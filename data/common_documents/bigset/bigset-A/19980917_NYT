NORTHRIDGE BRACES FOR N. ARIZONA PASSING ATTACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHRIDGE, Calif. _ The talk at Cal State Northridge for nearly
two weeks has been about whether the Matadors' patchwork offensive
line will be able to block No. 13 Northern Arizona's quick front
four. But CSUN defensive tackle Levi Line sees something else when
he looks at the Lumberjacks.
</P>
<P>
   `They think they can pass on us all day. They think they can
gain big yards on us all day,'' said Line, a transfer from Nevada.
``They have a fairly good offensive line. Big and touted.We looked
into it and, yeah, they think they can pass on us all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Line isn't just talking about Lumberjacks quarterback Travis
Brown (27 of 55, 356 yards) throwing deep but also the quick
hitters on three-step drops that he was so effective doing in last
week's 38-16 demolition of Southwest Texas State.
</P>
<P>
   And even though Brown's status remains uncertain because of a
bruised elbow, NAU's approach should be the same if Clay Brown (5
of 7, 115 yards) gets the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think they have a good passing attack anywhere on the
field,'' Line said. ``They'll mix it up and that's what we have to
be prepared for as a defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Bussin' it, baby: Typically, CSUN would fly to Saturday's game
at NAU, but coach Ron Ponciano elected to bus it so he can bring 58
players instead of 48. So after practice today, the Matadors will
bus to Laughlin, Nev., spend the night and then head to Flagstaff,
Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we used to travel 48, we used to take three or four guys
just because they were good scout kids and they deserved to go on a
trip,'' Ponciano said. ``We're struggling at 58 now. It's really a
tough part of this job, but it's a good sign for our program
development.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those not making the trip is freshman free safety Hassan
Abdul-Malik, who is nursing a shoulder injury he suffered in
practice, and senior cornerback Tayari Ferrell.
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano said Ferrell is sore after being involved in a one-car
accident Monday and needs more time to heal.
</P>
<P>
   Among those making the trip is converted wide receiver James
Maldonado, now a safety. He's impressed the coaching staff in
practice, Ponciano said.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping up with Jones: Sitting on the bench absorbing
Wednesday's practice was Terrence Jones, a transfer from Fresno
State. Jones, a speedy wide receiver, isn't eligible this season
because of grades, but he was a regular with Fresno State and
should get a good look from the coaching staff in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Jones caught 17 passes for the Bulldogs last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a little bit of film on him, but I haven't been able
to evaluate him yet,'' CSUN offensive coordinator and wide
receivers coach Rob Phenicie said. ``I know he has a lot of speed,
but I don't know how he'll adapt to our system. He'll get a
considerable look in the spring as long as he's eligible.''

expect in the stair hall of a grand old Brooklyn townhouse. The
florid sworls of carved plaster moldings, maybe; the ample curve of
a stolid wooden banister, of course. But a two-story wall of metal
mesh layered on linen? And that's but one of many experimental
metal applications appearing throughout the pristine

<P>
   DESIGN-DECORATION (Undated) _ Design is serious. Decoration is
superficial. In the 20th century, modern design and interior
decoration have never had much use for each other. Design was a
science _ a hard body of facts. It was technology, like engineering
and architecture. It had purpose. Interior decoration was fashion _
an art when it prayed hard. It knows how to stop a room when it
walks in. Since the 17th century, when it appeared professionally,
it was a rich man's game. But modern design and decorator taste
have been showing up together lately _ and they make a
great-looking team.
</P>
<P>
   FREY-ARCHITECTURE (Palm Springs, Calif.) _ Albert Frey hates
waste. He sees no need for water-hungry lawns or spacious homes. He
lives modestly in a 16-by-32-foot house made of low-maintenance
materials that he built for himself 34 years ago. His principle in
life and architecture, he explains, is to ``do the most with the
least.'' So why are the young and the affluent drawn to a
94-year-old man living in a space they'd normally consider too
small to swing a cat in? Because Albert Frey is the living
embodiment of a minimalist philosophy of life and design that is
enjoying a revival by a generation fattened on the go-go 1980s and
'90s. By Frances Anderton.
</P>
<P>
   LOTTERY-TICKETS (Undated) _ One night, while buying a quart of
milk at a convenience store deep in the Catskills, I found myself
standing in front of a glass display case holding perhaps 20 neat
stacks of instant lottery tickets. Maybe it was the mountain air,
or maybe it was the magnitude of the display, but suddenly I found
these butterfly-bright slips of cardboard exotic and intriguing. By
Karrie Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   REPLICA-FURNISHINGS (Wilmington, N.C.) _ Electric cables,
television monitors, lighting and sound paraphernalia crowded the
front hallway of the two-story saltbox house. Gingerly stepping
over the wires, I crossed the foyer _ and the family home of my
imagination came alive. I spotted the dining room through an
archway: a faux-Tiffany lamp hung above an antique table of dark
luminous wood, surrounded by six red-velvet Louis XIII chairs. Made
to order in Paris by James Ivory and Ismail Merchant for their film
``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries,'' these were replicas of the
originals I grew up with. Real ones would have been too expensive
to buy and then ship all the way to the United States. By Kaylie
Jones.

   FOXGLOVE (Undated) _ Don't take any happy homemaker tips from
the film ``One True Thing,'' which opens tomorrow _ unless you want
to poison your guests. By Anne Raver.

A TIME TO LASSO TEXANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA's two-season, three-city Texas tour continues
Saturday in Houston, giving the Bruins another opportunity to show
their stuff for the top high school talent in the Lone Star State.
</P>
<P>
   Victories last year in Austin (over Texas) and Dallas (over
Texas A&AMP;M) provided UCLA critical exposure in its successful
pursuit of defensive tackle Sean Phillips and guard Steve Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sends a message to kids that they don't have to stay in
state just because it's Texas,'' said Phillips, a Parade
All-American from Dulles High in Sugar Land, a Houston suburb.
</P>
<P>
   ``For an out-of-state school, it gives them influence to get
kids to play for them. You can go judge for yourself if it's a good
team and if you want to play for them. It helps a lot, because
there are a lot of great players in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins lured Tommy Maddox, Kevin Williams and Skip Hicks out
of Texas in the past decade, and they've recruiting several players
this year, including two from Dulles: receiver Leroy Price and
linebacker Damian West, an elite national recruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an opportunity for the players we recruit not only to see
us against the home team but to see us in person,'' said Randy
Taylor, UCLA's director of football operations. ``You can see the
uniforms, the size of the players, the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the games in Texas helped us sign (Phillips and
Morgan). It's good to schedule games in areas you recruit.''
</P>
<P>
   Slippery when wet: The Bruins are expecting heat and rain at
Houston's 20,500-seat Robertson Stadium. But coach Bob Toledo will
not practice with wet footballs to prepare the quarterbacks and
receivers for adverse conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's overrated _ I've ruined more practices with wet
balls,'' Toledo said. ``It's like, `Let's practice in the snow to
get ready for it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Second-string tailback Keith Brown left practice
early with turf toe and is day-to-day. If he can't play, true
freshman DeShaun Foster moves up the depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   Starting outside linebacker Michael Wiley injured his back and
also is questionable. Redshirt freshman Santi Hall, impressive
against Texas with a sack and three tackles, is ready if Wiley
can't play.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: UCLA's 584 yards against Texas was its highest
output since November 1994, when the Bruins gained a school-record
679 yards against Arizona State....
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins scored touchdowns on all five trips inside the red
zone (20-yard line) against Texas....
</P>
<P>
   Guard Andy Meyers and tight end Ryan Neufeld were named captains
for the week, joining Cade McNown and Larry Atkins, the season-long
selections....
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's game will be broadcast on KOGO 600-AM because of a
conflict with the Dodgers on 1150-AM.

NETSCAPE AND QWEST PLAN TO ANNOUNCE WEB ALLIANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forming perhaps the deepest alliance yet between a big Internet
software vendor and a long-distance communications company,
Netscape Communications Corp. and Qwest Communications
International Inc. plan to announce a far-reaching strategic
alliance Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will link Netscape, a company whose browser software
for navigating the World Wide Web made it synonymous with the
Internet, to Qwest, a well-financed start-up that is building one
of the most advanced fiber optic communications networks. The
intent of the venture, to be known as Netscape Contact, is to
enable consumers to manage voice mail, e-mail and fax
communications through a single site on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Under intense competitive pressure from the Microsoft Corp.,
which distributes its Web browsing software free, Netscape recently
moved away from selling consumer software. It has instead focused
on building its Netcenter Web site into an aggregation of
information and communications services that generates revenue
through advertising and direct sales.
</P>
<P>
   The Qwest deal will allow Netscape to broaden its Web offerings
while also helping to insulate Netcenter from Internet traffic
jams.
</P>
<P>
   For Qwest, securing an alliance with Netscape could prove a
marketing coup. Along with IXC Communications Inc., Williams Cos.
and Level 3 Communications Inc., Qwest is among a new breed of
long-distance carriers that are building national networks based on
Internet technology rather than on traditional phone technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great distribution channel said Qwest chief
executive Joseph Nacchio. ``The Netcenter customers are more
educated, more computer-centric and higher spenders.''
</P>
<P>
   Nacchio said he expected the venture to generate between $150
million and $175 million in revenue over the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest will pay Netscape for the right to share the branding on
Netscape Contact. In return, Netscape will pay Qwest for access to
its network. In the end, Netscape expects to make about $25 million
net over three years on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape now mainly employs the Sprint Corp. and the MCI
Communications Corp. to provide Netcenter with high-speed,
high-capacity access to the Internet. Those relationships are not
endangered by Netscape's deal with Qwest, Homer said. Netscape will
use Qwest's network for additional capacity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer, Netscape added a search engine and e-mail to
its Web site in an effort to compete against so-called Internet
portal companies like Yahoo and Excite. Working with Qwest,
Netscape intends to begin selling long-distance phone service for 9
cents a minute any time of the day and to offer an integrated ``in
box'' for voice mail, faxes and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Qwest announced that it had agreed to buy a rival
Internet service provider, the Icon CMT Corp., in an all-stock
transaction valued at $185 million to attract corporate customers
to its new super-fast Internet access. As Qwest expands into the
Internet service market, it intends to sell Netscape software.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Netcenter's main competitors, including Yahoo, Infoseek,
Lycos and Excite, have already made deals with long-distance phone
companies. None of those agreements, however, appear as ambitious
as Netscape's pact with Qwest.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Bierstedt, an author and emeritus professor of
sociology at the University of Virginia, died Sept. 8 in Martha
Jefferson Hospital in Charlottesville, Va. He was 85 and lived in
Charlottesville.
</P>
<P>
   He began teaching at the University of Virginia in 1972 and
became a professor emeritus in 1983. Previously, he headed the
department of sociology at City College in New York and at New York
University.
</P>
<P>
   Bierstedt, who combined abiding interests in sociology and
constitutional law, was a longtime director of the American Civil
Liberties Union, serving as chairman of its academic freedom
committee and the church-state committee in the 1960s and 1970s.
</P>
<P>

RIB INJURY COULD SIDELINE JETS' FOLEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Glenn Foley, whose durability was an issue
when coach Bill Parcells anointed him the New York Jets' starting
quarterback, is suffering a painful rib injury and has only a 50-50
chance to play Sunday against the Colts.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that Foley hid the seriousness of the injury (torn
rib cartilage) from Parcells, who was concerned with Foley's
passing during last Sunday's 24-10 loss to the Ravens at Giants
Stadium. Now, the Colts game has taken on an urgency for the 0-2
Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not certain he can play,'' Parcells said Wednesday. ``My
best guess is that Vinny Testaverde will get most of the snaps
today.'' Foley, however, wound up taking the majority of snaps, a
Jets spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said he had asked Foley ``four, five times during the
course of the game and he indicated he was OK''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the injury had restricted his passing during the
game, Foley replied, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Then asked if he would have admitted to Parcells if it had.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   Foley also said, ``I wouldn't want to do anything to affect the
team.'' The implication is that he would take himself out of the
Colts game if he feels he is ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to go out there 40 or 30 percent if Vinny is
100,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde is a 6-foot-5-inch, 238-pound weight-room obsessed
34-year-old who has had 132 career starts.
</P>
<P>
   Foley was wearing a flak jacket to prevent just the sort of
injury he suffered against the Ravens. He was sandwiched between
the Colts' 280-pound defensive ends, Michael McCrary and Rob
Burnett, in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, said Foley, rammed him helmet-first in the ribs.
``You could see he was getting up slowly,'' said right guard Matt
O'Dwyer. ``He was hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He took some hit,'' said tight end Kyle Brady. ``When two guys
that size hit you, it's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the injury, Foley continued in the drive and helped
position the Jets to a field goal that cut the Ravens' lead to
17-10. But from the time he was hit until the end of the game _ he
played every down _ he suffered two interceptions and was sacked
three times, while completing seven of his last 10 passes. The
passes gained only 49 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said that he did not know the seriousness of Foley's
injury until Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Foley had spent most of his free time on Monday in the trainer's
room, having his bumps and bruises taken care of. Testaverde
suggested then that Foley would find it different being a starter,
taking most of the snaps, and having to haul a battered body to the
line every play.
</P>
<P>
   Foley is attempting to start his third straight National
Football League game, something he has been able to achieve only
once.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to play, as far as I know,'' he said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Foley saw his first extensive action in 1995 in Week 10 against
the Patriots but suffered a serious shoulder injury that ended his
season. Last year, he replaced Neil O'Donnell, started twice, but
then injured a knee and missed the last five games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has admitted he was uncertain about Foley's staying
power and commanded him to put on 15 pounds and take a rigorous
weight-room program in the off season. Foley now weighs about 220
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   As for Testaverde's preparation, he contended it would be no
different this week, that he learned long ago he must think of
himself as starting _ even if he doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The few times I wasn't a starter,'' he said, ``I didn't let
the details get away.''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde has been listed as the third quarterback, while Ray
Lucas was listed as the backup. That technicality allowed Lucas to
play on kick-coverage and kick returns.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde has an almost-storied history against the Colts. In
1988, he produced a 469-yard passing performance against them for
Tampa Bay. It was the second-highest total ever achieved against
the Colts, exceeded only by Joe Namath's famous 496-yard shootout
against Johnny Unitas in 1972. Testaverde also set a rookie passing
record against the Jim Mora-coached Saints in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   For much of training camp, Testaverde outshone Foley, who became
more confident and stronger as the summer progressed. Foley has
played every down the first two games, but his won-lost record as a
starter has fallen to 1-6. He remains without a complete-game
victory.

HOLYFIELD A BIG DRAW IN HOMETOWN BOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (smw) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Evander Holyfield vaguely remembers when Muhammad Ali
fought Jerry Quarry here at the Municipal Auditorium in 1970. It
was Ali's first bout after he had been banned from boxing for
refusing to join the military. Holyfield was 8 and had not yet
become immersed in boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a kid I didn't like boxing,'' Holyfield said Wednesday. ``I
only liked the things that I did. If I wasn't boxing, I wasn't
watching it.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield, speaking at a news conference for his title fight
against Vaughn Bean at the Georgia Dome on Saturday night, did not
have exciting memories of Ali-Quarry. ``It was just a lot of
talking,'' he said. ``It was kind of boring. I used to like to see
the little guys fight, because they were always scrapping. The
heavyweights would hold, and blow their nose and pull up their
trunks and fight for about 30 or 45 minutes and then leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield (38-3) is promising to do more than that when he
defends his International Boxing Federation and World Boxing
Association heavyweight titles against Bean, whose record of 31-1
is inflated by opponents of questionable skill.
</P>
<P>
   The promoter Don King said that as of Wednesday afternoon,
24,000 tickets had been sold, and he was projecting that 40,000
would be sold, which would make Holyfield-Bean one of the
best-selling bouts ever. Muhammad Ali- Leon Spinks II in 1978 and
Sugar Ray Leonard-Roberto Duran in 1980 (the ``No mas'' fight) both
drew 70,000 at the Super Dome in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's fight will also be broadcast on the Showtime cable
network during a preview weekend, meaning that 60 million homes
will get the fight free.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield, who is distributing blocks of tickets through the
Boys and Girls Clubs of Atlanta, took a substantial pay cut to have
the fight staged here in his hometown. He will earn $3.5 million
for the fight, with a chance to make up to $5 million depending on
ticket sales. Typically, Holyfield earns $8 million for a
pedestrian fight like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an opportunity to do something for the people, and I
can't let money be the reason why I don't do it,'' Holyfield said.
``But now, I've got more people coming out than anyone expected.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time Holyfield fought in Atlanta he stopped Bert Cooper
in the seventh round on Nov. 23, 1991, before 12,996 at the Omni.
But Holyfield was a newly crowned champion, with just one defense
under his belt and no established credentials in the heavyweight
division. The fight was poorly organized and promoted, Holyfield
said, because the opponent kept changing. He was supposed to meet
Mike Tyson for the first time, but Tyson had a rib injury and was
under indictment on a rape charge. Another opponent, the Italian
heavyweight Francesco Damiani, pulled out with an ankle injury.
Cooper took the fight on one week's notice.
</P>
<P>
   So for Holyfield, this weekend's fight was the perfect
opportunity to validate himself in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evander is the greatest fighter in the world, and he deserves
a different type of image,'' King said. ``This is an image
builder.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Holyfield steps into the ring against Bean, Tyson will go
before the Nevada State Athletic Commission to try to have his
license re-instated. Tyson's license was revoked after he bit
Holyfield on both ears during their title bout on June 29, 1997.
Holyfield said Tyson should get his license back, despite the fact
that he has been charged with assaulting two men in suburban
Maryland after a minor traffic accident.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield has made peace with the fact that he and Tyson will be
inextricably linked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure with everything he does, my name comes up too,''
Holyfield said. ``It's not like Tyson is not a good fighter. Iron
sharpens iron. This guy was good. If you mention Ali, you have to
mention Joe Frazier. No one stands alone, because they were that
great and didn't fight anybody. That's life. People are always
going to link you with what you've been through.'' &QL;

SHOWDOWN TIME TOOK EARLY TWIST FOR ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Local indifference was on display at the
ballyard last night. And for once in their dysfunctional season,
the indifference couldn't be blamed on the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   First place at stake. Divisional title on the September cooker.
And The Ballpark in Arlington was 9,000 seats short of a sellout.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it maybe on the team's promotional staff. Why didn't
somebody think of a fan giveaway involving X-ray prints of Troy
Aikman's collarbone?
</P>
<P>
   Be it the Angels coming in for the American League West
showdown, or the current management push involving postseason
ticket sales, there's no stampede at the Arlington windows.
</P>
<P>
   Why should there be? The Rangers have been a model of
inconsistency _ or worse _ since June. They can't be trusted to
outlast the Angels in these final days of September. Anaheim, after
all, has had plenty of gumption on its injury-riddled side, while
the Rangers seem to have an on-and-off problem with caring enough
to care.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, by most other divisional standards in baseball,
showdown time in the AL West is a battle of gnat-weights. But with
the Rangers' postseason history _ one time in 27 years _ they don't
have to be Ali or the Yankees. Just winning anything by any means
is rare enough.
</P>
<P>
   But first, the Angels have to be removed from first place. With
five games between the two teams in eight days, the outcome in the
AL West will basically be decided head-up.
</P>
<P>
   Last night's outcome, however, may have been decided in late
July. Or who knows, maybe it was decided 24 hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The trading deadline deal the Rangers made for Todd Stottlemyre
finally showed a sizable profit. Stottlemyre took on the Angels in
the pivotal first game of the fivesome, and he dominated for eight
innings in an eventual 5-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers now share first place with the Angels. Of interest,
however, is that on Tuesday night at Tampa Bay, Anaheim may have
sprung a crack in its Team Together image.
</P>
<P>
   A silly dispute occurred an hour before game time at Tampa Bay,
but silly disputes for a contending team this time of year drive
managers up clubhouse walls. Terry Collins, the leading candidate
for AL manager of the year, was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   A pregame memo was received from the home office in Anaheim
regarding playoff tickets. Copies were passed out to the players,
who became hot and hostile became they thought management was
telling them they had to pay for their tickets. Yes, guys making
millions have a personal budget, too. Not to mention most players
are cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Disney drone who typed up the memo had failed to
mention that these tickets were in addition to the two freebies
each player receives. Let it also be noted the Angels aren't
pleased anyway with their Disney bosses, who they think did some
dime-squeezing instead of providing enough trade help.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the dispute was finally cleared up, then the Angels took
the field and lost, 8-1. This came on the heels of the Rangers
staging a Tuesday night ninth-inning rally in Baltimore to pull
within a game of the divisional lead.
</P>
<P>
   Media covering the Angels reported Collins was on a season-high
mad after the Tuesday night game. Yes, he blamed his team for
``distractions.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins had cooled it before the game last night, saying his
reaction was ``frustration more than anything else. I know the
players weren't looking past Tampa Bay. But all the questions (from
the media) for the last week were about Texas and we had other
games to play.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was mentioned Johnny Oates had placed an embargo on the
Rangers speaking about the upcoming Anaheim games, Collins replied,
``I should have done the same thing.'' He said the memo was
``terrible timing. We are fighting for our lives here. All of a
sudden there are all these other things to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming off a disruptive Tuesday night, the Angels immediately
had ace Chuck Finley ripped for a 4-spot in the second inning last
night. Plus, they couldn't solve Stottlemyre.
</P>
<P>
   Some locker-room bulletin-board motivation also didn't work for
the Angels. A newspaper story on this series was tacked up in the
visitors' clubhouse, and ``Rangers'' in the headline was scratched
out. Written in was ``Dirtballs.'' A tad cheesy, don't you think?
</P>
<P>
   But with three games next week in Anaheim, all the Angels need
now is a split of the two here, as a calm Collins pointed out in
his postgame remarks last night. With that, they could leave town
with their one-game lead intact.
</P>
<P>
   Before tonight's finale, maybe Rangers GM Doug Melvin should
have bogus memos passed out in the Angels' locker room. Something
about this-just-in-from Disney:
</P>
<P>
   No free playoff tickets, plus meal money for all players has
hereby been discontinued.
</P>
<P>
   Under some dire circumstances, the Angels have had a good
season. But if a weakness has been found, exploit it.

DEVIL RAYS SHUT OUT YANKEES, 7-0 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Manager Joe Torre usually contains his
angry thoughts and waits a day before unleashing them in a more
digestible form. But he did not bother waiting on Wednesday night,
after fuming through the New York Yankees' 7-0 loss to the Tampa
Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   Torre planted himself in a corner of the clubhouse and chastised
the Yankees for their play and their effort, warning that they
better improve quickly, with under two weeks left before the
American League playoffs begin.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have lost 16 of their last 28 games. You cannot just
turn it on and off, Torre barked, according to one player. ``Kick
it in gear,'' he added, sternly.
</P>
<P>
   But Torre's speech was hardly educational; before he stalked
into the clubhouse, they shared the same thoughts, felt the same
way.
</P>
<P>
   During a pitching change in the eighth inning, with the Yankees
in full retreat, Derek Jeter turned to teammates Scott Brosius and
Homer Bush at the mound and said, in so many words, ``We better
start playing better.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Jeter said: ``It's like we're out there just going
through the motions. We haven't been playing well for a long time.
We just mixed in a couple of good games.''
</P>
<P>
   A Yankees meltdown seemed impossible a month ago, as remote as
snowflakes in August. The Yankees were 92-30 and on pace to shatter
Major League Baseball's single-season record for victories, the 116
games won by the Chicago Cubs in 1906.
</P>
<P>
   The best the Yankees (104-46) can do now is tie the Cubs' mark,
only if they win their final 12 games. But Torre does not care
about that. He is more concerned _ and judging by the timing of his
explosion, growing more concerned by the day _ that the Yankees
start playing better, and soon.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, they were not even prepared to play Tampa
Bay, an expansion team with the league's second-worst record.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining his usual erect posture on the bench, Torre watched
the struggling Andy Pettitte make a series of terrible pitches and
mistakes and allow six runs in six innings. He watched the Yankees'
hitters overswing constantly with runners on base.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, the Yankees stranded 11 base runners; Chili Davis
failed to produce an rbi in his first three at-bats despite coming
to the plate with six runners on base.
</P>
<P>
   And the left fielder Chad Curtis made a brutal throw homeward
when he had no shot at the runner there, allowing a trailing Devil
Ray base runner to move from first to second. Fundamental mistakes
on fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stunk tonight, top to bottom,'' Torre said. ``Nobody can
just turn it on. Nobody can, when you beat yourself, pitching or
outfield play or at-bats. We didn't have good at-bats tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've accomplished so many good things. Maybe my club has
spoiled me, and you set your standards a little high.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees maintained during the first two weeks of this slump
that it was no big deal, that they were just tired. But they
changed their testimony on Wednesday night; there were no more
pleadings about an innocent, harmless little slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to turn it up a notch,'' Pettitte said. ``We're
flat. We need to get motivated. Obviously, we aren't playing like
we did in the first five months.''
</P>
<P>
   There is great irony in those words from Pettitte, whose
motivation and effort seem to overwhelm his ability. A radar gun
perched high above the stands here showed that Pettitte's fastball
was consistently clocked in the range of 90 to 93 miles an hour _
strong evidence to Torre that Pettitte is perfectly healthy.
</P>
<P>
   But the left-hander has had a knack of making mistakes, trying
to make pitches too fine and then getting hammered as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte sometimes pitched into trouble and almost never got
himself out. Bush's error gave Tampa Bay a runner at second and two
out, before Pettitte made a poor pitch to Fred McGriff _ whack, a
run-scoring double. Then he choked a changeup so badly that it
bounced some 5 or 6 feet in front of home plate and off catcher Joe
Girardi.
</P>
<P>
   Girardi could not see that the ball had bounced all the way to
the Yankee dugout and, incredibly, the slow-footed and conservative
McGriff scored all the way from second.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte walked Mike Kelly leading off the fifth. Kelly is such
a free swinger, 18 walks and 77 strikeouts in 95 games, that he
virtually requires a visa to take first base this way. Catcher Mike
DiFelice singled, Kelly taking third; then Kelly scored on a
squeeze play. Two outs and a runner at second, the damage still not
beyond repair.
</P>
<P>
   But Pettitte then allowed a run-scoring single to Quinton
McCracken, allowing DiFelice to chug home with Tampa Bay's fourth
run.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte's intensity _ and intense frustration _ showed its face
in the sixth inning, when the Devil Rays' hit him hard.
</P>
<P>
   The hits came courtesy of guys like Bubba Trammell and Aaron
Ledesma and Kelly, not Tim Salmon or Darin Erstad or Juan Gonzalez,
hitters Pettitte may have to face in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte has lost to Minnesota, Chicago and Tampa Bay during his
last eight starts, in which he has accumulated a 6.66 earned run
average. He was pleased with the way he felt, with his stuff. But
Pettitte did not pretend a solution is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know what to say anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Joe Torre did.  &QL;

   ST. LOUIS _ If height were distance, Mark McGwire, the
Cardinals' power hitter, would have had two more home runs on
Wednesday night in Busch Stadium to add to his record-setting total
of 63 for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, his sky-high flyout to center field in the sixth inning
and his space shot that seemed to have aged by about three weeks
the Pittsburgh left-fielder, Turner Ward, as he waited for the ball
to descend in the seventh inning, were simply outs.
</P>
<P>
   True, they excited the 40,928 fans, who rose almost in unison as
McGwire struck the ball and uttered ``Ooohhh!'' in anticipation.
But that was all the theater they could muster out of McGwire on
Wednesday night. He went 0 for 4, with one base on balls, in the
Cardinals' 4-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
   On the scoreboard in deep center field, the season homer totals
of McGwire and Sammy Sosa of the Cubs remained unchanged at game's
end for the Cardinals. McGwire remained at 63 and Sosa, playing in
San Diego, was still at 62.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire walked in the first inning off the left-hander Chris
Peters, who was roundly booed for depriving the fans of possibly
another McGwire clout. The slugger struck out in the third on a
called third strike, and stood at the plate staring down in the
batter's box, clearly unhappy with the plate umpire Randy Marsh.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire had hit his 63d homer the night before, in a pinch-hit
role in the ninth inning of the first game of a doubleheader. He
failed to connect for a homer in the second game.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday, he had gone six games without a homer. The
longest he had gone previously was 10 games. There had been some
question about the status of his back, since he left last Sunday's
game in the fifth inning with spasms. But he said the back is ``not
an issue'' and he seemed to be swinging hard on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   He understands the disappointment of the fans when he doesn't
please them with a home run. ``But people don't like to give credit
to the pitchers,'' he said.

EDITORIAL: CAMPAIGN REFORMER UNDER ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Sept. 17:
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to capitalize on the distraction in Washington,
congressional Republicans are planning a new sneak attack on clean
elections. The target, as before, is Lawrence Noble, general
counsel of the Federal Election Commission and scourge of
fund-raising violations.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have tried repeatedly to oust Noble by attaching
dismissal riders to various bills, only to back down. They are at
it again this week, spreading word that a provision forcing out
Noble will be attached to an unrelated spending bill that has
already passed both the House and Senate. Proponents of campaign
reform must speak out and block this move.
</P>
<P>
   Attacking Noble represents an arrogant assault on an important
agency's independence. Since its establishment to enforce the
election reforms of 1974, the Election Commission has had more than
its share of troubles with Congress. Lawmakers who love to complain
about each other's fund-raising abuses have limited funding for the
commission and insisted on the appointment of weak commissioners
beholden to the political parties.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission's staff has persisted in going after election
law violations by both parties. Attorney General Janet Reno cited a
commission audit as the reason for opening an investigation into
the use of unregulated ``soft money'' for television ads in
President Clinton's last campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are angry because Noble has investigated Republican
fund-raising groups and defended the commission against a
Republican lawsuit to lift all restrictions on the use of soft
money for national campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Only last week Senate Republicans retreated from a proposal
cutting short Noble's term. This week they plan to attach the
measure to a Treasury spending bill that is before a conference
committee. The Republican rider would also let one party or the
other on the commission veto any personnel appointment, a dangerous
step for a bipartisan group.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in the conference committee, if they care about
their independence, should refuse to go along. If the Noble ouster
succeeds, it would present the spectacle of the Republican Party
suing the commission and dismissing the man in charge of defending
against the suit. If the ouster of Noble is adopted, Democratic
senators should be prepared to filibuster, forcing the Republicans
to find 60 votes to close off debate.
</P>
<P>
   Filibustering a Treasury spending bill would be a serious
business. But Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott was willing to
filibuster the McCain-Feingold soft-money ban this month, forcing
supporters to get the 60 votes to end the debate.
</P>
<P>
   After all, a majority in the House and Senate favor a soft-money
ban along with other campaign fund-raising restrictions. They
should do all they can to prevent Republican leaders from using the
back door to squelch reform.

KING WANTS TYSON TO GET HIS BOXING LICENSE BACK

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Boxing promoter Don King said he believes former
heavyweight champion Mike Tyson should have his license reinstated
by the Nevada State Athletic Commission, but he refused to say why.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have the slightest idea whether he will get it back,''
King said. ``Yes, I'd like to see him get his license back. Should
he get his license back? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson will go before the Nevada State Athletic Commission on
Saturday for a hearing on having his license reinstated. Tyson's
license was revoked after he bit Evander Holyfield on both ears
during their heavyweight championship bout on June 29, 1997. Tyson
has sued King for $100 million in an effort to get out of his
promotional contract with King. King would not comment on the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   King, speaking following a news conference to promote the
Evander Holyfield-Vaughn Bean heavyweight title bout on Saturday at
the Georgia Dome here, was civil in his comments about Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish Tyson well,'' King said. ``I love the man. We never had
an argument. We never had any animosity. I'm not suffering any type
of pain. Let him live his life and let me live my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson broke from King and his co-managers, Rory Holloway and
John Horne, in February and aligned himself with new advisers,
Shelly Finkel in New York and Jeff Wald in Los Angeles. &QL;

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Sept. 17:
</P>
<P>
   To American eyes, the clerical dictatorships of Iran and
Afghanistan can seem variations on the same Islamic fundamentalist
theme. But relations between the two neighboring countries are now
at a flash point. Ethnic, political and religious tensions have
been exacerbated by the recent killings of at least eight Iranian
diplomats by Afghan Taliban fighters. Iran is now assembling some
250,000 troops along the Afghan border and threatens military
action unless its demands for amends are met.
</P>
<P>
   There is irony here, since 18 years ago it was Iran that held 52
American diplomats hostage for 444 days. This time, Iran has a
legitimate grievance. Carrying out its military threats, however,
would undermine the efforts of President Mohammad Khatami to
reassure the world that Iran no longer seeks to threaten its
neighbors or export revolutionary violence. Instead, Tehran should
stick to diplomacy in pressing its demands for an apology and for
prosecution of the killers by an Iranian or international court.
</P>
<P>
   A United Nations working group on Afghanistan meets in New York
next Monday, and Iran's foreign minister and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright may attend. Such talks could help defuse the
crisis over Iran's diplomats and ease tensions between Washington
and Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, an organization that follows Sunni Muslim precepts
and is allied with Pakistan, now rules most of Afghanistan. But the
country's ethnic and religious diversity has produced opposition to
the Taliban's totalitarian rule. Afghanistan's minority groups
include Shiite Muslims, Farsi-speakers and ethnic groups akin to
those in Iran. Many of these overlapping minorities fear
persecution by the Taliban and have supported the resistance
militias that Taliban forces are now rolling back.
</P>
<P>
   Iran also supports these militias, while Pakistan backs the
Taliban. That explains why Iranian diplomats were stationed in a
militia-held provincial town that fell to Taliban forces last
month. It also explains why Iran now includes an end to Pakistani
military support for the Taliban in its list of demands.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, both Iran and Pakistan should stop their meddling in
Afghanistan's conflict. The Taliban, for its part, should apologize
for the killings of the diplomats and promise a credible criminal
investigation of the incident.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Sept. 17:
</P>
<P>
   The House is poised to consider a misguided bill against
assisted suicide that would intrude on the right of doctors to
provide appropriate care at the end of a patient's life and the
right of states to regulate the practice of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, sponsored by Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., would allow the
federal Drug Enforcement Administration to investigate and punish
any physician who prescribes lethal doses of drugs with the intent
of assisting in a patient's suicide. Even the American Medical
Association, which opposes physician-assisted suicide, is strongly
opposed to this bill.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is an inappropriate attempt to undo the Oregon
Death With Dignity Act, which citizens in that state approved by a
60 percent vote last November. The Oregon law allows a terminally
ill patient who is of sound mind to obtain a prescription for
lethal drugs if two doctors judge that the patient has less than
six months to live.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, DEA Administrator Thomas Constantine announced
that the agency had authority to revoke a doctor's drug license for
prescribing lethal doses even if the doctor fully complied with
Oregon's law. Attorney General Janet Reno sensibly reversed that
policy in June, ruling that federal drug laws did not give the DEA
power to ban all physician-assisted suicide in this country.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has said that states should be free to engage
in the profound debate over the right to die. Oregonians have
decided that their legislation reflects their needs and values,
while other states have chosen different approaches. But
congressional opponents of the Oregon law want to deny all states
the right to make any judgments on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of heavy-handed legislation is likely to harm patients
and could even cause more suicides. Doctors facing the possibility
of a federal investigation would be less likely to provide
aggressive but potentially lethal drug therapy for pain relief. It
is the lack of adequate pain management that drives some patients
to seek suicide in the first place. The bill, by giving federal
bureaucrats new power to second-guess difficult medical decisions,
would increase needless suffering among terminal patients.

EDITORIAL: A PRINCIPAL PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Sept. 17:
</P>
<P>
   Students and teachers are back at their desks. New classrooms
are open while older ones are mostly patched and painted. Now it is
time to confront another crisis threatening New York City schools _
the one in the principal's office.
</P>
<P>
   Last year a record 113 principals gave up their jobs in the
city's public schools. Many of the most talented defected to the
suburbs, where their new posts provide more money and status for
far easier work.
</P>
<P>
   What is worse is that the pool of qualified replacements is
growing smaller by the day, as top-rated applicants become
increasingly rare for a job that some describe as hell with tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the increasing number of schools being run by ``acting
principals'' is a three-year battle between city officials and the
principals' union over a new contract. The Council of Supervisors
and Administrators, a stultifying union that covers school
principals, wants to keep tenure and raise salaries for principals
of the city's 1,100 schools. The city is willing to grant much
higher pay, but only in return for the principals' giving up tenure
and performing more work through longer days and year-round
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, the principals should not even have a union. They are
managers, like the superintendent of a school district or the
president of a college, and should be treated as managers, subject
to removal for poor performance. The principals themselves should
begin trying to extricate themselves from this union if they want
the pay, authority and responsibility they deserve.
</P>
<P>
   But since getting out of the union could take years, the city
and the union _ whose talks stalled again Tuesday night _ should
find some agreement that boosts salaries handsomely in exchange for
ending the grip of tenure. The deal should include some agreement
not to oppose legislative efforts to remove tenure protections from
state law.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, most city principals earn $20,000 to $25,000 less
than their colleagues in the suburbs. The school system should find
some way to remedy that gap, in exchange for increased freedom to
remove principals who are mediocre at this vital job.
</P>
<P>
   As for the swarm of politicians publicly agonizing about our
children and our schools in this election season, they could do a
service by taking on the tough issue of assuring high-quality
principals. Almost every educational study makes the same point _ a
great school starts with a great principal.

ONCE AGAIN, METS COME FROM BEHIND TO WIN GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS

<P>
   HOUSTON _ It would be almost impossible to play four
regular-season games with more plot turns than these. Home run
followed home run as the Mets kept rallying, night after night.
</P>
<P>
   And on Wednesday night, it was Todd Hundley who delivered the
biggest home run of them all.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley, who has been Mike Piazza's backup at catcher this
season after undergoing reconstructive elbow surgery last fall,
followed Piazza's game-saving three-run ninth-inning blast with a
solo homer in the 11th as the New York Mets rallied for a 4-3
victory over the Houston Astros to keep the pressure on the Chicago
Cubs in the National League wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley's third homer of the year, and first pinch-hit blast in
three and a half years, came with two out, on a 2-1 pitch from the
Houston right-hander Sean Bergmann and landed just beyond the
center-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   It came after the Astros had rallied back from Piazza's
hard-to-believe 3-run blast in the top of the ninth, which was
off-set by Brad Ausmus' home run in the bottom of the ninth to
force extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   After both teams threatened in the 10th, Hundley came through
with defining moment of what has been the most frustrating year of
the former All-Star catcher's career. And then Turk Wendell, who
has been the Mets' most valuable right-handed reliever for the
second half of the year, pitched a perfect eleventh for his fourth
save and second in as many games, as the Mets (86-68) had somehow
pulled a season-high 18 games over .500 for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Through eight and a half innings, the situation was so familiar
it was downright scary: the Mets down two runs in the south of
Texas heading into the top of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   And on Wednesday night, with two outs and two strikes on him in
the top of the ninth, it was now Mike Piazza's turn to do what his
teammates had done before him.
</P>
<P>
   Twice before in the last three games here at the Astrodome, the
Mets had rallied to force extra-innings on improbable home runs.
And then Piazza hit his 200th career homer to give the Mets an
actual ninth-inning lead.
</P>
<P>
   But homers have been kind to the Astros, too, over these last
three topsy-turvy days. And when Brad Ausmus drilled a full-count
homer off Dennis Cook with one out in the bottom of the ninth, the
Mets and Astros were headed for extra innings for the third time in
four raucous games.
</P>
<P>
   What a series.
</P>
<P>
   Brian McRae's ninth-inning homer on Monday night had set the
stage for a 7-4 victory in 13 innings; Carlos Baerga's on Tuesday
night had only prolonged what would become a 6-5 loss in 12 innings
in the first game of a doubleheader, one in which Jeff Bagwell
would homer in the 11th for Houston to force a 12th, in which Derek
Bell would homer to give Houston the game.
</P>
<P>
   And that was all before the Mets would salvage a split for the
evening on John Olerud's go-ahead, 3-run, eighth-inning home run,
as the Mets took the nightcap, 8-4.
</P>
<P>
   These last three days had to be scripted, the way Piazza stepped
to the plate with two on and two out in the top of the ninth
against Houston closer Billy Wagner - what with the Mets, who had
already left 11 runners on base, trailing by 2-0 and trying to stay
with the Chicago Cubs in the wild card chase.
</P>
<P>
   And then Piazza responded on Wednesday evening by doing just
what the Mets hoped he would do in the stretch run when they
acquired the All-Star catcher way back on May 22.
</P>
<P>
   The man who has been carrying the Mets on his back offensively
for more than a month now, drilled a 2-2 pitch from Wagner just
over the fence in right center field for his 32d homer of the
season and a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But, after the Mets had come up with their fourth unbelievable
comeback under the dome this series, the Astros were not through
yet. Ausmus is not known as a home-run threat. But Cook was
pitching for the sixth time in the last eight days. And, after
Ausmus somehow cleared the fence in left center field for his sixth
home runs, it was time for another extra-inning game.
</P>
<P>
   And more dramatics, of course.
</P>
<P>
   In the tenth, Jermaine Allensworth singled to left to open the
tenth against Wagner and took second when the ball skipped through
Moises Alou's legs in left. But, after Luis Lopez sacrificed
Allensworth to third, Rey Ordonez grounded to second with the
infield in and pinch-hitter Matt Franco struck out. And the Mets
had stranded their 12th runner of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Which became all the more alarming when the Astros loaded the
bases against Greg McMichael with two out in the bottom of the
tenth. McMichael had retired the first two Houston batters he had
faced. But the former Met Carl Everett _ whose third-inning homer
had given the Astros their first two runs _ walked, Everett stole
second and took third on Piazza's throwing error.
</P>
<P>
   McMichael responded by intentionally walking Bagwell and then
walking Alou to load them up. And then McMichael fell behind Ricky
Gutierrez 3 balls 0 strikes. Before he threw another pitch,
McMichael nearly picked Everett off third, which would have been
something, too. But then the beleaguered right-hander calmly fired
two called strikes past Gutierrez,, who fouled two full-count
pitches off, before McMichael struck him out on an off-speed pitch
that got away from Piazza, who stepped on home to end the tenth.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it was Hundley's turn. And his first pinch-hit home run
since May 4, 1995 (it was just the fourth of Hundley's career) put
the exclamation on a series that will be hard to forget.
</P>
<P>
   By the time it was over, Mike Hampton and Bobby Jones had been
rendered mere footnotes, even though both had pitched a splendid 8
innings apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton scattered 8 hits and 6 walks in his scoreless outing,
before being lifted just as Lenny Harris had been announced to
pinch-hit to open the ninth. On came Wagner, who had surrendered
McRae's home run on Monday night. And Todd Pratt, pinch-hitting for
Harris, responded with an 0-1 single to left.
</P>
<P>
   But Wagner struck out Tony Phillips and then retired Edgardo
Alfonzo on a long fly to right. And the Mets were down to their
final out. But Olerud drilled a single off third baseman Sean
Berry's glove _ the hit was the Met first baseman's fourth of the
evening and it was hit so hard it caused Berry to leave the game.
And then Piazza came through with one of his biggest hits of the
year, as the Mets finally were able to touch home plate.

MEETING MAY DECIDE ISLES' HOME ICE

<P>
   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. _ For the first time since the New York
Islanders moved out of Nassau Coliseum last week and filed a $10
million lawsuit against the company that operates the arena,
representatives of both sides will meet on Thursday in the hopes of
reaching an agreement to have the team play its home games at the
Coliseum this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders moved out of the 26-year-old Coliseum last
Thursday, citing ``uninhabitable'' conditions. The team alleged in
the lawsuit against SMG, which runs the Uniondale arena, that the
hoist that supports the scoreboard and speaker system is in danger
of falling from the ceiling. It also contended that SMG knew of the
unsafe condition of the hoist for several months without notifying
the Islanders or Nassau County.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to play someplace safe and where fans can have a good
time watching hockey,'' said Steven Gluckstern, co-owner of the
Islanders, who was here Wednesday for the fourth day of training
camp. ``As of today, in effect, we have no lease.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting will include David Seldin, the president and chief
executive officer of the Islanders; Wes Westley, the president of
SMG, and Thomas Gulotta, the Nassau County Executive. The National
Hockey League will not send a representative, but an official said
yesterday that the league plans to hire independent engineers to
inspect the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary objective is to get all of the safety concerns
taken care of so that the season can begin on time and the fans
will not be deprived,'' said David Vieser, a Nassau County
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders-Devils preseason game originally scheduled to be
played at Nassau Coliseum on Sept. 25 has been moved to Lake
Placid. The Islanders sent a letter to season ticket holders
Wednesday with a telephone number to call for information on free
transportation to the game.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern of the Islanders' is their lease at the
Coliseum. Under the current lease, SMG does not share with the team
any revenue generated by parking, advertisements or concessions.
Gluckstern called the contract with SMG ``one of the worst leases
in the NHL.''
</P>
<P>
   Westley of SMG had a Manhattan-based structural engineering firm
inspect the Coliseum on Wednesday, checking everything but the
hoist in question, which has been taken down and is scheduled to be
replaced. According to Westley, the building was found to be safe
for public events.
</P>
<P>
   Should nothing come of Thursday's meeting, the Islanders will
move ahead with a plan to play their first 12 home games of the
regular season at several arenas, including Hartford Civic Arena,
New Haven Veteran Memorial Coliseum, Core States Center or the
adjacent Spectrum in Philadelphia, Continental Airlines Arena in
East Rutherford, N.J., or Madison Square Garden.

   DINING NOTES
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ PLACIDO DOMINGO, the tireless tenor, conductor and
cover boy for the redesigned Opera News magazine, was the guest of
honor at an Opera News party Tuesday at his own restaurant,
Domingo's, on East 49th Street. Domingo and the magazine's new
editor and publisher, RUDOLPH RAUCH, did some catching up on things
they had discussed during their interview, including Domingo's
long-out-of-print recording of Verdi's ``I Vespri Siciliani.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I went and borrowed a copy of that recording and it's
really terrific, and it should be reissued and why hasn't it been
reissued,'' Rauch said. ``He said, `I don't know; there's the man
who can tell us,' and waved his finger at an RCA executive, who
came over and said, `Not that many people are asking for it.' I'm
thinking we can stir up some trouble on our Web site and start a
groundswell to get that recording back in the catalog.''
</P>
<P>
   3 MUSIC SCHOOL DROPOUTS
</P>
<P>
   BILLY JOEL and PAUL SHAFFER, David Letterman's music director
for the last 16 years, went to JIMMY WEBB's performance Tuesday at
Rainbow and Stars, the nightclub in the GE Building at 30
Rockefeller Plaza. Then Joel, Shaffer and Webb went to dinner. Make
that Dr. Joel, Dr. Shaffer and Dr. Webb.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're also all kind of musical dropouts,'' Webb said, ``but
we've all got these honorary doctorates. We tease each other and
call each other `Doctor.''' Webb said that his and Shaffer's
degrees were from Five Towns College on Long Island. ``I think
Billy has a whole briefcase full of them,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   PARTY ON, SI &QL;
</P>
<P>
   S.I. NEWHOUSE JR., the chairman of Advance Publications and
overseer of all things Conde Nast, has never been a big fan of
employee parties. So it came as a surprise to regulars on the
Manhattan party circuit when this week brought invitations to not
one, not two, but three Newhouse parties.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Newhouse gave a cocktail party for 100 people at the
Four Seasons restaurant in honor of RUTH WHITNEY, who is retiring
as editor of Glamour magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Newhouse, looking almost Armani-esque in a dark suit
and black T-shirt, gave a party for 200 people at Gotham. This one
honored DAVID REMNICK, the new editor of The New Yorker. And last
night, Newhouse invited another 250 to toast ART COOPER, the editor
of GQ _ again at the Four Seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been working with Si for 15 years,'' Cooper said, ``and
I never suspected that he was this iron-man party animal.''
</P>
<P>
   WRITER'S CRAMP &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GARRISON KEILLOR, the bard of Lake Wobegon, often ends his
public-radio program, ``A Prairie Home Companion,'' by crediting
what he says is the show's writing staff: Sarah Bellum, Pete Moss,
Sandy Beach and Warren Peace, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Many longtime listeners assumed that these were made-up names
and that Keillor had written every word by himself. But now he is
looking for a real, live writer to help out.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Public Radio, which produces the show, placed a
classified advertisement in The New York Times on Sunday and said
it was taking similar ads in Variety and The Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a two-hour show every week for 34 weeks a year, that is
an awful lot of material,'' said CHRISTINE TSCHIDA, the producer.
``Garrison does write nearly the entire program. It would be nice
to have a few other submissions to take off some of the pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Nice, but not easy. Minnesota Public Radio received 50 responses
to a Web-site ad in July. ``Of those 50, I've passed along about a
dozen to Garrison,'' Ms. Tschida said. ``He looked at them, and he
thought that some definitely had some flashes of brilliance, but.
He was hoping to really be bowled over, and he hasn't been bowled
over yet.''

MORTON EXPECTED TO MISS START
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tailback Chad Morton probably will not start
against Oregon State after straining his back doing leg squats
earlier this week, USC coach Paul Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Morton will play, but Petros Papadakis is expected to start and
true freshman Frank Strong will also get increased playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll be fine. He's been lifting the building. He
doesn't need to be on ESPN lifting barrels,'' Hackett said. ``He
just strained his back. I'm not concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton hurt his back while lifting Monday, which is a
traditional no-practice day for the Trojans. He had missed
Tuesday's practice, but said it was because he didn't feel well.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't practice you don't get the opportunity to be a
starter,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Morton's reduced role could be a plus for Strong, who has taken
an increased number of snaps in practice this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches have told me, `You're just gonna have a few more
carries. Be ready,' '' Strong said.
</P>
<P>
   Strong is still excited about his college debut last weekend,
when he had three carries for 11 yards against San Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, it was great. Just the time of my life. What I've been
waiting for,'' Strong said.
</P>
<P>
   Center of controversy: Starter Matt McShane has a twisted
ligament in his left knee, and is expected to miss the Oregon State
game. Eric Denmon, who started against Purdue, is out with a
sprained ankle. McShane will not need surgery, however, and it is
possible he could play against Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't hurt that much,'' McShane said. ``I limped off the
field but there wasn't a lot of pain. I just hit the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   David Pratchard and Jason Grain split time playing center in
practice Wednesday, although reserve Donta Kendrick is also a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have too many fumbles in practice today,'' Hackett
said. ``(Tuesday) was a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   USC did get some good injury news. Linebacker Mark Cusano
(sprained left ankle) was cleared to practice Wednesday and strong
safety Grant Pearsall is practicing and will play.
</P>
<P>
   Early appearance for Palmer?: Mike Van Raaphorst will start
again at quarterback, but Hackett said he may try freshman Carson
Palmer in the second quarter of the Oregon State game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about him. He's gonna play better the more he
plays. Maybe the end of the second quarter this week,'' Hackett
said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Hackett said the same thing last week and Palmer
didn't enter the game until late in the third quarter.

RANGERS DOWN ANGELS, 5-3, MOVE INTO FIRST-PLACE TIE IN AL WEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Many observers perceived the Rangers as the
American League West's team to beat July 31.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps perception became reality last night at The Ballpark in
Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Todd Stottlemyre _ whom the organization acquired
that July afternoon _ represented the best of general manager Doug
Melvin's efforts, and great expectations became realized during the
Rangers' 5-3 victory against the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, who recorded seven strikeouts and surrendered only
one run on six hits through eight innings, provided the Rangers his
best performance to date. The victory gave the Rangers and Angels
identical 81-70 records with 11 games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just absolutely went out there and shut them down,'' said
Rangers first baseman Will Clark, who refused to shut down after
fracturing the big toe on his right foot Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Clark served as the catalyst for the Rangers' four-run second
inning with his leadoff home run against Angels left-hander Chuck
Finley (11-8), and shortstop Royce Clayton later delivered a
two-run double that gave Stottlemyre (4-4) the offensive support
needed to pitch aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, who provided the rotation's 13th quality start
during the past 17 games, proved as tough as the situation
dictated. The Angels went 0-for-6 with runners in scoring position,
and the heart of their lineup _ center fielder Jim Edmonds,
designated hitter Tim Salmon and right fielder Garret Anderson _
went 0-for-11 with one walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story of the game,'' Clark said, ``was Todd.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, who took a 5-1 lead into the seventh inning, came
through magnificently during his greatest crisis. A two-out double
by Angels shortstop Gary DiSarcina put runners at second and third
and brought left fielder Gregg Jefferies to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferies entered the at-bat with two doubles and a fifth-inning
solo home run that accounted for the Angels' lone run, and
Stottlemyre put himself at a distinct disadvantage immediately with
consecutive pitches that eluded the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I've got a base open,'' Stottlemyre said. ``I know he's
gotten three hits. I'm either going to make the perfect pitch or
miss.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre responded with two quality fastballs down and away
to work the count even, but a third consecutive fastball missed.
The wheels then began to churn in the mind of catcher Ivan
Rodriguez, who flashed the signal for a 3-2 curveball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such a great call, a gutsy call,'' Stottlemyre said.
``I was just going to grip it and rip it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre admitted that the curveball hung in the strike zone,
but the change of speed after three consecutive fastballs
devastated Jefferies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't sit on a 3-2 curveball,'' said Jefferies, who swung
through the pitch. ``It was the first one I saw all night.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre hopped off the mound and shook his fists in triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pitched a great game,'' Jefferies said. ``He got me out
when he needed to.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels made it interesting during the ninth inning after
Rangers closer John Wetteland surrendered a one-out, two-run homer
to catcher Matt Walbeck, but an improbable rally died there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep hearing how bad we are and how we should be 10 games
ahead and that our players are underachieving,'' Rangers manager
Johnny Oates said. ``Now, the only way we can redeem ourselves is
to go out and win this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers acquired Stottlemyre in an effort to achieve that
goal.

OATES HAD RIGHT PLAN AS STOTTLEMYRE PROVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Two-and-a-half weeks ago someone writing
under the same name you see with this column tried to tell Rangers
manager Johnny Oates that he had to juggle his rotation for
Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   No way, that idiot said then, could Oates let the Todd
Stottlemyre of August start two critical games against the
front-running Angels in the middle of a late September pennant
race.
</P>
<P>
   Thank the baseball gods, Oates didn't listen.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, that wasn't exactly the Stottlemyre of August who
stepped up with one of the biggest games of his career last night
at The Ballpark in Arlington and once again enhanced his reputation
as a big-game pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre held the American League West-leading Angels to one
run in eight commanding innings and the Rangers survived a shaky
ninth by closer John Wetteland to win, 5-3, in the opener of a
critical two-game series.
</P>
<P>
   The victory sent the Rangers surging into a first-place tie with
the Angels, who are showing signs that they may finally be running
out of gas.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Rangers' second consecutive clutch victory, coming on
the heels of Tuesday night's come-from-behind 6-5 triumph in
Baltimore, while the Angels have dropped six of their past eight.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' clubhouse was still buzzing with electricity long
after the game. Loud music poured out of the jam-box speakers.
Stottlemyre was surrounded six-deep by reporters. Will Clark, who
ignited the Rangers' four-run second with a solo home run, sipped a
beer, kept his broken toe shoved into a bag of ice and extolled the
greatness of Stottlemyre to anyone who cared to listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big-game performance by a big-game pitcher,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   A relieved and excited Wetteland charged into Oates' office in
his underwear, reliving the nail-biting ninth when a base runner
reached on a strikeout/wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The game was delayed momentarily by a fan racing from the
right-field foul line to the left-field corner, where he raised his
hands above his head and waited for security to lead him away, and
then Wetteland surrendered a two-run homer to Matt Walbeck, cutting
the Rangers' lead to two and bringing the fans to the edge of their
seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm out there telling myself to keep up the intensity, keep up
the intensity,'' Wetteland said. ``I was so mad when I gave up that
home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``That guy (the fan who ran on the field), he shouldn't go to
jail. We should just go into a room together.''
</P>
<P>
   After Wetteland left, Oates grinned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think John turned it up a notch after that home run,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   No one has raised the bar higher than Stottlemyre, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few days ago we were sitting here, trying to decide who
would pitch this ballgame,'' Oates conceded after the Rangers had
regained a share of first for the first time since they led the
Angels by half a game on Aug. 13. ``We decided on Todd, and he was
very excited that he was going to be the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates won't say how close he came to looking for another option,
but Stottlemyre helped him make up his mind with strong
performances in his past three starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not damaged goods when we got him (from St. Louis at
the trading deadline), but he was not healthy,'' Oates said. ``He
hadn't pitched in 16 or 17 days, and he just wasn't 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell the difference in his last two starts
particularly. He has really been able to snap his breaking ball off
the table on hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for Gregg Jefferies, who doubled twice and hit a solo
homer in the fifth, the Angels had few good swings against
Stottlemyre, whose pivotal moment came in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   He had the four-run lead, but Craig Shipley had dumped a two-out
single into right and Gary DiSarcina had drilled a double into the
left-field corner, bringing the dangerous Jefferies back to the
plate. Stottlemyre struck him out with a full-count curveball that
started at Jefferies' eyes and tumbled to his knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was as big an out as there was in the game,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   At 120 pitches, Stottlemyre might have finished it, but with
Wetteland available in the bullpen, Oates saw no reason to push it.
</P>
<P>
   Eight superb innings was enough to prove that starting
Stottlemyre against the Angels last night and again next week in
Anaheim were the most logical and sanest decisions a manager could
ever make.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a full investigation is under way in an attempt to
discover the identity of the irrational scoundrel who was able to
sneak his own opinion in under this column sig, suggesting that
Oates' forget about Stottlemyre completely.
</P>
<P>
   Shame on him.

 By NEIL HOHLFELD  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON _ When the Texas Rangers made a trade-deadline deal to
acquire pitcher Todd Stottlemyre and shortstop Royce Clayton from
St. Louis on July 31, they undoubtedly had September in mind.
</P>
<P>
   It was Stottlemyre's pitching and Clayton's hitting, fielding
and baserunning that led the Rangers past Anaheim 5-3 Wednesday and
into a first-place tie with the Angels in the American League West
Division.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams are 81-70; they play four of their remaining 11 games
against each other.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have a chance tonight to regain first place for the
first time since Aug. 13 when they send 19-game winner Rick Helling
against Anaheim knuckleballer Steve Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers and Angels also play three games next week in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre had been a disappointment in eight previous starts
with the Rangers, going 3-4 with a 5.56 ERA. But he worked eight
strong innings Wednesday, allowing one run on six hits, three of
them to Gregg Jefferies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that when you get traded for, there are a lot of
expectations,'' said Stottlemyre. ``To this point, I'd pretty much
come up a little short. But I also know that if you have a good
September, everybody forgets what you did in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't pitched well since coming over, and all day today I
was really focused. I didn't say much to my family at home, and I
didn't say anything to my teammates at the park. I knew the task at
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton went 2-for-4 with a two-run double in a four-run second
inning against Chuck Finley, who allowed nine hits and five runs in
6 innings as he lost his eighth straight decision to the Rangers
dating to June 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Clayton stole third base in the second inning and
made a run-saving stop of a ground ball into the hole in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton and Stottlemyre were key components when St. Louis
overtook the Astros to win the National League Central title in
1996. This July 31, the Rangers traded three young players to the
Cardinals for Clayton and Stottlemyre, both of whom will be free
agents at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   For Anaheim manager Terry Collins, it must seem like a recurring
bad dream. In 1996, when Collins was the Astros' manager, they had
a 2{-game lead over St. Louis on Sept. 1 but went 8-16 the rest of
the way and finished six games behind the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Collins was fired at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd Stottlemyre is one of the best competitors out there,''
said Collins. ``When I saw him for the first time when St. Louis
got him, the thing that jumped out was his competitiveness. It
seems like when things are at the tightest, he steps it up a notch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Royce Clayton has hurt me many times. He's a good shortstop,
both offensively and defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   For Collins and the Angels, another September to forget looms.
</P>
<P>
   Collins has a 40-50 record in four Septembers as a major-league
manager. When he managed the Astros, they fell short to Colorado by
one game in the wild-card race in 1995 and were caught and lapped
by the Cardinals a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Last season at Anaheim, the Angels led the AL West in late
August and were one game back on Sept. 1 but went 10-15 the rest of
the way as Seattle won the division.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have a recent September history that is even more
grim.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, they are 53-90 in the ``S'' month. The finish to the
1995 season was the measure of how to blow a commanding lead down
the stretch. The Angels led Seattle by 7{ games on Sept. 1 before
going 10-16 and losing a one-game playoff to Randy Johnson and the
Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers manager Johnny Oates said, ``I keep hearing about how
bad we are. I hear that we should be 10 games ahead by now, about
how we're underachieving. I guess the only thing we can do now to
redeem ourselves is to win this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The AL West is the only division title in the majors not
decided. With the home-run race in full bloom and four division
winners with more than 100 wins or positioned to reach that total,
the Rangers and Angels are more or less a footnote to this baseball
season.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday's game, Collins said he has tried to deflect
attention from the AL West race in order to take pressure off his
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told them that if you think for one second that the focus
of the baseball world is on us, you're crazy,'' said Collins.
``We're barely being noticed. The focus is still in St. Louis (Mark
McGwire) and in Chicago (Sammy Sosa), and it should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are saying that we shouldn't even be here, so
why should we be uptight about anything?''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have lost five of their last six games, are 5-8 in
September and have lost four games in the standings to the Rangers
since Aug. 26.
</P>
<P>
   And while Collins says he has scaled back his white-hot
intensity a bit, he pitched a fit Tuesday after his team lost 8-1
at Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Collins sensed that his players were looking past the Devil
Rays. He was incensed when a memo from the front office circulated
around the clubhouse, and players groused about having to pay for
playoff tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Collins let his players know in no uncertain terms that they
wouldn't have to worry about playoff tickets unless they started to
focus more on their task at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was mad last night because we were playing Tampa Bay and
nobody was talking about Tampa Bay,'' said Collins. ``I wasn't
nervous; I was mad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are 3-5 against Anaheim this year, all three wins
coming against Finley.
</P>
<P>
   Will Clark's homer set the tone in the second inning, and
Clayton's two-run double put the Rangers ahead 3-0. Stottlemyre did
most of the rest, holding the Angels' big hitters _ Jim Edmonds,
Tim Salmon and Garret Anderson _ to a combined 0-for-10.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, with runners on second and third, Stottlemyre
struck out Jefferies to end the threat and pumped his fist as he
came off the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``You like those people with that look,'' said Oates. ``He has a
presence that allows his teammates to gain confidence by just
watching him walk around. When guys like that walk out there, it's
like they're saying, `This is ours. Nobody is taking it from us.'''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. _ Life could not be better for Buffalo Bills
running back Antowain Smith.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sure, Smith would like for the Bills to be 2-0 rather than 0-2.
He would like to have more than 88 yards rushing, but he knows they
have 14 games left after losses at San Diego and Miami. And he
plans to rush for at least 1,300 yards and lead Buffalo back to the
NFL playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In his second season, Smith has a new coach, Wade Phillips, who
believes in him. He has a new role that features Smith in a
run-oriented system. A former No. 1 pick from the University of
Houston, Smith has money in the bank and a new two-story house in
this quaint, picturesque town just outside Buffalo and not far from
the Bills' offices at Rich Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antowain's got unlimited potential,'' says Phillips, the
Bills' defensive coordinator who was elevated after last season to
replace the retired Marv Levy. ``He's just so big (6-2 and 240
pounds) and fast (4.4 in the 40), and he knows how to run, too. He
has the power and toughness to run over people, but he also makes
good cuts and can bounce outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is his year to see where he's going to be because we're
going to get him the ball more as the season progresses.''
</P>
<P>
   As a rookie last season, Smith played behind Thurman Thomas but
saw enough action to convince his coaches, teammates and people
around the league he could be something special. More important,
Smith developed the confidence to prove to himself he can be one of
the best backs in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a bigger role this season, and there's more pressure
on me,'' Smith says. ``I'm the man who has to get the job done, but
my teammates will be a big part of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can be as good as I want to be, and I want to be
what Barry Sanders is to Detroit and Terrell Davis is to Denver. I
know it's not going to come easy. I busted my butt in the
offseason, and I'm ready to shoulder the load.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bills are off to a slow start, but Smith's teammates and
coaches believe he is ready to carry that burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's what I call a lineman-friendly runner because he makes
our jobs easier,'' Pro Bowl guard Ruben Brown says. ``Because
Antowain's so powerful, he gets a lot of extra yards. He can push
the pile. He also can make his own holes.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds offensive line coach Carl Mauck: ``He's got a great burst,
that extra gear a lot of runners don't have.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since Thomas joined the Bills in 1988, he is
not the starting halfback. Smith, his teammate, friend and protg,
earned the job after an impressive rookie performance last season
that continued through training camp and the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   In the offseason, Thomas and Smith reside in Houston, where they
plan to move permanently when their careers end. Because Thomas,
32, will return to Houston before Smith, he is passing the torch
with grace and dignity to the player who has taken his starting
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my 11th year, and I was a starter for the first 10,''
Thomas says. ``That's a lot of football. I'm not going to stand
here and say I feel like I'm 25 years old. I feel like I'm 32 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very easy for me to help Antowain. I recognize
talent, and he's got talent. He's also a good person. I'm still
teaching him the tricks of the trade in the NFL, but he's a Pro
Bowl-caliber player who can put the team on his shoulders and carry
them all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who grew up in Alabama and played junior-college football
in Mississippi before signing with the Cougars, believes he has
been blessed in ways most people can't comprehend. He uses Thomas'
attitude toward him as an example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most guys wouldn't have taken me under their wing like Thurman
did,'' Smith says. ``They would have turned their back on me
because I was the new kid trying to win his job. I didn't know
Thurman before I came here. I always knew he was a great player,
but I really respect him because of what he's done for me. He's
making me a better player.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have helped me get to where I am today. I
think it was destiny that brought me to the NFL. The long, hard
road that I took, the obstacles I had to overcome, I think God was
testing my will to see if I would quit. I didn't. I never take
anything for granted. I know from personal experience that on any
given day what we've worked so hard for can be taken away. I just
thank God I got this opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   When Smith talks about overcoming obstacles, he isn't
exaggerating. Few athletes have persevered as Smith has.
</P>
<P>
   In high school, Smith played football only in his senior year,
but Auburn and Alabama wanted him. Rather than play big-time
college football, however, Smith got a job in a factory that dyed
clothes because his grandmother, Clara Smith, was severely ill.
Smith spent three years caring for his grandmother before she died
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was basically raised by my grandmother and grandfather,''
Smith says. ``My mother had me when she was 16. We've got a good
relationship. I understand that times were tough back then. My
grandmother worked in the kitchen at my high school. She suffered a
stroke and wasn't able to do things she used to do. I elected to go
to work to take care of her. I made $5.50 an hour, and I worked the
3-to-11 p.m. shift so I could drive her back and forth to the
hospital so she could undergo kidney dialysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cooked for her and cleaned for her. I basically did whatever
she needed to be done. Sure, I wanted to go out with my friends and
enjoy life at 18 and 19, but I wanted to take care of her. I'm the
oldest of seven children, and I've always believed that you should
always put your family first.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother did everything in her power to take care of me.
A lot of people looked at what I did as a sacrifice, but to me it
wasn't a sacrifice at all because I loved her dearly. Near the end,
it was hard for me to visit her in the hospital and see her hooked
up to all those tubes, but I'd sit there and tell her not to worry
because I was going to be all right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I know she's up there looking down on me, and she's just
tickled to death that her baby made it.''
</P>
<P>
   After his grandmother died, Smith quit his job and went to
Atlanta to spend a few weeks with his mother and his brothers and
sisters. He and a friend planned to join the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the last thing my grandmother told me before she died was,
`Son, go to school,''' Smith says. ``That's what stuck in my mind.
It was always her dream to see me go to college.''
</P>
<P>
   After three years of inactivity, Smith was out of shape, but he
got a tryout at a junior college in Scooba, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran a 40-yard dash, and they gave me a scholarship right
then,'' he says. ``Man, I wanted to go home. That town was so
small, there was only one convenience store.''
</P>
<P>
   After his first practice, Smith tried to go home to Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost quit football the first day,'' he says. ``I was so
out of shape. I almost died. I had to get help to get off the
field, I was so exhausted. I tried to quit. The reason I couldn't
is because when I called home, no one would come get me. I really
didn't have any choice, so I thought since I was going to have to
stay, I might as well make the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith had an excellent sophomore year and met University of
Houston coach Kim Helton.
</P>
<P>
   ``When coach Helton recruited me,'' Smith says, ``he said, `Son,
if you want to get to the National Football League, I'm the one
that can help you get there. I coached in the NFL. I've got great
contacts in the NFL, and we run a pro-style offense.'
</P>
<P>
   ``What really sold me was when I came to Houston. There was so
much to do. I loved Houston right away. I was ready for a change. I
grew up in Alabama and spent two years in Mississippi, and I wanted
to go to a big city. My first year at U of H, I was second-guessing
myself because we went 2-9, but we went to a bowl game my last
year, and everything worked out well.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's senior year at UH was bittersweet. He was an outstanding
player who impressed NFL scouts at the Senior Bowl and the scouting
combine. But his grandfather died of cancer, which also struck a
younger brother, Quintin Long. Now, his brother's cancer is in
remission, and he attends Houston Community College.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really miss my grandparents,'' Smith says. ``Not a day goes
by that I don't think about them. I have their initials on the
shirt I wear (under his jersey) to every game. I just wish they
could be here to share this with me.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I think if you can overcome tragedy in your family,
you can overcome anything. I had to grow up early. I experienced a
lot at a young age.''
</P>
<P>
   When Smith left Houston, he was 25, which repelled a lot of NFL
teams but not Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ``His age didn't scare us, because we knew he hadn't been hit a
lot,'' Bills general manager John Butler says. ``He wasn't a
beat-up 25-year-old. We knew his background and what he went
through.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so refreshing to see a guy with the type of character
Antowain has. Whether it's his age or what took place in his past,
he knows how to handle success.''
</P>
<P>
   Success didn't come easy for Smith, and unless everyone is
wrong, he should have a lot of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my age, my maturity level, has helped me deal with
this situation better,'' Smith says. ``There are a lot of things
that can distract you if you want to explore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this: I don't think anyone could appreciate what I have
any more than I do.''

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
NEW ORLEANS _ New Orleans is the ultimate party town, but running
back Lamar Smith did not come to the Big Easy to drink and carouse.
He couldn't find the French Quarter with a city map and has no
desire to.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Smith, who played at the University of Houston, is happy
sticking close to the Saints' practice facility in Metairie. He is
focusing on football, making new friends and trying to put his past
where it belongs _ behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Sidetracked by tragedy and hungry from inactivity, Smith came to
New Orleans to add punch to coach Mike Ditka's offense. He left
Seattle for New Orleans because he wanted to rejuvenate a football
career that had been derailed by an automobile accident that left
former Seahawks teammate Mike Frier partially paralyzed and caused
Smith to spend two months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new start for me, and I'm really enjoying myself,''
says Smith, who got out of a Washington jail on a work furlough in
March to come to New Orleans to sign a four-year, $7.1 million
contract. ``It's taken me awhile to get into shape physically, but
everyone's treating me real well.''
</P>
<P>
   And they will treat him even better if he continues to make the
kind of big plays he made in victories over St. Louis and Carolina.
Against the Rams, Smith caught a 35-yard touchdown pass and threw
an option pass for a touchdown. Against the Panthers, Smith carried
12 times for 78 yards. New Orleans rushed for 207 yards against the
Panthers, which brought tears of joy to Ditka's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Considering what he has gone through, Smith's career in New
Orleans could not have gotten off to a better start. He's glad to
be out of Seattle. Things were never the same for him after that
cool, rainy night in his rookie season of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was driving. His passengers were Frier in the back seat
and running back Chris Warren in the front. They had been drinking.
The car slid off the road and crashed into a telephone pole. When
Smith was tested, he was barely over the legal limit for public
intoxication.
</P>
<P>
   ``They treated me as if I were a career criminal,'' Smith says
of the Seattle fans. ``It was an accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith emphasizes the word ``accident.''
</P>
<P>
   It could have happened to anyone who drinks and drives. And it
happened to Smith, who spent a lot of time wondering: ``Why me? Why
was I driving?''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Smith experienced enormous guilt over Frier, a
defensive lineman, being paralyzed below the waist. The guilt might
have been too much for Smith to overcome if not for Frier and his
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike's been wonderful about the whole thing,'' Smith says.
``He knows what happened. He knows I didn't mean to do it. We have
a great relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I talked to him (after the accident) was a real
trying moment for me because I didn't know how he'd accept me. I
didn't know if he'd hate me for what I'd done to him. But he
welcomed me with open arms. We had tears in our eyes, and we
hugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``His parents have been great, too. If it weren't for them, I
just don't know how I would have been able to handle it or if I
would have.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally, police tried to say Warren, the Seahawks' star
running back, had been driving even though the players told the
truth. The general opinion was that Smith, the rookie, was trying
to protect Warren.
</P>
<P>
   When it was finally figured out and determined that Smith was
indeed driving, he was charged with vehicular assault. The judge
sentenced him to 120 days in jail. He got off 30 days for community
service and 30 days for good behavior.
</P>
<P>
   To settle a civil suit with Frier, Smith agreed to give his
former teammate 40 percent of his earnings and 50 percent of his
incentive bonuses. And his contract is full of performance bonuses
that kick in when he rushes for 700 yards. He can earn as much as
$5 million in incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's mother, who resides in their native Indiana, moved to
Seattle to be with her son and help him deal with the situation.
Now, his mother has gone back home, and her son is in New Orleans
trying to make a new start on what had been such a promising
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, it was tough,'' Smith says in a voice so soft it's almost
a whisper. ``It was a four-year nightmare for me. I'd go into a
restaurant, and I could tell people were looking at me in a certain
way, like I was some kind of criminal who'd done a lot of bad
things. That's not who I am. I just couldn't take it. It was
really, really hard on me.''
</P>
<P>
   As an organization, the Seahawks treated Smith well after the
accident. But the public never really knew who Lamar Smith was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a private person,'' he says. ``I don't reveal a lot of
myself publicly. People didn't know me. After the accident, a lot
of them thought they did, but what they thought was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a bad person. I'm a good person.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than continue his appeal, he pleaded guilty, accepted his
sentence and served 60 days this past offseason on a work-release
program. He still must perform 240 hours of community service,
which he plans to do in New Orleans. He's on probation for one
year, and he has to call his probation officer once a month. His
driver's license has been suspended for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 27, never played regularly for the Seahawks. When he
played at the University of Houston, Smith became one of the
Southwest Conference's better backs before suffering a shoulder
injury. Seattle selected him in the third round of the 1994 draft,
but it was his misfortune to play behind Warren.
</P>
<P>
   Smith received opportunities when Warren was injured. In 1996,
he rushed for 680 yards. Last season, he was limited to 392 after
suffering a broken ankle.
</P>
<P>
   When Smith reported to training camp with the Saints, he was not
in good shape because he had done the time in jail. He had to work
overtime to get into the kind of shape he wants. He is listed at
5-11 and 218 pounds, but he is playing closer to 225.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still getting into a comfort zone,'' he says. ``I'm still
not where I want to be, but I'm getting there. My conditioning has
improved week to week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just thankful to be playing football. While I was in jail,
there was one point where I felt stripped of everything. It wasn't
a good feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's position coach, Lary Kuharich, is his biggest fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether by run or catch, Lamar has a unique ability to run
with the ball,'' Kuharich says. ``He's taking advantage of his
chance. He does something every day that draws a response from his
teammates and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``At his size, to do the things he does is really extraordinary.
We think he can be a big-play, game-breaking type of back. We have
to make him some room. He's shown that even when he's trapped in
the backfield, he can make moves to get out of trouble. He's tough,
competitive and smart. We knew he was a good pass protector from
watching him on film, but we're asking him to block on the run,
too, and he's knocking people down. He's everything a lead back
should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Center Jerry Fontenot is one of the blockers who has to give
Smith some daylight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed a guy who can be a possession back, someone who can
get four or five yards a pop,'' Fontenot says. ``Lamar's got strong
legs, but he's also nifty enough to put moves on people. Once he
gets this offense down a little more, he'll definitely make a big
impact on our running game.''

DOG DNA HELPS CONVICT TWO OF MURDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELAINE PORTERFIELD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The blood of a dead dog named Chief helped convict two
Seattle men of murder Wednesday in the first trial ever in the
country to use animal DNA as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The courtroom of King County Superior Court Judge Richard Jones
erupted into moans, sobs and profanity as soon as the verdicts were
read. Courtroom officers had to step in to separate the families of
the victims and the defendants on the orders of the judge.
</P>
<P>
   The officers then trooped into the hallway to maintain order.
</P>
<P>
   The jury convicted Kenneth John Leuluaialii, 23, of aggravated
first-degree murder and of one count of first-degree animal
cruelty. Because prosecutors did not seek the death penalty, the
only sentence is life in prison with no chance of release.
</P>
<P>
   The jury also convicted George Tuilefano, 23, of two counts of
first-degree murder. He faces a minimum of 20 years in prison on
each count, served consecutively, Senior Deputy Prosecutor Tim
Bradshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuilefano was acquitted of animal cruelty.
</P>
<P>
   Both men stared down and ran their hands through their long hair
after hearing the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The pair was accused of shooting to death 20-year-old Raquel
Rivera and Jay Johnson, 22, along with their dog Chief, in the
couple's South Park apartment in December 1996. Prosecutors say
Leuluaialii and Tuilefano burst into the apartment demanding drugs
and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera and Johnson died at the scene. Chief died about 30 hours
later, despite efforts to save his life.
</P>
<P>
   The blood of the dead dog helped convict the two, Bradshaw said
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We owe a debt to the scientific community,'' Bradshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   The DNA tests were ``exceedingly important,'' Bradshaw added.
``We could not only identify it as dog blood, but individuate it to
a single dog.''
</P>
<P>
   One unidentified juror said the evidence was very important
because it placed the men at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   But juror Mark Madden of Mercer Island said other evidence
figured more prominently in his decision. A distinctive footprint
on the front door of the slain couple's apartment that matched
shoes worn by Leuluaialii was very convincing, Madden said.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the testimony of witnesses who saw the pair at the
apartment was convincing as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My assessment is that a lot of the witnesses weren't
necessarily the most reliable ... but their stories seemed to
match,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors told jurors that Johnson was tortured by being shot
in both thighs by Leuluaialii. After Johnson then said ``justkill
me,'' Leuluaialii handed the gun to Tuilefano, who shot Johnson
three more times.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera was shot in the chin and mouth as she screamed,
prosecutors said, and in the neck. Chief was shot twice.
</P>
<P>
   Leuluaialii's lawyer asked Jones to immediately sentence his
client, but the judge declined to do so, saying the families of the
victims had a right to speak at his sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   No sentencing date has been set.
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict, Leuluaialii kissed a baby held up by a young
woman over and over _ as a relative of one the victims cried out,
``No more, no more'' _ before corrections officers handcuffed and
led him away. Relatives refused to identify the baby.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his violent behavior at previous court appearances,
Leuluaialii has been strapped into a special security chair to be
wheeled between the courtroom and the jail.
</P>
<P>
   Leuluaialii also asked the judge which prison he would be sent
to. Jones told him that decision was up to the state Department of
Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the judge rebuked a female relative of Leuluaialii for
her lack of control. The woman cried out, ``He's not a killer, God
knows'' and ``I love you'' before telling Johnson's family he had
deserved to be killed.
</P>
<P>
   The victims' families slipped from the courthouse without
speaking publicly.
</P>
<P>
   The jury began deliberations Monday morning, following two
months of testimony. Jurors signaled they'd reached a verdict
Wednesday by midafternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think public safety was served today,'' Bradshaw said.
``We're indebted to the jurors.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief's DNA was central to their case, said Bradshaw, who called
the dog the third, silent victim in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Its blood was found spattered on the right arm of a jacket
belonging to Leuluaialii. A sheriff's deputy testified that he saw
Leuluaialii wearing what appeared to be the same jacket several
weeks before the killings.
</P>
<P>
   The jacket was found in a Lakewood motel room when Leuluaialii
was arrested the day after the killings. Without DNA tests on the
jacket, it might have been much tougher obtaining convictions,
Bradshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   DNA from cat hair had been used in a Canadian case, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers put three DNA experts of their own on the stand
to dispute the conclusions of experts for the state. They also
questioned the credibility of prosecution witnesses, and tried to
cast doubt on who owned the blood-spattered clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Although the prosecution had sought an aggravated-murder
conviction against Tuilefano, as well as Leuluaialii, Bradshaw said
he respected the jury's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuilefano's conviction was based on accomplice liability,
clearly,'' he said, not for being the primary force behind the
crime.

DODGERS BEAT ROCKIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa both surpassed Babe
Ruth's monumental single-season home run total over the last two
weeks. Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Brian Bohanon looks as if he
caught and passed Ruth's waistline some time ago.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it, Bohanon's chances of winning a Mr. Olympia title
are about as good as the Dodgers' hopes of making the playoffs. At
6-foot-2 and a playing weight well above his listed 219 pounds,
Bohanon could easily have the worst body in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   But the left-handed, pot-bellied pitcher looks toned and trim in
today's box score. He mixed speeds and location and established a
career high in strikeouts to beat the Colorado Rockies 2-0 in front
of an announced crowd of 27,906 at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon, a journeyman whom the Dodgers picked up in a July 10
trade with the New York Mets, allowed two hits to start the game
and then retired 12 of the next 13 Rockies. He threw eight shutout
innings before being relieved by Jeff Shaw, who picked up his 44th
save despite giving up three hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very confident right now,'' Bohanon said. ``I feel like I
could put the ball wherever I want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Glenn Hoffman, who has seen Hoffman go eight
innings in his last two starts, said he has been impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bohanon) threw 107 pitches (tonight) and came out with hardly
a sweat,'' Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   OK, this was a Colorado lineup devoid of the slumping Dante
Bichette (.336 average despite a recent 0-or-9 skid), the gimpy
Larry Walker (NL-leading .357), and Rookie of the Year candidate
Todd Helton (.321, 89 RBI).
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon was tough on the kids. Rookies Angel Echevarria, Derrick
Gibson and Edgard Clemente were a combined 2 for 8 against him, but
All-Star third baseman Vinny Castilla (1 for 2, walk) didn't do
much and neither did second baseman Mike Lansing, who went 0 for 4
and struck out twice.
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon struck out a career-high 10, including six batters in a
row at one point, in his 79th major-league start. He also was
responsible for the Dodgers taking a 1-0 lead in the third. With
runners on first and third and no outs, Bohanon grounded to
Lansing. Even though the Rockies turned a double play, the ball was
hit deep enough on the infield to allow Adrian Beltre to score from
third.
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon (7-10) was also boosted by the maddening Dodgers'
defense, which booted the game away on Tuesday and came back with a
tour de force on Wednesday. The Rockies put the potential tying run
on first in the fifth, sixth and seventh, but each time, the
Dodgers turned a rally-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Mark Grudzielanek turned in the prettiest, diving to
his left on former Montreal teammate Lansing's sharp grounder and
flipping to Juan Castro at second to start the double play in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek also made a diving catch to his right to rob
Echevarria of a hit and double pinch-runner Curtis Goodwin off
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at some of those plays that were made,'' Hoffman
said, ``and it just shows how pitching and defense win games.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman said he didn't hesitate to use Shaw, even though Bohanon
was still going strong. Lansing represented the potential go-ahead
run with two outs but he grounded into a force play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff Shaw is a closer,'' Hoffman said. ``That's his job and
his role.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado starter Jamey Wright (10-12) wasn't so lucky. The
Dodgers took a 2-0 lead in the bottom of the seventh after Kurt
Abbott misplayed Roger Cedeno's single, allowing the speedy Cedeno
to advance to second with two outs. Castro singled to drive in
Cedeno. It was only the sixth hit Wright allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers played without Bobby Bonilla, who was a late scratch
with a sore wrist. The Dodgers (78-75) are off today and start a
three-game series in San Francisco on Friday.

SOSA REACHES NO. 63 WITH A GRAND SLAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ED GUZMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Chicago Cubs right fielder Sammy Sosa was relaxed
enough to hit his 63d home run on Wednesday night. It was simply a
matter of when.
</P>
<P>
   After singling and doubling in his first four at-bats on
Wednesday night, Sosa stood at the on-deck circle in the top of the
eighth inning holding his personalized black Louisville Slugger
bat. He made a sign of the cross, put his fingers to his lips and
then touched his bat.
</P>
<P>
   With that bit of divine help, Sosa came to the plate with the
bases loaded and two out. With the Qualcomm Stadium crowd of 49,891
on its feet, Sosa drove a 1-0 pitch from the San Diego right-hander
Brian Boehringer high and deep into the second deck in left field,
a 434-foot blast that tied Mark McGwire for most home runs in a
season and gave the Cubs a 6-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs went on to beat the Padres, 6-3, to remain a half-game
ahead of the New York Mets in the race for the National League
wild-card playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think 62, 63 are pretty good for me,'' Sosa said. ``Now I
want to take my team to the playoffs. Right now, I feel great.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa had tied McGwire at 62 on Sunday, when he connected twice
in a stunning performance at Wrigley Field. That gave him four
homers in three days.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire went back ahead with No. 63 when he pinch-hit for the
St. Louis Cardinals in the ninth inning of the first game of a
doubleheader Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's third career grand slam _ all this season _ was his 22nd
career homer against the Padres, the most against any opponent. He
was 1 for 9 with six strikeouts in the first two games of this
four-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa will have a chance to jump ahead of McGwire on Thursday,
when he faces the Padres rookie Stan Spencer. The Cardinals are off
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa and McGwire each have nine games left.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa was so loose before the game that after a horde from the
news media finished asking questions, he sheepishly said: ``Don't
leave. Does anyone have any more questions? I've got time for
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   A reporter then asked Sosa if he had any questions for the
members of the news media. After pausing for a minute, he said:
``What did Mark McGwire do today? Did he hit 64?''

BASEBALL FOULS UP GIVING SOSA HIS DUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The post-election party for a local candidate was well
underway Tuesday night. But when you're branded a sports guy, the
sports questions never stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you think,'' the die-hard baseball fan asked me, ``that
the way baseball is underplaying Sammy Sosa is a little racist?''
</P>
<P>
   In a word, no.
</P>
<P>
   If the word in question is indeed racism.
</P>
<P>
   If the word is insensitive, then there's a point.
</P>
<P>
   For a month, the question has drifted around the periphery of
the home run chase. The suspicion is that because Mark McGwire is a
white guy, baseball and many of its fans hope he prevails over the
Latin guy with the accent.
</P>
<P>
   While no one should underestimate the rockhead portion of
American society, a hefty majority would seem to be preoccupied in
this matter by the thing that historically has been the
preoccupation of the culture _ who's first.
</P>
<P>
   As a society that endlessly quantifies, compares, lists and
ranks, we have an overwhelming desire to learn the identity of No.
1 and a near-total obliviousness about who is No. 2. Make all the
value judgments you want; it's a fact.
</P>
<P>
   As the first guy in 37 years to top Roger Maris in home runs,
McGwire's feat was accorded almost an instant national holiday. As
the second guy who passed Maris, Sosa has been hailed vigorously in
Chicago but in a more muted fashion elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The point hit home Sunday when Sosa's two home runs tied him
again with McGwire at 62, but baseball officials didn't have the
presence of moment to mark his baseballs for historic certitude, as
they did for McGwire, nor was there special acknowledgement of his
achievement within his industry.
</P>
<P>
   But Sosa broke no record. He bested Maris and Babe Ruth, but
neither holds the record.
</P>
<P>
   Without trying, Clinton-style, to split hairs, the fact remains
that while a record has been broken, a new record has not been set.
That can't happen until the season is over, or unless both players
go down with season-ending injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Until the record is set, the degree and ultimate moment of
Sosa's achievement is unknown. McGwire's achievement is more
clearly defined because he was the first to break sports' most
glamorous record. And we love our firsts.
</P>
<P>
   If the recent situation had been reversed, wherein Sosa had hit
four home runs in two days to put him at 59 while McGwire was at
56, I would be shocked to learn that this newspaper or any other
media outlet would have been any less aggressive in covering the
story of the record's imminent fall. Nor would baseball have been
less celebratory in its salute.
</P>
<P>
   To the degree that Sosa is less familiar to the sports audience
than McGwire, it is largely a factor of their baseball profiles.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, an All-Star once, had never hit more than 40 home runs
until this season. Ever since McGwire, a 10-time All-Star, hit 49
home runs in his rookie year of 1988, he has been the object of
annual speculation as to whether each year would be his year. After
hitting 58 in 1997, McGwire's middle name became ``on a pace for.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Sosa hit his astonishing 20 homers in June, he was not a
serious contender. Even afterward, it was expected by many that the
pressure that had consumed every previous pretender over 36 years
would consume him, as well as McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   But no. Both not only withstood the grind, they eventually
flourished. McGwire simply had the good fortune to run into the
Florida Marlins' Class AAA pitching staff on Sept. 1-2, when he hit
four home runs to break away.
</P>
<P>
   (A moment's digression: Anyone who thinks the feats of McGwire
and Sosa have healed baseball is apparently not a witness to the
defending champ Marlins, whose wreckage remains a more vivid
reminder of the state of baseball than any number of home runs).
</P>
<P>
   Having said all of the above, baseball again missed another
opportunity for goodwill by its inattention to Sosa's potential
achievement. As a sport with a dubious record in advancing the case
for minority athletes, coaches and executives, the last thing
baseball needs was even the appearance of insensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a stretch to imagine that Sosa Sunday and Monday could
have tied and surpassed McGwire. Nor is it difficult to imagine
that McGwire, already bothered by back spasms and a long injury
history, could have been stopped for the season at 62.
</P>
<P>
   Then what?
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, the indistinct resolution of one of baseball's
greatest individual competitions makes party planning difficult.
But it doesn't seem a lot to ask that commissioner Bud Selig spend
a few days with the Cubs or if business is so pressing (as if,
after six years without a commissioner, things couldn't wait),
designate a former Cubs great such as Ernie Banks or Billy Williams
as his representative.
</P>
<P>
   Since at this writing any of Sosa's home runs could tie or set a
splendid record, the baseballs should be marked and the game be
prepared to acknowledge in a brief ceremony the significance of his
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Would that be overdoing it? In a nation that features Las Vegas,
the Starr report, Pamela Anderson, Dennis Rodman and Humvees, the
act of overdoing is impossible.

RANGERS BEAT ANGELS

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ One way or another, Todd Stottlemyre figured
to pitch in an Angels-Rangers game in September. The only question
was: Which uniform would he be wearing?
</P>
<P>
   Though the Anaheim Angels tried to get him in a trade with the
St. Louis Cardinals, Stottlemyre became a Ranger on July 31 in a
trading-deadline deal. Wednesday night, the Angels probably wished
they had tried harder.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre undressed the Angels hitters in a 5-3 Rangers
victory before 37,481 at The Ballpark in Arlington, the Rangers
knocking the Angels out of sole possession of first place in the AL
West for the first time since Aug. 13.
</P>
<P>
   With the win, the Rangers caught the Angels at 81-70 with 11
games to play, including four against each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't gotten down after 151 games so far,'' Angels
manager Terry Collins said, ``we're hardly going to get down now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still 11 games left,'' Angels center fielder Jim
Edmonds said. ``I think it's going to come down to all 11 games.
They're all important. I'd hate to say any game is too important
because it puts too much pressure on you. The next 11 are important
just like the last two weeks have been important.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre stifled the Angels hitters except for Gregg
Jefferies, who doubled twice and homered. His homer _ No.1 with the
Angels and No.9 overall this season _ was the Angels' only offense
of the night against Stottlemyre (4-4). Stottlemyre gave up one run
and six hits in eight innings, striking out seven and walking one.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Jefferies had three hits against him, Stottlemyre
struck Jefferies out to end the seventh inning with runners on
second and third. Jefferies swung and missed at a 3-2 curveball,
and both Stottlemyre and catcher Ivan Rodriguez celebrated by
throwing a fist into the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pitched a great game,'' Jefferies said. ``He got me out
when he needed to. Pretty much my first three at-bats meant
nothing. He made a great pitch. I can't sit on a 3-2 curveball. He
hadn't thrown me one all night.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre's performance was his best in eight starts as a
Ranger, and he saved it for the most important game to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole day today I was focused,'' Stottlemyre said.
``They're tough, they're scrappy. My hat's off to (Angels starter
Chuck) Finley. He stuck it out. Five days from now, I know we're
going to go head-to-head again and I know he's going to be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley (11-8) had one bad inning _ the fourth, when the Rangers
scored four runs. Will Clark led off the inning with his 23rd homer
of the season. Mike Simms had a key double and Royce Clayton drove
in two with a double.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Finley gave up five runs and nine hits in 62/3 innings,
falling to 0-3 vs. the Rangers this season and to 7-15 in his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Texas or any other team, if you get behind in the count,
you're swimming with sharks most of the time,'' Finley said.
``Obviously I'm disappointed from the standpoint of not winning.
But I'm not disappointed in myself because I did everything I
could. I've just got to do my deal. It didn't work out.... I've got
two more starts, and they might make the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley didn't get much help from the offense. Besides Jefferies'
three hits, the Angels got a two-run homer from Matt Walbeck in the
ninth off Rangers closer John Wetteland.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels bats have gone cold on the current trip _ they are
hitting .229 (47 for 205) as a team in six games, five losses.
They're not doing the little things, like in the first inning when
Jefferies opened the game with a double but Randy Velarde failed to
move him over, popping out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a leadoff double ... if we scored right away, we
might've popped their bubble,'' Collins said. ``I'm not blaming
Randy Velarde. He said he could get the runner over and he didn't.
This is not a game of absolutes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't moved a guy over on the whole road trip, I think,''
Edmonds said. ``It doesn't matter if you're trying or not. You have
to get it done.''

DODGERS' INFIELD AUDITIONS HAVE INTRIGUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Nine games remain for the Los Angeles Dodgers and
a bunch of guys who are uncertain about their futures are
auditioning for next season.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the intrigue as thick as the middle infield. The
Dodgers have two established shortstops _ Mark Grudzielanek and
Jose Vizcaino _ and prospect Alex Cora might not benefit from
another year as a reserve, or worse, at Triple-A.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Young, who will be in the second year of a four-year, $18
million contract, is entrenched at second, but the competition to
be his backup might include Cora and Adam Riggs.
</P>
<P>
   So where does this leave Juan Castro?
</P>
<P>
   Castro, who took over for Young as the starter at second, saw
his average dip below .200 (.199) after he struck out in his first
two at-bats Wednesday night. There is no question about his
abilities defensively, although he says he feels more comfortable
at shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't thought about (next season),'' Castro said. ``What I
want is to play every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro committed a throwing error after replacing Young in
Tuesday night's 5-4 loss to the Rockies. But Dodgers manager Glenn
Hoffman said he feels comfortable with Castro at second. Cora can
also play second.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done well over there,'' he said. ``Juan's probably got
the most experience.''
</P>
<P>
   After going 0 for 3 on Tuesday, Castro had only eight extra-base
hits in 79 games.
</P>
<P>
   Hurting: Raul Mondesi, who has battled a sore back, was given
the night off by Hoffman, who said he wanted Mondesi fresh for the
weekend series in San Francisco.``(Mondesi)'s been dragging a
bit,'' Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   Left-handed reliever Mark Guthrie pitched in the bullpen without
pain Wednesday and will also be ready to pitch Friday, Hoffman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the day after he suffered a season-ending broken foot,
Young stayed home. Hoffman said Young, who played in only 117 games
this year, would rejoin the team when the Dodgers open their
season-ending homestand against San Diego next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ready for prime time: The Dodgers called up second baseman Mike
Metcalfe from Double-A San Antonio on Tuesday. At the time of the
call-up, Metcalfe was in Phoenix, preparing for the Arizona Fall
League season. He joined the Dodgers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Metcalfe, a 25 year-old second baseman, finished the season with
San Antonio the first week of September. He wasn't expecting to
even be playing because he broke a bone in his lower back in April
and played in only about 60 games at Double-A.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pleasant surprise,'' Metcalfe said of his call-up.
``I was supposed to be out the whole year.''
</P>
<P>
   Season-ending injuries are nothing new to Metcalfe, the Dodgers'
third-round draft choice in 1994 out of the University of Miami. He
played in only two games in '96 before undergoing major surgery on
his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Future plans: The Dodgers released next season's schedule. They
open the 1999 season at home on Monday, April 5, against the
Arizona Diamondbacks, and the Angels and Rangers will play at
Dodger Stadium June 4-9.
</P>

GORDON'S SAVING GRACE A HEALTHY DOSE OF NERVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Here's the unvarnished truth from Red Sox closer Tom
Gordon, minutes after he broke Jeff Reardon's club record for saves
with No. 41 in Wednesday night's 4-3 win over the Baltimore
Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm nervous every day,'' he said. ``Every day. I think that
may be one reason I come to the park so early, to get past it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Boddicker once said to me, `When you're not nervous, it's
time to quit.' There's nothing wrong with being nervous. Just don't
be scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night Gordon admitted his nervous system was on
overload. He tried hard, he said, not to think about the record.
His teammates reminded him of it, he said. So did family and
friends. There were six messages awaiting him when he arrived at
the team's hotel here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only one guy here had 40 saves,'' Gordon said, referring to
Reardon, the bearded one who saved 40 games for the Sox in 1991.
``Now there are two, and only one guy today has 41.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's a blessing. Thank God for that.''
</P>
<P>
   After watching Gordon's dress rehearsal for the role last season
_ he had 11 saves in 13 chances after taking over for the traded
Heathcliff Slocumb _ pitching coach Joe Kerrigan expected big
things from him. He's the one who had sold manager Jimy Williams
and general manager Dan Duquette on the idea and convinced Gordon
it was the best move he could make for his career.
</P>
<P>
   But 41 saves and counting in his first full season on the job?
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sitting around the hotel bar one night this spring,''
Kerrigan said. ``And I don't remember who said it, maybe (Bob)
Schaefer or Sammy (Ellis), but somebody said, `You know, if the guy
gets the opportunity, he can save 40 games.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, when you win 90 games, somebody has a chance to save 40.
So no, it doesn't surprise me. Not the way his work ethic is. Total
concentration.''
</P>
<P>
   The burden of the moment, Gordon admitted, caused him to depart
from his usual approach. He fretted too much about throwing strikes
instead of just throwing his ``nastiest'' stuff.
</P>
<P>
   That changed after he gave up a double to Cal Ripken and singles
to B.J. Surhoff and Lenny Webster, which cut the Oriole deficit to
4-3 and put the tying and winning runs on base.
</P>
<P>
   ``He turned it up to 97 on Becker,'' Kerrigan said, referring to
one of the fastballs Gordon threw pinch hitter Rich Becker, who
struck out for the second out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon then retired Robbie Alomar on a liner to Damon Buford in
center to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad it's over,'' Gordon said. ``I really don't know what
to do. I've never been in this position. Do I buy myself a bottle
of Dom Perignon?''
</P>
<P>
   What he should do, Dennis Eckersley said, is savor the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had a difficult job, especially in Boston,'' Eckersley
said. ``That ballpark is not an easy place to close games out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we wouldn't be where we are without him. He's as
much our MVP as anybody. If he blows four or five games, we're
scuffling.''

BYU, STAR RUNNER JENKINS FIND COMMON GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Ronney Jenkins is the best football player on the
Brigham Young football team coming to play Washington Saturday, and
he's not a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Unusual as that is at BYU, it isn't the most interesting thing
about the third-year sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   Rewind back to the 1995 season on an early November evening in
Oxnard, Calif., about 50 miles up the coast from Los Angeles. Jim
Lane, the athletic director at Hueneme High School, customarily
sought out the 5-foot-11, 170-pound Jenkins to shake the hand of
the star running back and wish him well.
</P>
<P>
   Lane couldn't immediately find him. Jenkins was down in the
opposite end zone, alone with his thoughts before the final game of
his high school career against Oxnard's Rio Mesa High.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you doing down here?'' Lane asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just thinking,'' Jenkins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not cooking up something special here?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to dedicate this game to my grandmother.''
</P>
<P>
   In his office today, Lane fumbles for the USA Today story, which
he has laminated and framed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Write these numbers down,'' Lane says. ``Here they are _ 93,
84, 26, 79, 43, 87, 15.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are the distances Jenkins covered for touchdowns the night
he set a national high school rushing record. He finished with 619
yards on 30 carries, which, if you're going to dedicate a game to
somebody, is a fairly emphatic tribute.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Cobbs, the grandmother, raised Jenkins in the absence of
any significant positive parental influence. She also had a say in
his decision to attend Brigham Young, and more important, in his
choice to stay there, something that will have a major impact on
Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, an intuitive runner with breakaway speed, just sliced
up the Arizona State defense for 171 yards on 30 carries. He is
reputed to have run a 4.3-second 40 and a wind-aided 10.29 in the
100 meters, which is within hailing distance of Ja'Warren Hooker.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to size up Jenkins earlier this week, UW coach Jim
Lambright shot a bemused look at the reporter and said, ``He's a
pretty damn good running back.''
</P>
<P>
   LaVell Edwards, the longtime BYU coach, thinks so, too. At a
school so accustomed to throwing, he is delighted with a runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he stays healthy,'' Edwards said, ``I think he's going to
be as good as anyone around.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington had an interest in Jenkins three years ago, as did a
lot of schools when they got word of a 600-yard game. But he lacked
a qualifying test score, a fact that made the local paper.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day Lane got a call from a retired college professor
named Meredith Moyers. She had read of Jenkins' plight and said she
had had success in counseling such students. She was telling Lane
she could guarantee Jenkins would conquer his test with six weeks'
preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We corraled him every day for six weeks for an hour over lunch
break,'' Lane says. ``He got an 890 (needing only 700) on the
test.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, everybody but BYU, Arizona and Arizona State had
abandoned him. He picked BYU, brushing off the adjustment it would
require.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came on my trip, I felt comfortable, I guess,'' Jenkins
said this week. ``My grandmother wanted me to come here. I felt
good about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In one season, Jenkins set the Western Athletic Conference on
its ear. He rushed for 733 yards, scored 11 touchdowns and was the
WAC's freshman of the year. BYU had never seen anything like him.
</P>
<P>
   Then the tough times hit. In the spring of 1997, BYU found
Jenkins in violation of the school's honor code, bound to the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. It is believed that he
had attended a function at which alcohol was served.
</P>
<P>
   Going to BYU had already proved tough for a black athlete from
Southern California. Now it would demand everything he had.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a little bitter about it,'' Lane says.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins says he had his bags packed. Schools would call Hueneme
inquiring about Jenkins and word would get back to him about what
was available.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were probably 50 colleges calling when they ran the
story that he was going to sit out,'' says the Hueneme coach, Larry
Miller. ``No question everybody and his brother wanted him. And you
know, he was talking to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins says he spoke to Arizona State, USC and Colorado, and
``I was going to talk to Washington but I didn't get a chance to.''
</P>
<P>
   His grandmother advised him to stay put.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel good about running away from what I had done,''
Jenkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins is proud of his resilience. Still, he doesn't minimize
the difficulty of a black at BYU.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just different,'' he said. ``Coming from another
environment, you have to just change. It's hard to grow up one way
all your life and change to a whole different lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for black athletes here. You get so much attention;
everybody knows who you are. You can't do things you normally would
do at home.''
</P>
<P>
   With Jenkins, BYU is a different team. The Cougars have run the
ball 93 times this year, passed it 51. They splashed him on the
cover of their media guide this year, suspension or not. And it
might be that Jenkins is headed for the same destination of his
favorite running back, a player an hour up the coast from Oxnard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say I have a running style similar to him,''
Jenkins says, referring to ex-Husky Napoleon Kaufman, now with the
Oakland Raiders. ``I like him a lot. I talked to a him a couple of
times, when I was being recruited by Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   So there's this tip for Husky fans: If you see Jenkins off by
himself sometime in pregame warmups Saturday, be suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   IF, ANDS, MUTTS: UW linebacker Lester Towns had his foot stepped
on late in Wednesday's practice and Lambright said he would be
reevaluated Thursday. It appears that Towns will be OK. ...
Slotback Dane Looker stayed out of practice again with a thigh
bruise but Lambright said the junior transfer felt better.

RED SOX PUT CLAMPS ON ORIOLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The ninth inning may have seemed like an eternity
and the eighth inning only a little shorter, but after two straight
wins, the Red Sox are making pages fly off the calendar again, with
October dead ahead.
</P>
<P>
   With cardiac units on alert from Block Island to Old Orchard
Beach, closer Tom Gordon gave up a ninth-inning run on three
straight hits and put the tying and winning runs on base with one
out but recovered for his club-record 41st save in the Red Sox' 4-3
win over the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   The win, Bret Saberhagen's 14th of the season, preserved the
Sox' four-game lead over the Toronto Blue Jays, 2-1 winners over
Detroit Wednesday night, in the American League wild-card race. It
also reduced to eight the Red Sox' magic number for a playoff berth
with a dozen games left.
</P>
<P>
   Any combination of Sox wins or Blue Jay losses totaling eight
and Boston will be in the playoffs for the first time since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But those pleasantries meant little in the ninth inning after
Cal Ripken doubled off the center-field fence, B.J. Surhoff singled
him home, and Lenny Webster followed with another base hit, all
with one out.
</P>
<P>
   Was Jimy Williams nervous?
</P>
<P>
   ``He should have been,'' said Gordon, who had entered in the
eighth and retired Rafael Palmeiro on one pitch after the one
batter Dennis Eckersley faced, Eric Davis, bounced into a double
play with runners on first and second and nobody out.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the most I've sweated in a long time,'' Gordon added.
``I mean, it was hot out there (95 degrees at game time), but it
wasn't that hot.''
</P>
<P>
   How hot was it? It was so hot, Eckersley was sweating, too, and
he was sitting in the air-conditioned visitors' clubhouse at Oriole
Park at Camden Yards, where a crowd of 42,676 was imploring its
team not to lose here for the first time this season against the
Sons of Jimy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was not an easy win,'' said the Eck, who is now within
three of tying Hoyt Wilhelm for most career pitching appearances
(1,070). ``It was tough to watch that last inning. I'd rather be
doing it than watch it.''
</P>
<P>
   The doing was left to Gordon, after a visit from pitching coach
Joe Kerrigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I came in with a two-run lead, this was the
biggest game I've pitched in,'' said Gordon. ``I was so nervous. It
meant something to me. It meant something to my teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a chance to win two in a row, and I had a chance to
break a record.''
</P>
<P>
   Mission accomplished on both scores. Gordon struck out pinch
hitter Rich Becker _ with one fastball clocked at 97 miles an hour,
according to Kerrigan _ then induced Robbie Alomar to line out to
center. He thus broke Jeff Reardon's 7-year-old club mark and tied
Jose Mesa's 1995 major league record for consecutive saves in a
season with his 38th.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is awesome,'' said Eckersley, one of four relievers to
pitch in the eighth after Saberhagen allowed just two runs on six
hits, including Mike Bordick's 13th home run, and one walk in 6 2/3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking how if I had stayed in St. Louis, we would have
been playing the last month of the season with not much happening
(McGwire, si; playoffs, no). It would have been a drag. It would
have been hard to say goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this makes it exciting. Last winter, it was like, `I want
to play for Boston. I hope they have a good year.' Hey, just roll
'em.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight game, the Red Sox rolled out their bats,
too. They had 14 hits, their most in 22 games and the first time in
a dozen games they've reached double figures.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra had two doubles and a single and scored two
runs; Troy O'Leary had three singles, scored one run, and drove in
another; and rookie Trot Nixon, Williams's fourth leadoff hitter in
four nights, had two singles and scored a run.
</P>
<P>
   The game was close only because the Red Sox left the bases
loaded twice and stranded 11 runners in all. But they scored enough
for Saberhagen, who has won more games than in any season since
1994 and made more starts (29) than in any season in the last 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do the job well is a great feeling,'' said Saberhagen, who
received highlight-reel help from rookie second baseman Donnie
Sadler, who somehow speared Webster's bad-hop ground ball while
falling backward with two on and two out in the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time since I've pitched a meaningful game in
September. I did in 1995 with the Rockies, but my arm was already
blown out.''
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong with his arm _ or his heart _ now.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see why he won all those awards early in his career,
can't you?'' Williams said. ``The way he competes?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a tribute to the man _ and I mean the man _ on that
mound.''

ERSTAD MIGHT LIMP BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Darin Erstad's strained left hamstring has
not yet healed, but it's improved to the point where he could be in
the lineup tonight against Texas, manager Terry Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad, who hurt the hamstring for the second time this season
on Sept. 2, pinch hit in the ninth inning Wednesday and struck out
on three pitches against Rangers closer John Wetteland.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy's not going to be 100 percent,'' Collins said. ``But
90 percent of Darin Erstad is still very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad, though, probably isn't even 90 percent. He says he still
can't run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can make the plays and do what it takes to do the job at
first base,'' Erstad said, ``but when it comes to going from second
to home or first to third, I can't. It's all about being able to
run. Stealing a base is something I'm not going to be able to do
the rest of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins told Erstad he doesn't want him to do too much too soon
because he might aggravate the injury and lose the rest of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that after this series we have 10 games left,
including six at home and three more against these guys (the
Rangers),'' Collins said. ``I told him, `I have to have you for
that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After Erstad tests the hamstring in warmups this afternoon,
Collins will consult with trainers and Erstad before making a
decision. ``I think you can figure out what my input's going to
be,'' Erstad said. ``But I'm also not going to lie to him. I'm
going to tell him what I can do. I'm not going to hurt the team in
any way.''
</P>
<P>
   Newsprint fodder: The Dallas Morning News previewed the
Angels-Rangers series with a large headline proclaiming: ``Edge:
Rangers.''
</P>
<P>
   The story, which quoted anonymous scouts and a manager saying
the Rangers were the favorites, made its way into the Angels
clubhouse and was posted. A similar story, from USA Today, was also
clipped and posted.
</P>
<P>
   Many lines from both stories were highlighted, including one
that read: ``The Angels greet September like a turkey greets
November.'' A quote from a scout said closer Troy Percival has a
tendency to get ``goofy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know he's goofy,'' shortstop Gary DiSarcina said. ``Now
the whole world knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Angels said the stories didn't bother them _ ``I
don't care what they write,'' DiSarcina said _ but Collins, when
asked if the stories made the Angels angry, said, ``I hope it does.
You've got to play the game angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence reports: To prepare for this series, the Angels
sent four scouts _ typically they send one _ to follow the Rangers
on their last road trip to Tampa Bay and Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did an outstanding job,'' Collins said, ``but the games
are played by human beings. You've still got to play the game. We
know every way there is to get Juan Gonzalez out, but if you don't
get the ball where you're supposed to, he's going to hit a home
run.''
</P>
<P>
   Emergency help: With Charlie O'Brien breaking his right index
finger Tuesday night and being lost for the season, the Angels
today will activate catcher Ben Molina to serve as their third
catcher. Molina split time this season at Double-A Midland and
Triple-A Vancouver.

SOSA SLAMS 63D 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Put Sammy Sosa back in the record book. The Catch-Up
Kid from Chicago has done it again.
</P>
<P>
   He waited until the eighth inning Wednesday night to wave his
magic wand at Qualcomm Stadium. But when he did, it resulted in his
63d home run of the season, tying Mark McGwire of the St. Louis
Cardinals for the major league lead _ and all-time season record.
Just as important to Sosa, it came with the bases loaded off
reliever Brian Boehringer to break a 2-2 tie and give the Cubs a
6-3 victory that enabled them to retain their half-game lead over
the Mets in the race for the National League wild-card playoff
berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think 62, 63 are pretty good for me,'' Sosa said. ``Now I
want to take my team to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I feel great. The game tonight was unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Even McGwire would have been proud of this wallop. Once it left
Sosa's bat, the only question was how far out it would go. It
landed an estimated 434 feet away in the second deck, only the 22d
ball to reach that area in stadium history. The San Diego crowd of
49,891 saluted Sosa with a standing ovation that lasted two
minutes. Even then, they weren't satisfied until he took a curtain
call.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa was on fire. The homer was his third hit of the night. He
singled in the second but was stranded. In the seventh, he broke a
scoreless tie with a double to left with the bases loaded, giving
Chicago a 2-0 lead. But it lasted only until the bottom of the
inning when Cubs lefthander Terry Mulholland gave up two runs.
</P>
<P>
   The home run was preceded by two hits and a walk. Tyler Houston
led off with a single. With one out, Red Sox short-timer Orlando
Merced singled to center. The Padres brought in lefthander Mark
Langston to replace Dan Miceli, and he walked Lance Johnson,
loading the bases. Boehringer replaced Langston, and Houston was
forced at the plate on a grounder to short for the second out. That
brought up Sosa, who crushed a 1-0 pitch and boosted his RBI total
to a major league-leading 154.
</P>
<P>
   The blast was the latest installment in Sosa's bid to rewrite
recent history. Only eight days before, he seemingly was consigned
to a supporting role behind McGwire, whose 62d homer Sept. 8 _ in
St. Louis against the Cubs _ eclipsed Roger Maris's 37-year-old
mark. As the first man to cross that threshold, McGwire won
nationwide adulation. Sosa, stuck on 58 home runs, appeared to be a
footnote.
</P>
<P>
   But along came the Milwaukee Brewers, a club against whom he'd
hit six home runs previously, and Sosa started firing back at
McGwire. He hit No. 59 last Friday, his 60th Saturday, and on
Sunday, he outdid himself.
</P>
<P>
   He hit No. 61 off Bronswell Patrick, and in the ninth inning, he
tagged righthander Eric Plunk for No. 62, tying McGwire and
renewing the battle royale the two have waged for months.
</P>
<P>
   Then he took his quest to San Diego. The first night was a
disaster. The Cubs lost, 4-3, and Sosa struck out a season-high
four times. On Tuesday in a 4-2 win, he went 1 for 4, a
seventh-inning single that launched the decisive rally. But in St.
Louis, McGwire struck for No. 63, inching back in front.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no denying Sosa Wednesday night. When he took the
field, he knew that McGwire had been shut out, going 0 for 3 with a
walk. And after warming up with a couple of hits, he staged the
grand finale.
</P>
<P>
   And away they go. Again.

GLOVER, HABIB BRING STABILITY TO SEAHAWKS' OFFENSIVE LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ The question loomed before Warren Moon like a
pair of 315-pound defensive tackles: What is his biggest concern
entering Sunday's game against the Washington Redskins?
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two guys inside. They really can clog up the middle,''
the Seahawks quarterback said after practice Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the $57 million question. That's what the Redskins doled
out in free agency this offseason to sign those two defensive
tackles _ Dana Stubblefield, NFL defensive player of the year last
season while with the 49ers; and Dan Wilkinson, the first pick
overall in the 1994 draft by the Cincinnati Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks will match these two with their own free-agent
acquisitions _ center Kevin Glover, the NFC Pro Bowl starter the
past three seasons; and guard Brian Habib, a starter on the Denver
Broncos' Super Bowl team last season.
</P>
<P>
   Glover was signed away from the Detroit Lions in February after
Kevin Mawae jumped to the New York Jets. Habib was added two weeks
later to solidify a position where three different players started
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of made that line complete,'' Stubblefield said of
Glover and Habib stepping in between left tackle Walter Jones, left
guard Pete Kendall and right tackle Howard Ballard. ``If you look
at them on film and how well they play together, you think, `Well
these guys have been together for more than one, two, three
years.'''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they've been together since April, when the Seahawks
held the first of their four minicamps. Then came a month of
training camp and five preseason games. It was extra time well
spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went out and found the best guys we could get,'' offensive
line coach Gregg Smith said. ``The thing about Kevin and Brian is
that they're smart, they understand things very well and they blend
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Experience helps. Glover is in his 13th NFL season, but when he
first joined the team after 12 years in Detroit he had Kendall to
help him with the line calls. Habib is in his 11th season and still
leans on Ballard when one of the five offenses he learned at
Minnesota and Denver collides with terminology in the Seahawks'
offense.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to know how well Glover and Habib are playing, ask
each about the other, not themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin is the consummate pro,'' said Habib, who downplays his
own contributions. ``He's stepped in here like he's known the
offense forever. He makes all the right calls, does all the right
techniques. It's just great to play next to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The first thing anyone notices about the 6-foot-2, 282-pound
Glover is how active he is. He might be 35, but Glover displays his
quickness on almost every play, and his speed has even his
teammates shaking their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``He runs around out there like a 20-year-old kid,'' Habib said.
``I can't keep up with him, and I'm three years younger than he
is.''
</P>
<P>
   As for being a leader, Glover was elected an offensive
co-captain along with Moon.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-7, 299-pound Habib made his first big impression in the
weight room. This spring, he lifted 325 pounds a team-high 19
times.
</P>
<P>
   Told that Habib was less than complementary when asked for a
self-assessment, Glover smiled and offered, ``Ask any lineman and
we feel that way. You're always searching for the perfect game.
Brian is doing real well.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ricky Watters was finding little room to run in the first
half of Sunday's game against the Arizona Cardinals, Glover and
Habib were there between series. They told Watters not to get down.
They explained what was happening, and what would happen if they
continued to pound away. Watters finished with 105 yards, with 63
coming in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like them because they talk to me a lot during the
game. So I know what they're doing up front as well as what I want
to do back there,'' Watters said. ``They are great players. Through
the league, they have tons of respect. And they're guys who are
obviously students of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon also has grown to appreciate the two newest additions to a
line that has been in constant change for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little surprised at how quickly they've come together,''
Moon said. ``The offensive line is a tough position to break into
and have that cohesiveness. So that's the thing that surprises me.
Not so much that they've picked up what we're doing, but how well
they're all playing together.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon last year, and now Glover, Habib and Watters. Addition by
addition.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Ricky back there and with Warren back there, who's really
handling things,'' Stubblefield said, ``I think they completed that
offense.''

GALAXY BEATS CLASH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE _ The Los Angeles Galaxy has no idea who it will oppose
when Major League Soccer's playoffs kick off in a few weeks, but
the team learned Wednesday night who it won't be.
</P>
<P>
   With a gritty, 1-0 shootout victory over San Jose, the Galaxy
(23-7, 65 points) eliminated the Clash (11-19, 27) from postseason
consideration for the second successive year and trimmed its list
of possible playoff foes to three: Colorado, Dallas or Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't all the Galaxy gained from an otherwise meaningless
triumph before 15,893 at Spartan Stadium. With San Jose playing for
survival, the Galaxy found itself in an intensely tight battle that
will do more for its playoff preparations than any 5-0 rout could.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clash played us very tough,'' said Paul Caligiuri, one of
four Galaxy shooters to connect in the tiebreaker. ``It was a good
game to get that playoff mentality, that playoff atmosphere. They
were playing for everything, and although we didn't need a point,
didn't need a victory, it kept us honest and prepared us for the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the primary purpose of these final regular-season games,
and there was much for the Galaxy to be pleased with in that
regard.
</P>
<P>
   Goalkeeper Kevin Hartman turned in another superb performance,
notching his sixth shutout of the season. The defense, without
suspended captain Robin Fraser, allowed the Clash few decent
chances. And a vibrant midfield passing game enabled L.A. to
dictate terms much of the match, even if the strategy led to few
true scoring opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy managed just three shots on target, with only Danny
Pena's header off a 49th-minute Cobi Jones corner kick causing any
trouble. Wade Barrett cleared it off the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Jose came to play with everything they had, but we matched
their intensity ...,'' said L.A. coach Octavio Zambrano. ``Without
anything at stake, this team wouldn't lay down and take a loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the credit for that goes to Hartman, who made two diving
stops on Ronald Cerritos -- one with little more than a minute to
play -- and the crossbar, which got in the way of a John Doyle
header in the 77th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team could find the net until the shootout, which L.A.
won, 4-3. Jones, Caligiuri, Welton and Mauricio Cienfuegos
connected for the Galaxy, but Hartman took the ball off Victor
Mella's feet on San Jose's first attempt, and Cerritos fired wide
on the decisive kick.
</P>
<P>
   GALAXY NOTES: L.A. called up midfielder Eric Chaisongkram from
the A League's San Diego Flash late Tuesday to bolster a roster
missing five players from suspension (Robin Fraser, Clint Mathis),
injury (Ezra Hendrickson, Wellington Sanchez) and international
duty (Martin Machon). Chaisongkram, a former UCLA standout, started
19 of 28 games for the Flash. ... Carlos Hermosillo served as
Galaxy captain in Robin Fraser's absence. ... Lawrence Lozzano made
his Galaxy debut at right back and saw 75 minutes of action. ...
The Clash were without striker Eric Wynalda (strained right calf).

   OAKLAND, Calif. _ The American League West is the only four-team
division in baseball, and the best thing about that might be on
display now. Only AL West teams get to play exclusively within
their division the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim Angels and Texas Rangers are doing battle in
Arlington, tied in pursuit of a playoff spot. The Mariners and
Oakland Athletics? They got together before 12,371 at the Oakland
Coliseum Wednesday night, with the keys to the basement the booby
prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to finish in the cellar,'' said left-hander
Jeff Fassero, who pitched the M's to a 4-1 win that kept them out
of last place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think these games are important, especially against
Anaheim and Texas. We could decide one of two (contenders') fates.
It's going to be a big last 10-11 games for us.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's true for the Mariners as a team, it's also true for
Fassero personally. Fassero lost seven straight decisions before
beating the Royals with eight strong innings last Friday. He hasn't
had a losing record since his rookie season of 1991, and he evened
his mark at 12-12 Thursday by working 72/3 innings, allowing one
run on four hits and no walks.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero said he had all three of his pitches working, and made
hitters hit his pitches by staying ahead in the count. At one point
Thursday, he retired 22 of 23 A's.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to be above .500 and somewhere around 15
wins,'' Fassero said. ``I have two starts left so obviously I can
only get to 14, but if I pitch like I did tonight, maybe I can get
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassero's thinking 14, Alex Rodriguez is thinking 40/40 and Ken
Griffey, Jr., is done thinking 50/20.
</P>
<P>
   While Rodriguez went hitless in four at-bats and still is one
homer from joining the 40 homer/40 stolen base club, Griffey stole
his 20th base to become the third player in history with 50 homers
and 20 steals.
</P>
<P>
   The M's center fielder stole second in the eighth _ putting
himself in position to score the Mariners' final run _ and joined
Willie Mays (1955) and Brady Anderson (1996) as the only players to
go 50/20.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to make a big deal, because I enjoy playing
baseball,'' said Griffey, who has 52 homers. ``If you stay healthy
and be consistent, things happen. You have to be consistent and
take what they give you.''
</P>
<P>
   For Griffey, it was the second milestone in as many days.
Tuesday in Minnesota, he became the fourth youngest player to drive
in 1,000 runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you take for granted the things he does,'' manager
Lou Piniella said. ``But I played, so I know how hard it is to do
the things he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakland right-hander Gil Heredia made things hard on everyone
for awhile yesterday, retiring the first 12 Mariners in order. But
Edgar Martinez greeted him in the fourth by ripping a homer off the
facing of the second deck. It was Martinez's 28th homer _ one off
his 1995 career high _ and gave the Mariners a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez would add two more hits and another RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Martinez has a future with the Mariners, Piniella said
yesterday, but it probably will be in a slightly different role.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have until Nov. 1 to pick up their $3.5 million
option on the 35-year-old designated hitter, and Piniella said
Martinez would be back next year. He'll need to play some first
base, however, which would free up the DH spot to give other
players days off now and then.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm open to that,'' said Martinez, who has played their
briefly this year. ``It's for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   What Martinez doesn't know is if he'll need surgery on his left
knee, which has some cartilage damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to think about surgery sometime soon, so I can get
ready for spring training,'' Martinez said. ``But we haven't
decided if it's going to be surgery or not. We're still talking
about it.''

CLINTON SEX SCANDAL CREATES CAPITAL CONFUSION 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The world of Washington _ where life is scripted
and orchestrated like a Broadway play _ has become suddenly,
unpleasantly confused. No one in the cast seems to know his lines,
and the directors haven't a clue how the story might end.
</P>
<P>
   Following independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report, routine
legislative work continues, with its scuffles over spending bills
and its debates over tax cuts and health care. But everything now
occurs under a surreal cloud that is part fear, part opportunism,
part distaste and part disillusionment, all mixed up in a vapor of
genuine bafflement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here 17 years, and I've never seen anything remotely
like this,'' said a GOP House committee aide. ``No one has any idea
what's going to happen now. No one has been in this situation
before. It's unsettled and fluid, and no one can really know what
effect this is going to have on normal business around here, except
that it's going to be large.''
</P>
<P>
   Said an environmental lobbyist and former Democratic House aide:
``It's like finding a big pile of dog doo-doo in your yard and you
step in it and you've got this mess to deal with. Where the analogy
falls apart is that you just don't know what to do next.''
</P>
<P>
   Most members of Congress seem determined to go on with business,
partly because they must but also because committee rooms and floor
debates provide a haven from a political theater where neither
polls nor principles provide obvious guidance.
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report's lurid if not pornographic accusations against
President Clinton _ and low hanky-panky is not unknown in Congress'
own hallowed halls _ revolve primarily around Clinton's grand jury
testimony in a case involving not the affairs of state, but an
affair.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations hover in a bizarre netherworld, between the
Constitution's ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' that would provide
grounds for impeachment of a president and lies about an illicit
affair that by itself had little to do with the public's business.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, many House members find nothing murky about perjury.
Maverick Ohio Democrat James Traficant declared on the House floor
Tuesday: ``If Joe Q. Citizen lied to a grand jury, he'd go to jail.
Lying is perjury, perjury is a crime . . . Does America now have
two legal standards, one for you, one for me? One for he, one for
she? . . . One for presidents, one for residents? . . . An America
with two legal standards is an America with no legal standards.''
</P>
<P>
   But even some Republicans hesitate to compare Clinton's alleged
lies with former President Richard Nixon's, who resigned before an
almost certain impeachment. ``I don't think he's crossed the line
that Nixon had crossed yet, but he's getting very close,'' said
Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Most Democrats crave a quick end to the scandal, possibly
through a vote to censure Clinton. Most Republicans simply say they
will follow the ``process'' _ Washington's code word for the
seldom-tested path toward possible impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But that process is hardly clear. There is no specific
definition of high crimes and misdemeanors, and impeachment, most
agree, is ultimately a political act.
</P>
<P>
   With congressional elections a month and a half away, and
Clinton's troubles dominating political discourse, escape is
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are trying to grapple with finding a solution when
there does not seem to be a ready solution,'' said a Senate
Democratic aide. ``It's very tough. A lot of people are very
disillusioned. There is important legislative agenda still to be
accomplished, and it's tough to figure out a way to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Hellman, lead House lobbyist for the National Federation
of Independent Business, said, ``Every time I see a member, they
want to talk about tax cuts and spending bills, not the Monica
stuff. They talk about it because other people want to talk about
it, but the rank and file and the leadership don't really want to
talk about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Moderate Democrats, who are most closely allied with Clinton,
are deeply frustrated. ``At what point is this essentially allowed
to obliterate any kind of policy discussions in the country for the
foreseeable future?'' asked Ed Kilore, political director for the
centrist Democratic Leadership Council, a group Clinton helped
form. ``At what point do we go from what some are calling a
constitutional crisis, to a real political crisis? The public would
sort of like their elected representatives to govern.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservative activist Grover Norquist, president of Americans
for Tax Reform, is gleefully sounding the death knell for new
Democrats _ who include such moderates as Ellen Tauscher of Walnut
Creek, Calif. _ now that their leader is crippled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 10 to 20 Democrats in the House and the three to five in
the Senate who are going to lose in November are the people who ran
in rural, suburban, Southern and Western districts who can no
longer survive as those districts move Republican and their party
is seen as hewing left,'' Norquist said.
</P>
<P>
   Norquist, who has close ties with GOP House leaders, also
predicts a more aggressive Republican agenda on the Hill. ``Nobody
is afraid that Bill Clinton will get up and give five speeches and
change the topic of debate,'' Norquist said. ``Before, a few
Clinton speeches could move voters. And for Republicans to get
through the Clinton message cost millions of dollars in
advertising. This time around, that just isn't an option.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Democrats are simply furious. Clinton's problems may
well torpedo their chances to take back the House and restore their
powerful committee chairs that help set national policy on
everything from airline regulation to the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats are angry, and they're going to wonder just how much
they want to come to bat for the president,'' said an aide to a
high-ranking House Democrat. ``They have to decide what's in
Congress' best interest and what's in the president's best
interest, and it's not necessarily the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate end of the Clinton drama, whether bodice-ripper
comedy or constitutional tragedy, will not be known for some time.
``Nature abhors a vacuum, but politics doesn't,'' said John Pitney,
a political scientist at Claremont-McKenna College in Los Angeles
County. ``We may be looking ahead to two years of nothingness.
These are strange days.''

   The number of cool gadgets for home businesses is growing. The
September issue of Small Business Computing takes a quick look at
some of the interesting ones recently released. Among them is the
Novatel Minstrel, an 8-ounce modem for the PalmPilot. The Minstrel
slips around the PalmPilot to create a new device no bigger than a
cellular phone. It enables the PalmPilot to receive e-mail and surf
the Web. A big difference between the Minstrel and a cellular phone
is the price. The Minstrel costs $400. Another product discussed is
a slender little black box called Symphony. It enables users to
wirelessly share files, printers and faxes, as well as connect to
the Internet. Made by Proxim, it retails for $299.
</P>
<P>
   No longer are affluent white males the typical Net users. Users
now are as varied as the country's population. At least that's the
conclusion of a special report in the September issue of Yahoo!
Internet Life. The magazine found that nearly 52 million people are
online. The article features interviews with a varied group of
surfers including students, comedians, park rangers and truck
drivers.

   War game simulations are becoming increasingly realistic. A new
example is ``Spearhead,'' a desert tank game just released by
Interactive Magic. You play a platoon leader in the 3rd Armored
Division. Your platoon is part of Operation Removal, a U.S.
campaign to repel Libyan invaders from Tunisia in North Africa. The
game includes 20 single-player missions and one big campaign. The
tanks and other armored vehicles look like their counterparts in
real life. You can also play the game over the Internet or a
network. The game is available only for PCs with Windows 95 or
higher operating systems and retails for $39.95.
</P>
<P>
   Broderbund Software is releasing a trio of new learning games
using Dr. Seuss characters. Designed for young children, the games
are ``Dr. Seuss Preschool,'' ``Dr. Seuss Kindergarten'' and ``Dr.
Seuss Kindergarten Deluxe.'' Each title includes 250 lessons in
math and reading. The lessons are taught through more than 50 Seuss
characters, who sing original songs and act in the various
activities and games. The first two games retail for $19.99, while
the deluxe game is $29.99.

   Now you can read Consumer Reports' exhaustive reviews online.
The venerable product rating organization has put most of its

 &HT;    Smaller packages pack more PC power
 &HT;    By John Ghirardini
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thin is in these days, and computer manufacturers looking to
fatten their wallets haven't let that fact go unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   IBM and Toshiba have unveiled new desktop machines, aimed at the
high-end consumer and the mid-range commercial markets, that look
almost anorexic when compared with the squat computer cases and
bulky monitors that weigh down many work spaces.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers who must have the fastest and latest, IBM has
topped its Aptiva line with the SE7, which features a 450 MHz Intel
Pentium II MMX chip, 128 megabytes of RAM expandable to 384 megs, a
16.8 gigabyte hard drive, a DVD-ROM drive, a 56K modem and a pair
of Infinity speakers.
</P>
<P>
   To save space, IBM offers a 15-inch flat-panel LCD monitor that
offers the viewable area of a 17-inch standard monitor. The SE7 is
available with either a 17- or 19-inch standard CRT, but the basic
configuration has a purposeful, futuristic look about it that
technophiles will find hard to resist.
</P>
<P>
   Retail price is $2,399 without monitor; the choice of monitor
will raise the price to around $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   For commercial users, there's the new Toshiba Equium 100, which
has a 300 MHz Pentium II chip, 64 megabytes of RAM, a 4 gigabyte
hard drive, a CD-ROM drive and a built-in networking capability.
The entire setup takes up less desk space than a single standard
17-inch monitor, Toshiba says.
</P>
<P>
   Crowning it all is a 15-inch digital LCD monitor with integrated
speakers, a built-in microphone and built-in jacks for headphones
and mike input and output.
</P>
<P>
   The screen can swivel to a 90-degree vertical or horizontal
viewing angle, allowing large documents or spreadsheets to be seen
in either portrait or landscape mode.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for the Equium 100 begin at $2,999.
</P>
<P>
   Go forth and utilize
</P>
<P>
   The popular AltaVista search site on the Internet is trying to
make it easier to find information.
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista Discovery, a free utility program, is now available
for downloading at http://altavista.digital.com. The program lets
users search in both local and public domains without changing
applications _ including the Internet, e-mail and more than 100
document and file types that may be lurking on the computer's hard
drive.
</P>
<P>
   The utility will highlight key words, summarize page content,
find similar pages, identify Web sites referring to a particular
page, offer a list of other sites with relevant information and
show a complete listing of all pages from the same site as the page
being viewed.
</P>
<P>
   Installing the program produces a customizable toolbar that
attaches itself to the browser, giving access to AltaVista Search
from anywhere on the Net. Users then can switch to look at e-mail
or documents on the hard drive that contain the same selected
search string.
</P>
<P>
   The software requires Windows 95, 98 or NT, 16 megabytes of RAM,
24 megs of disk space and Netscape Navigator 3.0 or later or
Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 or later.
</P>
<P>
   One-on-one instruction
</P>
<P>
   Kids 3 to 7 can combine learning and fun with a new product from
Microsoft, ``My Personal Tutor: Preschool-First Grade'' for Windows
95.
</P>
<P>
   The software features a new Tutor Assist learning technology,
which according to Microsoft recognizes when a child needs help
with a concept, then offers a multimedia tutorial to help the child
understand.
</P>
<P>
   The software comes in a suite of four CD-ROMs, all featuring
Professor P.T. Presto, who guides children through tutorials with
music, animation and humor. The CDs contain hundreds of songs,
games, activities and characters designed to foster confidence,
curiosity, exploration and learning, Microsoft says.
</P>
<P>
   The four titles are:
</P>
<P>
   ``Preschool Workshop'' (ages 3-5), in which kids learn shapes,
colors, counting and other skills while helping friendly jungle
animals build toys;
</P>
<P>
   ``Alphabet Playhouse'' (ages 3-5), which highlights letter
recognition, uppercase and lowercase letters and pre-reading skills
with Rosy Raccoon;
</P>
<P>
   ``Reader Railway'' (ages 4-6), which focuses on vocabulary and
reading comprehension during a trip to the circus with Rosy
Raccoon's cousin Rusty; and
</P>
<P>
   ``Mathopolis'' (ages 5-7), in which kids hone their thinking and
problem-solving while developing addition and subtraction skills in
five fast-paced games.
</P>
<P>
   The software will be available in late September for a retail
price of $55. A free trial version has been available since Sept.
10 at http://www.microsoft.com/kids/.

 &HT;    Voice recognition software takes work
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was my hope, going into this series on voice recognition
programs, that at some point I would be able to announce that this
column was written without the need for a keyboard. Regrettably,
that will not be the case _ although, if I had all the time in the
world and a lot of inclination, it might be done.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, it is possible for any of you with an Internet
connection to try out this technology at little or no expense,
depending on whether you have a suitable microphone.
</P>
<P>
   FreeSpeech from Philips is a shareware program you can download
for free and try for 30 days. After that, it will cost you $40 to
get a key to keep it going.
</P>
<P>
   FreeSpeech is certainly the cheapest of the voice recognition
programs I've tried, but I find it to be at least the equal of
IBM's ViaVoice Gold, to which it is very similar. Both programs
used several different modes _ command for editing and controlling
programs, dictation for doing just that, plus spelling and other
modes. They are intended to work with virtually any Windows 95 or
NT program.
</P>
<P>
   I spent the usual amount of time ``enrolling'' in FreeSpeech _
that is, reading text it presented to familiarize it with my voice
and speech patterns. This was more enjoyable than either of the
preceding programs because Philips gives you a wide choice of
things to read. I chose the best part of the best horror story ever
written _ Jonathan Harker's diary of his trip through Transylvania
and his stay at that most unpleasant place, Castle Dracula.
</P>
<P>
   I then tested FreeSpeech by dictating my favorite sentence:
``Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their
country.'' FreeSpeech could not distinguish between ``come'' and
``comma.'' It kept inserting a comma when I said ``come.''
</P>
<P>
   You can feed the program text documents you have already written
in order to further familiarize it with your style, or at least
with the language. I gave it a handful of documents to look at and
pushed the Recognition slider from the halfway mark between
``speed'' and ``accuracy'' somewhat into the area of greater
accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Bingo! Now I get punctuation when I say ``comma'' and I get
``come'' when I say ``come.'' However, only three words further
down the line another problem arose. FreeSpeech was unable to
comprehend ``aid.'' It gave me ``ate'' and ``eight,'' but no aid.
At that point someone knocked on the door, sending our dog into his
savage beast act. FreeSpeech nearly came unglued _ ``Please
repeat!'' ``Please repeat!'' it demanded. Finally, it translated
the dog's last statement as ``all.'' The thing couldn't even get
``arf.''
</P>
<P>
   I have no doubt that with further effort, I could teach it the
word ``aid.'' Unfortunately, I have no patience with teaching a
machine. I'd rather type anyway.
</P>
<P>
   For the FreeSpeech test, I used Philips' SpeechMike, a sharp
departure from the flimsy headsets supplied with the previous two
programs. It's a sturdy hand-held gizmo that contains a speaker, a
microphone, a little trackball for running the mouse, left and
right buttons, and another right-clicking button on the underside,
right where your forefinger normally falls. I liked it a great
deal. Of course, it costs around $70, probably more than five times
what the headsets cost.
</P>
<P>
   If your primary goal is to work with Microsoft Word, then L&AMP;H's
Voice Xpress Plus, at $69, is the way to go. If you want to work
less extensively with a lot of different programs, give FreeSpeech
a try. IBM has upgraded its ViaVoice in configurations from $50 to
$150, and I will re-review that program soon. Just remember, if you
choose any of these, you're in for a lot of work to make it
worthwhile.

 &HT;    Improved Find feature important part of OS 8.5
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apple Computer plans to release its next update to the Mac
operating system in less than a month, and it looks like a keeper.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed OS 8.5, this upgrade not only speeds up basic performance
but adds several important features. Those include a greatly
enhanced Find feature and the ability to customize the look of the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of this OS upgrade is lots of new code written
specifically for the PowerPC chip that runs all new Macs. That code
enables Power Macs to run an average of 30 percent faster. Actions
that will run faster include copying files, searching and emptying
the trash can.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is you can't use this upgrade if your computer is
not a Power Mac. That includes such models as the SE, Centris, LC,
IIsi and Classic.
</P>
<P>
   In OS 8.5, Apple Computer has totally rewritten its Find
feature. It will now be able to search for content within files.
And what's found will be sorted by relevance, with the closest
match listed first.
</P>
<P>
   The new Find feature will also let you search the Internet
without a browser. Of course, you'll still need a modem and an
Internet provider to access the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Another great new feature is the ability of the OS now to check
and repair itself. It won't catch and fix every problem but is
designed to identify the most common ones. This feature used to be
a separate program called Disk First Aid. Now it has been built
into the OS.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the changes in OS 8.5 are cosmetic tweaks that make the
Mac more fun and easier to use. For example, Apple Computer will
now allow you to customize the look of your screen. You can choose
among themes that change the look of scroll bars, arrows and title
boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer will supply two new theme looks, called Hi-Tech
and Gizmo, with the OS 8.5.
</P>
<P>
   Another small but helpful change will be the ability for a
floating window that lets you switch applications with a click of
the mouse. This feature, offered for years by shareware, now will
become part of the OS.
</P>
<P>
   These are just a few of the many changes coming in OS 8.5. No
price has yet been released for this upgrade, expected to be
released Oct. 9.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, check out Mac Web sites such as MacNN. It
features a special page devoted to OS 8.5, called Allegro. You'll
find the site at http://www.macnn.com/reality/allegro.shtml

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Goodbye to campaign funding reform
 &HT;    (Eds: Tom Teepen will be on vacation the week of Sept. 21. His
column will resume the week of Sept. 28 with a column moving that
day.)
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   While we all vicariously joined the president of the United
States as he contemplated Monica flashing her thong undies and in
general were puzzling out who had done what and with which and to
whom, there was a murder in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans finally did in campaign-funding
reform. They used the noisy release of the Starr report to cover
the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The next presidential and congressional election cycle will
differ from the last only in further excesses of the de facto
extortion and bribery that political fund-raising has become.
</P>
<P>
   Already in this election go-round, Republican committees have
raked in $193 million in regulated money, Democrats $108 million.
That's an increase of 19 percent for the GOP, 30 percent for
Democrats over the last similar period. ``Soft money'' _ boodle
from corporations, unions and the super-rich that the parties use
to get around limits on candidate fund-raising _ has gone up 70
percent for Democrats, to $53 million _ and up 250 percent for
Republicans, to $71.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   When the House slalomed last month through the last of the
sundry barriers Speaker Newt Gingrich had thrown up against reform
and voted 252 to 179 to ban the soft-money dodge, reformers felt a
surge of hope that an earlier Senate roadblock could be revisited
and crashed.
</P>
<P>
   But the brief numerical bipartisanship of the House vote only
masked the enduring partisan split. Many Republicans wanted a
reform vote on their records this November and could cast one in
confidence that Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott would do what he
had said all along he would do _ quash any reform that came over
from the House.
</P>
<P>
   Only six Republicans joined their co-sponsor colleague, John
McCain of Arizona, to override the Lott-created filibuster. With 45
Democrats, that left the good guys eight votes short of the 60
needed. R.I.P.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two years, Republicans in both the House and
Senate have staged hearings to torture Democrats over their at best
compromising, at times illegal fund-raising hustles in the last
election.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats had it coming, but absent any reformist
follow-through, the hearings stand as little better than political
show trials. Indeed, making matters worse, Republicans used the
hearings to learn how to catch up with and surpass Democrats in
soft-money excesses. GOP leaders are now, in effect, threatening
corporations with legislative reprisal if they give to Democrats as
well as Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Expect some Republican movement on this issue next year, but
probably only toward refining its previous, failed attempts to
legislatively close off traditional Democratic funding sources
under the color of ``reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls for Public Campaign in eight core-sample states
found that majorities in each believe the current campaign funding
system is flawed and should be changed. But until those majorities
shake off their fatalism, we have an electorate, sluggish to the
point of being inanimate, that is willing to let its democracy be
subcontracted out to special-interest vendors.

 &HT;    Garrett can be Cowboys' hero
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Four years after leading the Dallas Cowboys to
one of their most memorable victories in team history, backup
quarterback Jason Garrett has been asked to be a leading man again.
</P>
<P>
   But when Garrett takes the snap in the nationally televised game
against the New York Giants, he will not be alone. His teammates
and coaches vow they will not let the 32-year-old Ivy Leaguer
shoulder all the responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only human that I'll want to do a little extra,'' running
back Emmitt Smith said after practice at Valley Ranch. ``I'm a
human being, and I think everyone on this team wants to do a little
extra in order for us to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrett has been known for his patience during his career with
the Cowboys. Always behind Troy Aikman on the depth chart. Usually
No. 3 behind players such as Wade Wilson and Rodney Peete.
</P>
<P>
   This week, however, Garrett is the headliner. This week he has
been asked to relive an exciting Thankgiving Day game in 1994, an
improbable 42-31 victory over the Green Bay Packers. With Aikman
and Peete nursing injuries, Garrtt threw for 311 yards and two
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   That was the last time the Princeton graduate made a significant
impact for the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``That game was a long time ago, and I've certainly turned the
page on that,'' Garrett said. ``But it certainly was a great day
for me and something I'll remember the rest of my life. It'll
certainly help Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   This will be the first game in a monthlong journey for Garrett,
who has replaced Aikman as the starter. Aikman has a broken left
collarbone, an injury that will keep him inactive for at least four
games, and Garrett's first game is against one of the most imposing
defenses in football.
</P>
<P>
   Through two games, the defending NFC East-champion Giants have
an NFL-best 13 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Any bets the Giants will add a blitz or two to their defensive
scheme, now that a relative newcomer has taken Aikman's slot?
</P>
<P>
   ``You know they're going to bring the house,'' Dallas guard Nate
Newton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the Giants can possibly do any more on defense
than they've already shown,'' Cowboys Coach Chan Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey may be new in town, but he is familiar with Garrett's
1994 heroics against the Packers. He watched that Thanksgiving Day
shootout on TV, saying that game is one reason he decided to make
Garrett the No. 2 quarterback this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I remember about that game is that he took his team to
victory,'' Gailey said. ``You can say what you want about
quarterbacks, but that's the bottom line. Did you take your team to
victory?''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said the Cowboys have not simplified the offense to ease
Garrett's role. He doesn't have Aikman's arm strength, but Garrett
knows the playbook as well as anyone on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett's promotion begs the question: Who plays if Garrett goes
down? For the record, newcomer Mike Quinn, who threw two passes for
the Pittsburgh Steelers last year, will get his first taste in a
Cowboys uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said Quinn, who has taken only a handful of snaps, will
have to learn the offense ``by osmosis.''
</P>
<P>
   After Quinn, the job would go to someone already on the roster.
Tight end Eric Bjornson played quarterback at the University of
Washington and has been designated the No. 3 quarterback this week.
Running back Sherman Williams and cornerback Deion Sanders were
given a look Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have almost zero chance of getting in, but if I do, I'll try
to get out of there alive,'' Bjornson said.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest part of Wednesday's practice was warming up,
Bjornson said: ``I had to ice my arm down after four throws.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders took a few snaps after practice, and said he's willing
to try playing quarterback. When asked if he has ever thrown a pass
in the NFL, he recalled that he threw an option pass to Andre Rison
while with the Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   It was incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy ran a bad route,'' Sanders insisted. NOTES: Defensive
linemen Leon Lett and Chad Hennings (sprained left knees) missed
practice Wednesday and are questionable for Monday's game.

 &HT;    A buddy system in name only
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ Jimmy Johnson and Dan Marino aren't buddies, and
don't need to be.
</P>
<P>
   Their coach-quarterback relationship, as important as it is to
the Dolphins' success, doesn't require friendship.
</P>
<P>
   It just has to be professional enough to allow them to work
together.
</P>
<P>
   Two games into the third season of the process, they're still
smoothing out the kinks.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty is in the adjustment of one man to the other.
Johnson is, by title, the boss. He's the head coach. Marino is, by
reputation, the icon. He's the superstar.
</P>
<P>
   Both have been supremely successful _ Johnson with two Super
Bowl titles during his tenure with the Dallas Cowboys; Marino with
passing statistics unparalleled in the history of professional
football.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the potential for conflict, or, at least,
agitation. Johnson feels he tried too long to compromise his own
preference for standard offensive game plan (run the ball) in order
to accomodate Marino's special talents. Now, it's Marino who feels
compromised even though he's doing his best to accomodate Johnson's
desires.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, in the wake of Miami's victory Sunday against Buffalo,
seemed to snipe at Marino by saying throws were made too often to a
covered receiver rather than an open one.
</P>
<P>
   The simplistic translation of Johnson's statement is that Marino
locks too quickly onto wide receiver O.J. McDuffie, with whom he
has worked the longest and feels most comfortable and confident.
And, in fact, Marino did aim 11 of his 26 passses vs. the Bills at
McDuffie.
</P>
<P>
   But examination of both games played by the Dolphins this season
reveals that McDuffie has been a target only 15 times on 50 passes
by Marino, and 30 percent is hardly a gluttonous slice of the
receivers' pie for someone considered a team's most reliable
catcher.
</P>
<P>
   McDuffie's his guy. So what?
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, both of Marino's touchdown passes have been caught
by wide receivers not named McDuffie _ Oronde Gadsden and Lamar
Thomas. Overall, he has thrown 27 times to wide receivers (15
connections), 12 times to tight ends (seven) and 11 times to
running backs (five).
</P>
<P>
   That seems a reasonable distribution.
</P>
<P>
   The fact of the matter is that Marino is still learning a new
system and how to implement it. And that may be slowing him down
just a tick, which, in the helter-skelter world of an NFL
quarterback dropping back to pass, is forever.
</P>
<P>
   So, maybe he's rushing.
</P>
<P>
   McDuffie, though, is astounded at any criticism of Marino.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous,'' McDuffie said. ``He's doing everything
asked of him, he's not bitching, and we're 2-0.''
</P>
<P>
   McDuffie did say defensive reads Marino made effortlessly in the
old system are, for now, necessarily more mechanical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a `feel' thing, and that takes time,'' McDuffie said,
``but Danny's going to be Danny.''
</P>
<P>
   Danny being Danny has amounted to Miami being Miami for a very
long time. And even though Johnson has pulled the plug on that
strategy, he recognizes the value someone he says ``could very well
be the best quarterback ever.''
</P>
<P>
   And the 36-year-old Marino, in his 16th season, appreciates the
fact that his career could be extended if only because he ``won't
take as many hits'' if he's throwing fewer passes.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a buddy system.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't have to be, as long as they're able to smooth out
the other kinks.

 &HT;    It's Tee's time to shine as Vol's QB
 &HT;    By Craig Dolch
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early Saturday evening, Tee Martin will take a short walk to
Neyland Stadium. It will be an emotional time for Martin, who will
make his first home start as Tennessee's starting quarterback
against the hated Florida Gators.
</P>
<P>
   Then Martin will glance up at the street sign that reads: Peyton
Pass.
</P>
<P>
   That's the worst part about following a legend _ the legend
seems to follow you around.
</P>
<P>
   Martin knew it wouldn't be easy replacing Peyton Manning,
perhaps the most popular player to wear a Tennessee uniform. But
before the new guy can make a name for himself, does he really have
to walk down a street named for his predecessor?
</P>
<P>
   ``It only energizes me more and motivates me that much more when
people constantly throw Peyton in my face,'' Martin said. ``But
there's no way I can outshine him, nor do I want to. It's not a
popularity contest, because I would never win that.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin can win games, however. Two weeks ago the junior from
Mobile, Ala., drove the Vols 72 yards in the final seconds to set
up the winning field goal in a 34-33 victory over Syracuse. That
win became more impressive last week when Syracuse went on the road
and humbled reigning national co-champion Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stepped out of Peyton's shadow,'' receiver Peerless Price
said after the Syracuse game. ``Don't think that hasn't been
burning down inside of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, 20, wasn't fabulous in his first start, completing just
9-of-26 passes for 143 yards and two touchdowns. But he gave the
Vols a dimension they haven't had since Heath Shuler, running eight
times for 81 yards and a score. Martin's running ability is the
reason Tennessee coach Philip Fulmer allowed his new quarterback to
get hit during spring practice.
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer said Martin is taking the right approach to following
Manning, who set SEC career records for passing yards (11,201),
completions (863) and completion percentage (62.5) while ranking
second to Florida's Danny Wuerffel in touchdowns (89).
</P>
<P>
   ``Tee is a very level-headed man who knows he'll never put up
numbers like Peyton Manning did,'' Fulmer said. ``All he wants to
do is help this team win.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin knows he can accomplish something Manning never did: beat
Florida. The Gators have defeated the Vols five years in a row,
with Manning the starter in the last three meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say much about why we haven't beat Florida, but I know
we've lost those games because of turnovers and mistakes,'' Martin
said. ``We can't let that happen again this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin played sparingly his first two years at Tennessee,
completing 8-of-16 passes for 87 yards with one touchdown and one
interception. His most extensive playing time came when he led the
Vols to a touchdown in the final seconds of last year's 42-17 loss
to Nebraska in the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The touchdown was meaningless to most, but not to Martin. The
80-yard scoring drive _ during which Martin completed 4-of-4 for 53
yards _ and subsequent two-point conversion triggered a change of
leadership at Tennessee. That became clear when his teammates
hugged him after the drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like they were accepting me as their starter,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the sixth-ranked Vols, however, won't accept another
home loss to the second-ranked Gators. Being placed in such a
pressure-packed situation might seem too much for Martin, but not
after what he's been through in his life.
</P>
<P>
   Martin grew up in a tough neighborhood in Mobile, where gangs
and drugs were constant sights. He says since he's enrolled at
Tennessee, he's lost 12 family members or friends to violent
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even cry anymore,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin said his background has helped him on the field and
in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I think about the pressures that come with getting
to the top,'' he said. ``I came from nothing and made it out. I
feel like there's nothing that can rattle me.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even walking down Peyton Pass as he prepares to try to pass
the biggest test of his college career.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will give me motivation, knowing how much he accomplished
to have a street named after him,'' Martin said. ``I'm going to
walk down that street with pride.''

 &HT;    Panthers still waiting for Dvorak to blossom
 &HT;    By Brian Biggaine
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNRISE, Fla. _ The Florida Panthers' coaches and scouts didn't
know what to make of Radek Dvorak at his first training camp in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers' first-round pick (and 10th overall) that year,
Dvorak beat everyone in the 5-mile run, then stayed a step ahead of
the competition the rest of the week, leading the team with six
goals in five scrimmages.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, three years later, that remains the highlight of
Dvorak's NHL career _ that and the five-game point streak he put
together to close last season.
</P>
<P>
   First-year coach Terry Murray clearly expects that to change.
After stating Wednesday that he plans to play Dvorak on one of his
top two lines, Murray said, ``He's got great speed, he's got
experience now, and I think he can have a breakthrough year this
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Dvorak has generated that kind of optimism before. After he was
drafted and, particularly, after his first camp, General Manager
Bryan Murray said Dvorak could be a 30- 35-goal scorer.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed he might be on his way when he scored 13 and 18,
respectively, in his first two seasons, both of which he played as
a teenager. But when he slipped to 12 last year, Murray conceded
that he might top out in the 20-25 range.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try to show him I'm better than that,'' Dvorak
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got all the skill to be a scorer,'' linemate Dino
Ciccarelli said. ``He's got great speed and size (6-foot-1, 195),
and that's something a lot of guys in this league don't have. Maybe
he should have the mindset to shoot more.''
</P>
<P>
   While Dvorak took the fewest shots of any Florida forward last
season (112, an average of 1.75 per game), he also was one of only
seven Panthers to convert better than 10 percent (10.7).
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to pass too much,'' he admitted. ``I'll get a 2-on-1 or
an open net and try to pass. But they've told me I have to shoot
when I get a chance. Kozzie (linemate Victor Kozlov) always shoots.
I have to do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant coach Slava Lener, who coached Dvorak on the Czech
Republic under-20 team three years ago, said he sees three keys to
Dvorak's success: 1. Being strong on the puck; 2. Taking the puck
more to the net; and 3. Concentrating more on his defense.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Murray feels the best place for him to accomplish those
goals might be left wing, and promised to try him there in some
upcoming exhibition games. Dvorak has played mostly right wing
until now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of potential, but there's a lot of work to be
done,'' Lener said. ``He's playing too relaxed so far; that's not
the way we want to have him.''
</P>
<P>
   Dvorak said one reason he's relaxed is the pressure has been
lifted since he signed a four-year, $4.5 million contract last
weekend. At 21, he knows his future is secure and he can
concentrate on playing hockey.
</P>
<P>
   But that future may not be in Miami. In discussing the contract
last week, Bryan Murray noted that Dvorak has a league-wide
reputation now and that, if a youngster such as, say, Marcus
Nilson, made a big impression, Dvorak could be moved.
</P>
<P>
   The message was clear: Perform and you've got a future in South
Florida. Come up short again and you'll be starting over somewhere
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that happens,'' Dvorak said, ``that's the business. But I
want to be with this team when it gets back to the playoffs.''

 &HT;    A different era in the air
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob Christian, who covered baseball for The Atlanta Journal when
baseball was the Crackers in Ponce de Leon Park, recently retired
from airline consulting in Washington. He spends his time welcoming
visitors to Mount Vernon, keeping up with news from Georgia and
being the finest amateur historian I know.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the sports beat he became a Delta public relations
executive before joining rival Eastern as a vice president. His
latest dispatch included a reminder that this month is the 32nd
anniversary of the death of C.E. Woolman, Delta's founder. He hopes
some of Mr. Woolman's personality and management style survives all
the changes Delta has gone through in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I once had to drive over to the Hilton Inn from Delta
headquarters to pick up a senior editor from Forbes magazine in
town to interview Mr. Woolman,'' he wrote. ``The man was in a foul
mood because I had not been able to give him a definite time for
the interview. Mr. Woolman didn't make appointments. It was first
to the door, first in.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we drove up to the building, we saw Mr. Woolman get out of
his old Chrysler Imperial and send Robert, his driver, on his way.
But when we got to his office on the second floor, somebody had
beaten us to the door. We took our seat and waited. And waited.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could hear loud talk and laughter coming from Mr. Woolman's
office. Our guest from Forbes was fuming. Finally Mr. Woolman
appeared at his door. He had his arm around a large black man, a
skycap from Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ```Now John,' he was saying, `If you ever have that problem
again, just get on an airplane and come on down and we'll work it
out.'''
</P>
<P>
   Christian said the editor left happy, convinced there was
something unique about Mr. Woolman and his airline.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Woolman grew show-class orchids in his greenhouse. On his
birthday, Oct. 8, every woman in the building got one of his
orchids at an afternoon party. ``The orchids were a daily thing,''
Bob explained. ``Each day he brought two or three to work.
Throughout the afternoon he'd invite one of the women employees to
stop by his office so he could give them one of his orchids.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Woolman was famously frugal with company money. Christian
made many out-of-town trips with him and recalls riding in a
limousine only once. He normally hitched a ride on a Delta mail
truck or some other company delivery vehicle. He deviated only the
one time when he was in New York to accept the Newcomen Award, the
most prestigious honor a business executive can receive. John Shad,
Delta's director of sales in New York, insisted on the limousine.
``Darned if I was going to let my boss ride up to the Pierre Hotel
in the company mail truck,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, the Georgia General Assembly was looking for a new
source of revenue. Politicians were about to start charging a sales
tax on everything from equipment to food purchased by big
companies, even if the goods were bought out of state and never got
to Georgia. Southern Railroad was threatening to move its Atlanta
maintenance center to Chattanooga. Delta was worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right at this time Mr. Woolman had to make a speech at the
annual meeting of the Tampa Chamber of Commerce,'' Christian says.
``We flew down and stayed over the next day to have breakfast with
Scott Christopher, the president of the Tampa chamber. Scott drove
us to a big, beautiful, new office park.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be a lovely spot for some company's headquarters,''
was Mr. Woolman's comment to his Tampa host.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, back in Atlanta, Christian got a call from
John Pennington, the Journal's top reporter. ``What's this about
Delta moving its headquarters to Tampa?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's moving to Tampa in 1963 would have been at least as
devastating as Delta's moving to Tampa in 1998. Christian went
bounding up the steps to Mr. Woolman's office to find out what to
tell the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``He grinned and said. `Now Bob, you know we aren't going to
move, but don't deny it too strongly. Just say we always look at
proposals that are attractive to Delta's future.'''
</P>
<P>
   The sales tax threat evaporated as soon as the afternoon Journal
hit the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Woolman really was one of the most remarkable men I have
ever met,'' Christian wrote. ``One of the things that made him
unique was that from crop-dusting in Louisiana to running the
country's most envied airline, he had only one secretary. His
payroll number was 001. Catherine Fitzgerald, `Miss Fitz' in the
old Delta family, was No. 002. She died a multimillionaire from her
Delta stock, but never moved out of her garage apartment in College
Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian wonders if anyone in the new Delta rides the mail
truck in New York, or hands out orchids in the afternoon; or if a
reservations agent in Florida loves his company so much he lists
Delta as his middle name in the telephone book.
</P>
<P>
   Of course not. We all live in a different world in 1998.

 &HT;    Travel story on California
 &HT;    By Gregory Kallenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The descriptive term ``breathtaking'' is
overused. Admit it, we all hate it. The canopy of trees was
breathtaking. Her beauty was breathtaking. The new Mazda is
breathtaking.
</P>
<P>
   What does it mean, anyway? Is it a situation, person or panorama
where, witnessing it, one is prone to hyperventilation?
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, I'm traveling north on the Pacific Coast Highway
through Big Sur and I can't think of any other word to describe the
cragged cliffs, the crushing sea as it meets the rocks, the ocean
mist that hovers over the scene and makes it almost surreal. It's,
well, you know...the ``b'' word.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, my wife and I were about halfway through our trip
up the California coast. We were determined to shun the quicker,
multi- lane, mega-highways and stay ompletely on scenic,
turtle-paced, Highway 1 (or, by it's more romantic name, the
Pacific Coast Highway) from San Diego to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Coast Highway is a two-laned stretch of concrete and
asphalt that begins in San Diego and unravels along the Pacific
coast to Leggett, Calif. Our trip would take us past the posh
Hollywood mansions of Los Angeles, through Big Sur, Monterey and
Pescadero and end at the Golden Gate Bridge. On a regular day,
armed with coffee, Wow! Doritos and 10 CDs, you could make the trip
in about 11 hours. We decided to take nine days to make our
journey.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego: The journey begins. ``It's been kind of hot here,''
said my San Diego friend Mike Hojel when we arrived by plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah,'' I said, having just left a brisk 102-degree July
day behind in Texas. ``How hot has it been?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost 80,'' he said, sounding perturbed at having to use a
number so high. The temperature would be a recurring theme on our
trip, so let's get it out of the way now: While we were in the
Golden State, the median mid-afternoon temperature was a little
above 74 degrees. San Diego is a beautiful city situated at the
bottom of California, nestled next to the Pacific Ocean. With L.A.
being only 90 minutes north and Tijuana, Mexico just 40 minutes
south, both cultures tug at the city. It's cool and glamorous, but
it also has a rough, south of the border'' feel to it. This leaves
a unique final product. Our first night was a prime example.
</P>
<P>
   Hojel promised us a gourmet Mexican meal at El Callejon (The
Alley''), a bistro-esque spot in Encinitas just north of San Diego.
There, the beautiful people ate puntas de pollo and medallones
chipotle in the exclusive setting. The patrons, along with their
cellular phones, looked and felt like Hollywood. It wasn't until we
sat down that the Mexican influences of the restaurant became
apparent. Two-hundred and forty-three tequilas, ranging from $3.75
a shot to $45, sat on shelves along the wall. By the time we had
gotten to tequila No. 7 on the list (a beautiful Patron Anejo), it
felt like we were banditos holing up in a border town.
</P>
<P>
   On our last day in San Diego, we visited the San Diego Zoo,
arguably the best zoo in the world. After seeing a Chinese Blue
Sheep give birth (really, we did), Pygmy Chimps play with dead
ducks (really, they did) and the giant panda Ling-Ling sleep, we
decided to begin the 2 1/2-hour drive to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   After passing through some interesting ocean towns separated
only by signs reading, ``Welcome to ...,'' we stopped in Cardiff to
take in a bit of beach culture at a cafe called Swami's (''Every
bite is a vegan's delight!''). There, a waitress named Charity,
awash in glitter, and a guy named Regular Joe bantered over
consumerism and its effects on the ocean's ecosystem. It was kind
of like being in Austin with sand.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles: The jocund conspiracy
</P>
<P>
   It was apparent we had arrived in Los Angeles when the traffic
got bad and the people stopped smiling. Again, we were staying with
some friends. The Rhodes' live in Century City, down the street
from 20th Century Fox Studios and around the corner from Lucille
Ball's old house. Their abode is a quaint 1,250-square-foot,
two-bedroom, one- bath affair and (take note all who whine about
Austin real estate prices) would sell for about $600,000. After we
settled in, we sat in the cool dusk eating guacamole and drinking
grape juice under their lemon tree right next to their flowering
rose garden just feet away from their artichoke bush. This would be
yet another theme of our trip: everything, especially things you
eat, grows in California.
</P>
<P>
   The next day was spent riding down Sunset Boulevard, seeing the
'Hollywood'' sign (to which my wife commented, It's so small!''),
cruising by Groman's Chinese Theater on Hollywood Boulevard, and
winding up at Disneyland in Anaheim. The traffic going out was
horrendous and put us both in sour moods, but those moods
disappeared once we entered the Magic Kingdom. Here, smiles weren't
optional and everyone seemed to wear one, so we reluctantly joined
in. Though it was nice to see so many happy people in one place, it
felt like some sort of jocund conspiracy. I actually spent a lot of
my time at Disneyland watching Mickey's little helpers joyfully
dish out ice cream and gleefully clean the streets just waiting for
their faces to fall. It didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   The night ended on an exciting note. While making our way to the
newly refurbished Tomorrowland, power went out in half of the park.
A driver on the Harbor Freeway had run into a transformer. Disney
refunded everyone their money as they left.
</P>
<P>
   The downside was this: It just made everyone smile all the more.
</P>
<P>
   Carmel: The long and winding road
</P>
<P>
   We left Los Angeles early in the the morning with Carmel as our
destination. This day would take us up into the heralded Big Sur
National Park and Los Padres National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   The year has been a rough one for this portion of the Pacific
Coast Highway. Mudslides from torrential rains closed portions of
the road. Recently, the passage was reopened, but we were warned to
expect some delays on the way up.
</P>
<P>
   If the stretch of road to Carmel was straightened, the swank
town would take two hours to reach from L.A. However, the intricacy
of the highway as it twists around mountains, the intermittent road
construction delays and stops in some of California's most charming
towns meant our trip took about six hours.
</P>
<P>
   The gateway to this stretch of road is Santa Barbara, where we
refueled and ate a four-pound breakfast burrito at a highly
recommended taqueria called El Bajio on Milpas. From there, we
passed through the picturesque San Luis Obisbo; the
not-picturesque-but-worth-the-stop-to-see dormant volcano, Morrow
Bay; and the sort of picturesque Buellton, which lays claim to
being the ``Home of Split Pea Soup.''
</P>
<P>
   I had been told how breathtaking'' (there's that word again)
this road was and once the tiny burgs were left behind and the
Escheresque roads began, it was clear there had been no
exaggeration. Woe be those who bring only one roll of film on this
portion of the trip; it's definitely a three roller. If nothing
else, stop and enjoy the array of wildflowers that adorn the side
of the road along with the wild fennel and rosemary.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic delays were frequent because of bulldozers clearing the
road of debris, but these seemed to be welcomed by travelers as
they took full advantage of the downtime: posing dangerously close
to a cliff' s edge or taking snapshots down the rocky coast. With
the drama of the sea meeting land on one side and tall woolly
forests and mountains on the other side, the Pacific Coast Highway
provides the kinds of photo opportunities where you can blow up
your prints and your will friends ask, ``Where did you buy that?''
</P>
<P>
   After traveling into the tiny town of Big Sur, we stopped at
Nepenthe, a restaurant near the new-age Esalen Institute where
spanking as therapy was made famous. Nepenthe is a touristy little
stop with terraces overlooking the Big Sur coast. Here, we supped
on $10 hamburgers while taking in a view that was worth 10 times
that.
</P>
<P>
   The next stop was Carmel, the fabled golfing village by the sea.
In Carmel we finally had the opportunity to stay in a hotel. La
Playa was originally an oceanfront mansion. It proved to be the
best part of the town, along with the beach that was within walking
distance. Carmel is a bit stodgy and white bread for my taste.
Everywhere you look, you either see people dressed for golf in
light pastels or entire families with matching argyle sweaters
draped around their necks. It was spooky.
</P>
<P>
   Sonoma: The Wine Country beckons
</P>
<P>
   The next day we had a change in plans. Instead of ending with a
four- day stint in San Francisco, we decided to head into the Wine
Country for a couple of days. Through Monterey with its stellar
aquarium, to Pescadero where we stopped at the soon to be famous''
Duarte' s Cafe for its artichoke soup, over the Golden Gate Bridge
and into Napa and Sonoma, just an hour and a half north of San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Our first night was spent in Sonoma at a hotel called El Dorado.
Sonoma is a beautiful place with a town square picturesque enough
to be on a cereal box or bread label but, unfortunately, the town
square sits alongside busy Highway 12. The same highway fronted our
hotel and our night was spent listening to semis, souped-up pickup
trucks and motorcycles make their way up and down the road. It was
a good thing we had been properly fed and sedated at Babbette's, a
tres cool cafe across the square.
</P>
<P>
   The next day we decided to move to Napa, which was also a
mistake. Every hotel was booked, so we ended up staying at the
Silverado Country Club. Once the tony place to stay in Napa, the
hotel hasn't aged well and looks like the backdrop for a
``Caddyshack'' sequel. I could just imagine Rodney Dangerfield
standing next to me and looking at the golfers waiting to tee off.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is this? A funeral?'' he would have said.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing that amazed me about the Wine Country is how
touristy the place is. People are everywhere: the roads are packed,
the restaurants are packed, even the most remote of wineries are
packed.
</P>
<P>
   What made it all worthwhile was the food at Tra Vigne in St.
Helena (dauntingly hyper-Italian decor but a fantastic menu) and
the tours at Beringer and Domaine Chandon. The hand-dug caves at
Beringer, Napa' s oldest winery, are a sight and the gardens and
tasting rooms at the Chandon sparkling winery are worth a couple of
hours.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco: Here we come
</P>
<P>
   The last leg of the trip was spent in San Francisco. After
checking in at our hotel, the Milano, we headed into the city. My
wife was gung ho on getting a boiled crab so we tried hiking up Nob
Hill with Fisherman's Wharf as our destination. Halfway up, we
hailed a street car.
</P>
<P>
   The first day was spent eating a crab at Wharfatude and drinking
Irish coffees at Buena Vista, a touristy spot made famous by the
drink. San Francisco was downright cold and the Irish coffees took
off the chill.
</P>
<P>
   Our last day was spent shopping for schlocky gifts in Chinatown,
stuffing ourselves at Yank-Sing (a dim sum restaurant in the
Financial District) and watching soccer with Italians in the North
Beach area of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, as we waited for our plane, we pulled out our
road atlas and retraced our journey up the coast. For a moment,
there was silence between us, trying to fashion some word that
described the whole experience. As our flight was announced we
turned to each other and simultaneously used that overused term
that I thought I always hated: ``Breathtaking!''

 &HT;    Travel story on Montreal
 &HT;    By R. Michelle Breyer and Jody Seaborn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ When planning our trip to Montreal, we were told a
number of things about the Canadian city.
</P>
<P>
   It's like Paris, except friendlier.
</P>
<P>
   It's like New York, except they speak French.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Montreal offers a pleasant mix of European and American
sensibilities and features. With its museums, first-class shops and
ethnic neighborhoods, it does resemble a cleaner, smaller New York.
And because of its French heritage and largely French-speaking
population, Montreal does have a European flair.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans will feel they are in a European city.
</P>
<P>
   But in a European city in which language isn't a barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone we met could switch easily from French to English, and
did so with none of the reluctance of Parisians. In fact, no matter
the shop or restaurant we walked into, if we greeted their bon jour
with our own weak, badly accented bon jour, the reply was
inevitably in English and was made without condescension.
</P>
<P>
   The cheerful blend that makes Montreal such a wonderful place to
visit, however, includes not only New York and Paris, but also the
eclecticism of San Francisco and, thanks to the Casino Montreal,
the solid excessiveness of Las Vegas. And with an exchange rate
that has been especially favorable recently _ when we were there in
late July, one U.S. dollar bought $1.50 in Canadian currency _
Montreal is a relatively affordable city, perhaps only slightly
more expensive than what a visitor staying at a moderately priced
hotel and eating at moderately priced restaurants would find in
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal lends itself to spontaneity. We arrived without much of
a planned itinerary and suffered not in the least because of it. A
fast perusal of a couple of guide books and off we went.
</P>
<P>
   You'd be hard-pressed to lose your way in Montreal: The major
streets are quickly learned, the major sites are easily accessible,
and if you don't find that special restaurant you're looking for,
one just as good will be around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite all these great things about Montreal, the greatest
was its weather. Keep this in mind for next year before those
memories of this year's brutal June and July wane: Montreal is an
ideal summer escape _ mild days and cool nights, though slightly
humid.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the weather, the things we enjoyed about Montreal
were those things Austin doesn't offer, or doesn't offer very
often. Let the list begin with Montreal's excellent public
transportation system.
</P>
<P>
   The Metro
</P>
<P>
   Never fear getting around Montreal. It's easy. It's quick. And
it's cheap.
</P>
<P>
   The Metro, Montreal's subway system, can take you just about
anywhere in the city you want to go, or at least put you within
walking distance. (You will want to do most of your exploring on
foot anyway.) If necessary, you can also use your Metro ticket to
board the city's buses.
</P>
<P>
   There are 65 Metro stations _ the city will be expanding its
network of underground tunnels in the next decade or so _ placed
along four Metro lines. Each line is color-coded and easy to figure
out. Most visitors to Montreal will be primarily concerned with
stops along the green line, which covers downtown and the tourist
areas around Olympic Park, and the orange line, which covers Old
Montreal and the Plateau Mont-Royal neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Single rides on the Metro cost $1.30 U.S., while a three-day
pass costs about $8.50 U.S. We got our money's worth with our
three-day pass. And as we rode on the train, we often commented on
how nice it was not to have to rely on a car to get anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhoods
</P>
<P>
   Much of Montreal's charm lies in its diverse neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Our favorite was the eclectic, multi-ethnic Plateau Mont-Royal,
just north of downtown. Less touristy than Old Montreal, which
despite its history and Old World architecture has little to offer
beyond a pleasant stroll, and Rue Ste-Catherine, the heart of
Montreal's downtown shopping district and ground zero for the
inevitable Americanization to come (a Planet Hollywood opened off
Ste-Catherine while we were in Montreal), Plateau Mont-Royal
features offbeat shops, nightclubs and a variety of restaurants and
bistros, many of which open onto the sidewalk in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   This neighborhood has few if any of the tacky tourist shops
common downtown. You're more likely to find memorabilia related to
Tintin, the Belgian cartoon character; funky bookstores and thrift
stores; and European-style clothing stores.
</P>
<P>
   (An aside: Spandex shorts, pants and shirts, along with high
heels and soles two- to three-inches thick, were all the fashion in
Montreal. Perhaps the looks reflects the prevalence of discos. )
</P>
<P>
   Our most memorable meals were at restaurants within the Plateau
Mont- Royal neighborhood. One was a late-night dinner at a Greek
restaurant on Rue Prince-Arthur; the other was a mid-afternoon
feast of tapas and paella at a Portuguese restaurant on Rue Duluth.
Lack of time kept us from trying the many Middle Eastern, Japanese,
Vietnamese and Italian restaurants in the area.
</P>
<P>
   We wouldn't suggest staying anywhere but downtown, specifically
the area bordered by Rue University on the east, Rue Crescent on
the west, Rue Sherbrooke to the north and Boulevard Rene-Levesque
to the south. Though downtown had its Gap _ actually its Gaps and
its Starbucks (when we go to Mars, we will find a Starbucks there),
and now its Planet Hollywood _ it offered much more in terms of
shopping and dining, and much more at a later hour. Like New York,
Montreal may never sleep _ and it definitely likes the wee hours.
</P>
<P>
   We kept reading about Montreal's underground city,'' but when we
asked people how to get to this city, they looked at us as though
we were from Oz. Don't be fooled by the guide books: There is no
underground city per se. Rather, it is loosely connected Metro
passageways, corridors and store basements, an informally
structured defense against Montreal's long, bitter winters. In this
subterranean universe, residents can make their way from
restaurants to movies to concerts without stepping outside.
</P>
<P>
   The sites
</P>
<P>
   Montreal has several museums, a nice feature for people coming
from a city with few museums. We spent several hours one morning at
the architecturally interesting Museum of Fine Arts, touring an
exhibit of Alberto Giacometti's sculptures and paintings, and
wandering through the museum's permanent collection, which includes
work from the Middle Ages to the late 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   We also visited the Biodome, where plants and animals live in
reproductions of their natural ecosystems. The Biodome features a
tropical forest, a Laurentian forest, and marine and polar
habitats.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby is Montreal's botanical garden and insectarium, as well
as the Olympic Stadium, home of the Montreal Expos baseball team
and the Canadian Football League's Montreal Alouettes. (Montreal
hosted the 1976 Summer Olympics; the city has made good use of the
complex it built to host the games.)
</P>
<P>
   The McCord Museum of Canadian History, associated with McGill
University, showcases thousands of costumes, artifacts and
historical photographs. There's even the Just for Laughs Museum, a
by-product of the annual Just for Laughs comedy festival, held the
last two weeks of July. This museum includes video and film clips,
a 250-seat cabaret, a humor hall of fame, a shop and a cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was undergoing renovations during our visit, the
Basilique Notre-Dame is an awe-inspiring structure, big enough for
4,000 worshippers. While touring the 169-year-old cathedral, we
were treated to an impromptu performance by a Swiss a capella
choir. It was a beautiful moment.
</P>
<P>
   But there are times when art and culture and beauty need a
counterbalance, and for that Montreal has built a multistory casino
like no other. With almost 3,000 slot machines, the Casino de
Montreal is a grand place for anyone who likes to park their butt
on a stool and feed an electronic gadget their money.
</P>
<P>
   For those of us who prefer the gaming tables, however, the
casino is less grand. There are precious few blackjack tables _
precious fewer affordable blackjack tables _ and it was next to
impossible to get a seat at one of them. But get a seat we
eventually did. After a couple of hours entertainment, we parted
with $40 Canadian and with our gambling ways. At least for this
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal's answer to New York's Central Park _ in fact it was
designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, the landscape architect who
created Central Park _ is Parc Mont-Royal. This 494-acre park
boasts miles of running and biking trails, observation points
overlooking the city, a small lake, a gorgeous chalet, and in the
winter, a small ski lift. We enjoyed a long, peaceful walk through
the park, as well as a few challenging runs up its gently sloping
hills.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem an odd place to visit, but just north of _ in
fact, across the street from _ Parc Mont-Royal is Montreal's
Catholic cemetery, Notre-Dame-des-Neiges Cemetery, a vast, serene
area of magnificent headstones. We spent two or three hours
wandering around, noting the names, the different ethnicities, and
how the arrangements and divisions within the cemetery reflect the
ethnic mix and socioeconomic arrangements within the city. Next
door is the city's Protestant (read: British) cemetery, another
clue into Montreal's past and present.
</P>
<P>
   Friendly (family-friendly even), unique, romantic, rich in
history and different enough to Americans for it to feel foreign,
yet not too foreign, Montreal is an ideal travel destination. IF
YOU GO: GETTING THERE: Many major airlines go to Montreal's Dorval
International Airport, including Air Canada, American, Continental,
Delta and Northwest. There was even a direct flight between
Montreal and Austin, with one stop in Dallas. It's about a
five-hour plane ride, not including stops. Leave extra time on the
way back to the United States, because it can take some time to get
through customs. WHEN TO GO: Quebec has warm summers and severe
winters, with snow lasting from mid-December to mid-March. During
August, while Austin hovers in the 100s, the average temperature in
Montreal is 76 degrees, falling to 61 degrees at night. Eastern
Canada also has beautiful springs and falls. LANGUAGE: Canada's two
official languages are English and French. Although English is
widely spoken, it is helpful to know some basic French. Many of the
street signs and Metro signs are in French. MONEY: Although U.S.
money is accepted many places in Canada, visitors are encouraged to
exchange some of their money for Canadian dollars. It can be done
at the airport or at any bank, where the exchange rates tend to be
better. Be aware that American tourists in Canada are eligible for
a General Sales Tax refund on purchases taken out of the country
and on short- term accommodations. Rebate forms, which must be
submitted within 60 days of leaving Canada, may be obtained from
certain retailers, duty-free shops and customs officials. The GST
on each receipt must be at least $3.50 and visitors must claim at
least $14 in tax per rebate application form. MORE INFORMATION: For
visitor information, you can call Tourisme Quebec at (800) 363-7777
or the Greater Montreal Convention and Tourism Bureau at (514)
844-5400.

 &HT;    Travel story on Scandinavia
 &HT;    By Michael Barnes
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway _ On balance, we visit Scandinavia for the pretty
scenery and the pretty people.
</P>
<P>
   Not for the vaulting monuments (there are few), nor for the high
art (there is little), and certainly not for the famously bland and
expensive food of Norway, Sweden and Denmark (mostly dairy and
fish, without much attention paid to preparation or presentation).
</P>
<P>
   Yet Scandinavia deserves an extended stay. Because these
countries were spared the full brunt of modern wars, their physical
pasts remain remarkably intact. Thus, the culturally curious
visitor should make special efforts to visit some small historical
or art museums in the cities of Oslo, Bergen, Stockholm and
Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
   Envision dragon-shaped Viking vessels that skimmed the far seas
and tall-masted warships meant to ferry Swedes to the bloody Thirty
Years War. Discover the barracks of the Hanseatic League, a
mysterious guild that monopolized Baltic Sea trade for centuries,
and linger in a bizarre museum, built by a beer tycoon to display
his extensive collection of historical sculpture. Examine
well-preserved wonders, such as the jewel-like theater at Sweden's
Drottningholm Palace, and the exotic instruments on display in a
Danish musical museum.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, you should tour the majestic fjords, sample the local
beers, but before you leave, rummage through Scandinavia's cultural
attic by spending a few stray hours in these nine small museums.
Vigeland Park and Museum, Oslo, Norway
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most memorable spot in Norway, outside of the
fjords, is Vigeland Park, a few minutes on the tram from the center
of Oslo. Its designer, sculptor Gustav Vigeland (1869-1943), viewed
art on a scale both grandiose and humane. The large, popular park,
opened in 1950 after more than 40 years of design and construction,
is organized around a corridor of bronze and stone sculptures of
human figures. At first glance, Vigeland's hundreds of nudes
suggests a Rodinesque eye for handsome, smooth, large-limbed men
and women. After a few moments of inspection, one realizes Vigeland
was plumbing for deeper insights into the human condition. Men toss
babies through the air, or pull women viciously by their braids.
Figures young and old drip with a dignified eroticism. The bridges
and fountains, covered with real children at play, are capped by a
huge monolith of piled bodies, depicting humankind competing for
top position. High pedestals also hold men and women embraced by
dragon-like lizards. If the park makes one wonder what kind of
character would create this art, the nearby Vigeland Museum keeps
the man mysterious, with only a few clues to crack his
psychological code. Here we see his studios, built by the City of
Oslo, packed with small studies, plaster casts, drawings, woodcuts,
sketches and plans, as well as prints of the army of craftsmen who
executed his fantasies. Although most Americans have never heard of
Vigeland, the work of this strange artist deserves a much closer
inspection, and perhaps a good explanation. Viking Ship Museum,
Oslo, Norway
</P>
<P>
   Of all the cultural prizes of Scandinavia, the most familiar to
Americans is this museum, built especially for three ninth- century
Viking ships discovered in the 19th century. The building itself is
one of the most graceful solutions to the problem of bending
architecture to historical display. A cruciform of barrel vaults
gently encloses the amazing remains of seagoing oaken ships, as
well as Viking artifacts. One problem: Small balconies force
visitors to crowd together to view the decks from above. You get a
real sense of the power and utility of these long, curved vehicles
by approaching them from different directions in the diffuse light.
This splendid little museum is surrounded by other attractions,
such as the Norse Folk Museum, Kon-Tiki Museum and Fram Museum
(another ship museum) on the Bygdy peninsula in southwest Oslo; all
are easily reached by ferries which leave the Rdhus (Oslo city
hall) at regular intervals. Munch Museum, Oslo, Norway
</P>
<P>
   The single Scandinavian painter to make an impact on the larger
world of art was Edvard Munch, a moody master of color and
distorted line. While Norway's boring National Museum owns some
fine Munchs, one must travel to Tyen, in what passes for a scruffy
neighborhood in well-scrubbed Oslo. The 1963 building feels much
like an American museum, with prominent gift shop and oversized
lobby, but the actual galleries are aptly proportioned for Munch's
vivid artwork. One also learns about the man, who suffered from
years of depression and bruising affairs, since one large gallery
is devoted to a detailed account of Munch's life. But the reason to
go is paint, great smears of it, evoking unavoidable emotions,
mainly through psychologically suggestive color. I never really
understood the association of the color green with the feeling of
envy until I saw the way Munch depicts the faces of jealousy. Most
art museums in Scandinavia underwhelm, but, perhaps because of its
narrow focus, the Munch Museum leaves you feeling aesthetically
satisfied. Vasa Museum, Stockholm, Sweden
</P>
<P>
   Rising from Stockholm's inner harbor is a modern building with a
roof that resembles the sails of a tall ship. Mastheads peek out of
the concrete arcs. Made skeptical by this architectural gimmick, I
was in no way prepared for the overwhelming experience of viewing
the vast warship, Vasa, enclosed in the Vasa Museum. The wooden
warship, commissioned by Swedish warrior-king Gustav II Adolf, sank
in the harbor on its maiden voyage in 1628. You cannot walk on the
Vasa's decks, but the novel shape of the museum allows you to view
everything close-up through several stories of amply shaped
balconies. Each floor also contains instructive exhibits on
shipbuilding, figure carving, military arms. What happened to the
Vasa? One of the most interesting exhibits is a slide show about
the trial after the disaster. It seems the king demanded an extra
battery of cannons, without increasing the hull's width, so,
despite warnings from experts, the navy sailed a ship that simply
tipped over in the lightest wind. The ship was amazingly well
preserved in the harbor's mud, until raised in the 1950s and '60s,
an epic story in itself. Of all the historical sites on the fair
islands of Stockholm, this one is the best interpreted and the most
invigorating, and most material is available in English.
Drottningholm Court Theater, Stockholm, Sweden
</P>
<P>
   There are only a few pilgrimage stops required for the lover of
theatrical history. One is the court theater, or Slottsteater, at
the Drottningholm Palace on Lovn Island, just outside Stockholm. A
scenic ferry shifts tourists to the 17th-century ``queen's
palace,'' built in the style of Versailles, only much smaller.
Between the palace and its formal gardens is a unique theater and
museum. There's a great story here: A former German princess, Queen
Lovisa Ulrika of Sweden, missed the civilized graces of her
homeland, so she commissioned a theater. Yet she failed to pay the
architect, Carl Fredrik Adelcrantz (so he lived in the building as
repayment). The Slottsteater glowed with activity after it opened
in 1766, reaching its apex of grandeur during the reign of Gustav
III, who staged his own operas. After the 1790s, it was mothballed,
a storage house for royal artwork and, for a time, potatoes. Then,
in the 1920s, an enterprising art historian uncovered the perfectly
preserved 18th-century theater, a unique treasure. Tiny, dark, it
contains the original ``wing-and-drop'' scenery, operated with
ropes, with the wings sliding in floor slots, the unframed fabric
drops streaming overhead. Nowadays, a guide demonstrates some of
the theatrical machinery, although I was disappointed not to see
the ``sea'' or ``cloud'' simulations. Nearby is a theater museum,
which contains dozens of scene designs, models and images of shows.
The wall texts are not in English and the displays are hardly
fashionable, but it's a trove of theatrical memorabilia. The
Slottsteater is a ``working'' museum, so the operas of Gluck,
Haydn, Handel and Mozart are staged in historically inspired
productions, but you must plan well in advance to attend one of the
festival performances. Hanseatic Museum, Bergen, Norway
</P>
<P>
   Do you recall any but the dimmest references to the Hanseatic
League from high school or college history classes? This all-male
guild of merchants monopolized trade in Northern Europe until the
18th century. Sound boring? Not if you visit the Hanseatic Museum
in Bergen, one of the league's northern outposts and Norway's
second largest city, located on the western coast. What survives on
the Bryggen, or old waterfront, are fabulous timber buildings,
including the museum's structure, which served as offices and
dormitories for the league. In the low-ceilinged, dark-wood, dimly
lit rooms, one learns all about the collecting of dried fish, the
main export from northern Norway, and the import of just about
every other kind of consumer goods, which, to this day, Norwegians
don't grow or make. This museum is not crammed with explanations,
but it makes up for it in authentic character, each room with the
tools of the Hanseatic trade. You really want to climb into the
beds and pretend you were tapped into the league. Bryggens Museum,
Bergen, Norway
</P>
<P>
   Archaeological sites of varying interest speckle Scandinavia,
and, after a while, they begin to amalgamate in the mind. Tiny
coins and medallions begin to look alike; fragments of wood and
stone objects lose their magical powers to imaginatively rearrange
themselves into weapons, tools and other signs of culture. What's
powerful about this one is its location over the 12th-century site
uncovered in the middle of Bergen. The museum concentrates on the
medieval years, with maps, implements and fragments of fabric and
building materials displayed with care and sensitivity. Here is the
place to take kids with a hankering for the Middle Ages, since
everything is arranged to replicate daily life eight centuries ago,
this despite sitting in a stark, modern structure. Music History
Museum, Copenhagen, Denmark
</P>
<P>
   This is an odd little curiosity, almost untouched by 20th
century concepts about museum display and education. High-quality
specimens of musical instruments line three narrow floors of a
modest building on a Copenhagen backstreet. Although smaller
instruments are masked behind glass casing, others are (almost too
temptingly) placed right before the spectator. No attempt is made
at sophisticated presentation -- some of the time-curled wall cards
are attached to the wall with straight pins, not even map tacks.
All this adds to the charm. It's like being set loose in an attic
of an eccentric uncle to gape at outlandish monstrosities --
zithers, psalters, antique horns, drums, keyboards, harps and a
healthy array of instruments from exotic lands. I felt a childish
awe at the sight of these music-making objects, but left wishing
for a deeper understanding that would have come with more
explanation of these rare finds. Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek,
Copenhagen, Denmark
</P>
<P>
   Do not visit the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek exclusively for its
sculpture, despite the thousands of examples from Greece, Rome,
Egypt, the Near East and elsewhere on display. Truth be told, the
examples collected by Danish beer (Carlsberg) magnate Carl Jacobsen
(1842-1914) are substandard, measured against the masterpieces
horded by British, American, French, German and Italian museums.
(Military empires facilitate artistic imperialism more than mere
commercial profits.) The reason for visiting this large museum is
the building, which looks like a sober palace from the outside, but
is a lost world on the inside. Each display attempts to put the
sculpture into an appropriate context, so the colors of the walls,
the execution of the floor mosaics, are related to the materials
and styles of the art on display. A central atrium is styled after
the interior of a Roman building, but the real stunner is the
conservatory, a plant-filled public area where one can spend hours,
reading, snacking or watching the regular performances in the
space. The scent of great wealth permeates the Glyptotek, but what
sets this place apart from the major art museums of Scandinavia is
an obsession with a particular art form. You may wish the curators
were more selective, but you cannot help being amazed by the sheer
size of the collection and the impressive way that it is displayed.

 &HT;    Welcome to your yoga vacation
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASSAU, Bahamas _ The boom of a gong pierced the silence of the
night promptly at 5:30 a.m., which is mighty early on Paradise
Island.
</P>
<P>
   This is the time to go to bed after a night at the casinos and
bars, not to get up to meditate and to do yoga positions that turn
your body into a pretzel.
</P>
<P>
   I obediently got out of bed.
</P>
<P>
   My legs were as stiff as a crab's, and a spasm in my neck, the
result of a recent backpack trip, ached when I turned my head. I
bent down to see if I could touch my toes - not even close - and
then stumbled half-asleep down a path through 5 acres of lush
gardens to the yoga temple overlooking Nassau Harbour.
</P>
<P>
   I joined two dozen other retreaters, who sat cross-legged in the
dark in front of an incense flame. I tried to meditate,
concentrating on the Sanskrit word Om (meaning something along the
lines of what was, what is and what will be).
</P>
<P>
   But it was hard to focus longer than 15 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Ommmmmmm.
</P>
<P>
   I need a cup of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Ommmmmm.
</P>
<P>
   My legs are going numb and my knees feel like they're
calcifying.
</P>
<P>
   Ommmmmmm.
</P>
<P>
   Do people really want to do this on vacation?
</P>
<P>
   The Sivananda Ashram Yoga Retreat is not for everyone, but it is
definitely the ticket for those seriously looking for some peace
and serenity.
</P>
<P>
   For 30 years it has been a tranquil oasis for a steady stream of
people including ex-Beatle George Harrison, Crocodile Dundee star
Linda Kozlowski, high-powered execs, physicians and regular
stressed-out folks like me.
</P>
<P>
   The ashram embraces all ages, nationalities and religions. The
head of the ashram, Swami Omkarananda, who is from Israel,
describes the retreat as ``a greenhouse to learn how to live life
properly. It gives you the right conditions to exercise properly,
breathe properly, eat properly, relax properly and teaches you how
to think positively and to meditate.''
</P>
<P>
   The price is also soothing - $85 a day for a single private room
($70 each for two people in a beach cabin), two vegetarian meals a
day, two two-hour yoga sessions a day (mandatory for guests) and
two two-hour meditations (also mandatory).
</P>
<P>
   Life here is simple.
</P>
<P>
   My room in a rambling wood house, which had a long veranda
facing a coconut palm grove and the ocean, was so small that a man
with long arms could touch the two parallel walls.
</P>
<P>
   The bed was a cotton pallet on a plywood platform. Pickled pine
walls rose to a high ceiling; a large window framed a view of palm
trees; and a ceiling fan and a screen door opening to the veranda
kept the room cool.
</P>
<P>
   At this Bahamas resort, there is no alcohol - you don't sip
margaritas on this beach - no coffee, tea, meat, fish, cigarettes,
radios, TVs or air-conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Bathrooms are off an outside porch and signs tell guests to mop
after use - all the conveniences of home.
</P>
<P>
   It reminded me a lot of the summer camp I went to as a kid, and
I liked it instantly.
</P>
<P>
   What I, and the other campers, didn't like were the cold showers
- not room temperature but cold enough to make you scream for
mercy.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of hot showers ran rampant through the ashram. My new
friend Carl told me he had found a shower with warm water in the
bathrooms near the staff cabins.
</P>
<P>
   Exhilarated at this news, I immediately went there and stood
under the shower-head ready for hot water that would soothe my
aching thighs. Not only was there no hot water, there was no water
at all.
</P>
<P>
   At that point it was hot water or nothing, so I went back to one
of the showers in the main house and poured out a plastic gallon
jug of mineral water, filled it with hot water from a sink in the
bathroom and poured it over my head in the shower. I discovered I
was a five-gallon-shower person. I even steamed up the mirror,
which must have amazed the person who came behind me.
</P>
<P>
   Another guest told me he walked up the beach to Pirate's Cove
Hotel and used the Jacuzzi.
</P>
<P>
   Guests are expected to wash their plates after meals, and are
given opportunities to help out at the ashram. One day we were told
we could help the staff paint the tiny wooden cabins on the beach.
That's called ``karma yoga,'' selfless service.
</P>
<P>
   The food was simple - whole-wheat pancakes, fruit, cereal and
baked tofu for breakfast, spaghetti, bean soup and salad for
dinner. There were no spices, garlic or onions.
</P>
<P>
   I went from 121 pounds to 118 in three days, and I even cheated
one afternoon and went to the Poop Deck in Nassau for a big plate
of fried cracked conch.
</P>
<P>
   The down-to-earth simplicity of the ashram, not to mention the
experience of seeing your fellow campers at 5:30 a.m., makes for a
relaxed and social group. We ate outdoors on picnic tables and got
to know each other.
</P>
<P>
   My group included two computer experts, a couple in their 30s
from Munich, Germany; a flight attendant from Madrid; a lawyer from
Vienna, Austria; a chic woman in her 20s who worked at a
high-powered modeling agency in New York City; two middle-aged
women from Montreal; a student from Boston; and a man in his 60s,
who was there on the advice of a physician to help cure a bad back.
</P>
<P>
   We had varying degrees of yoga abilities. The man with the bad
back could barely touch his knees, but a young Canadian woman could
balance on her forearms and rest her feet on her head.
</P>
<P>
   A yoga instructor gently reminded us not to be competitive and
helped us into positions, asanas, we couldn't do on our own.
</P>
<P>
   The morning yoga class was held from 8 to 10 a.m. on a wooden
deck overlooking one of the prettiest white sand beaches in Nassau.
Guests at Club Med, which was next door, would come to a standstill
on the beach and watch us.
</P>
<P>
   After brunch at 10 a.m. we were free to go into Nassau or sit on
the beach until the next yoga session at 4 p.m. The ashram is not
accessible by road, but a boatman is available to ferry people
across the harbor to town.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the third day I not only could touch my palms to
the floor but could do some pretzel-type asanas. When I woke up on
the second and third mornings my legs weren't stiff.
</P>
<P>
   And my neck spasm was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Next time, I'll come here for two weeks like most of my fellow
campers, and I'll learn how to touch my feet to my head while
balancing on my forearms.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   The Sivananda Ashram Yoga Retreat: For reservations and
information, call (242) 363-2902. Single rooms in the main house
are $85. Cabins on the beach are $70 each for two people. Tent
sites are $50. Children of all ages are welcome. One of the
instructors had a 15-month-old.
</P>
<P>
   Getting there: Major airlines fly to Nassau and Paradise Island
airports. There is no road access to the ashram, so when you make
reservations ask them to make arrangements for a water taxi from
Nassau to the ashram's pier.

 &HT;    How does Jackie Chan get his kicks?
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ Jackie Chan is conducting a tour of his
broken bones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, three times,'' he says, pointing to his bumpy, pug nose.
``Many teeth, gone,'' he says, touching his chin. ``The shoulder,
the bone comes out.'' He extends his long, but gnarled fingers,
saying, ``Broken, broken, broken,'' as if it were a children's
counting game. ``There, broken,'' he says, gesturing to his right
leg. ``Toes broken and ankle twisted and broken.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely there must be an easier way to make a living. But Chan _
the short, compactly built star of such Hong Kong chop-socky
tumbles as ``Rumble in the Bronx,'' ``Operation Condor'' and ``Mr.
Nice Guy'' _ wouldn't consider it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to show off,'' he says softly during an interview at a
Fort Lauderdale hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Chan, 44, originally named Chan Kong-sang, which means ``Born in
Hong Kong,'' devises and executes all of the daredevil,
gravity-defying and occasionally bone-fracturing action sequences
that have made him Asia's No. 1 box office attraction. And when his
movies get dubbed into English, they bring in additional millions
over here.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a new as-told-to autobiography, ``I Am Jackie Chan: My
Life in Action,'' and his first leading role in a U.S. studio
feature _ ``Rush Hour,'' which opens Friday _ Chan is making his
bid for Hollywood stardom.
</P>
<P>
   More than the money, he wants to conquer Hollywood for the sake
of his people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I can retire,'' says the man who commands $4
million per picture. ``Before, when I make a movie, I want to do
something for myself, for my family. To make my father proud. (Now)
I'm going to do something for my Chinese community.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people are talking about movies, I want them to say, `We
have a Spielberg.' I want to be like Spielberg for China. People
will say, `Jackie, he's conquered Hollywood. He's one of the big
stars in Hollywood now.' Then I'll feel satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not Chan's first assault on American movies. In the
early '80s, he appeared in a tepid action film called ``The Big
Brawl'' and, thanks to pal and admirer Burt Reynolds, he was
featured in ``Cannonball Run'' and ``Cannonball Run II.'' Although
Chan already had some 30 Asian films under his martial arts belt by
then, he became frustrated by Hollywood's ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, nobody listened to me. Everybody thought I was a
new actor,'' he says, rolling his eyes in exasperation. ``I had to
listen to stunt men who worked for only two years, who tell me how
to punch. Now, these days, I can change the stunt men.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Chan remains puzzled by the Hollywood moviemaking
process, and its painstaking emphasis on safety. ``When I'm doing a
stunt, they spend like four hours to make sure a tree doesn't
break.''
</P>
<P>
   Chan is used to self-insuring his Hong Kong movies. Over here,
he has to contend with insurance representatives who have to
approve the stunts and the safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, `Hurry up, hurry up.' The stunt coordinator says,
`Jackie, don't worry. We have time, we have money. The most
important thing is your life.' In Hong Kong, they say, `OK, set up
the camera. Ready, go!' ''
</P>
<P>
   When he directs movies in Asia, Chan works quickly, often
putting in much longer days than American unions allow. In
Hollywood, it is hurry-up-and-wait-in-your-trailer, but Chan uses
the down time to practice his English.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the most important for me,'' he says, with a distinct,
but halting delivery. ``Everybody on the set is fooling around _
ha, ha, ha. Me? I'm in the trailer, working on the dialogue all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, Chan's fans wouldn't care if he fumbled his lines
as long as he kept performing those acrobatic stunts. But he
wonders how long he can keep doing that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I come to Hollywood now,'' Chan explains. ``Besides
making a movie, I want to learn something from Hollywood _ computer
graphics, special effects. When I retire, I want to be an action
director in Hollywood. To teach people how to make my kind of
action, but with special effects.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a logical career progression. Chan's amazing physical
agility _ and some would add his foolhardiness _ began at the age
of 6 1/2, when his cook and cleaning woman parents sent him off to
the Chinese Opera Research Institute for 10 years. He learned
singing, dancing, acting, acrobatics, sword fighting and kung fu,
all under a system of deprivation and corporal punishment that has
been described as Dickensian.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he left school, the opera's popularity had waned,
but Chan found his skills were needed in the Hong Kong movie mill.
He moved up from stuntman to fight choreographer to supporting
roles, playing a villain in kung fu king Bruce Lee's ``Enter the
Dragon.'' When Lee died suddenly in 1973, Chan was tapped as his
successor. Yet it was not until he was allowed to inject movies
with his comic flair _ taking pratfalls and wincing in pain after
throwing punches _ that he rose to stardom.
</P>
<P>
   Chan's Asian fans are known to be fanatical about him. So he is
wary of talking about his personal life, including his 14-year,
on-off marriage to Taiwanese actress Lin Fung-chiao and his
13-year-old son Chen Zuming. In 1985, when he mentioned that he was
dating, a Japanese girl committed suicide. A year later, when
another female fan proposed to him and he turned her down, she
drank a vial of poison. It's not easy being an Asian superstar.
</P>
<P>
   Or to cross over to Hollywood stardom. Chan's latest Asian
movie, ``Who Am I?,'' in which he plays an amnesiac cop tracking
diamond smugglers, was so popular in Singapore it outperformed
``Titanic'' at the box office. In the United States, however, it is
expected to be dumped onto HBO.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different culture,'' says Chan with a mystified shrug.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Rush Hour,'' Chan plays a Hong Kong detective who flies to
Los Angeles to help nab the kidnappers of the Chinese consul's
daughter. He teams up with Chris Tucker, a loose cannon cop
assigned to keep Chan's character out of the way. It's a familiar
antagonistic buddies formula, so geared to American tastes that
Chan doubts it will be popular in Hong Kong. ``We don't like movies
with too much dialogue,'' he notes.
</P>
<P>
   With the release of ``Rush Hour,'' Chan is cautiously, even
nervously, awaiting his American future. ``I tell my manager . . .
if `Rush Hour' is good, everything will be good.''

 &HT;    FSU given money to combat binge drinking
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASEE, Fla. _ Florida State University, named America's No.
1 party school two years ago, announced recently it will receive up
to $750,000 in grants to combat binge drinking.
</P>
<P>
   FSU and nine other schools, including Nebraska, LSU and Georgia
Tech, are eligible for grants totaling $10 million from the Robert
Wood Johnson Foundation, group that supports public health efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the money likely will be used for advertising to counter
heavy marketing by local bars, similar to what's going on with
anti-tobacco advertising in the state, school officials said.
</P>
<P>
   FSU officials said they did not know if they received the money
because of the recent party-school crown conferred by the Princeton
Review, based on student surveys and statistics such as the
freshman dropout rate. FSU slipped to No. 3 in the survey last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wonder about why we get grants,'' said Jon Dalton, FSU vice
president for student affairs. ``I do think Florida State's visible
as a high-profile university, not simply a party school.''
</P>
<P>
   One part of FSU's plan probably will be training beverage
servers when to cut off drinks to people already intoxicated, and
how better to avoid serving underage drinkers. Details will be
worked out by a group including university officials, students,
police and city leaders.
</P>
<P>
   FSU banned open fraternity parties last year. But binge drinking
is still more prevalent in Tallahassee than at the average U.S.
university, a 1997 Harvard survey shows.
</P>
<P>
   The survey defined binge drinking as five drinks in a row during
the past two weeks for men, and four drinks in a row for women.
Nationally, 42 percent of college students acknowledged binge
drinking. At FSU, it was 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Just over half, or 52 percent, of college students nationally
said the main reason they drink is to get drunk. The number at FSU
was 61 percent.
</P>
<P>
   School officials are looking closely at bars near campus _
particularly specials for free drinks or 99-cent cocktails on
certain days of the week. The bars say they welcome the program if
it does not go too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we start restricting normal business competition, such as
saying you can't have specials or happy hour, that's a lot of tax
revenues lost to the city,'' said Steve Bailey, general manager of
Bullwinkle's Tavern in Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Moreli, a 22-year-old FSU student with feet up and sipping a
beer on a bar porch near campus Wednesday afternoon, questioned
whether it was case of overreaction. He said students at Florida
State are not really much different at other large schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are they going to do with all that money?'' Morelli said.
``The more restrictions you put on something, in spite of that,
people are going to want to do it that much more.''

 &HT;    Detectives refused to let case go
 &HT;    By Laylan Copelin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Fourteen years ago, Austin police Detective
David Parkinson had to release murder suspect Richard Alan Woods
because he didn't have the physical evidence to link him to the
abduction, rape and slaying of a 21-year-old Austin woman.
</P>
<P>
   But Parkinson, who initially investigated the 1984 murder of
Lauren Marie McCarty, stayed in touch with Woods. At first, they
talked almost daily. Woods' phone calls to Parkinson's house were
so routine that the officer's children would simply say, ``Daddy,
it's Richard.''
</P>
<P>
   They would talk for hours. Woods would invite Parkinson to visit
him at his South Austin apartment where he lived with his mother _
but he warned him always to come alone. Woods didn't like most
cops. Detectives would wait in the parking lot as their colleague
played a cat-and-mouse game with the street-smart Woods. At times,
Parkinson said, Woods was almost confessional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought he wanted to tell me,'' Parkinson said. ``He
was just showing us that he was in control of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   This week's arrest of Woods is being hailed as a testament to
the wonders of DNA testing. Technology finally advanced so that
police said they now can match hair, blood and saliva samples taken
from Woods 14 years ago with a minuscule amount of physical
evidence _ no more than a pinpoint _ from the murder scene. Yet
this week's arrest also is the culmination of a tale of two
detectives, Parkinson, now a lieutenant, and Sgt. Paul Johnson, who
wouldn't let go of the case even as Woods played games with the
minds and emotions of investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he had any sympathy for his victims,'' Johnson
said Wednesday. ``He may have felt the need to brag _ but not to
clear his conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarty's abduction just a week before Christmas 1984 stunned
the city. She had left work at the Texas Municipal Court Training
Center at 812 San Antonio St. to mail some letters and eat a late
lunch, police said. Officers believed she made it to the post
office, but they could not trace her from there. For six days, the
police and McCarty's family searched but found nothing. Finally, an
officer spotted her car behind Westgate Shopping Center. Her body,
bludgeoned and stabbed, was in the trunk. She was wearing only her
lavender T-shirt, and her hands were bound.
</P>
<P>
   The police quickly targeted Woods, a former mental patient with
a violent past, as their primary suspectafter two women said they
saw a man who looked like Woods in the parking lot of McCarty's
office. Other witnesses said Woods had told them that he had
committed ``five felonies in one,'' without ever saying what he
did.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks after the slaying, police questioned Woods but had
to let him go. Investigators hoped to match samples, especially
blood, from McCarty's car and body with the hair, blood and saliva
taken from Woods. The tests _ rudimentary by today's standards _
could not make a match, especially because McCarty had been dead
for six days. The police were left with a circumstantial case with
no physical evidence tying Woods to McCarty or to her car.
</P>
<P>
   They had to let him walk.
</P>
<P>
   The police were convinced that they were in a deadly race with
time before Woods would be charged in another crime. They lost the
race in 1986 _ just a little more than a year after McCarty's death
_ when Woods was convicted of the sexual assault of a woman. He was
sentenced to 15 years in prison. From prison, Woods stayed in touch
with Parkinson, writing him frequently.
</P>
<P>
   That same year Parkinson transferred from homicide, but he
returned in 1992 as a homicide lieutenant. Austin police, however,
never closed the McCarty file. As is common procedure, the unsolved
homicide case was handed off several times as new detectives
rotated into the division.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Johnson inherited the case. There was a greater sense
of urgency than ever before because Johnson knew Woods would soon
be released on parole. Yet the detective had nothing new to go on.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many years go by, and it's unlikely you'll find new
witnesses or new physical evidence,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   But he found a notation in the file that gave him hope.
</P>
<P>
   Four years earlier, in 1993, a detective had the state crime lab
try again to match Woods' hair, blood and saliva samples to the
evidence from the crime scene. The technology had improved enough
that the scientists found microscopic evidence from someone other
than the victim. But it had not improved enough to link it to
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson first phoned the state lab a year ago to see whether the
technology had advanced to the point that the link from a pinpoint
of evidence could be made. Not yet, he was told. Perhaps in a few
months.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Johnson transferred from the homicide division this
year, he kept calling the lab. ``I had started it,'' Johnson said.
``I wanted to finish it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Woods was released from prison this year, first to a
halfway house in El Paso, then to one in Austin. When he came to
the Police Department to register as a sex offender, as required by
law, he asked to see Parkinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We visited for about three hours,'' Parkinson said. Woods
continued to tease his investigator. ``He almost told me, then
said, `I've got to go away and think about it,''' Parkinson said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Unknown to Woods, time was running out. The state had purchased
10 new genetic analyzers, at a cost of $780,000, that could
decipher DNA from the minuscule amount of decayed material. DNA _
deoxyribonucleic acid _ is an essential ingredient in human cells.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a state lab technician paged Johnson, now working as
a street detective. The test matched Woods to the evidence. There
is a 1-in-16,000 chance that the samples could match anyone else,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt terrific,'' Johnson said. ``You get your hopes up that
maybe, after all these years, you can do something.''
</P>
<P>
   But where to find Woods, who had been released from the halfway
house? The police found him nearby: in jail, charged this month
with an aggravated robbery of a woman in Zilker Park.
</P>
<P>
   After 14 years, the low-key Parkinson was surprised by the
melancholy he felt. ``You expect to feel happy, and you do,'' he
said. ``But all you can remember is a poor girl who died.''

 &HT;    A winner by design
 &HT;    By John Maher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It's no accident that Roddy Foreman is having
his best year in power boat racing, capturing another national
championship recently. But an accident last year, the most
frightening one of his 17 years of racing, helped make his current
dream season possible.
</P>
<P>
   Foreman, an architect of network design and messaging systems
for IBM, races power boats in the SST-60 class. The boats aren't as
big and bad as Miss Budweiser and other roostertail-spewing
monsters in the unlimited hydroplane class, but SST-60 boats can
still have their 800 pounds whipped over the water at speeds in
excess of 100 mph by their 170-horsepower motors.
</P>
<P>
   Foreman said that in the course of his racing career he has had
his boat blown over backwards and done some barrel rolls. But in
the very first event last year, his boat apparently hit something,
suffered a puncture and then went violently out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly it just spun and flipped; it just exploded,'' Foreman
recalled. Although he wasn't hurt too badly, the boat was lost. A
six-time national champion and former world champion, Foreman had
his worst season as he missed events while trying to find another
boat.
</P>
<P>
   A friend, Kevin Beaulier, designed a new boat for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cockpit is offset to the left, and the boat turns on a
dime,'' Foreman said. ``We feel we have an advantage. We've been
able to dominate.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreman's new boat has become the talk of the circuit as he's
won nine of the 11 races he has entered this year. He said that
several competitors have already tried to come up with something
similar, but haven't yet been able to match its performance. Once,
he said, when the boat was left unattended out of the water, he
returned to find someone underneath it going over it with a tape
measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are pretty competitive,'' Foreman said. ``We try to
keep the boat covered and under lock and key.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to having the best boat on the water, Foreman said,
``I think my experience helps. My driving has improved every year.
I think it was Dale Earnhardt who said you learn something every
race.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weekends ago, in Kankakee, Ill., Foreman won another
national championship. This past weekend in Clarksville, Tenn., he
finished second in what is the next-to-last event of the season for
him. He's already wrapped up the point championships for both the
American Performance Racing Series and the American Power Boat
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Foreman said, ``It's been a dream of mine to accomplish what
I've done this year.

 &HT;    Travel story on Trail's End, Minnesota
 &HT;    By Chris Riemenschneider
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRAIL'S END, Minn. _ It's abundantly clear paddling into the
Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness that the name refers to more
than just the border between the United States and Canada. This is
the boundary line past which superfluous things like money and cars
and TV Guide don't matter _ or even are usable. What's needed
instead is a desire for serenity and the hope of setting aside
``real life,'' as if it gets any more real than this.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a light canoe helps in that quest, as we found out
the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   This wilderness encompasses more than one million acres of
glacial waterways and thick, Crayola-green forest near where Lake
Superior ends and Minnesota's land of 10,000 other lakes begins.
It's an unspoiled land, the kind you see in old Hamm's Beer signs
(''From the land of sky blue waters'') and history films on
explorers looking for a passageway west.
</P>
<P>
   Two hundred years after the first explorers arrived, the canoe _
man's original sport utility vehicle _ is still the only way to get
around in the Boundary Waters. There are 12,000 miles of canoe
routes within its boundaries, but no roads. Hiking trails are few
and far between. Motorboats aren't allowed, though the lack of
roads would contain them on the outermost lakes anyway.
</P>
<P>
   There's even a law limiting airplanes from flying overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, it's a wild place and has the wildlife to prove it.
Moose, timber wolves, black bears, bald eagles and beavers reside
in this rocky, glacier-scraped land. The most prevalent creature,
however, is the operatic loon, which is to Minnesotans what an
armadillo is to Texans. The peaceful, high-pitched calls these
red-eyed, black- and-white-speckled ducks regularly make are the
stuff of Zen nature tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Having grown up in Minnesota, I knew the deep, inner pull of the
Boundary Waters by the time I was 13. Years later _ 11since I had
last been there and 10 since I moved to Texas and found out the
unnatural dullness that is a manmade lake _ I let the placid,
unbridled appeal of the Boundary Waters pull me in once more.
</P>
<P>
   Four of us, including my dad, brother and a friend from Austin
who had never been in a canoe, were going in for four nights. Some
visitors do two-nighters. Some do two-monthers. Theoretically,
excluding a few minor obstacles such as winter and hunger, a
paddler could start at one of the Boundary Waters' 86 entry points
and keep paddling for a year without seeing the same lake twice.
</P>
<P>
   Four nights and 20 of the 1,100 lakes were enough for us,
though, and we made the reservations that would solidify that plan.
</P>
<P>
   Reservations are required for each entry point to prevent
overcrowding and to ensure that campsites will be available for
everyone. The most popular entries generally fill up months in
advance, so the policy requires that you plan ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The entire nature of the Boundary Waters calls for planning,
though. Before you leave, you've got to figure out the food
situation: ``Let' s see, if we have freeze-dried spaghetti on
Tuesday, will we want the dehydrated chicken teriyaki on
Wednesday?'' Then comes packing, which requires waterproofing
everything, as well as finding a bag for the food that can be hung
between two trees at night so bears can't get to it. Many
wilderness outfitters in northern Minnesota have guide services
that will take care of all of this for you, but, of course, you pay
a lot for what could otherwise be an inexpensive vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Having borrowed one canoe _ an aluminum one _ we got up at 5
a.m. and left the Twin Cities for our destination near Trail's End,
about 15 miles from the Canadian border. After the breathtaking
drive along Lake Superior's North Shore and up the historic
Gunflint Trail, made of logging roads and trails carved by 18th-
and 19th-century French trappers, we said goodbye to the Blazer. A
nearby outfitter, which had dropped off a second aluminum canoe at
our first lake, charged $20 a day for the Alumacraft. The extra $15
a day a lighter Kevlar model would have cost us seemed like a fee
for wimps in this rugged land.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what we thought until our first portage.
</P>
<P>
   Portages are the pesky stretches of land that get in the way of
your paddling and require you to carry your canoes and equipment.
The most popular routes are generally the ones with the least
and/or smallest of these paths, but we chose our paddling loop
based on scenery. The only time we regretted this decision was when
we were grunting and puffing with a canoe resting on our shoulders,
like turtles clumsily carrying their shells made of aluminum.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day, that occurred often. First, we had a 3/4-mile
portage between Round and Missing Link lakes. Soon after, came the
1 1/2-miles portage to Tuscarora _ the longest on our trip, which
took us about two hours. Two long hours.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard work, but as we learned when we pulled up to our
remote, picturesque campsite, the portages were worth it.
</P>
<P>
   The Boundary Waters campsites are dutifully designed. Each comes
with a fire grate surrounded by chairs (OK, they're just logs you
sit on), two or three flat spots for tents, and the obligatory
latrine, which amounts to a hole in the ground covered by a plastic
or wood box. Hey, it works.
</P>
<P>
   The campsites, like the portages, are noted on the must-buy
Boundary Waters topographical maps (available at ranger stations
and outfitting stores). The sites are first-come, first-serve,
which meant we missed out on the island spot we wanted on Tuscarora
Lake but landed one nearby on a point that was just as scenic. The
thing you eventually learn in the Boundary Waters is that no matter
the entry point, lake or campsite where you end up , it's all good.
Each camping spot, for instance, is set up out of sight and earshot
from all others, so it appears you have the lake to yourself.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly how we felt that first night as the sun set,
offering colors thought only possible on canvas or in Technicolor.
We dipped our sweaty bodies into the lake water, clean enough to
drink (though we, like many, used a filter-pump to be safe) and
cool enough to feel it deep down inside. For certain latitude
reasons, the western horizon stayed lit until past 10 that night,
and we savored every minute of it.
</P>
<P>
   Here, you have to take nature as it comes, which meant that
instead of the Northern Lights we had hoped to see after nightfall,
we got swarms of mosquitos. Throughout the trip, even after we
coated ourselves with mysteriously strong bug spray that my dad
proudly boasted was taken off the market, the mosquitos and the
biting black flies continued to bother us. If they weren't biting
us, they were flying in our mouths every time we tried to complain
about them. We were told it was an especially bad year, but the
bugs are always something to prepare for when headed to the
Boundary Waters.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, we woke up and tried to get something besides
the bugs to bite: preferably the tasty walleye. Other common fish
in the Boundary Waters include small-mouth bass, lake trout and
northern pike (just ``northerns'' to northerners). After finding a
still, hidden pond connected to Tuscarora Lake by a small channel,
we cast. Eventually, Fisherman Dad was the only one who got lucky,
reeling in a three- pound northern. Satisfied we had some fillets
for dinner, we headed to our next campsite.
</P>
<P>
   We spent the next two nights on Gillis Lake, taking more time to
fish and go on a day-trip. That meant paddling without all the
equipment. It also meant we were able to cover about 16 gorgeous
miles in one day, taking in the rather large and island-strewn
Little Saganaga Lake (you should see the big Saganaga) and spotting
a nervous moose calf, a nesting bald eagle and one working beaver
in the same outing. Despite a couple more hours of fishing, we only
caught one more northern. It was good enough to spice up the
freeze-dried dinner, but the real treat was the hours spent
floating from lake to lake, like wanderers without a purpose.
</P>
<P>
   By the final night, we had a purpose: to get beer. After a long
haul completing our loop, which meant crossing a total of eight,
mostly short portages and nine small lakes, we returned to our
starting point, near our beer-packed Blazer, and camped nearby.
</P>
<P>
   While still beautiful, this final night was too much like a
typical camping experience. Gone was the feeling of total
isolation, the equal parts thrill and uneasiness that the nearest
phone _ heck, the nearest buzz of electricity _ was at least 20
miles away by canoe, and that you were ruled by the water.
</P>
<P>
   If there's a place that offers more solitude and beauty in the
lower 48 states, take me there. And then strap a canoe to my back,
because I'm convinced paddling is the best way to be carried into
wild territory, carried across that boundary.
</P>
<P>
   Next time I go, though, I'm going to seriously think about the
lighter canoes. IF YOU GO: WHAT: Boundary Waters Canoe Area
Wilderness reservations: A must. Call (800) 745-3399. Check permit
availability at www.bwrc.com. GETTING THERE: Northwest Airlines and
several other carriers offer flights into Minneapolis/St. Paul and
Duluth. From the Twin Cities, most Boundary Waters' entry points
are four to five hours by car. From Duluth, most are one to two
hours away. WHEN TO GO: June-August is warm enough for shorts and
swimming. The tradeoff in April-May or September-October is that
the bugs aren' t around. Winter months are for (brave)
cross-country skiers only. WHERE TO GO: With 86 entry points, the
possibilities are endless. The most popular areas from which to
start are off the Gunflint Trail (Minnesota Highway 12), near the
town of Ely or in the Sawbill Lake area. MORE INFORMATION: The
Gunflint Trail Association, (800) 338-6932 or

   He got one.
</P>
<P>
   And on the dinner menu at B-Bar-B Ranch Inn, which Young and
wife Patti own and operate, you can now try the fried rabbit. Or
the quail stuffed with nilgai antelope sausage and rice. Or the
redfish you caught this morning. Or Chef Normand's crab cakes. In
fact, there' s no group too small, nor pig so big that the B-Bar-B
won't take it on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our breakfast specialty is Eggs B-Bar-B,'' Luther Young said.
``That's a poached egg, but instead of Canadian bacon, it's on
nilgai sausage. We use a biscuit instead of an English muffin and
gravy instead of hollandaise sauce.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't be fooled into thinking that B-Bar-B is just about
gourmet variations of wild game dinners. It's also about gourmet
variations of wild game dinners in a rustic lodge atmosphere in the
heart of South Texas, on the edge of Mexico, less than four hours
from Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a man's kind of lodge,'' says Patti Young,
pointing out the mounts of birds and animals, hunting prints and
skin rugs that decorate B-Bar-B's main living area.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you'd be surprised at how many women like it, too. It's a
place to get away but still experience South Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the getaway just keeps getting better, as the Youngs
take B-Bar-B from its beginnings as a hunting lodge into a
year-round resort stop for hunters, birders, tourists and adults
just wanting to hide out in comfort for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of our business is still hunters from September
into February,'' says Luther Young. They come to hunt the famed
King Ranch or other ranches in the area and turn to B-Bar-B as a
place to stay. Young also trains and handles bird dogs, booking and
running quail hunts for individuals or groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lots of people who come at different times of the year
just for the birds,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can stay here and go to Padre Island or onto the King
Ranch to watch birds. This is one place you can come and see the
ferruginous pygmy owls on the King Ranch. The tour bus picks you up
right at the door in the morning and drops you off later in the
day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Youngs only recently have expanded the sleeping quarters at
B- Bar-B Ranch, converting an old warehouse into another cluster of
rooms and suites, featuring wooden floors, Luther's hand-made cedar
log beds and Mexican furniture, huge sunken tubs and even
his-and-hers bath robes for their guests.
</P>
<P>
   My wife and I recently spent three days at the ranch, just to
escape for a little while. We fished in nearby Baffin Bay, visited
the Connor Museum on the campus of Texas A&AMP;M University-Kingsville
and enjoyed the food Chef Normand served for dinner _ which
included a crab and corn chowder that was the best soup I've ever
eaten.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea is for people to be able to enjoy themselves,''
Luther Young said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can arrange for you to go fishing, bird hunting or
watching, or you can just sit out by the pool and enjoy South
Texas. It's a great place to get away.''
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO:
</P>
<P>
   Take Interstate 35 south to San Antonio and Interstate 37 to
U.S. 77 South. Eight miles south of Kingsville, turn left on
Kleberg County Road 2215.
</P>
<P>
   Standard rooms are $85 per night, and suites range from
$110-$125. A conference room is available for $50 per day.
Breakfast for two is included in the price of the room. Other meals
should be scheduled with B-Bar-B staff. Prices range up to $25 per
person. Anyone can make reservations for dinner on Friday and
Saturday evenings. Wine, beer and mixed drinks are extra. There is
an extensive wine list.
</P>
<P>
   B-Bar-B will cater meals for groups numbering in the hundreds.
(Example: A pig roast for a minimum of 100 is $10 per person,
including dessert, tea, salad and side dishes.)
</P>
<P>
   Visa, MasterCard, Discover, cash, personal checks and travelers
checks are accepted.
</P>
<P>
   No children under 12. Pets can stay in B-Bar-B kennels, but
owners must bring inoculation proof.

 &HT;    WOODWORKING COLUMN: New book praised by writer
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Taunton Press's coffee table book for this holiday season is
``The Art of Fine Tools,'' by Sandor Nagyszalanczy, and it is a
truly beautiful work from every standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy is perhaps the finest pure writer of all woodworking
authors; he was an editor at Fine Woodworking for a good many years
before packing it in to return to his own shop. He must have had a
wonderful time putting this book together.
</P>
<P>
   At $37 in hardcover, is it scarcely overpriced. Any lover of
fine tools, especially old fine tools, will be hard put to be
without it. The tools shown, all in lovely color, range from
hammers dating to about 55 B.C. to the exquisite miniatures being
made by Phil Hamler in Snellville.
</P>
<P>
   I've got a couple of nice Starett rules, one and two-footers. I
paid a fairly high price for them. They look like a kid's first
measuring stick compared to the 12-inch rule made in 1849 of ivory
with a frieze of mostly mythical figures in gilt copper let into
the side.
</P>
<P>
   In the days when plastic was new, it was all the rage. Perhaps
the most remarkable example of this is a fancily-boxed Bakelite
six-foot tape measure, called, curiously enough, the Lady's Man
pocket tape measure.
</P>
<P>
   There is a collection of dancing master calipers, mostly
shop-made in the 18th and 19th centuries, in the shape of human
legs, sometimes with stockings, garters and boots engraved on them.
</P>
<P>
   An unexpected delight are the axes, often astonishing in form
and beautiful in execution. Among the most remarkable of the latter
is the 18th-century boarding ax, ornately decorated and intended
not for chopping wood but for bloody mayhem in hand-to-hand combat
during the boarding of an enemy ship.
</P>
<P>
   An entire section is devoted to Asian tools. Most of these, of
course, are Japanese, but the most wonderfully ornate are the
Indonesian and Indian planes.
</P>
<P>
   Another section is given over to amazing and even bizarre
mechanical contrivances. There are several pages devoted to the
Holtzapffel ornamental lathe, but more charming are things like the
tool that is, at once, a try square with a bevel gauge, a level, a
marking gauge, a butt gauge and a small rabbet plane.
</P>
<P>
   The most enchanting of all, however, is the section on decorated
tools. here we have planes with carved dragon heads rearing up from
their leading edges. There is everything from the most primitive
but earnest European country chip carving to very sophisticated
carving and inlay. An early French brace has a photograph of a man
let into its head, protected by isinglass.
</P>
<P>
   In the miniature section, there is no work finer than that of
Hamler; indeed, several pages are devoted to his exquisite _ and
very expensive _ work. All of Hamler's miniatures are complete
working models, not mere dummies. Sandy reports that Hamler's 4
1/2-inch model of the complicated Tidey Patent plane, intended to
bevel two edges of a board at once, recently sold at auction for
$27,000.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I could go on and on about this book, but you get the
idea. A very fine Christmas present for any tool freak.

A GUIDE TO THE QUICKIE STARR PAPERBACKS  
</HEADLINE>
  By TIMOTHY NOAH 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Flytrap aficionados will need to purchase one of the three
paperback versions of the Starr report, which hit the stores
Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   They are Pocket Books ($5.99), Prima ($9.99) and the Washington
Post's Public Affairs edition ($10).
</P>
<P>
   Here's how they match up:
</P>
<P>
   Format: The Washington Post edition) is a trade paperback, with
bigger-sized pages and a more pliant spine. Unlike the other two
editions, it can be stretched out and laid on a table while you
munch a sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   Introductory material: In the Pocket Books version, Phil Kuntz
of the Wall Street Journal writes a five-page intro that is an
economical-but-thorough explanation of how a 1992 New York Times
story about Whitewater by Jeff Gerth led to a 1998 report about
Monica Lewinsky by Ken Starr. This is precisely what readers will
need to be reminded about, especially in a few years, when the
details become hazy in everybody's mind.
</P>
<P>
   Fairness: The Pocket Books and Post versions both reprint the
preliminary rebuttal from Clinton's lawyer. The Prima version does
not. None of the three paperback versions contains the rebuttal
Clinton's lawyers produced after they actually had a chance to read
the report.
</P>
<P>
   Did Journalists Get Rich Off This?: The Pocket Books version
earned Kuntz an undisclosed sum, but he won't be getting royalties.
The Post reporters whose articles are being reprinted in the Post
edition won't get paid at all, because they don't own their
stories. The Prima version contains no material from journalists at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Overall Winner: The Post version, entirely on the grounds that
it's a trade paperback. But the Pocket Books version is the more
practical choice for those who don't need to worry about eyestrain.
The Prima version places a distant third.

   1. BONES PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF TORTURE Many men and women seeking
political asylum claim to have been tortured. But because their
injuries may have been inflicted months, even years earlier, it is
often difficult to confirm their stories with a medical exam or
standard x-ray studies. Sceptical immigration officials, citing the
lack of physical evidence, may reject their asylum requests.
Austrian researchers now report that a bone-imaging technique
called scintigraphy, which is able to detect subtle bone damage,
can be used to corroborate many such claims, even if the beatings
occurred years earlier. By M. McCarthy. The Lancet News Service.
1,000 words 2. DON'T LET DISTASTE ENDANGER THE PRESIDENCY The issue
is no longer Bill Clinton's behaviour and evident character flaws.
It is about governance and constitutional precedent, not so much
the President but the presidency. The paralysis of the White House
sex-and-lies scandal is striking not only the U.S., but all the
countries affected by its role in the world. In the desire to
punish Clinton, should the U.S. and indeed the rest of the world be
punished by distorting or incapacitating the U.S. political system?
By Flora Lewis. 800 words. 3. FOR LEWINSKY, IT WAS ABOUT THE CAREER
LADDER The most striking revelation of the Starr report is the
lurid detail it goes into - not about sex, but about jobs. Large
parts of the report are devoted to Monica Lewinsky's career
pursuits and reveal her ambitious streak. There should be a term
connoting the opposite of sexual harassment : When a person of less
power uses her sexual attractiveness or personal relationship with
a person of greater power to get ahead. By Katie Roiphe. New York
Times Op-Ed. 800 words. 4. IN NURSES' LIVES, A TREASURE TROVE OF
HEALTH DATA More than 20 years ago, a doctor in the U.S., curious
about the effects of long-term oral contraceptive use, sent
questionnaires to 370,000 registered nurses. The answers since
received have turned into the largest and longest study ever of a
group of women. With many of the original participants now entering
their 60s and 70s, the study promises an even greater wealth of
knowledge, much of it otherwise unattainable, about how a lifetime
of choices in food, drink, exercise and medications can translate
into protection from or increased risk of deadly and debilitating
diseases. By Carol Kaesuk Yoon. New York Times Science Times. 2,000
words.
</P>
<P>
   5. START A CONVERSATION AND KEEP IT GOING The tips in this quiz
will help you develop the skill of talking to anyone about
anything. By Valerie Sokolosky. From Spirit magazine. 1,000 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 6.
PREVENTING MULTIPLE MISCARRIAGE Losing a pregnancy once is
miserable enough, but going through it repeatedly, without a clue
as to why, is sheer emotional torture. Fortunately, doctors are
discovering that multiple miscarriages may be easier to prevent
than was once thought. By Suzanne B. Gleason. From Child magazine.
1,200 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 7.
POPULAR RELEASE OF BUTTERFLIES PUTS TROUBLE IN THE AIR Some brides
and grooms in the U.S. are not showered with traditional rice or
confetti when they leave church -- they are surrounded by hundreds
of butterflies. It is the latest fashion at weddings and sometimes
at memorial services, grand openings, divorces and prison releases.
But while some people may view the release of butterflies as an
uplifting celebration of natural beauty, others see it as a
misguided practice that poses serious risks. By Carol Kaesuk Yoon.

people at using sounds rather than sights to map space, some

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: SUMMER'S FADING STARR
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Sept. 20.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the end, public opinion may decide whether
President Clinton serves out the rest of his term. But, for now,
public opinion is having little impact on the nasty doings here.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of new stuff out there that's still going to
come out,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch told me, even as House Republicans
were tossing more dirt from Ken Starr's deep multimedia pits to a
ravenous press corps.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the Utah Republican had sought to persuade his
friend, the independent counsel, to show up for a CBS ``60
Minutes'' interview in order to counter White House assertions that
Starr was a vindictive creep.
</P>
<P>
   By September, the drama had moved to the point that Clinton's
lawyers were going on TV talk shows to claim they were normal
people, despite their convoluted definitions of Clinton's
extramarital sex life.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not where this sad drama will remain.
</P>
<P>
   All the video screens and all the paper pulp in the world that
gird the pundits' huge daily fix cannot alter the next step: a vote
in early October by the 37-member House Judiciary Committee over
whether to pursue impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The real issue facing the panel's chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde of
Illinois, is how many, if any, of the committee's Democrats would
go along with a request to the full House for authority to open
such a formal review.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, with the political roles reversed, an adroit Democrat,
New Jersey's Peter Rodino, persuaded six Republicans on his
committee to support one of three impeachment counts lodged against
Richard Nixon. At the time, Rodino thought that was the minimum he
needed to spread a bipartisan cloak over those historic events.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde knows he can throw only so much political red meat to the
party's rabid anti-Clinton wing, because major Republican errors of
timing and judgment could ``nationalize'' the November election
over the impeachment issue.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than a rout of dispirited Democrats that's now assumed,
voters could then send Clinton's tormentors (including the media)
another message. If that happens, Rep. John Conyers Jr. of Michigan
would steer the 1999 investigation, in the unlikely event that he
finds anything to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Should Hyde remain at the helm after November, his likely
priority would be to broaden the probe beyond Starr's
lying-about-sex package. Both Hyde and Speaker Newt Gingrich have
told confidants that they won't go before the Senate and prosecute
a case against Clinton on Starr's laundry list alone.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, of course, Clinton's
``I've-been-hired-to-do-this-job'' strategy may also need to be
updated. Should the campaign finance questions that Hyde will want
to examine directly hit a legal artery, then a fresh line of
defense will be required. And should a former Little Rock lawyer
who is married to the president become a criminal target, public
sympathy could turn against the First Couple.
</P>
<P>
   One possible scenario: Clinton makes Al Gore acting president
while he undergoes therapy for clinical depression. Impeachment
proceedings are put on hold. Some weeks later, doctors pronounce
Clinton cured, to the great joy of the people.
</P>
<P>
   Please stay tuned.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Awash in 'lost' episodes and manuscripts
 &HT;    (For release Sept. 20, 1998)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Late at night, awakened by a dog's bark or a painful indication
from my bladder, I sometimes find it difficult to return to sleep.
To abet slumber, I usually go to the front room and turn to one of
those non-network cable stations to watch reruns of decades-old
sitcoms, those being slightly more sleep-inducing than a West Coast
baseball game.
</P>
<P>
   It is there that I come across what TV syndicators have come to
describe as lost episodes. There are lost episodes of ``The
Honeymooners,'' lost episodes of ``I Love Lucy,'' lost episodes of
just about any timeworn sitcom that markets cheaply for 2 a.m. or
so viewing.
</P>
<P>
   Television is not alone in this gambit. The book publishing and
music industries have long been practicing the art of finding
previously lost or, more likely, discarded efforts by authors and
composers.
</P>
<P>
   Even baseball statistics freaks are getting into the act. This
summer, when a player looked like he might break the existing
runs-batted-in record of Hack Wilson, not one but two ``lost''
runs-batted-in were claimed on his behalf by a surviving member of
Wilson's 1930 team.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, it was announced that Ernest Hemingway's last
unpublished book is going to be published, coincidentally in time
for the 100th anniversary of his birth next July.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the fourth posthumous book by Hemingway, who
committed suicide in 1961, and like others, I wonder if they had
not been published during his lifetime because he did not want them
published. Perhaps he did not think them worthy of publication.
</P>
<P>
   When it was revealed in August that ``True at First Light''
would be published, it was said this really was the last
unpublished Hemingway, the previous last posthumous book being
``The Garden of Eden'' in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   I would find it hard to imagine that Hemingway was working on
all these books at the same time. So, if they were incomplete at
the time of his death, it must have been for a reason. I would
suspect that reason was that Hemingway thought little of his work,
may even have killed himself in despondency over the unfinished
manuscripts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Garden of Eden'' was not a success. No less than
Hemingway's granddaughter Lorian, reviewing ``Eden'' for Rolling
Stone in 1986, wrote that the novel ``is as dead as the man. ... It
is not just bad. It is God-awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Quote and unquote.
</P>
<P>
   As described by the future publishers, ``True at First Light''
was 850 pages long until pared by Hemingway's 70-year-old son
Patrick. Similarly, ``The Garden of Eden'' was 1,500 pages until
the editors got their hands on it.
</P>
<P>
   The drama behind this latest book, a fictionalized account of
one of Hemingway's African safaris, is that the manuscript has been
under seal in two libraries since his widow, Mary, went to Havana
to retrieve it after his death. In the intervening years, according
to the story, only relatives, scholars and publishers have cast
eyes on the manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   When I think of all the tender care Hemingway gave to his ``Old
Man and the Sea,'' the careful massaging of words and sentences
over and over until it was near perfection, I cannot accept that
someone other than Hemingway, son or not, can prune 1,500 of the
master's words into a book worthy of the Ernest Hemingway name.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever had the audacity to finish Gilbert Stuart's portrait
of George Washington, and I don't believe anyone should be messing
with Hemingway's unfinished work.
</P>
<P>
   We've already got too many ``lost'' Hemingways.

</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL-SYMPHONY _ WASHINGTON _ When National Symphony
Orchestra conductor Leonard Slatkin decided to focus on Beethoven's
choral work for his second Beethoven festival, who would he call
but Atlanta's own Robert Shaw? Pegged to this weekend's (Sept.
17-19) Kennedy Center performances, we observe the 82-year-old
cultural institution at work. We'll catch final ``Missa Solemnis''

him at his suite at the Watergate. (Brock, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) WITH PHOTO. ETA 8 p.m. ET.
</P>
<P>
   MORRISON-SOUTH _ Toni Morrison will read from ``Paradise'' at
the Georgia State University conference on Toni Morrison and the
South. Brief interview with Carolyn Denard, organizer of the event,

writer's Nobel-winning work. (Warmbold, Atlanta

<P>
   LIFESTYLE
</P>
<P>
   SIBLEY-COLUMN _ If you or any of your relatives took pictures at
the ``Gone With the Wind'' premiere in December 1939, Herb Bridges
wants to hear from you. He's putting together a book about the
premiere, to be published in 1999. (Sibley, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) ETA 8 p.m. ET.
</P>
<P>
   FASHION-LANG _ Day 4 of the New York Fashion Scene. Designers:
Helmut Lang (1 p.m.); Searle ( 2:30 p.m.); Violet (4 p.m.) (Walton,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution) ETA 8 p.m. ET.
</P>
<P>
   WARNER-ON-WOOD _ The Taunton Press's coffee table book for this
holiday season is ``The Art of Fine Tools,'' by Sandor
Nagyszalanczy, and it is a truly beautiful work from every
standpoint. Sandy is perhaps the finest pure writer of all
woodworking authors. (Warner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   COLLEGE-DRINKING _ TALLAHASEE _ Florida State University, named
America's No. 1 party school two years ago, announced recently it
will receive up to $750,000 in grants to combat binge drinking. FSU
and nine other schools, including Nebraska, LSU and Georgia Tech,
are eligible for grants totaling $10 million from the Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation, group that supports public health efforts.
(Elmore, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL
</P>
<P>
   SCANDINAVIA _ OSLO, Norway _ On balance, we visit Scandinavia
for the pretty scenery and the pretty people. Yet Scandinavia
deserves an extended stay. Because these countries were spared the
full brunt of modern wars, their physical pasts remain remarkably
intact. Thus, the culturally curious visitor should make special
efforts to visit some small historical or art museums in the cities
of Oslo, Bergen, Stockholm and Copenhagen. (Barnes, Austin
American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   CALIFORNIA _ SAN FRANCISCO _ The descriptive term
``breathtaking'' is overused. Admit it, we all hate it. The canopy
of trees was breathtaking. Her beauty was breathtaking. The new
Mazda is breathtaking. Nonetheless, I'm traveling north on the
Pacific Coast Highway through Big Sur and I can't think of any
other word to describe the cragged cliffs, the crushing sea as it
meets the rocks. (Kallenberg, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Montreal offers a pleasant mix of European and
American sensibilities and features. With its museums, first-class
shops and ethnic neighborhoods, it does resemble a cleaner, smaller
New York. And because of its French heritage and largely
French-speaking population, Montreal does have a European flair.
(Breyer/Seaborn, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-YOGA _ NASSAU, Bahamas _ The boom of a gong pierced the
silence of the night promptly at 5:30 a.m., which is mighty early
on Paradise Island. This is the time to go to bed after a night at
the casinos and bars, not to get up to meditate and to do yoga
positions that turn your body into a pretzel. Do people really want
to do this on vacation? (Blackerby, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TRAILSEND _ TRAIL'S END, Minn. _ It's clear paddling into the
Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness that the name refers to more
than just the border between the United States and Canada. This is
the boundary line past which superfluous things like money and cars
and TV Guide don't matter _ or even are usable. Of course, a light
canoe helps in that quest, as we found out the hard way.
(Riemenschneider, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   KINGSVILLE-TX _ The getaway just keeps getting better, as the
Youngs take B-Bar-B in Kingsville, Texas, from its beginnings as a
hunting lodge into a year-round resort stop for hunters, birders,
tourists and adults just wanting to hide out in comfort for a few
days. (Leggett, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   SCIENCE/MEDICINE
</P>
<P>
   PHYSICAL-EXAMS _ The annual physical has become more than just
checking for blood pressure and heart condition. There is a growing
list of tests directed at a specific age. When should one have a
colon screen? What about the frequency of complete blood workups
and what does ``complete'' mean. (Martin, Austin
American-Statesman) ETA 8 p.m. ET.
</P>
<P>
   DNA-OLDSLAYING _ AUSTIN, Texas _ This week's arrest of a suspect
in a murder many years old is being hailed as a testament to the
wonders of DNA testing. Yet this week's arrest also is the
culmination of a tale of two detectives, Parkinson, now a
lieutenant, and Sgt. Paul Johnson, who wouldn't let go of the case
even as Woods played games with the minds and emotions of
investigators. (Copelin, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Remembering the warmth of a
mother's kitchen
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (''Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in which readers share
their stories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or at
least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   Who can recall what you did with the pan after your mother
finished baking cookies or cake? John C. Westervelt of Tulsa,
Okla., remembers it in delightful detail. Here's his story:
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother, a home economics teacher, made the best angel food
cake in town during the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   ``A steady hand was a must to separate the whites from the yolks
of a dozen fresh eggs. An egg was cracked over a bowl and the yolk
was poured back and forth between the two half shells until only
the yolk remained in the shell while the white fell into the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flour and sugar were mixed, sifted three times, and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then Mother beat the mixture of egg whites, cream of tartar,
salt, vanilla and almond extract with a wire whip until foamy.
</P>
<P>
   ``While still beating this mixture, Mother added sugar, a little
at a time. She didn't stop beating until the meringue held up in
stiff peaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember standing in awe of the muscles in my mother's
strong arm as she beat the egg white mixture with the wire whip.
Only after I became a parent did I understand that this was a labor
of love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next Mother gently folded the flour-sugar mix before pushing
the batter into an ungreased tube-centered pan. Finally, there was
a gentle cut through the batter with a knife before baking.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the top would spring back when lightly touched, the cake
was done. That's when it was turned upside down to cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``After my patience had been fully tried, the cake was
pronounced 'cool' and was removed by running a knife between the
cake and the tall round pan.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the cake safely on the plate, Mother handed the pan and
three spoons to her children.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the golden brown residue scraped from the sides of the
pan reached my mouth, my taste buds reacted with a pleasure that no
other food has ever matched.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a little older, my brother Wallace and I baked a
special cookie. The name at the top of the card in the recipe box
that my wife copied from my mother's card is 'John and Wallace
Cookies.'
</P>
<P>
   ``2 cups brown sugar, 1/2 lb. butter, 2 eggs well beaten, 2 cups
flour, 1 cup chopped pecans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cream butter and one cup of brown sugar together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Add one well-beaten egg, and mix well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Add flour, working in gradually.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now spread this mixture to evenly cover a buttered baking
sheet
</P>
<P>
   with short sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cover the surface thoroughly with the other well-beaten egg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sprinkle with the remaining cup of brown sugar and pecans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bake until lightly brown in a 350-degree oven.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cut into bars, but do not remove from pan until cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yield is three dozen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mother chose these cookies for her young boys to make
because they were so easy. Why not let your children try?''
</P>

   A review of brands commonly found in U.S. bars and stores based
on the new edition of ``Michael Jackson's Complete Guide to Single
Malt Scotch.'' The ratings are Jackson's for the basic version of
the scotch available. Ratings tend to improve with age.

</P>
<P>
   Description: Soft, medium to heavy, nutty, spicy, sherry
accented. After dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Distillery dates to 1824, but may be older. Aberlour

</P>
<P>
   Age: 15 years old
</P>
<P>
   Description: Lightly peaty, very aromatic. Aperitif.

</P>
<P>
   Age: 10 years old
</P>
<P>
   Description: Big, malty, oaky, sherryish. After dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Experienced tasters place Glenfarclas malts in the top
three or four from Speyside. The word means ``valley of the green
grass.'' Founded in 1836, it is family-owned and regarded as the
most independent of all Scottish distilleries. Mostly aged in
sherry casks. Its Cask Strength 105 label is the strongest single
malt offered by any distillery in an official bottling.

   Age: No age listed
</P>
<P>
   Description: When young, a dry fruity aperitif; when more
mature, a raisiny, chocolatey, after dinner malt.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Biggest selling single malt in the world. The
distillery pioneered the export of single malt scotch in 1963, when
it was considered too intense for people outside of Scotland.
Founded in 1886-87 on the glen of the River Fiddich and is still
owned by original family. In 1991, nine casks of 50-year-old
Glenfiddich were bottled and sold for $5,000, but one fetched
$70,000 at an auction in Milan.

   Origin: Eastern Lowlands

   Description: Flowery start, complex flavors and a dry finish. A
restorative, especially after a walk in the hills.

</P>
<P>
   Age: 12 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Description: Flowery, fruit, peachy. Aperitif.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The only whisky allowed to use the name of the glen of
the River Livet and the definite article ``The'' on its label, even
though other malts use Glenlivet as a place identifier for their
brands. This is perhaps the most famous Speyside malt and is the
biggest-selling single malt in the U.S. market. The brand dates
back to 1824, but was started at its current site in 1858. About a
third of the scotch is matured in sherry casks.

</P>
<P>
   Description: Delicately spicy. In younger ages, an aperitif; in
older ages, after dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The biggest-selling malt in Scotland but from a small
company. (The Scots pronounce it to rhyme with ``organgey.'' Owned
by the same company since 1918. Uses bourbon casks and has faint
hint of seaweed in taste because of the coastal location of the
distillery.

   Description: Elegant with suggestions of berry fruits with a
perfumey nose suggesting raspberries in cream.
</P>

   Comments: Considered by some to be the Rolls-Royce of single
malts. Sherry aging and a devotion to small stills give this malt

   GLENLIVET, Scotland _ No one knows when distilling began in
Scotland. Ancient Celts using rudimentary stills made a fiery
liquid they called ``uisge beatha;'' the root of the word
``whiskey,'' it means ``water of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the centuries, stills flourished in out of the way places,
and many modern distillers date back to these. Wandering from
distillery to distillery, blenders would gather malt and grain
whiskies and mixed them to create what became the familiar brands
such as Cutty Sark, Dewar's and Johnnie Walker. Single malts were
an indulgence of the Scots nearly exclusively until after World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   Malt scotches are products of single distilleries using only
water and malted barley, most of which is grown on Scottish fields.
Blended scotches, which still account for 90 percent of the scotch
whisky market, are made by combining as many as 50 malt and grain
whiskies.
</P>
<P>
   The process of making single malt scotch is seemingly simple.
</P>
<P>
   Barley is soaked in water and kept until it germinates and
sprouts, increasing the sugar content. When the sprout reaches
about the size of the nail of the small finger, the barley is
placed in a kiln and dried over fires fueled in part by peat --
turf cut from the hills and fields. The Scots call this process
``malting.'' Smoking the barley in the peat, which varies in
content of grasses, heather and flowers, subtly influences the
flavor the toasted barley will impart.
</P>
<P>
   The malted barley then is milled and mixed with warm water, and
the liquid called ``wort'' is drained off. Yeast is added to the
heated wort in huge tanks, creating a violent reaction that causes
the liquid to appear to be boiling, giving off pungent a carbon
dioxide-rich gas that smells much like very strong beer and will
burn the nose.
</P>
<P>
   The fermented liquid is then boiled in large, pot-bellied copper
vats with distinctive gooseneck designs. The alcohol vaporizes and
condenses, is captured and stored in casks, most often those
re-used from aging bourbon or sherry and occasionally port wine or
armagnac. As much of 70 percent of the flavor comes from the wood
in which the scotches are aged. They are aged a minimum of three
years to qualify as scotch, and many are aged 10 to 15 years and
more.
</P>
<P>
   It's remarkably labor ``un-intenstive.'' Tormore distillery
employs 11 men, while the giant Glemorangie has a staff of 16 men
and one woman. The entire scotch whisky industry only employs
12,500 people.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the high-tech age, malt scotch is made pretty much the
same way its has been made for 300 years. In some distilleries, the
job of monitoring the stills has been given over to computers, a
change traditionalists abhor because they insist the only suitable
quality control instrument for whisky making is a human being.
</P>
<P>
   After decades in the trade, distillers observing the spirit
coming from the stills make their adjustments by checking
temperature and faint changes in the smell and color.

   GLENLIVET, Scotland _ Standing on the grassy bank, Robbie Hughes
casts a stainless steel canister into the still, clear water.
</P>
<P>
   Dapples of sunlight break through the 100-foot trees around the
pool, which holds water from four springs that come up through the
rocks up the side of the steep hill. From time to time, a trout
will break the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Tugging on a white cord, Hughes reels in the full canister and
places it on top of a cabinet built of stone and lumber. He opens
the cabinet and finds three small glasses and sets them out on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the finest bar in the whole world,'' Hughes, 32, tells
a pair of visitors who offer no arguments. He pours the cold,
crystalline water into the glasses. ``Taste that,'' he says,
reaching again into a cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   He uncorks a bottle of 10-year-old Tormore single malt scotch
and pours two fingers worth of the pale, golden whisky in each
glass. ``Now,'' he says, ``taste this.''
</P>
<P>
   When sampled this way, one right after the other, the connection
between the water of this unique burn and the drink it yields is
unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   However, this is perhaps the only place on Earth where Tormore
is still served. The brand has fallen victim to the realities of
doing business in the booming single malt trade.
</P>
<P>
   The distillery's owner, Allied Distillers Ltd., whose parent
firm also owns Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins, has dropped
Tormore as an independent brand and intends instead to use it in
its blended whiskies, merging its distinctive flavors with others.
</P>
<P>
   A surge in single malt price, demand
</P>
<P>
   A novelty in the United States just a few years ago, single malt
scotch well may be the drink of the '90s. While sales of spirits --
including blended scotches -- have been generally flat in recent
years, single malts have surged.
</P>
<P>
   In the years between 1992 and 1997, U.S. sales more than doubled
from 4.3 million bottles to 8.7 million bottles, according to the
Edinburgh, Scotland-based Scotch Whisky Association. Last year
alone, U.S. sales jumped 14 percent making single malt scotch the
fastest growing category of liquor. Americans consumed nearly 20
percent of the single malt scotch sold worldwide
</P>
<P>
   Its prices range from $30 to $100 in stores, making it well in
to the high end of liquors. Prices can reach dizzying heights.
Christie's Scotland auction house holds regular sales, with vintage
malts going for $1,000 to $10,000 a bottle. The magazine Malt
Advocate reported that a Japanese tourist recently paid about
$16,000 for a bottle of 60-year-old Macallan from a specialty shop
at London's Heathrow Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, two men were arrested on charges of trying to
scam investors eager to get into the hot market. Using a
Gibraltar-based company, Hamilton Spirit Management, the men sold
shares in little-known single malt brands at $1,600 to $5,000 with
promises of returns of 18 percent a year when the brands took off.
The scotches were of little value, yet the men still managed to
take in more than $11 million from investors.
</P>
<P>
   Evan Campbell, a spokesman for the Scotch Whisky Association,
believes the increased demand in scotch whisky is partly cultural
-- people are looking for new experiences -- and partly smart
marketing of a fine product.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a bit of a backlash to the '80s,'' Campbell said.
``People have decided in the '90s that it's OK to consume spirits
in moderation, and they're looking for a good quality drink. At the
same time, malt is becoming more available to them.''
</P>
<P>
   To promote their brands, single malt makers are employing the
techniques of California vineyards. They want people to sample the
products firsthand and learn enough to know what it is they are
tasting. Single malt aficionados seem to travel in the same social
tribes that seek out expensive cigars, wines and cognacs.
</P>
<P>
   Bars and restaurants offer scotch tastings and lectures on the
complexities and variations of single malts, which vary
dramatically in flavors from a powerful iodine sting to a honey
richness. Cultivated wine drinkers tend to appreciate the nuances
and individuality of single malts, finding a certain fascination in
regional influences on both.
</P>
<P>
   Appropriate for the drink of the '90s, the scotch industry has
had a wave of mergers and acquisitions, involving huge players such
as Seagram, United Distillers and Allied Distillers.
</P>
<P>
   More than 150 brands are now produced, but the number is being
reduced as corporate managers seek efficiencies in their marketing
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is a natural product of market forces, Campbell said.
``In some cases, they are deciding to put their marketing efforts
behind a single, or fewer brands rather than across the board,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, fine brands such as Tormore and Dallas Dhu now exist
only in storage and on a few shelves, making scotch drinkers fret
about the future.
</P>
<P>
   One whisky store in Dufftown, the heart of the Speyside whisky
country, offers more than 100 brands, but the store owner lamented
the other day that 26 were no longer in production.
</P>
<P>
   Searching the shelves for lost brands, Robert Burns -- an
Aberdeen salesman and whisky lover, not the poet -- expressed a
common worry: ``I just hope that I don't live to see the day when
they take the individuality out of what is the world's most
individualistic drink.''
</P>
<P>
   A product of its environment: It's the water, stupid!
</P>
<P>
   While some spirits can be made virtually anywhere -- vodka and
gin for example -- single malts are products of their environments.
Each represents a place.
</P>
<P>
   And what places. There are four major Scotch producing regions:
The Lowlands, The Highlands, Campbelltown and the Isle of Islay.
</P>
<P>
   The highest concentration of distilleries is in the Highland
district known as Speyside, so named because the River Spey snakes
through it. The water in Speyside has attracted scores of
distillers over the past 200 years. It falls on the hills and
filters through the rocks and soil, giving it a peaty taste that
remains with the scotch. Speyside whiskies have come to be known as
the ``premier grand cru'' of single malts, and there is growing
demand for those aged more than 25 to 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   It is an area of rare, sometimes eerie natural beauty, with
broad emerald glens surrounded by hills that in late summer are
sided by patchworks of deep violet heather. Looking from narrow
roads like tiny cotton puffs, sheep graze on the hillsides. Here
and there are stone farmhouses and barns, occasionally the ruins of
an ancient church or castle. Everywhere there is water, from rivers
with names such as the Livet and the Fiddich.
</P>
<P>
   It is a place to be explored -- languidly -- by car. Many
distilleries offer tours or at least tolerate visitors.
Glennfiddich has an elaborate gift shop and tourist complex at its
honey-and-gray stone distillery house with the pagoda-shaped roof
that is common among distilleries. Glennfiddich, one of the few
family owned brands, is a pioneer in the business; in 1963, the
company was the first to export its single malt. The conventional
wisdom at the time was that it was too powerful for tastebuds owned
by anyone but a Scot.
</P>
<P>
   The attempt at whisky-related tourism here is thankfully minimal
but there are many other reasons to visit, not the least of which
is its charm and serenity.
</P>
<P>
   This is what lured Brett and Christine Holmes to buy the Minmore
house, an elegant country estate bed and breakfast that is said to
have been the residence of the founder of the Glenlivet distillery
next door.
</P>
<P>
   Minmore House gets some traffic in guests on the Scotch Whisky
Trail, a route marked along the winding roads that work between
glen and burn, but most of the business comes from hunters and
fishermen, for whom this must be some kind of heaven. A log in the
hotel's lobby lists accounts by guests of landing large trout and
15-pound salmon in the River Avon.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit, its guests were obviously well-to-do older
couples from England and Edinburgh and Aberdeen. Holmes offers his
guests a handsome array of Speyside scotches in his bar, with its
large front window overlooking an expanse of meadows.
</P>
<P>
   The guests joked in the bar that one of their aims is to sample
each scotch at least once -- with the goal of testing them all
before consolidation in the industry leaves the world with only one
single malt scotch.
</P>
<P>
   Single malt's disappearing act
</P>
<P>
   Robbie Hughes lives in a house that sits in a row that once was
a sort of commune for the distillery workers. He is the only
Tormore employee who lives there, with his other 10 co-workers
commuting in from surrounding villages.
</P>
<P>
   The distillery remains one of the most elegant in Speyside, with
pristine white buildings, decorative dormer windows, a belfry and
musical clock with a curving lake in the front surrounded by
sculpted topiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Built during a scotch boom in 1958, it was the first completely
new malt distillery to be built in the highlands this century.
``They built it here by this wee burn, the Achvochkie,'' Hughes
says as he leads some visitors up the hill to the natural spring
pool.
</P>
<P>
   While Tormore no longer exists as an independent brand, Allied,
which also produces Ballantine, Scapa and Laphroig, has given no
indication that it will close the distillery.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Hughes worries that this and other unique shades of malt
are disappearing all too quickly just as the market, particularly
the American market, is finding the joy of variety.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't think it was 'in your face' enough, so they
decided not to keep it around,'' Hughes says, taking a last
mournful sip by the pool. ``It's a crying shame, isn't it?''

it was considered too intense for people outside of Scotland.
Founded in 1886-87 on the glen of the River Fiddich and is still

   Comments: The only whisky allowed to use the name of the glen of
the River Livet and the definite article ``The'' on its label, even

   GLENLIVET, Scotland _ No one knows when distilling began in
Scotland. Ancient Celts using rudimentary stills made a fiery
liquid they called ``uisge beatha;'' the root of the word
``whiskey,'' it means ``water of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the centuries, stills flourished in out of the way places,
and many modern distillers date back to these. Wandering from
distillery to distillery, blwhisky making is a human being.
</P>
<P>
   After decades in the trade, distillers observing the spirit
coming from the stills make their adjustments by checking
temperature and faint changes in the smell and color.

   FALLING-SLAB (San Francisco) _ Stunned firefighters shook their

there had vacated the station just three days earlier. By TYCHE

   TV-PREVIEWS-FALL (Undated) _ This is what you need to know about
the fall network television season: The vast majority of the new
shows are either mediocre, bad, or oh-well-these-shoes-are-ruined
bad. Still, I counted eight shows (out of 35 reviewed) worthy of
getting a good review. By MARK McGUIRE. (For release Sunday, Sept.
20.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-PREVIEWS-FALL (Undated) _ Fall brings a flood of new
movies. And, as usual, critics across the land respond by making
vague predictions about which films might actually prove worth
seeing. In the movie industry, today's good buzz is tomorrow's
bomb. The only forecast worth reading _ or writing _ is one that
claims no inside knowledge whatsoever. By AMY BIANCOLLI. (For
release Sunday, Sept. 20.)
</P>
<P>
   BOOK-TAPE-SEMATARY (Undated) _ ``Pet Sematary,'' by Stephen
King, is out on tape, a fully dramatized multivoice presntation by
the British Broadcast Corp. Abridged, approximately three hours.
Most books are read by a single actor, or, on rare occasions, by
the author. Which is why ``Pet Sematary'' is unique and a treat in
the world of audio books. By DOUG BLACKBURN. (For release Sunday,

   WEDDING-CAKES (Albany, N.Y.) _ It's Saturday morning of Labor
Day weekend and wedding bells are ringing throughout the region.

wedding cake decorator at Vanilla Bean Bakery. He has booked 26

be delivered this day. By DOUG BLACKBURN. (For release Sunday,

adorn one of its newest 32-cent stamps. By TIMOTHY CAHILL.

   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ For some reason, we have higher
expectations of college presidents than the president of the
country. If a college president had an affair with a student, he'd
be fired, with no chance of keeping his job by taking weekly
``spiritual counseling'' sessions with pastors. By ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Sometimes, just to stay sane, I
imagine what it would be like if Jesus came back, physically, among
us. Would he spend his time condemning homosexuality and women
preachers _ something he never did the last time around _ or would
he stick to his main message that we should love God and our
neighbor and care for the poor, sick and imprisoned? By STEPHANIE
SALTER.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel and Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Reviewer's initials appear at end of review). Grades range from
A to F.
</P>
<P>
   Air Bud: Golden Receiver G
</P>
<P>
   If you're under 8, this ``Bud's'' for you. In this sequel to
``Air Bud,'' Buddy, the hoop-shooting Golden Retriever, and his
boy, Josh (Kevin Zegers) trade basketball for football. Scriptwise,
it's little more than a glorified after-school special, but there
hasn't been much around for younger kids recently and it handles
its messages well. And so what if the movie is essentially a series
of Stupid Pet Tricks? In his K-9 jersey, pads and helmet, Buddy
looks more athletically heroic than Bruce Willis. 1 hour, 31
minutes. (ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Armageddon PG-13
</P>
<P>
   While ``Deep Impact'' treated a similar let's-save-Earth story
with sobriety, ``Armageddon'' never lets the threat of global
annihilation get in the way of fun. It's a space-cowboy movie, with
Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck saving the world for Liv Tyler. As a
summer popcorn movie, it's more enjoyable than that big-lizard
flick ``Godzilla.'' And you'll see the reported $165 million budget
onscreen in the impressive effects and mammoth sets. But is the
movie good for you? Probably not. Rated PG-13 for sci-fi disaster
action, implied sex and profanity. 2 hours, 24 minutes. (SM) Grade:
C
</P>
<P>
   The Avengers PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Visually, this update of the '60s TV series pays witty homage to
the original's vein of Carnaby Street surrealism. In between sips
of champagne and civilized quips, agents John Steed (Ralph Fiennes)
and Mrs. Emma Peel (Uma Thurman) foil criminals plotting against
the British government. But there are two problems: a half-baked
script and Thurman, who's trumped by the cool, feline memory of
Diana Rigg, who originated the role. (SM) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   BASEketball R
</P>
<P>
   Thank heaven for the rude boys of summer. In the wake of the
Farrelly brothers and ``There's Something About Mary,'' here come
``South Park'' creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone in another
zesty, disgusting, laugh-out-loud comedy. Parker and Stone play two
slackers who invent a hybrid of baseball and basketball that
becomes a national sport. The movie manages to be racist, sexist,
homophobic and just about everything else. But it does so in a way
that kiddingly tweaks the very notion of political correctness.
Rated R for profanity, gross-out humor. 1 hour, 43 minutes. (SM)
Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Blade R
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't cut it. Wesley Snipes stars as the half-vampire,
half-human hero who can handle sunlight but also has a taste for
blood. Armed with an arsenal of sci-fi gadgets, a really cool
leather coat and Kris Kristofferson (a kind of high-tech Gabby
Hayes), Blade is devoted to wiping out all vampires. Especially a
strutting bloodsucker played by Stephen Dorff. Alas, all the
non-stop slash 'n' gnash action becomes more repetitive than
anything else. Rated R for extreme violence and strong language. 2
hours. (ER) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   The Chambermaid NR
</P>
<P>
   The lives of a French laborer (Olivier Martinez) and his wife
(Romane Bohringer) change forever after his encounter with a
chambermaid about to embark on the Titanic. It's a beguiling
meditation on desire, loss and, especially, the transformative
power of art in the drab, everyday world. 1 hour, 36 minutes. (SM)
Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Dance With Me PG
</P>
<P>
   A guilty, quick-stepping pleasure. Vanessa L. Williams plays a
Houston dance instructor who hopes to recapture past dance
competition glory with the help of a Cuban newcomer (Latin music
star Chayanne). Original it isn't, but ``Dance'' is great fun. It's
the first film that lets Williams show off her knockout dancing,
and in his first Hollywood flick, Chayanne goes for the summer's
heartthrob title. 2 hours, 6 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Dead Man on Campus R
</P>
<P>
   Some passable laughs, but it doesn't make the honor roll. Two
college students (Tom Everett Scott and Mark-Paul Gosselaar) hope a
kamikaze frat boy (Lochlyn Munro), will share their dorm suite.
And, preferably, kill himself in one of his misadventures. That's
because an odd clause at their college gives students an automatic
4.0 average if their roommate offs himself. Rated R for drug use,
language and crude sexual humor. At metro theaters. 1 hour, 36
minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Disturbing Behavior R
</P>
<P>
   Disturbingly lame. This teens-in-peril flick is a high-concept
pitch with zero follow-through _ it's ``The Stepford Teens'' with a
touch of ``Invasion of the Body Snatchers.'' James Marsden plays a
newcomer to a smalltown high school who encounters a band of
frighteningly clean-cut students. With the help of the school
psychiatrist (Bruce Greenwood), these fascist Archies ``recruit'' a
new classmate into their group every few days. Rated R for
profanity, violence and sex. 1 hour, 23 minutes. (SM) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Ever After PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Happily, this ``Ever After'' proves you can teach an old doll
new tricks. Re-inventing the Cinderella story in a way that targets
``Titanic''-loving teens more than Barney grads, the movie stars
Drew Barrymore as its spirited heroine, Anjelica Huston as her
scheming stepmother and Dougray Scott as a Prince who's more than
just another trophy husband. Jeanne Moreau, doyenne of the French
New Wave, contributes a classy cameo. Rated PG-13 for emotional
situations (death of a father) and some violence. 2 hours. (ER)
Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Everest NR
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' This
44-minute documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm
that killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' Cameraman David Breashears
fills the screen with awesome vistas, but discreetly avoids the
piles of discarded oxygen tanks, human waste and frozen bodies that
now litter the trails of the mountain. This is a film whose cruel
beauty manages to celebrate the spirit of the climbers, while
making you question their sanity. (SM) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   54 R
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan nightclub Studio 54 was a late-'70s blast of
neo-Roman decadence where everyone could be fabulous.
Unfortunately, writer-director Mark Christopher gives us a tired,
creaky fable about a smalltown stud (Ryan Phillippe) who gets
seduced by the limelight, almost loses himself, but gets saved by
the right girl. The movie is as meek as Studio 54 was outrageous.
Rated R for sexuality, profanity, drug use. 1 hour, 33 minutes.
(SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Halloween: H20 R
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Lee Curtis returns in this unsurprising 20th anniversary
sequel to John Carpenter's 1978 frightfest ``Halloween.'' Now,
she's a single mom to 17-year-old John (Josh Hartnett). Also back
is Michael Myers, the maniac who stalked Curtis all those years
ago. You can easily guess who'll survive and who'll get cut out of
the picture, literally. But when Curtis pulls a Sigourney Weaver, a
la ``Aliens,'' stalking Michael instead of fleeing him, the movie
finally gets some juice. Rated R for profanity, violence, gore,
alcohol use. 1 hour, 22 minutes. (SM) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   How Stella Got Her Groove Back R
</P>
<P>
   The screen version of Terry McMillan's novel tries to distract
us from its lack of plot with visual opulence. Angela Bassett plays
a fortysomething investment banker who takes a trip to Jamaica with
her best pal (Whoopi Goldberg), where she falls for a 20-year-old
local (Taye Diggs). Luckily, Bassett roots the picture with a
glowing performance, sharing with us Stella's unexpected moments of
emotional rediscovery. Rated R for sexual situations, nudity,
language. 2 hours, 4 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Knock Off R
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Claude Van Damme returns in _ surprise! _ an action movie
about an American salesman working in Hong Kong who becomes aware
of a terrorist conspiracy. Directed by Hong Kong action auteur Tsui
Hark. NR. Grade: NR
</P>
<P>
   Lethal Weapon 4 R
</P>
<P>
   The latest in director Richard Donner's cheerfully chaotic
blow-'em-up series re-pairs Mel Gibson's hothead cop Riggs, and
Danny Glover's long-suffering partner Murtaugh. Shaggy and amiable,
Number 4 hardly bothers to get its real plot going for its first
hour. More than ever, the film is an excuse to give its crack
supporting cast, including Joe Pesci and Chris Rock, a series of
comic riffs. Rated R for violence and profanity. 2 hours, 5
minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Mulan G
</P>
<P>
   The best Disney animated feature since ``Beauty and the Beast''
and ``The Lion King.'' Based on a 4th-century legend, it's about a
young girl who pulls a National Velvet, i.e., disguises herself as
a boy and goes to battle in her elderly father's place. This isn't
just a grand family film; it's a grand film, period. As Eddie
Murphy's little red dragon says, ``Mulan, you the man!'' 1 hour, 28
minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   The Negotiator R
</P>
<P>
   In this crisply acted thriller, Samuel L. Jackson plays a
hostage negotiator for the Chicago police department who is framed
for embezzlement and murder. Desperate to clear his name, he takes
four members of the department hostage, then asks another
negotiator (Kevin Spacey) to act as a mediator between himself and
his fellow officers. The film's main kick is the engrossing duel of
bluffs and counterbluffs between Spacey and Jackson. They make us
believe in the high stakes of the situation. Rated R for violence
and profanity. 2 hours, 15 minutes. (SM) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Next Stop, Wonderland R
</P>
<P>
   A small wonder in its own modest way. This charming low-budget
romantic comedy about the relationship travails of a Boston nurse
(Hope Davis) is stronger on character nuance than on plot; in fact,
filmmaker Brad Anderson loads it with too much plot. But by
applying a naturalistic independent-film sensibility to a vintage
glossy-Hollywood predicament, he comes out ahead. Think of a film
where John Cassavetes shares pillow talk with Doris Day. Rated R
for vulgar language and sexual situations. 1 hour, 36 minutes. (ER)
Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   One True Thing R
</P>
<P>
   Strikes too many false notes. Renee Zellweger plays a career
journalist who goes home to care for her dying homemaker mother
(Meryl Streep). Streep's performance is terrific, but the movie
suffers from generic slickness.2 hour, 7 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   The Opposite of Sex R
</P>
<P>
   Christina Ricci's teen tart burns across the screen in this
acerbic yet strangely sweet black comedy. The convoluted plot kicks
off when Ricci visits her gay half-brother (Martin Donovan) and
steals his dim-bulb lover (Ivan Sergei). The eclectic (and fine)
supporting cast includes Lisa Kudrow and Lyle Lovett. Rated R for
vulgar language, sexual situations, some nudity and sexual
references. 1 hour, 40 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Permanent Midnight R
</P>
<P>
   Permanent vanity production. This true-life story of a
successful sitcom writer (Ben Stiller) trying to kick his heroin
habit could use some time in movie rehab. Though it pretends to
explore the lower depths, Hollywood-style, it's actually a
self-serving, give-us-a-break ego trip that uses its shooting-up
scenes as shock tactics and its ``insider'' Hollywood talk as an
audience-flattering distraction. Stiller stays the course, but it's
all in vain (or in vein). (ER) 1 hour, 27 minutes. Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   Rounders R
</P>
<P>
   Director John Dahl (``The Last Seduction'') has a couple of very
hot aces up his sleeve _ Matt Damon and Edward Norton _ in this
nifty movie about the addictive lure of high-stakes poker. Damon is
a former card sharp who's managed to kick the habit and concentrate
on his law studies. Norton is his old friend, fresh out of jail,
who lures him back. A pungent, character-rich picture that's a lot
less about where it goes than how it gets there. Rated R for nudity
and language. 2 hours. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Rush Hour PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Karate king Jackie Chan and fast-talking comedian Chris Tucker
play two cops whose clashes go way beyond cultural differences.
Thrown together by FBI agents who don't want either mucking up
their search for a kidnapped child, the pair drive each other
crazy, at first. You'll howl as Chan and Tucker learn to work
together, in part by imitating (sometimes badly) how the other one
works. 1 hours, 37 minutes. (Jill Vejnoska, c. 1998 Cox News
Service) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Saving Private Ryan R
</P>
<P>
   Part gung-ho heroism, part in-your-face horror show, Steven
Spielberg's superb film shows us World War II as we've never seen
it before. Tom Hanks leads a courageous squad (and excellent
ensemble cast) on a mission to find a private (Matt Damon) whose
three brothers have already been killed in combat. Hanks'
performance is a miracle of decency and subtle emotion, but kudos
all around here. And the opening D-Day sequence is the most
powerful combat footage ever created on film. Rated R for extreme
violence and some vulgar language. 2 hours, 50 minutes. (ER) Grade:
A
</P>
<P>
   Simon Birch PG
</P>
<P>
   A little movie with big problems. In the early 1960s, a
pre-adolescent dwarf named Simon Birch (Ian Michael Smith) is
convinced he will one day be a hero while his best pal (Joseph
Mazzello) tries to solve the mystery of his real father (Ashley
Judd is Mazzello's closemouthed mom). The movie is clearly a labor
of love; alas, it's also a labor to sit through. Rated PG for
violence (a scary bus accident) and sexual innuendo. 1 hour, 50
minutes. (ER) Grade: D-
</P>
<P>
   Slums of Beverly Hills R
</P>
<P>
   A vivid, very funny look at coming of age on the fringes. Vivian
Abramowitz (Natasha Lyonne) is the odd girl out in a post-divorce
family led by a father (Alan Arkin) who, every three months or so,
skips out on rent and moves his brood to another fleabag on the
edge of Beverly Hills. Director Tamara Jenkins re-creates the daily
humiliations of adolescence with wince-inducing accuracy. And
Lyonne is terrific at navigating the waters of teen angst. Rated R
for nudity, profanity, sexual situations. 1 hour, 31 minutes. (SM)
Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Snake Eyes R
</P>
<P>
   Oscar winner Nicolas Cage and Brian De Palma are always worth
gambling on; while they don't come up total winners here, they're
hardly losers either. Cage plays a crooked Atlantic City cop who
finds himself in the middle of an assassination plot during a
heavyweight boxing match. Part detective story, part
action-thriller, the picture loses steam near the end, but De
Palma's wired camerawork and Cage's strutting energy help hold it
together. Rated R for violence and language. 1 hour, 42 minutes.
(ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   The Thief R
</P>
<P>
   This Russian fable of fathers and sons will steal into your
heart. In 1952, as Stalin inflicts his style of `'paternalism'' on
the Soviet Union, a 6-year-old boy and his young widowed mom are
wooed by a charming soldier (Vladmir Mashkov) who isn't what he
seems. As allegories go, this one's pretty transparent. But the
film's considerable strength lies in its poetic vignettes, telling
visual details and three wonderful performances. A 1997 Oscar
nominee for best foreign-language film. Rated R for sex, nudity and
language. Subtitles. 1 hour, 30 minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   A Touch of Evil NR
</P>
<P>
   Orson Welles' 1958 cult classic about corruption and lust in a
small Mexican border town has been recreated as the filmmaker
originally envisioned it. Small changes and some technical tweaking
render the film more coherent without losing its nightmarish,
B-movie edge. Charlton Heston and Janet Leigh star as newlyweds
whose honeymoon is interrupted by murder. Welles is decadence
incarnate as Capt. Quinlan, the lawman-gone-wrong. 1 hour, 51
minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Why Do Fools Fall in Love R
</P>
<P>
   This dark, dramatic biopic stars Halle Berry, Vivica A. Fox and
Lela Rochon as the women who were married to doo-wopper Frankie
Lymon, and whose court fight over his royalty ``estate'' clues us
to the singer's sorry life. Boasting some great late '50s and early
'60s rock sounds, this film, unfortunately, spins back and forth
narratively. Rated R for language, sex scenes and drug use. 2
hours, 3 minutes. (Hollywood Reporter) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Wrongfully Accused PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The sultan of spoof, Leslie Nielsen (``Airplane!'' ``The Naked
Gun'') stars in this gag-glutted comedy. Co-starring Richard Crenna
and Kelly Le Brock. Not reviewed. Grade: NR
</P>
<P>
   Your Friends &AMP; Neighbors R
</P>
<P>
   Neil LaBute, who did the lacerating ``In the Company of Men,''
suffers a sophomore slump of sorts in this black comedy about sex
games and power plays among six thirtysomething urbanites. Rated R
for sex and language. 1 hour, 45 minutes. (ER) Grade: C+

 &HT;    From cop chases to animal attacks, Fox's specials are the
brainchild of the World's Scariest TV execH
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _He's an hour late. New baby, traffic. He calls from
a car phone. ``Be there in 10 minutes!'' Twenty minutes later, he
shows. He's a bit of a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``In September of '96, I remember saying, `Who's the guy in
charge of specials?''' Peter Roth, Fox's entertainment president,
recalls of the first time he met Mike Darnell, the guy in charge of
specials. ``And in walked this 5-foot-2, shaggy, longhaired,
extraordinary guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Darnell, maybe the scariest guy in TV, shows up late this
morning at his office on the Fox studio lot pretty much as Roth
described: 5-foot-2 (more or less), long brown ringlets loafing
around his shoulders, sport coat, black T-shirt, jeans, ostrich
boots. He's 36, looks maybe 26. Seems like he talks a lot faster
than he actually does. That whiff of helium in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You seen the tumor? You gotta see the tumor. We'll show you
the tumor.''
</P>
<P>
   Darnell _ already behind a schedule, he'll stay behind all day _
is excited. He loves, loves this tumor segment that aired on the
premiere of ``Guinness World Records: Primetime'' in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guinness'' is the latest program from Darnell's department,
and the latest entry on a resume some think qualifies Darnell for
the title of World's Scariest TV Specialist _ the guy dinged by
other networks (NBC entertainment chief Don Ohlmeyer calls
Darnell's oeuvre ``snuff TV'') even as they contort themselves to
ape the success of such souped-up Fox specials as ``When Animals
Attack'' (I through IV), ``Magic's Biggest Secrets Revealed'' (I
through III), and, of course, ``World's Scariest Police Chases!''
(I, II, III, IV, V and counting).
</P>
<P>
   If TV has become more like an endless carnival midway, then
Darnell is one of its leading barkers. He's made lowbrow art out of
a hook 'em and hold 'em, get-'em-in-the-tent sensibility that in
the last few years has seeped into programming as wide ranging as
PBS (``Wild Weather Night!'') and network newsmagazines.
</P>
<P>
   Reality programming is hardly a Darnell invention, but he has
helped escalate it into a cultural imperative. In a 70-channel
universe, you better grab people's attention now.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have a hard time having a discussion about specials with
other network executives that does not eventually get to Mike
Darnell,'' says Bob Bane, once Darnell's boss at Fox and now an
independent producer
</P>
<P>
   of specials and events for all the networks. ``They're all
comparing themselves to him _ he's doing so much better than they
are. He's the only one who's rung the bell.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Guinness'' premiere that has Darnell excited this morning
features a segment on the World's Largest Tumor. At 302 pounds, it
is larger than the woman to whom it's attached. It really is an
awesome tumor. And through the miracle of video tape, we watch as
this awesome tumor is surgically removed _ you know, all very
professional, all very, you know, scientific.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have something gross in each episode,'' Darnell
explains of the strategic role in the summer series that has become
such a success that Fox has ordered a full season of episodes (at 9
p.m. Tuesday, the show will feature flesh-eating bacteria). ``Gross
is one of those things people go, `Ooh ...,' but there are no
coalitions out there against gross.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fascinating,'' Darnell adds. ``Some people can't watch
fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   `Everybody's a fan'
</P>
<P>
   Here is the world's scariest thing about Mike Darnell: He gives
people exactly what they don't want to admit they want. An hour of
nonstop car chases. An hour of nonstop stunt crack-ups. An hour of
animals going haywire. Hours and hours of how a rabbit is pulled
out of a hat; Tonya and Nancy staring grimly at each other from
chairs not 10 yards apart; Mark Furhman hooked up to a lie detector
machine as host Marcia Clark asks if he planted the bloody glove
(the machine backed up his denial).
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I watched `World's Scariest Police Chases,' it
was nonstop police videos, from the first to the last, and I was
left gasping in my seat by the end,'' says Tim Brooks, a longtime
network researcher and author of a TV history. ``It's the car wreck
thing: you can't take your eyes off it, even though you know you
shouldn't be watching it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody moans about it,'' Darnell adds, ``but everybody's a
fan, whether they admit it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the TV industry is watching. Among the 18 to 49 age
demographic that TV advertisers covet most, the entertainment
Darnell dreams up and solicits for Fox outperforms just about every
other network special that isn't a sports event, an awards show or
part of a regular series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surviving the Moment of Impact,'' ``World's Scariest Police
Chases'' and ``Magic's Biggest Secrets Revealed'' all ranked higher
last season among those age 18 to 49 than the season's
highest-rated TV movie (ABC's ``Oprah Winfrey Presents: The
Wedding'') and highest-rated news special (John Stossel's ``Love,
Lust and Marriage'' on ABC). And Fox's ``Busted on the Job'' and
``World's Deadliest Swarms'' weren't far behind.
</P>
<P>
   After ``Guinness'' premiered in August, it started beating
everything else on every network on Tuesday nights in prime time.
``Magic'' more than doubled the ratings of programming it replaced,
with its impact so far-reaching that an upcoming NBC magic special
reportedly will reveal the identity of Fox's ``masked'' magician.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Darnell) is the reason I come to the office early and leave
late,'' says Michael Davies, Darnell's specials rival at ABC.
``What Mike has done is change the specials business on network TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great for all of us that he's having so much success,''
adds Davies, who says ABC's successful summer replacement ``Whose
Line Is It Anyway?'' is the kind of ``outside the box'' thinking
that Darnell has prompted in him and others. ``When prime time is
so dominated by sitcoms, dramas and news magazines, people are
crying out for this type of programming. Now (the networks) are
going back to the more creative programing of the '50s and '60s.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent demise of TV movies has prompted the big broadcast
networks to fill the vacuum with news magazines, and many observers
see a kind of Darnellian devolution in their content: a greater
reliance on the sensational, the hyped, the adrenaline-driven
video. Darnell says video he's criticized for airing often shows up
on ``Dateline,'' trussed up as ``news.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The other networks want to do it under a more legitimate
banner, so they have the `Datelines,' the `PrimeTime Lives,' the
`48 Hours,''' says Steve Marks, a Los Angeles agent with many
clients who produce reality programming. ``If you took them
shoot-out, for the most part they won't touch it _ it's too
exploitative, too on the nose. It scares them. But then ABC's doing
`Deadliest Volcanoes,' `Deadliest Storms' _ stuff that's more
nature oriented, so they can get away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even PBS isn't immune from at least a mild case of the Darnell
bug. GPTV (which includes Atlanta's WGTV) sometimes repackages
reruns of shows into event nights sold to viewers with a taste of
the sensational, as when it cobbles together a three-hour block on
extreme weather, or UFOs and aliens, or predatory animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the intelligent version of that concept,'' allows BaBette
Davidson, GPTV program manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Fox does real police chases or `When Animals Attack,' it
sends a message to the people who produce our shows nationally that
people want to see wilder weather, more dangerous animals,'' she
adds. ``It's more of a trickle-up effect _ more of what the
audience wants to see. So when a producer looks at a nature
special, they might want to add video of a crocodile taking down a
hyena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an intangible.''
</P>
<P>
   TV, TV and even more TV
</P>
<P>
   Here's the world's quaintest thing about Mike Darnell: he loves
TV. Watches, sometimes, 14 hours a day. Good, bad _ ``Frazier,''
infomercials _ doesn't matter. He has five TVs in his house, one in
a bathroom, one in the baby's room, where the 3-month-old already
raises her head to watch. His wife Carolyn says Darnell ``is not
one of those parents who believes kids shouldn't watch TV.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never met anyone here who at the end of the day goes home
and watches more TV,'' adds Gavin Glynn, Darnell's manager of
specials. ``He's not jaded. You're never going to meet anyone who
loves TV more than Mike Darnell.''
</P>
<P>
   Darnell was a child actor whose family moved to Southern
California from Philadelphia when he was 12. He appeared on
commercials and in a parade of guest roles (``Welcome Back
Kotter,'' ``Sanford and Son,'' ``Kojack''), and starred in a
short-lived Saturday morning show called ``Big John, Little John.''
</P>
<P>
   He watched TV all the time back then, too. Handicapped TV
Guide's fall preview issue. Read and interpreted ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most actors like acting,'' he recalls. ``I liked TV.''
</P>
<P>
   His size kept him in kids' roles until he was 20, when he
started looking like a mighty old kid. So he got sort of serious
about college (``Anytime I could write on TV I did, no matter what
the subject'') and eventually became a video librarian at L.A.'s
Fox station. On his own time he put together a ``where is he now''
piece on Burt Ward, who played Robin on the old ``Batman'' TV
series. Barry Diller, the media mogul who at the time ran Fox, saw
the piece while channel surfing and Darnell was promoted to field
producer.
</P>
<P>
   He produced Rose Bowl parades, pre-Emmy shows, entertainment
segments. His biggest success was a tongue-in-cheek comparison of
the TV series ``Beverly Hills 90210'' and the just-released
``Beverly Hillbillies'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got me noticed,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Darnell landed in the Fox specials department in 1994. Weird
time at Fox. The mission then was more ``quality'' programming.
Specials wasn't part of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no vision,'' Darnell says of his plans when he arrived.
``I felt I would instinctively know what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   An unlikely special called ``Alien Autopsy: Truth or Fiction?''
kick-started those instincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Autopsy'' began when Darnell got a call from a producer who'd
found some film supposedly shot in Roswell, N.M., of an alien
undergoing a military autopsy. The guy slipped the tape into
Darnell's office VCR, Darnell recalls, ``and damn if it didn't look
like 18 minutes of an alien being autopsied. You can see the guts
coming out, the head being sawed ...''
</P>
<P>
   Darnell told the guy to prove the film was shot when it claimed,
in 1947. The guy returned with proof that it it could have been
shot in 1947 _ or 1927, or 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was enough for me,'' says Darnell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Autopsy'' was a smash. Believers loved it (``My wife thought
it was a real autopsy for two years,'' Darnell says). Nonbelievers
loved it (Jay Leno, David Letterman, ``Seinfeld'' all joked about
it). And with its huge ratings, the network loved it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized there's something to breaking the mold,'' Darnell
says. ``Something to getting controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is the world's scariest thing about our world, as seen
through the prism of Mike Darnell: There are ideas out there he
does not buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy came in, quite seriously, and pitched ``World's Most
Embarrassing Throw Up Moments,''' he says. ``I said, `I don't
understand.' He said, `Everybody has a story like that.' I said,
`What are they? Re-creations?' He said, `Yeah.'
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lines I will not cross.''
</P>
<P>
   Though most ideas come from Darnell and his staff, he listens in
his darkened office to about 25 pitches (ideas from producers) a
week. His reputation is as a quick, smart, un-Hollywood (``He's not
interested in having dinner with any agent in town,'' says L.A.
agent Ari Greenburg), in-fighting straight-talker who knows what he
wants and can deconstruct in seconds an idea that won't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like he's talking geometry; he knows what the theorems
are,'' says Tom Sheets, an assistant to Darnell.
</P>
<P>
   Darnell took five pitches this day. He bought none _ pretty
typical, considering he buys maybe one or two out of a hundred.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one:
</P>
<P>
   Producer: ``You're going to love this idea. `Killer Instinct.'
Inside the mind of the world's most terrifying serial killers.''
</P>
<P>
   Darnell: ``This may be too dark. Most of the stuff we do is more
adrenaline than dark.''
</P>
<P>
   Producer: ``We'll make the serial killer a funny guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Darnell: ``In the back of my mind, I'm thinking of something
less male and more female driven. There was that comedian who was
raping college students. No one dies. People were fascinated. ...
Anything else?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel if you can get me to watch it, hopefully an audience
will want to watch it,'' Darnell says later. ``I'm the opposite of
an elitist.''
</P>
<P>
   But is Darnell the opposite of responsible? Many observers
question how far this kind of programming will go _ whether the
real ``snuff TV'' that NBC's Ohlmeyer talks about is just around
the bend. Even Fox's recent magic specials, in which a masked
magician revealed secrets behind dozens of age-old illusions, was
jeered in some circles as unnecessarily exploitative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will do almost anything for a good number (big rating), as
long as it doesn't hurt me, the company, or my audience,'' Darnell
says. ``I don't cross into human suffering, making fun of a hurting
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Darnell is on the rise at Fox, where he's seen as more than a
clip-job artist, his notes valued by writers on other shows. He
recently added late-night to his specials and alternative program
duties. He's behind several Fox series that will appear in
mid-season, including a much-anticipated ``The PJ's,'' a kind of
claymation sitcom that features Eddie Murphy's voice. Darnell's
description: ```Larry Sanders' meets `Good Morning America' meets
puppets.'' With instincts even rivals such as ABC's Davies call
``incredible,'' Darnell could be that bridge between cable
sensibility and network mass appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all those people waiting for Mike Darnell to burn out,''
says ex-boss Bane, ``I'd be willing to bet he's at the front of the
line waiting to figure out what the next thing is.''
</P>
<P>
   It's late now inside Darnell's office. His wife and baby arrive.
</P>
<P>
   But Darnell still hasn't shown a visitor that giant tumor video.
So he grabs the tape. It's moments like these that Darnell the
shaggy-haired TV exec looks a lot like what Darnell the kid TV
junkie must have looked like, glued in front of the family set, a
dog-earred TV Guide on his lap.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's part of that. For better or worse, he's leaving a mark.
He's been called TV's P.T. Barnum. Fine with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love TV so much, that to carve out a niche that's mine, it's
an accomplishment,'' he says. He jokes of his epitaph: ``However he
died, I hope he caught it on video.''
</P>
<P>
   Darnell then slips the tumor tape into his VCR. It really is an
awesome tumor. The four or five other people in the office squirm,
moan, laugh, wince.
</P>
<P>
   But not one of them, including Darnell, stops watching.

 &HT;    This season, let caution be your TV guide
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 20: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Bob Longino, Phil Kloer, Lyle V. Harris, and Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TV's new fall season officially starts Monday, and the onslaught
of 36 new dramas and sitcoms begins in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   What's a viewer to choose? ABC's rehash of ``Fantasy Island''
with new devilish twists? WB's new critical darling ``Felicity'' _
a college drama that many critics are hailing as this year's answer
to ``Ally McBeal''?
</P>
<P>
   Our TV critics _ Drew Jubera, Lyle V. Harris, Phil Kloer and Bob
Longino _ have handicapped this season's new shows from 1 to 35
(NBC's new Nathan Lane sitcom ``Encore! Encore!'' was unavailable
at press time).
</P>
<P>
   WORTH IT
</P>
<P>
   1. ``Felicity'' (WB; debuts Sept. 29). Smart but naive girl goes
to college and messes up her life. Keri Russell stars in the best
pilot of the fall, one that's been compared to ``My So-Called
Life'' and ``Ally McBeal,'' but is really more like
``thirtysomething: the early years.''
</P>
<P>
   2. ``Sports Night'' (ABC; debuts Tuesday). What if they made a
sitcom about working at EPSN (which Disney owns) and put it on ABC
(which Disney owns)? Well, they did. It's a smartly written,
promising show that moves with the speed of ``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   3. ``Will &AMP; Grace'' (NBC; debuts Monday). He's gay, she's
straight, they're likable, although not as much as Julia Roberts
and Rupert Everett in ``My Best Friend's Wedding,'' the obvious
inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   4. ``The King of Queens'' (CBS; debuts Monday). ``Everybody
Loves Raymond'' without the kids. So far.
</P>
<P>
   5. ``Trinity'' (NBC; debuts Oct. 16). The best of the three new
shows about big Irish families: a cop, a priest, a crook, a
druggie, but no leprechaun in John (``ER'') Wells' family drama.
</P>
<P>
   6. ``Cupid'' (ABC; debuts Saturday). The god of love helps
singles in the '90s in a sweetly whimsical romance.
</P>
<P>
   7. ``The Hughleys'' (ABC; debuts Tuesday). Salt 'n' pepper in
the burbs. A comedy.
</P>
<P>
   8. ``That '70s Show'' (Fox; debuted Aug. 23). Already generating
a buzz for its goofy spin on Midwest teens in the mirrored-ball
years.
</P>
<P>
   9. ``Buddy Faro'' (CBS; debuts Friday). Retro-hip, swingin'
series about an aging detective (Dennis Farina) out of mothballs
and back in business in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   WORTH A FLIP
</P>
<P>
   10. ``Fantasy Island'' (ABC; debuts Saturday) ``De plane'' still
brings de guest stars, but they're confronted by a darker, stranger
island. Malcolm McDowell is Mr. Roarke.
</P>
<P>
   11. ``Jesse'' (NBC; debuts Thursday). Christina Applegate (Kelly
Bundy on ``Married ... With Children'') says bye-bye bimbohood,
hello decent sitcom about a working single mom.
</P>
<P>
   12. ``Two of a Kind'' (ABC; debuts Friday). The Olsen twins are
back in another TGIF sitcom aimed squarely at their young fans.
</P>
<P>
   13. ``L.A. Doctors'' (CBS; debuts Monday). ``Marcus Welby,
M.D.'' meets ``L.A. Law'' as four docs (led by Ken Olin of
``thirtysomething'') struggle with the money vs. medicine debate.
</P>
<P>
   14. ``Martial Law'' (CBS; debuts Saturday). More fun than a
roundhouse kick in the nose.
</P>
<P>
   15. ``Brother's Keeper'' (ABC; debuts Friday). Straight-arrow
single dad learns life's painfully fun from his always-in-trouble
sibling.
</P>
<P>
   WORTH HAVING ON IN BACKGROUND
</P>
<P>
   16. ``Brimstone'' (Fox; debuts Oct. 27). The devil sends a dead
cop (Peter Horton) back to Earth to hunt escapees from hell. Call
it ``Touched by a Devil.''
</P>
<P>
   17. ``DiResta'' (UPN; debuts Oct. 5). ``Everybody Loves
Raymond'' with just a trickle of its humor.
</P>
<P>
   18. ``Seven Days'' (UPN; debuts Oct. 7). Loud, hokey and
ridiculous sci-fi thriller about time travel. But kinda cool in its
hokey way.
</P>
<P>
   19. ``Living in Captivity'' (Fox; debuted Sept. 11). Salt 'n'
pepper in the burbs. A so-so comedy.
</P>
<P>
   20. ``To Have &AMP; to Hold'' (CBS; debuts Sept. 30). Irish cop hunk
marries Irish lawyer lass. They smolder; the rest of it molders.
</P>
<P>
   21. ``The Brian Benben Show'' (CBS; debuts Monday). He's a local
news reporter covering dumb stories. In case you can't wait till
11.
</P>
<P>
   WORTHLESS
</P>
<P>
   22. ``Charmed'' (WB; debuts Oct. 7). Three sisters are witches.
Somewhere between ``Buffy'' without the hipness and ``Sabrina''
without the glitter.
</P>
<P>
   23. ``Hyperion Bay'' (WB; debuts Monday). Revenge of a nerd.
</P>
<P>
   24. ``The Secret Lives of Men'' (ABC; debuts Sept. 30) Divorce,
golf, beer _ what's the secret?
</P>
<P>
   25. ``Conrad Bloom'' (NBC; debuts Monday). Conrad's a sweet
mensch, surrounded by females demanding, dysfunctional or both.
</P>
<P>
   26. ``Wind on Water'' (NBC; debuts Oct. 17). Surf 'n' jerks.
</P>
<P>
   27. ``Guys Like Us'' (UPN; debuts Oct. 5). The boys of bummer.
</P>
<P>
   28. ``Mercy Point'' (UPN; debuts Oct. 6). Kind of like ``ER''
with aliens and way, way out in space.
</P>
<P>
   29. ``Legacy'' (UPN; debuts Oct. 9). ``The Big Valley'' with a
``Titanic'' soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   WORTH GOUGING EYES OUT
</P>
<P>
   30. ``Costello'' (Fox; debuted Tuesday). Loud louts in a Boston
bar. The anti-``Cheers.''
</P>
<P>
   31. ``The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer'' (UPN; debuts Oct.
5). A sex comedy about Abraham Lincoln that's worse than it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   32. ``Maggie Winters'' (CBS; debuts Oct. 30). Faith Ford
(``Murphy Brown'') goes back to her small town where her friends
are re-living their high school years. As fun to watch as it would
be to live.
</P>
<P>
   33. ``Vengeance Unlimited'' (ABC; debuts Sept. 29). Violence
unexpurgated.
</P>
<P>
   34. ``The Army Show'' (WB; debuted Sept. 13). Oh, for the
sophisticated wit of ``Gomer Pyle.''
</P>
<P>
   35. ``Holding the Baby'' (Fox; debuted Aug. 23). Uh-oh, it fell
on its head.

 &HT;    QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON IMPEACHMENT THEN AND NOW
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (k) commentary categories for
release Sunday, Sept. 20.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the third time in U.S. history, Congress is
seriously considering whether to start the impeachment process
against a president.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Johnson is the only president who was ever impeached by
the House. In 1868, the Senate failed to convict him, and Johnson
served out the last 10 months of his term.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 after the House Judiciary
Committee voted to recommend that the House impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Judiciary Committee is considering whether to ask the
House for permission to start an inquiry into whether President
Clinton should be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very serious procedure, and very rare,'' said Michael
Les Benedict, a legal historian at Ohio State University who wrote
``The Impeachment and Trial of Andrew Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are very leery of the impeachment
process,'' Benedict said. In fact, ``whenever the process starts,
most people don't even remember what impeachment is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the answers to some basic questions on what our
impeachment procedures are, and how they have worked.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is impeachment?
</P>
<P>
   A. It is an official accusation by the House of wrongdoing so
serious that if the official doesn't resign, the Senate must hold a
trial to decide whether he or she should be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Who can be impeached?
</P>
<P>
   A. Any high federal official in the executive or judicial
branches of the federal government. The Constitution says, ``The
President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United
States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and
Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and
Misdemeanors.'' Since federal judges hold lifetime tenure ``on good
behavior,'' some people hold that behaving badly is an impeachable
offense for them.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How does it work?
</P>
<P>
   A. The House adopts ``articles of impeachment'' by a majority
vote. The Senate meets as a ``court of impeachment'' to consider
the charges. Conviction requires a two-thirds majority of those
voting.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can members of Congress be impeached?
</P>
<P>
   A. No, they lack protection of the impeachment process. Either
the Senate or the House can act alone to expel any of its members
at any time by a two-thirds vote.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Among the impeachable charges, treason and bribery seem
pretty clear, but what are ``high crimes and misdemeanors?''
</P>
<P>
   A. Whole books have been written about that. The phrase was used
in England to describe very serious wrongdoing that threatened the
king, who embodied the state. In the United States, where
impeachment involves both precise legal and broad political
judgments, there is general agreement that high crimes and
misdemeanors consist of corrupt activities as serious as treason
and bribery.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the narrowest legal definition?
</P>
<P>
   A. While all sides agree that a grave, indictable crime can be
grounds for impeachment, some argue narrowly that nothing other
than a criminal act can be grounds for impeachment. ``If we cannot
state upon paper a specific crime, how are we to carry this case to
the Senate for a trial?'' Rep. James Wilson argued during the
House's debate on Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is an example of a broader, political definition?
</P>
<P>
   A. Judge John Pickering, whose nephew informed Congress that the
judge was insane, was removed from office after he was impeached
and convicted on charges of being drunk and using profanity on the
bench. None of his offenses was an grave crime.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, when Gerald Ford was Republican minority leader of the
House, he said that in the case of judges, ``an impeachable offense
is whatever a majority of the House considers it to be at a given
moment in history.'' The cynicism implicit in that argument is
generally considered to be one reason that a House committee
squelched Ford's effort to impeach Supreme Court Justice William O.
Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What were Andrew Johnson's high crimes and misdemeanors?
</P>
<P>
   A. In 1867, the House Judiciary Committee charged that Johnson
failed to carry out some laws that Congress had passed after the
Civil War as a way to protect freed slaves and loyal Republicans,
punish leading rebels and restrict Democrats. The committee report
was rejected by the House.
</P>
<P>
   In 1868, the House voted to impeach Johnson, and then asked a
committee to draft some articles of impeachment. Eventually, the
House approved 11 articles with a mixture of legal and political
offenses. Besides reviving the earlier charges, the articles
charged that he disobeyed a law requiring congressional approval of
any decision to replace a patronage appointee and that he tried to
arouse public hatred and contempt for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate abandoned the trial after votes on three of the
articles all came up one vote short of the two-thirds margin needed
to convict.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What were the charges against President Richard Nixon?
</P>
<P>
   A. Before Nixon resigned, the Judiciary Committee had voted to
recommend that he be charged with obstructing justice by using the
FBI and CIA to help conceal his links to the Watergate break-in,
abusing his presidential powers by arranging illegally to spy on
and harass Americans he did not like, and refusing to honor
congressional subpoenas. The committee rejected a charge that he
concealed four years of bombing in Cambodia and decided that his
cheating on income taxes was not an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What would the charges be against President Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   A. Nobody knows. If the House does give its Judiciary Committee
permission to start an inquiry, it might or might not instruct the
committee to confine its hearings to matters publicized by
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What did Starr do?
</P>
<P>
   A. With the permission of a three-judge panel to which he
reports, Starr submitted documents, tapes and a 458-page summary to
the House. In his summary, Starr said some of Clinton's actions
``may constitute grounds for impeachment.'' While asserting that
his office uncovered ``substantial and credible information'' that
the president committed perjury and obstructed justice while trying
to conceal his marital infidelity, Starr noted, ``It is not the
role of this Office to determine whether the president's actions
warrant impeachment by the House and removal by the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. Has the House ever received a similar report?
</P>
<P>
   A. Not a public report. But during the Judiciary Committee's
impeachment inquiry in 1974, it received a less opinionated
confidential report. At the request of the grand jury investigating
the Watergate cover-up, Federal Judge John J. Sirica gave the
committee a briefcase full of evidence and a sealed grand jury
report that consisted of an index of the contents. ``The grand jury
sent nothing of an accusatory nature to the House committee,''
Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski told the Supreme Court. ``What the
grand jury sent to the House committee was the evidence that had
been accumulated.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. How are impeachments conducted?
</P>
<P>
   A. Each ``article of impeachment,'' or related set of charges,
must be adopted by a majority vote in the House. The Senate has the
sole power to conduct trials. Its members meet as a ``Court of
Impeachment,'' and conviction on any article requires approval of
two-thirds of those voting. Conviction on one article is sufficient
to remove someone from office.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does that mean the House acts as a grand jury?
</P>
<P>
   A. Not exactly. A grand jury must merely decide that it is more
likely than not that an offense has been committed. But the House
usually acts only if, first, a majority of the committee that
conducted an inquiry, and then, a majority of all House members are
convinced that an impeachable offense was definitely committed.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does the Senate act as a trial jury?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, but one with far more powers. It decides not only
matters of fact, but procedural questions, and could even decide
that the House was wrong when it described an activity as an
impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   Each impeachment trial has its own set of rules. But in the
past, the rules have let senators debate each other, walk out
during boring parts, cross-examine witnesses, negotiate with the
president privately, urge their constituents to lobby senators on
the other side, quiz defense lawyers or the prosecutor-like
``managers'' who represent the House during the trial, change the
rules in mid-trial and reserve the right to vote to overrule any
procedural or substantive rulings by the presiding officer.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Who presides?
</P>
<P>
   A. Normally, the vice president. But if the president is on
trial, the Constitution provides that the presiding officer is the
Chief Justice of the United States. The founding fathers thought it
wouldn't be a good idea to have a president's trial presided over
by someone in line to replace the accused president.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How common are impeachments?
</P>
<P>
   A. There are hardly any. Since 1800, the House has launched more
than 60 inquiries, but only 14 people _ one president (Johnson in
1868), one cabinet member (Secretary of War William Belknap in
1876) and 12 judges _ have been impeached. One of the judges
resigned. In the 13 Senate trials, Johnson, Belknap and four judges
were acquitted, and seven judges were convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are the penalties for conviction?
</P>
<P>
   A. There are only two. The Constitution says, ``Judgment in
Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from
Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy an Office of Honor,
Trust or Profit under the United States.'' The disqualification is
optional.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does that mean that if their impeachable offenses included a
crime, they get immunity from criminal prosecution?
</P>
<P>
   A. Not automatically. The Constitution goes on to say, ``but the
Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to
Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are the advantages to resigning, rather than facing the
impeachment process?
</P>
<P>
   A. It saves the president, Congress and the country weeks of
agony, and allows the departing president to keep his federal
pension and lifetime health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Practically speaking, doesn't even the mention of impeachment
lead to social ruin and political disgrace?
</P>
<P>
   A. Not necessarily. There are bound to be loyalists who will
always believe the accused person got a bum deal. Johnson was
elected to the Senate after completing his presidential term.
Nixon's funeral was well-attended. U.S. District Judge Alcee
Hastings, who was convicted on impeachment charges, was later
elected to and still serves in the House.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the third time in U.S. history, Congress is
seriously considering whether to start the impeachment process
against a president.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Johnson is the only president who was ever impeached by
the House. In 1868, the Senate failed to convict him, and Johnson
served out the last 10 months of his term.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 after the House Judiciary
Committee voted to recommend that the House impeach him.

RYAN'S LONG SHADOW  
 CARDINALS STILL HAUNTED BY REGIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Three years later, the damage former Coach Buddy
Ryan inflicted on the Cardinals remains.
</P>
<P>
   Seen the NFL rushing statistics? Ex-Cardinals back Garrison
Hearst of the San Francisco 49ers leads the league with 325 yards
and three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never wanted to get rid of Garrison Hearst,'' a Cardinals
coach said. ``We had to get rid of him or we couldn't sign our
draft picks. He was strictly a salary-cap casualty.''
</P>
<P>
   It was one example of how Ryan ran amok. His abuse of power
still is being felt at the corner of Warner and Hardy in Tempe as
team officials try to dig out from Hurricane Buddy.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals cut Hearst in training camp two years ago so they
could sign first-round pick Simeon Rice to a four-year, $9.3
million deal.
</P>
<P>
   The next week, the Cardinals released defensive end Clyde
Simmons, whom Ryan had signed to a five-year, $14.9 million
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons' contract and the identical one given to linebacker Seth
Joyner, released 15 months ago, left the club with salary-cap
troubles it couldn't get out of until this year.
</P>
<P>
   The two teams Ryan directed in the NFL, the Cardinals and
Eagles, play each other Sunday at Sun Devil Stadium. Both are 0-2
and desperate for a win.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan can't be blamed for the Eagles having the worst offense in
the league and the Cardinals at 28th. But he left both with huge
messes on the offensive line, and neither have been fixed.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't one offensive lineman on the current Cardinals team
left from Ryan's two-year reign of terror, but look around the
league.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Coleman, a 1993 first-round draft pick, is starting at left
guard for one of the best offensive lines in Jacksonville. Ryan cut
him midway through the '95 season. Rich Braham, a 1994 third-round
pick, is starting at guard for the Cincinnati Bengals, who claimed
him on waivers early in '94 season when Ryan, foolishly, thought he
could sneak him through waivers.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, running back Fred McAfee and cornerback Chris Oldham?
Ryan cut both in 1994. Each helped the Pittsburgh Steelers get to
the Super Bowl the next season and still are with the team.
</P>
<P>
   There are only seven Cardinals players left who joined the team
during Ryan's tenure _ wide receivers Rob Moore and Frank Sanders,
linebackers Jamir Miller and Terry Irving, defensive tackle Bernard
Wilson, safety Kwamie Lassiter and backup quarterback Stoney Case.
Ryan's best three moves were trading for Moore and drafting Sanders
and Miller.
</P>
<P>
   His first two picks, Miller and Chuck Levy, both were suspended
their second seasons for substance-abuse violations but remain in
the league. Miller is the Cardinals' best linebacker and could get
a big free-agent deal in the off-season. Levy is the 49ers' return
specialist and plays behind Hearst at running back.
</P>
<P>
   In Ryan's two drafts, he picked five defensive backs. None
remain with Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Team owner Bill Bidwill gave Ryan unlimited power. He was in
charge of every football decision, a move that continues to haunt.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan gave a $1 million offer sheet to journeyman offensive
tackle Larry Tharpe, who was making the league minimum at the time.
There may have been a reason for the big deal: Tharpe's agent was
Ryan's son, Jim.
</P>
<P>
   After telling other rookie free agents that the Cardinals
couldn't offer them any signing bonuses, Ryan gave Mike Gentry of
Eastern Kentucky an $8,000 bonus. Gentry's father was a mutual
friend of a Kentucky veterinarian who worked on Ryan's horses.
</P>
<P>
   That abuse of power is one reason the Bidwills haven't given
anyone complete control of the football operation since. They were
right to give a football man complete control. They just gave it to
the wrong guy.
</P>
<P>
   The many layers of power contributed to first-round draft pick
Andre Wadsworth's long holdout this summer. If someone were in
charge, the deal likely could have been done much sooner.
</P>
<P>
   It's understandable why the Bidwills are uneasy about
relinquishing control. What went on during Ryan's regime was
juicier than the details of Kenneth Starr's report on Clinton's
scandalous behavior.
</P>
<P>
   One assistant under Ryan said he had to miss work because of
abdominal surgery but really had penile implants, according to club
sources. The team paid for the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Another coach, in charge of enforcing player fines, didn't give
the money to charity, which is customary. He had the players buy
cosmetics from his wife.
</P>
<P>
   A couple hours before Ryan's last game, a Christmas match-up
against Dallas on ``Monday Night'' Football,'' ABC-TV analyst Dan
Dierdorf, a former Cardinals offensive lineman, walked into the
locker room. Middle linebacker Eric Hill and defensive end Chad
Brown were brawling.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few months, team officials discovered that Ryan's
son, Rob, the defensive secondary coach, had padded the defensive
statistics. He had credited Cardinals defensive backs with
deflections on all opposing passes that were incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan announced at his first news conference that the Valley
``had a winner in town.''
</P>
<P>
   He's a big reason Valley sports fans still are waiting. &QL;

CARBAJAL TRAINS FOR COMEBACK

<P>
   PHOENIX - Michael Carbajal turns 31 today with a hope of turning
back the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Carbajal, one of the best fighters of the mid-1990s, is training
for a comeback bout late in October.
</P>
<P>
   His brother, manager and trainer, Danny Carbajal, said he is
putting together a bout for Oct. 23 or Oct. 30 at a casino near
Biloxi, Miss., a site of several nationally televised cards during
the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Carbajal said he is reviewing potential opponents for his
brother, who last fought July 19, 1997, and lost by technical
knockout to South African Jake Matlala.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to get back in,'' said Carbajal, a former
International Boxing Federation and World Boxing Council
junior-flyweight champion (108 pounds), who plans to make his
comeback at flyweight (112.) ``I watched all the competition at
112, and I didn't see too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Carbajal said he is motivated by a desire to regain a major
title at a heavier weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want something that you lost, and you want it real bad,''
Carbajal said Wednesday after sparring at his Ninth Street Gym.
</P>
<P>
   He nearly attempted a comeback last spring, but a bruised right
hand prevented him. The hand, he said Wednesday, is healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Carbajal quickly rose to the top of the boxing world after a
silver medal at the 1988 Olympics. He's the first in the lightest
divisions (108-126 pounds) to get a $1 million purse. In all, he
earned about $7 million over 49 fights (45-4, 30 KOs).
</P>
<P>
   Money is not considered a key factor in his comeback, according
to people close to him. He is currently earning about $80,000 a
year from a retirement fund established from ring earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I can win another title,'' said Carbajal, who, as ``The
Ring's'' 1993 Fighter of the Year, is the lightest ever to win an
award that is older than the Heisman Trophy. &QL;

SNYDER INSERTS BAKER AS KICKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - On the heels of Arizona State's second straight
loss, Coach  &UR; Bruce Snyder made his first personnel change
Wednesday, naming punter  &UR; Stephen Baker as the field-goal kicker
for Saturday's game with North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Baker replaces redshirt freshman  &UR; Mike Gauthier, who made only
one of four field goals in the Sun Devils' two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think Mike Gauthier could be a fine Division I
kicker,'' Snyder said. ``I just think we need to make a change
right now. I hate doing the same thing over and over if it's not
working.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the definitions of insanity is keep doing the
same thing over and over, thinking you're going to get a different
result. I'm not insane, I don't think.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder typically doesn't like one player to punt and place kick.
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier missed field goals of 44 and 30 yards against Brigham
Young. He made and missed 42-yarders against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping it simple &QL; 
Snyder's back-to-basics approach this week includes making life
simpler for the defense, which returns only three full-time
starters from last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think it's important we don't have a lot of checks,''
he said. ``We've got to get into the flow of the game, go hit some
people and clean up tackles and gang tackle and strip the ball.
It's better than thinking, `What adjustment is this, what
adjustment is that.' We're trying to make it a little easier,
intellectually speaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the defensive newcomers who improved from the first to
second game was junior college transfer  &UR; Junior Ioane, defensive
coordinator  &UR; Phil Snow said. &QL; 
Getting tough &QL; 
Practices have been noticeably more intense this week. Snyder is
keeping a close eye on how his players react, because he is a
strong believer that the effort during the week reflects how the
team plays Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got after them pretty good, and they didn't fight back,''
he said. ``They took it. In order to salvage and be back where they
can be, they've got to work harder. We're going to work them hard,
treat them like dogs if we have to.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have certain standards to how we should play, regardless of
who we're playing against. . . . We didn't have that against BYU. I
don't care who's coming in, what matters is how hard we play.'' &QL;

IF TKACHUK'S GONE, WHO'LL BE LEFT FOR COYOTES?  
 ISBISTER, ADAMS EXPECTED TO TAKE UP SOME SLACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - General Manager Bobby Smith is on record as
saying the Coyotes can win without Captain Keith Tkachuk, the
recalcitrant left wing who refuses to honor the remaining two years
of his contract until it's renegotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Brave talk, no doubt. But can the Coyotes walk his talk?
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes have right wings and several centers who also can
play the left side, but if they are to prove Smith's stance
correct, chances are the onus is going to fall on newly acquired
left wing Greg Adams and bigger, stronger port-sider Brad Isbister.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got 40 goals last year from Keith, but other than that, we
really didn't get much production from our left side,'' Smith said.
``I think Isbister got nine goals and Darrin Shannon had two, so
there's going be a bigger responsibility for all of our forwards to
pick up the goals Keith Tkachuk won't score.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, it's not like subtracting 50 goals from our
lineup. Somebody is going to be on that power play. It's not like
whoever we choose to have on that first-unit power play is going to
get none. They're not going to get Keith's 50, but it's not like
saying, `We're going to start next year and we're going to have 187
goals.' Somebody is going to pick those up.''
</P>
<P>
   In Adams, 35, and Isbister, who's 22 and starting his second NHL
season, the Coyotes have the potential to pick up much of the
slack. The troble is, potential always carries questions. And with
this pair, the ``if'' factor isn't small.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible for me to set a goal for them,'' Smith said.
``If he stays healthy, Adams could score 35 goals. Isbister is a
young kid who's just emerging, but he seems more involved. It's
unfair to speculate.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Adams missed the Stanley Cup playoffs because of
a neck injury that caused his hands to go numb. Last year, his
season was limited to 49 games by a knee injury and a sporadic
recurrence of the neck problem.
</P>
<P>
   Isbister, who started last season in Phoenix but was sent down
to minor league affiliate Springfield for nine games and a
confidence boost before returning to finish with 17 points, is
trying to make his sophomore season a breakout year.
</P>
<P>
   The signs that he can do so are good.
</P>
<P>
   If any Coyotes' player benefited from a rigorous off-season
training program in Southern California that included many NHL
stars, it's him. At 6 feet 2, he's now 225 pounds of chiseled
muscle and looks like a totally different player in scrimmages,
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more confident,'' Isbister said. ``Just working with all
the guys who were down there made a difference. I realized I could
lift as much, if not more, than a lot of them. Just hanging around
with them rubs off on you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, I learned a lot from last year. Looking back on it, I
realized some things I could have done better and must do to be
successful. I have to play a big forward's game and go to the net,
go into the corners and take control and get the puck to my
teammates for plays, or just take it to the net.''
</P>
<P>
   Isbister said the pressure will remain the same whether Tkachuk
returns or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll put pressure on myself, regardless,'' he said. ``I'm
pressuring myself to score more, anyway. If he's not here, I'll
probably get a little more chance to play and a little more ice
time, which means there's also more chance to produce.''
</P>
<P>
   Little question exists about Adams' scoring ability. The former
Northern Arizona star has scored 30 or more goals four times and 20
or more five times during his 15-year career. He had 14 goals and
32 points in little more than a half-season last year. His biggest
question is durability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've really felt good in camp,'' he said Tuesday. ``I went
through my physical, and everything was fine. I'm fine and ready to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he doesn't feel pressure to pick up the missing
production that might be left by Tkachuk's absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The slack can't be picked up by one or two guys,'' he said.
``When a guy like that is missing, it has to be picked up by the
whole team. A couple of guys are not going to replace him.'' &QL;

ROENICK ADDS BULK FOR SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - Assistant captain  &UR; Jeremy Roenick hopes this
will be a season of increases and one thing has already increased:
Jeremy Roenick _ there is a lot more of him.
</P>
<P>
   After undergoing a rigorous off-season weight lifting and
conditioning program in southern California, Roenick reported to
the Coyotes' training camp at 206 pounds, the heaviest of his
10-year NHL career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come in at 197 before, but it was usually more fat than
muscle,'' said Roenick, who looks significantly bigger in the chest
and shoulders, but thinks the new muscle went elsewhere. ``I'm a
lot stronger in my butt and legs. Just my luck, the last place
where I need an extra chunk is on my butt.''
</P>
<P>
   Roenick, who has three times scored more than 100 points in a
season and has twice scored 50 or more goals, has been taken to
task consistently in national hockey publications for falling
production. The 56 points he scored last year was the lowest he's
had in a full season since 1989-90, his first full year in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't listen to that garbage anymore,'' he said. ``I've
worked hard to put myself in the best condition possible to have a
good season with weight training and by working on the (stationary)
bike. I should be much stronger this year.'' &QL; 
Missing member &QL; 
Wing  &UR; Dallas Drake missed Tuesday's scrimmage because of minor back
spasms. He's expected to play in tonight's Black and White
scrimmage at 7 p.m. at the Cellular One Ice Den.
</P>
<P>
   The scrimmage is open to the public, but team officials warn
only 200 seats are available and parking is negligible. &QL; 
New guy &QL; 
With  &UR; Mike Gartner in retirement, wing  &UR; Rick Tocchet has taken back
No. 22, which was worn the past two years by the fast-skating
Gartner. An onlooker joked to General Manager  &UR; Bobby Smith on
Tuesday that ``Gartner seems to have lost a step.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith answered, ``Maybe, but he's playing a lot tougher.'' &QL; 
Team effort &QL; 
Center  &UR; Cliff Ronning believes it unfair to expect one or two
players to pick up the scoring load that will be missed if Captain
 &UR; Keith Tkachuk's demand to renegotiate the remaining two years of
his contract keeps him out for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That situation is tough for everybody,'' Ronning said. ``Right
now we have to hold things together and not key on just one guy
having to score or this guy doing that. It has to be a team effort.
We win or lose as a team and that has to be the attitude all year.
If we play hard together, good things will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   FYI, Tkachuk's fines for missing camp soared past $50,000
Tuesday. &QL;

BASEBALL WASN'T RACIST IN SOSA'S RUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - C'mon now, there isn't really a rising tide that
believes Sammy Sosa is being slighted because he is a black Latin
American, is there?
</P>
<P>
   Please say it ain't so, America.
</P>
<P>
   The single-season home run record had stood for 37 years without
anyone seriously challenging it. So when Mark McGwire reached the
magical number of 62 first, naturally he received the lion's share
of attention.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's home run record is the most sexy and desirable in all
of professional sports. So when McGwire broke Roger Maris' record,
the nation's eyes were glued to the St. Louis Cardinals slugger's
every move. That's why a whopping 43 million people watched the
event live on television, captivated for one glorious evening by a
remarkable accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa came along and hit his 62nd home run five days later. A
record that stood for 37 years was bettered twice in only five
days. That, folks, was the reason the same circuslike atmosphere
didn't surround Sosa's equally remarkable accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, all of the festivities that took place at Busch
Stadium the night McGwire eclipsed Maris were staged by the
Cardinals franchise, not Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning it was Sosa who repeatedly said, ``McGwire is
the man.'' Everyone knew the first to reach 62 would be the more
celebrated of the two. In the end, whoever winds up with more home
runs will get his due.
</P>
<P>
   Take a close look at Sosa's infectious and never-ceasing smile.
Do you see a man who feels pain?
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at the crowds outside of Chicago, those in St.
Louis, San Diego and everywhere else the Cubs play. See how they
stand and give Sosa long ovations every time he steps to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Racism?
</P>
<P>
   Please.
</P>
<P>
   Even Sosa scoffed at such a thought when asked whether he felt
slighted by all the attention McGwire had received leading up to
the night the record was broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course he should be getting all the attention,'' Sosa said
that night. ``He's the first to get there. Like with your children,
the first always gets more attention than the second and so on. I
have no problem with it, I don't see why anyone else should.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this is not to say Major League Baseball didn't make a
grievous error when Sosa hit No. 62 last Sunday at Wrigley Field.
Unlike McGwire's home run balls, which had distinguishable infrared
markings on them, baseball took no such precautions with Sosa's
home runs. Now we have three people claiming they have the genuine
article.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there was no one from baseball at Wrigley Field for
Sosa's historic blasts. Another faux pas on the part of baseball,
especially considering Commissioner Bud Selig was lounging at his
home only 80 miles away in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   But both of those blunders were a case of baseball again finding
a way to show its ineptitude, a serious problem that has afflicted
the game for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Racism, it was not.
</P>
<P>
   If Sosa had reached the 62 plateau first, all of the hoopla that
surrounded that magical night in St. Louis would have occurred
wherever Sosa had been playing. Bet on that.
</P>
<P>
   These days, baseball officials are especially sensitive to even
the slightest appearance of favoritism toward anyone. Front offices
and coaching staffs are more diverse than at any time in the
history of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, I'm for Sammy Sosa. I would love to see a fellow Latin
become the single-season home run record holder. I'm also for Mark
McGwire, having covered his feats for six years.
</P>
<P>
   To say I'm pulling for Sosa over McGwire or vice-versa would be
a lie. I'm pulling for baseball, which is riding this incredible
Sosa-McGwire wave all the way back to the top of the sports heap.
</P>
<P>
   We should all be celebrating the accomplishments of two of the
greatest current players in the game. Instead, a vocal minority is
doing its best to tarnish what's going on, and that's sad.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City and south Florida, the Dominican communities
are considering organizing a protest march against Major League
Baseball over what it deems a slight against Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Radio talk shows in Latin communities are screaming
discrimination. The thrust being that if Sosa were White or even an
African-American like, say, Ken Griffey Jr., that baseball would
have treated him differently.
</P>
<P>
   This should not be a Black-White issue. It should solely be an
issue of two men hitting white baseballs over green fences. To make
it anything else only diminishes what's taking place on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trying to throw a sopping wet blanket on the fabulous
achievements that have taken place, maybe some of the people who
constantly yell racism whenever they can should look around and see
the joy on everyone's face.
</P>
<P>
   Racism definitely occurs in our society. It's up to everyone of
us, including people in baseball, to make sure those responsible
for such vile actions are shown for what they are.
</P>
<P>
   This, however, is not one of those times.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let the party-crashers get away with acts of stupidity and
ignorance. This is one hell of a party and it's not even near
closing time yet, not with the playoffs still on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   To Mark and Sammy: Party on, dudes! &QL;

GOOD PERFORMANCES, DIRECTION ELEVATE `ONE TRUE THING' 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TThe film version of Anna Quindlen's novel, ``One True Thing,''
is a textbook case of how vibrant movie-star performances and
sensitive direction can elevate predictable, overly familiar
material into something reasonably special.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the film is classic soap opera, divided between strong,
noble and long-suffering women and weak, philandering and abusive
men. It's also driven by conflicts that are actually
misunderstandings capable of being sorted out in a couple of frank
conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the film does a solid job of exploring the complications
of post-childhood family relationships, and there's no denying the
effectiveness of its performances or its power on an audience. Each
of its three stars would seem to be an instant Oscar contender.
</P>
<P>
   The film opens in late 1988, as Ellen Gulden (Renee Zellweger),
a Harvard-educated, twentysomething investigative reporter is being
questioned by a police detective about the recent death of her
mother, with the hint that a mercy killing may be suspected.
</P>
<P>
   As the interview continues, we flash back to the year before, as
Ellen, who works for New York magazine, returns to her small-town
family home for the 55th birthday of her father (William Hurt), a
college teacher, writer and winner of the National Book Award for
his critical study of T.S. Eliot.
</P>
<P>
   We quickly see that Ellen has an uneasy relationship with both
her semi-celebrity father, whose approval she desperately seeks but
can't quite get, and with her 47-year-old mother (Meryl Streep),
who is a kind of ditzy, June Cleaver-like, '50s-style happy
homemaker and everything Ellen doesn't want to become.
</P>
<P>
   When they learn her mother has cancer, her somewhat selfish
father demands that Ellen quit her job, move back home and take
care of her. She unhappily assumes the burden and the rest of the
film chronicles the series of discoveries she makes about her
parents and how it changes her own view of life.
</P>
<P>
   It's familiar territory, with no real surprises along the way
and more than its fair share of highly Hollywoodized elements,
including the entire small college town setting (which seems as
impossibly idealized as Frank Capra's Bedford Falls) and several of
those family screaming matches in the street you only see in
movies.
</P>
<P>
   The two leads are cast against type, and it doesn't completely
work. The Streep character is supposed to seem weak in the
beginning and gradually appear strong, and yet Streep-the-star
projects nothing but strength. Hurt's transition in our eyes is the
opposite, but his persona projects intellectual weakness from the
get-go.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even if their individual persona work against the overall
dramatic effectiveness and believablity of the characters, Streep
and Hurt are such mesmerizing presences that they're always a
pleasure to watch. Emotionally, they pull us into the family drama
and keep us riveted to the screen as only first-rank movie stars
can do.
</P>
<P>
   Director Carl Franklin (``One False Move,'' ``Devil in a Blue
Dress'') wisely underplays many of his scenes and does an
exceptional job of establishing his relationships and telling
background subtly, through nuance and suggestion. He doesn't shy
away from the depicting a slow death by cancer in (depressing)
detail.
</P>
<P>
   He's also smart enough to allow Zellweger to carry the movie,
despite the higher marquee pedigree of his older stars. She's
terrific every step of the way, communicating all the frustration,
suppressed trauma and sense of self-survival the character needs to
be totally believable and totally sympathetic as the audience point
of view.
</P>
<P>
   One True Thing. Directed by Carl Franklin. Screenplay by Karen
Croner. Cast: Meryl Streep, Renee Zellweger, William Hurt, Tom
Everett Scott. Universal. 127 minutes. Rated R for terminal-cancer
theme.

DIRECTOR'S CUT OF `TOUCH OF EVIL' IS BETTER ONLY IN SOME WAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Orson Welles' 1958 thriller, ``Touch of Evil,'' was the last
film he would ever direct for a Hollywood studio, and _ though he
would go on to make a number of low-budget, independent films
during the next 27 years _ it was the last to be widely regarded as
a masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   By this time in his career, he was already anathema to studio
heads, and he got the job largely through the hard lobbying of the
film's star, Charlton Heston, who was a longtime Welles admirer and
not afraid to use his clout to pressure the Universal Studios brass
into giving him another chance.
</P>
<P>
   The story is that Universal ultimately relented because it
regarded the film _ a melodrama about a Mexican crime buster
(Heston) who falls into a web of evil in a Tijuana-like border town
_ as a B-movie programmer that Welles couldn't much hurt.
</P>
<P>
   It was, for Welles, a remarkable smooth moviemaking experience,
with no budget problems and little studio interference until he
turned in a rough cut. At this point, Universal _ confused by
Welles' narrative _ had another director shoot 10 minutes of
(mostly linking) footage, and rework the cut.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, Welles was off to other things. It was his pattern
throughout his career to lose interest in his projects during the
editing process, and _ as his biographers unanimously agree _
something in his psychology needed to be an artistic martyr.
</P>
<P>
   But when he saw Universal's cut in December 1957, he did dash
off a pleading 58-page memo to studio chief Edward Muhl outlining
the changes he thought would make the movie smoother and more
accessible _ which Muhl promptly ignored.
</P>
<P>
   When the film was released, it was an instant and overwhelming
flop. Audiences found it cold, unpleasant, impossible to follow and
rather ridiculous _ especially the casting of the Heston and
Marlene Dietrich as Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, of course, that decision was reversed.
Championed first by French critics, the film has become almost
universally accepted as one of Welles' most uncompromising and
accomplished works, and the stylistic summation of Hollywood film
noir.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Welles' performance as the incorrigibly corrupt,
relentless despicable, 300-pound villain has been lauded as his
most daring performance _ a genuinely harrowing portrait of pure
evil at the very heart of American democracy that singlehandedly
transforms a cheap thriller into a tragedy of Shakespearean
proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the legend of the Welles memo, and the director's own
stories told in a thousand interviews and talk show appearances
about the ``Touch of Evil'' that should have been, have echoed down
through the decades. In effect: ``If you think the movie is good
now, you should've seen it before it was butchered.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, finally, we can. The occasion of the film's 40th birthday
this year has inspired a team of eminent Wellesians _ including
critic Jonathan Rosenbaum and Oscar-winning movie sound editor
Walter Murch (``Apocalypse Now'') _ to get Universal's approval to
re-edit the film to the specifications of the Welles memo: a
director's cut, as it were, from the grave.
</P>
<P>
   The results, ``The Re-edit of `Touch of Evil,''' are on display.
At 113 minutes, it's 20 minutes longer than the 93-minute release
version, and five minutes longer than the 108-minute ``preview
version'' that appeared in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   How different is it? As Heston always strongly maintained, the
Welles cut is in no way a different film _ both go to the same
place in much the same way. But there are some noticeable changes,
with some artistic gains and, more surprisingly, some losses.
</P>
<P>
   The most glaring change comes right away _ the titles and Henry
Mancini's jazzy score have been removed from the famous tracking
title sequence in which Welles skillfully chronicles a murder,
introduces his main characters and explores his two (Mexican and
American) border towns _ all in a single, unbroken shot.
</P>
<P>
   This surgery heightens the sights and sounds of the border
towns, and gives the film some A-movie dignity. On the other hand,
it removes some of the sleaziness that Mancini's deliberately
tawdry score establishes for the film, and takes us a big step away
from the '50s.
</P>
<P>
   The second most noticeable difference is in the cross-cutting,
pacing and arrangement of scenes in the parallel stories of the
film's husband and wife (Janet Leigh) protagonists _ as he is swept
up in the murder investigation and she is kidnapped and terrorized
by Mexican hoodlums.
</P>
<P>
   This was the part of the studio cut that irked Welles the most,
and which he argued against most strongly in his memo. And he was
right: his cut builds more suspense, gives equal weight to the two
story lines, and makes the film seem more balanced and much less
jarring to the senses.
</P>
<P>
   The other changes are smaller and harder to spot. Frames have
been removed from the shot of a corpse to heighten dramatic effect
here, a reaction shot has been moved there. The sound is clearer,
some of the non-Welles footage is gone, several of the supporting
players come into sharper focus, and the narrative generally makes
more sense.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, while all this is definitely an improvement on one level,
the changes also detract from the ``Touch of Evil'' experience on
another, and could even _ one suspects _ harm the film's critical
reputation and vaulted place in film history.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the thing that generations of critics have loved
about the film is its deceptive B-movie sleaziness, its fuzzy
character motivations, its jarring and convoluted cross-cutting,
its lack of narrative sense, its sheer unconventionality.
</P>
<P>
   Just think of how betrayed all those essayists and critics are
going to feel when they find out that much of that bold stylistic
murkiness they've been praising for four decades was unintentional!
Maybe, when all is said and done, it's never a very good idea to
tamper with a masterpiece.

JESUS FINDS LITTLE TOLERANCE IN VISIT TO SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sometimes, just to stay sane, I imagine what it
would be like if Jesus came back, physically, among us. ould he
spend his time condemning homosexuality and women preachers _
something he never did the last time around _ or would he stick to
his main message that we should love God and our neighbor and care
for the poor, sick and imprisoned?
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Declan Deane, one courageous Jesuit priest from St.
Monica's parish in Moraga, Calif., did some similar imagining last
month as part of the West Coast Call to Action convention.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Chicago, Call to Action is a group of nuns, brothers,
laity and a few priests. In 1996, the group was among many cited by
the bishop of Lincoln, Neb., as ``perilous to and incompatible with
the Catholic faith'' and a cause for excommunication.
</P>
<P>
   Why? As part of their quest for a more inclusive, Christ-like
faith, the group's members encourage discussion of such subjects as
the second-class citizenship of Catholic females. Pope John Paul II
has declared that such discussions by Catholic faithful violate the
church's ``infallible'' teachings.
</P>
<P>
   In a homily delivered during the convention's closing Mass,
Deane imagined Jesus landing at San Francisco International and
heading to the Commonwealth Club where he is a substitute for the
originally scheduled speaker _ ``Deepak Shupra,'' who was to have
lectured on ``Finding Peace of Mind.'' When Jesus hears that his
lecture fee is $25,000, he says: ``Go and disperse it among the
poor and homeless in the street.''
</P>
<P>
   During his lecture, he tells the audience that they can find
peace of mind by avoiding greed in all forms. He advises them to
sell all their possessions and give everything to the poor. The
audience grouses that Deepak Shupra would have been more inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Jesus is invited to dinner with all of San Francisco's
religious leaders by the archbishop of San Francisco. Jesus says he
can't come that night because he's already agreed to have dinner at
a restaurant ``with some of his friends from the gay and lesbian,
bisexual and transgender community.'' He invites the religious
leaders to join him, but they decline.
</P>
<P>
   After that, everywhere Jesus goes, he is followed by protesters
from the Christian Coalition. They carry signs that claim: ``This
is not the Christ. He welcomes sinners and dines with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesus visits prisoners in San Quentin and talks about the
sanctity of all human life ``from the unborn child in the womb to
my humble friends on Death Row.'' Before long, he has ``alienated
both liberals and conservatives.'' The number of his followers
decreases.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who don't desert Jesus are a group of faithful
women. So obvious is their presence, Jesus is questioned by the
Vatican's U.S. representative, the papal nunzio. He tells Jesus the
women are ``giving a bad impression'' because it looks like Jesus
thinks they can be ministers equally with men.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus quotes St. Paul: ``In Christ there is neither male nor
female, but all are one in him.''
</P>
<P>
   The papal nunzio asks: ``Do you think you know better than the
Holy Father (the pope)?'' Jesus says: ``Before the Holy Father was,
I am.''
</P>
<P>
   In a few hours, Jesus is under investigation by the Vatican's
keeper of Catholic orthodoxy, the Sacred Congregation for the
Doctrine of the Faith.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few days, Jesus recommends that people become more
child-like. He eats dinner at the home of a Mafia godfather, who
promptly gives half of what he owns to the poor and pledges to pay
back all whom he has defrauded ``four times over.'' Jesus
pronounces the man a ``child of God'' and is denounced by
politicians as a ``dangerous radical.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI starts trailing him.
</P>
<P>
   Then Jesus heals the servant of a Muslim after he says he can
tell that Jesus is ``from God.'' Jesus lauds the Muslim's faith.
Jesus receives death threats and must flee San Francisco for
another place.
</P>
<P>
   End of Deane's homily.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Pope John Paul II issued a couple of pronouncements
aimed primarily at curbing liberal clergy and theologians in the
United States. One declared that teachings that deviate from
Catholicism's ``definitive truths'' _ bans on euthanasia, female
priests and sex outside of marriage _ violate church law.
Transgressors can be punished with anything from a warning to
excommunication.
</P>
<P>
   Deane did his imagining in front of 300 people and allowed his
homily to be reprinted. As I said, he is one brave priest.

 World rights except Great Britain and Australia 
 With color slide and black and white photo of Malcolm McDowell in
``Fantasy Island.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``It's a very interesting part _ rather dark with great
emotional variety. I get to do it every week. I get paid for it and
we're shooting it in Hawaii. What the hell else is there to talk
about, really?''
 &HT;    What indeed?
 &HT;    Malcolm McDowell, the young English rebel of such classic films
as ``A Clockwork Orange'' (1971), ``If'' (1968), ``O Lucky Man''
(1973) and ``Britannia Hospital'' (1982) is 55 now. Silver haired,
slim, just right to step into the white shoes of ``Fantasy
Island'''s Mr. Roarke. The show debuts on ABC Sept. 26.
 &HT;    Remember Roarke (Ricardo Montalban) in the l978-l984 series
welcoming guests to his tropical island with his sidekick Tattoo
(Herve Villechaize)?
 &HT;    Well they're reviving the concept but with a few differences,
starting with Roarke. When McDowell's Roarke is getting dressed,
riffling through a wardrobe full of white suits, he selects the
only black one. This is not the smiling, charming, benevolent
Montalban version anymore.
 &HT;    ``He's much darker and edgier,'' grins McDowell, ``not
saccharine, not pontificating.''
 &HT;    McDowell says his first reaction to stepping onto the new island
was one of horror and he had to be persuaded to look at a script.
``I took the part because it was dark. I liked the producer's sort
of 'Men in Black' approach to it.''
 &HT;    Travelers to this ``Fantasy Island'' will first pass through a
mysterious travel agency run by a couple of veteran actors _
``Picket Fences''' Fyvush Finkel and movie great Sylvia Sydney.
Then on to the island where their fantasies will be fulfilled
though they may not always like it.
 &HT;    The old Roarke made sure his guests had a pleasant time.
McDowell's Roarke believes firmly in the old saying: ``Be careful
what you wish for _ you may get it.''
 &HT;    He's attended by a strange concierge and a bellhop played by
Louis Lombardi (``Natural Born Killers'') and ``Frasier'''s Edward
Hibbert, both of whom keep dropping clues that they are on the
island to pay for their sins. Their female colleague Ariel played
by ``Twin Peak'''s Madchen Amick can morph into any female form to
fulfill any fantasy.
 &HT;    Is the island really the afterlife, as some think?
 &HT;    ``We're all dead, yeah,'' laughs McDowell collapsing in an easy
chair in a bungalow suite at in the Pasadena Ritz. ``But they make
the afterlife seem quite palatable, with these gorgeous babes
coming out of the water waving at the camera.''
 &HT;    But do Roarke and his crew inhabit heaven or hell? ``When I show
it to friends in Europe,'' says McDowell, ``they see Roarke as God.
When I show it to Americans they think he's the Devil. What do you
think that says about the two cultures?''
 &HT;    Married to his third wife Kelly, McDowell has two teenage
children from his marriage to Mary Steenburgen, now Mrs. Ted
Danson. He lives in homes in Los Angeles, the Ojai Valley (50 miles
north of L.A.) and in Tuscany.
 &HT;    A slightly sinister air is notably absent in person but has
served him well in his long career. He's made over 70 movies, some
of them among the greatest British movies ever made. And he's been
kept busier than most of the screen's nice guys.
 &HT;    Just by casting him as Roarke the producers are sending a
message about the kind of show this will be. ``Of course this
Roarke is malevolent,'' says McDowell, ``There are no boundaries
and so many layers to him. Somewhere there is a glimmer of
something, but God knows how deep or locked away it is. He is
all-knowing, all-seeing. He is this Machiavellian character.''
 &HT;    The original ``Fantasy Island'' was made cheaply in and around
Los Angeles, but this one is first cabin all the way. The pilot was
shot on three Hawaiian Islands. Not a bad place to go to work every
day.
 &HT;    And if McDowell ever gets to fulfill his own fantasy, the actor
has one all lined up and ready to fly:
 &HT;    ``When I was in my early teens, I lived near a race track in
England. And they had the British Grand Prix. My heroes were
drivers like Stirling Moss and Mike Hawthorne. So my fantasy would
be to be in a 1950s race car in a race with those great champions
and beat them.''

`CLOCKWATCHERS' IS A DARK COMEDY GEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Clockwatchers'' opened in New York months ago and it's already
slated to be released on video in October, so who knows why its
distributor waited so long to give it a wider release.
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame this little dark comedy gem may not have the chance
to find its audience because it's quite appealing and features a
nuanced, movie-stealing performance by art-house darling Parker
Posey.
</P>
<P>
   It might be easy to dismiss ``Clockwatchers'' as another
absurdist comedy like ``Nine To Five,'' but there are more things
happening in Jill Sprecher's sharp, detailed exercise about four
temps, or ``corporate orphans,'' who become friends and buck the
system while working for Global Credit.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the women has a dream. Margaret (Posey) is one of those
over-qualified rebels who really just wants (and deserves)
recognition and a title. The film's narrator, Iris (Toni Collette),
likes to write and observe, while Paula (Lisa Kudrow) fantasizes
about becoming an actress and Jane (Alanna Ubach) is about to be
married to a seemingly perfect guy.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of the story, written by Sprecher and her sister
Karen, is that it gives each woman a private life and a full
personality. And the characters aren't always pretty. There is a
real pathos at the core of the movie _ a statement on the way some
companies chew up their workers, continuing to hire contract labor
for whom there are no benefits or security, while demandiing the
same attitudes and professionalism as from the select group of
regular staffers.
</P>
<P>
   A clock ticks through most of the movie. It's a reminder that
time never stops, though in a job like this, it moves very slowly.
The four women find comfort in their bond, but soon it seems the
company is out to get them. A rash of thefts have immobilized the
office and because they're ``temps,'' and none of the staff people
who depend upon their skills even know their names, they're
immediately suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly the system breaks them apart with suspicions, doubts and
accusations. There will be no fraternizing while working, no
personal phone calls, and certainly no unwarranted socializing.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, watching ``Clockwatchers,'' which feels akin to Billy
Wilder's ``The Apartment'' in its depiction of the dashing of
corporate hopes, is almost like being at work instead of at the
movies. We're thrust into the grind with the women. It's to the
credit of the cast and director that we feel like we're buried in
the monotonous minutia handled by administrative ``assistants'' day
in and day out.
</P>
<P>
   All of the cast are terrific and bring a wonderful sense of
humanity and complexity to roles that get darker and more difficult
as the film progresses. Though Australian actress Toni Collette is
the focal point, and she's fun to watch as an insecure dowdy who
blossoms (much like her role in ``Muriel's Wedding''), it's Posey
who brings the real heart and soul to the party.
</P>
<P>
   She's funny, heart-breaking and deep as a smart cookie who can't
find a place in the work world because she's more capable than her
bosses. Her refusal to let them break her is her downfall as well
as her strength.
</P>
<P>
   Clockwatchers. Directed by Jill Sprecher. Written by Jill and
Karen Sprecher. Cast: Toni Collette, Parker Posey, Lisa Kudrow,
Alanna Ubach. Artistic License Films. 96 minutes. Rated PG-13 for
language.

<P>
   George Orwell is so synonymous with his downbeat look at the
future, ``1984'' (and to a lesser extent, his send-up of communism,
``Animal Farm'') that his very name has come to stand for absurdly
oppressive political misrule _ Orwellian.
</P>
<P>
   But he had a lighter side as well, and many Orwell scholars
actually prefer his cycle of semi-autobiographical novels written
in the early '30s: ``Down and Out in London and Paris,'' ``Burmese
Days'' and ``Keep the Aspidistra Flying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Merry War'' is a film version of this last novel. In the
hands of British director Robert Bierman (``Vampire's Kiss''), it
makes a reasonably engaging light satire and '30s nostalgia piece,
if not exactly a laugh-out-loud comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1934 London, the surrogate Orwell character is Gordon
Comstock (Richard E. Grant), an angry young man who, as the film
opens, is in the process of quitting his job as the ace copywriter
of the New Albion Publishing Company for the higher calling of
poetry.
</P>
<P>
   The film follows his downward spiral as he tries to live the
bohemian life and is increasingly torn between his ideals of
poverty, art and honesty on the one hand, and middle-class
respectability and conformity (represented by a aspidisatra plant)
on the other.
</P>
<P>
   He's also a bit of a pompous twit, whose self-destructive streak
constantly forces him to bite the various hands that attempt to
help him: his waitress sister (Harriet Walter), his publisher best
friend (Jim Carter) and his long-suffering fiance (Helena Bonham
Carter).
</P>
<P>
   It's a movie that's likely to disappoint anyone who comes into
it with too high expectations. As satire, biography, or star
vehicle for the second-billed Helena Bonham Carter (who's basically
wasted in thankless role), it's nothing to get excited about.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, ``A Merry War'' is a literate, vaguely humorous,
never overly ambitious slice of '30s London life with pleasing
period detail, glitzy deco interiors and a slight Noel Coward edge
to the dialogue. Anglophiles should revel in it.
</P>
<P>
   So should fans of Richard E. Grant _ who's more commonly a
supporting player and the best thing in any movie he happens to be
in (``The Player,'' ``Ready to Wear''). His clever and
multi-leveled comic performance here makes this self-obsessed,
rather insufferable surogate-Orwell amazingly sympathetic, and
worthy of our attention.
</P>
<P>
   A Merry War. Directed by Robert Bierman. Screenplay by Alan
Plater. Cast: Richard E. Grant, Helena Bonham Carter, Jim Carter,
Harriet Walter. First Look Pictures. 101 minutes. Unrated.

`PERMANENT MIDNIGHT' OFFERS SOME EXCELLENT PERFORMANCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A couple of excellent performances are showcased in the
problematic story structure of ``Permanent Midnight,'' based on the
autobiographical tell-all of a double life by Jerry Stahl.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl was a novelist and writer in Hollywood who script-doctored
TV shows during the day while simultaneously addling his mind and
body with heroin and cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   As adapted by director David Veloz, the film uses a flashback
and narration format that doesn't work very smoothly, yet Ben
Stiller and Elizabeth Hurley turn in wonderfully gritty and
accomplished work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to shoot heroin, drink wheatgrass, run five miles every
day _ I was an L.A. junkie. I stayed fit,'' notes Jerry (Stiller)
to Kitty (Maria Bello), a fellow rehab veteran and ex-junkie. Kitty
picks Jerry up at a hamburger joint, where he's working a
low-paying job while doing his outpatient stint. He's in Phoenix
and is about to head home to L.A., the place where his high life
began and ended.
</P>
<P>
   The two begin a romance in a seedy motel. Jerry tells Kitty
about his pitiful descent in drug hell. Slowly, in flashbacks, he
unfolds his darkly tragi-comic tale, which includes a marriage of
convenience to the British Sandra (Hurley), who grows to love him
and becomes pregnant by him; his promising career and the
high-powered agent who wants to represent his work, and about the
birth of his daughter, Nina.
</P>
<P>
   Painfully, Jerry relays how each of these extraordinary
occurrences turns sour and unravels because of his addiction. His
story is funny, sad, harrowing, senseless and steeped in
self-loathing and anguish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Permanent Midnight'' refuses to romanticize Stahl and opts to
explore the despair and worthlessness behind the addict's need.
Unlike ``Leaving Las Vegas,'' a movie to which it bears more than a
passing resemblance, it refuses to turn its protagonist into a
lovable if wayward hero. Jerry is selfish and unable to care about
the people who believe in him or his talent. The film is more an
epistle about tough love than an elevation of bad behavior into
something to cheer about.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the credit goes to Ben Stiller. He is becoming a
surprisingly unconventional leading man these days though he's not
cut out of the usual movie star cloth and he doesn't emanate a lot
of warmth onscreen. Still, despite his willingness to go all out on
a limb, the relationships in the movie don't feel entirely true.
</P>
<P>
   While it's a cinematic staple to use a stranger as the catalyst
who changes a character's luck, Kitty isn't real _ she's Jerry's
fantasy projection. And Jerry's marriage to Sandra is given such an
off-handed, simplistic telling that we never understand their bond
or why Sandra sticks around as long as she does.
</P>
<P>
   While such flaws aren't fatal, they keep the film from having
the emotional depth and impact it might. Instead, like its
protagonist's life, the movie ultimately succeeds best at keeping
the viewer at an arm's distance.
</P>
<P>
   Permanent Midnight. Directed and written by David Veloz. Cast:
Ben Stiller, Elizabeth Hurley, Maria Bello, Owen Wilson, Cheryl
Ladd, Janeane Garofalo. Artisan Entertainment. 90 minutes. Rated R
for language, scenes depicting drug use.

`FARMER'S WIFE' A TOUGH ROW TO HOE FOR VIEWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Farmer's Wife'' is billed as a love story, and it is most
definitely a stirring account of one woman's commitment to her
marriage, her faith and her husband's dream.
</P>
<P>
   But David Sutherland's film about Juanita and Darrel
Buschkoetter's struggle to keep farming in the face of overwhelming
obstacles is not entirely successful because, for most of its
three-night run, it is unceasingly gloomy.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't Sutherland's fault. The filmmaker virtually lived
with the Buschkoetters for long periods over three years (1994-97)
to achieve a cinema verit &UR; gfacute &LR; e feel that is arresting and
alluring. But, over that three-year period, people with less
courage than Juanita Buschkoetter would have been driven todivorce,
maybe even violence. As a result, staying with the Buschkoetters
for just 6{ hours takes enormous willpower.
</P>
<P>
   Most disappointing is that Sutherland's camera missed the one
event _ an emotional outburst by Darrel Buschkoetter _ that
ultimately may have been the catalyst that changed the
Buschkoetters' lives. Still, for those of sturdy constitution,
``The Farmer's Wife'' provides more honest, intimate drama than a
month's worth of fictional prime-time fare.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the fine journalistic tradition of ``Frontline,'' the
film's real strength may lie in the questions it raises about the
wisdom of clinging at all costs to a noble but possibly outdated
tradition.
</P>

CHAN ATTEMPTS TO BROADEN INTERNATIONAL APPEAL WITH `RUSH HOUR' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The collapse of the Hong Kong movie business during the last few
years has left Jackie Chan the biggest star of an industry that is
no longer solvent enough to pay him what he's worth on the world
market. As one journalist put it, he's become ``a head without a
body.''
</P>
<P>
   So, even though he's still that city's official tourist symbol,
he's increasingly become an American-financed international star _
transplanting his comic kung fu to the occidental settings of films
such as ``Rumble in the Bronx'' and ``Mr. Nice Guy.''
</P>
<P>
   And his new film, ``Rush Hour,'' is a calculated attempt to
significantly broaden that international appeal. For the first
time, he's teamed with an American comic _ Chris Tucker _ in a
formula Hollywood comedy with no kung fu credentials behind the
camera.
</P>
<P>
   It could pay off at the box-office, but die-hard Chan fans will
definitely find it one of his lesser efforts. He's so subdued and
overwhelmed by Tucker that he barely seems to be in the film, and
the Pacific Rim casting chemistry never really clicks.
</P>
<P>
   He plays a gentle Hong Kong cop who is sent to L.A. to help the
FBI and LAPD track down his old enemy, an ex-Hong Kong gang leader
(Ken Leung) who moved east after the '97 takeover and has just
kidnapped the 11-year-old daughter (Julia Hsu) of the Chinese
Consul (Tzi Ma).
</P>
<P>
   Considered a nuisance by the FBI, he's pawned off on the
maverick of the LAPD, an impossibly incompetent detective (Tucker),
who guides him around the city and gets him in heaps of trouble as
they bumble their way toward solving the case.
</P>
<P>
   Chan's natural sweetness shines through pleasantly here and
there, and he has one clever routine _ a sequence in which he tries
to save two gigantic, tottering Tang Dynasty vases at the same time
he's fighting off a small army of bad guys.
</P>
<P>
   But it's Tucker's movie, and most of it has the lanky star
abusing everyone in sight in a screechy, high-pitched voice that
plays like fingernails on a blackboard. The publicity (accurately,
for a change) bills him as ``the biggest mouth in the West.''
</P>
<P>
   Even by the loose standards of a throwaway action comedy, the
script is an insult to all reason, and the direction of Brett
Radner (Tucker's director in ``Money Talks'') is limp and
uninspired _ nothing close to the zip Sammo Hung gave Chan's last
film, ``Mr. Nice Guy.''
</P>
<P>
   With its explicit child abuse, its race-baiting humor and its
gleeful climatic destruction of a museum full of Chinese art
treasures, ``Rush Hour'' is also the first Jackie Chan movie that
often seems deliberately mean-spirited and distasteful.
</P>
<P>
   Rush Hour. Directed by Brett Ratner. Screenplay by Jim Kouf and
Ross LaManna. Cast: Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker, Tom Wilkinson, Chris
Penn, Elizabeth Pena. New Line Cinema. 97 minutes. Rated PG-13 for
violence and language.

`FIRST LOVE, LAST RITES' LOSES SOMETHING IN THE TRANSLATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hot, humid swamps of Houma, La., aren't the only thing that
are buggy and stagnant in this inert _ if atmospheric _ screen
adaptation of Ian McEwan's 1975 short story.
</P>
<P>
   The British writer has had other works transferred to the screen
with more success. ``The Comfort Of Strangers'' intrigued because
of its fine cast (and Venice setting) and ``The Cement Garden''
creepily transported the viewer into a world without adults where
lines cross and the story's teenage siblings can never return to
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately ``First Love, Last Rites'' has none of those
beguiling concepts. This slight story of first love between two
young adults _ Sissel (Natasha Gregson Wagner) and Joey (Giovanni
Ribisi), who shack up in a single room and play house over the
long, hot summer _ initially engages with a creepy enough
undercurrent as Sissel's intense, scary father, Henry (Robert John
Burke), tries to ferret out Joey's intentions toward his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The two men have gone hunting, and are knee deep in the slime of
the bayou with eels and snakes skirting by. Henry shoots a bird and
orders Joey to fetch it, same as he might a dog. An ominousness
permeates the air. Will he shoot the boy because he's sleeping with
his daughter?
</P>
<P>
   No such luck. There are several hints of similar foreboding and
doom, but director Jesse Peretz chooses to skim over them and lands
with a thud in the end. All the gothic, over-the-top metaphors _ a
pregnant rat scratching in the wall that is a statement on Sissel's
female fecundity; eels snaking through Joey's nocturnal dreams of
Sissel, floating in red water, symbolizing his fear and desire _
are thrown to the wind in favor of a flat, conventional ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``First Love, Last Rites'' turns into a maudlin movie about the
``joys and sorrows of lovers everywhere'' and the tame attitude
that while love can be bliss, it can't last forever.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest lapse in judgment was trying to turn a short
story devoid of dramatic impetus into a feature-length movie in the
first place. David Ryan's script can't sustain itself and resorts
to repetitious, lingering filler shots of the couple sweatily
making love again and again.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the film becomes as claustrophobic as the squalid
single room the couple inhabit. And that's doubly infuriating. This
study in the decomposition and erosion of that first flush of
desire perfectly parallels the course of the movie itself. It's a
waste of time that makes us feel not only dulled, but duped.
</P>
<P>
   First Love, Last Rites. Directed by Jesse Peretz. Written by
David Ryan. Cast: Giovanni Ribisi, Natasha Gregson Wagner, Robert
John Burke, Jeanetta Arnette. Strand Releasing. 93 minutes. Rated R

 &HT;    
 &HT;    A letter this week to The Washington Post by Rich Davis of
Lawrence, Kan., begins, ''If actions speak louder than words, here
is what our children can learn from our president:''
 &HT;    --Women are sex objects.
 &HT;    --Honesty is not the best policy.
 &HT;    --Rules are for losers.
 &HT;    --If you are contrite, they can't indict.
 &HT;    --Never accept responsibility for your wrongdoing.
 &HT;    --Character doesn't matter.
 &HT;    Yet what have adults have learned from reading the ghastly Starr
Report? Absolutely nothing. They still approve of Clinton's job
performance by 66 percent in an NBC poll Wednesday.
 &HT;    Where are the nation's clergy, America's moral leaders on this
issue? With few exceptions they are either beguiled by his charm;
or, if outraged, have remained scandalously silent.
 &HT;    At a White House prayer breakfast, Clinton made his best
confession yet: ``I don't think there is a fancy way to say that I
have sinned. It is important to me that everybody who has been hurt
know that the sorrow I feel is genuine,'' mentioning Monica
Lewinsky for the first time.
 &HT;    He smoothly talked about the need for ''genuine repentance, a
determination to change and to repair breeches of my own making.''
Using David's phrase in Psalm 51, he spoke of having a ''broken
spirit.''
 &HT;    Oh, he was crushed, all right. Five sentences later he announced
what he would do about his sin: ''I will instruct my lawyers to
mount a vigorous defense using all available, appropriate
arguments.''
 &HT;    What arguments? Over the weekend, his lawyers continued to
maintain Clinton's contention that he was ''legally accurate'' in
stating that he did not have sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky. So
the lies of his hired guns continue, in flat contradiction to his
confession of sin.
 &HT;    Yet pastors who heard him last Friday were moved. The Rev. J.D.
Jakes, a popular Dallas preacher, said, ''Americans can relate to
his human frailty and are looking to see if it's possible to
restore fallen people.''
 &HT;    Rev. Robert Franklin, director of Atlanta's Interdenominational
Theological Center, gushed, ''It was a scene of biblical
proportions.''
 &HT;    Such clergy are confusing forgiveness with justice.
 &HT;    Chuck Colson, a White House aide to President Nixon, recalls:
''Twenty-five years ago, I became a Christian in the midst of
Watergate. I asked forgiveness for my sins and I knew God forgave
me.
 &HT;    ``But I also knew I had to pay the consequences for breaking the
law. I pled guilty and went to prison.''
 &HT;    If the president were truly contrite, he would not only
acknowledge that he has committed perjury, encouraged Monica
Lewinsky to lie, and tried to silence her with gifts and a New York
job, but he would put the nation ahead of his own desire to be
president, and resign.
 &HT;    Since he is unlikely to take this honorable step, Congress must
impeach him.
 &HT;    Colson says, ''Impeachment, remember, is essential to preserve
the rule of law because under our Constitution, a sitting president
cannot be indicted for crimes. So the only way to make him subject
to the law, and preserve the rule of law, is through the
impeachment process.''
 &HT;    Colson prays Clinton is repentant, and that Americans will
forgive. ''But that doesn't mean he's entitled to avoid the
consequences of his sin. If the law has been broken, justice
demands a penalty be paid. Congress therefore must do its duty and
decide if the facts warrant impeachment.''
 &HT;    The Rev. Terry Fullam, an Episcopal priest and my former pastor,
recalled that the thief hanging on the cross next to Jesus showed
both contrition and justice in saying, ''We are punished justly,
for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done
nothing wrong.''
 &HT;    In an interview, George Gallup noted that at the beginning of
the Watergate hearings in June 1973, a Gallup Poll found only 19
percent of the American people felt Nixon should be impeached.
 &HT;    By the end of the year, it rose to 35 percent, still quite low.
 &HT;    But after a House committee voted for impeachment, 65 percent
supported the step, Gallup said.
 &HT;    Let the hearings begin.
 &HT;    As one insider put it, ''President Clinton can not be trusted in
any decision. He should go. He has lost all credibility, all moral
leadership. Why limp along for two more years?''
 &HT;    Or our children will learn more lessons, as Rich Davis puts it:
 &HT;    --Anything goes if you are not caught.
 &HT;    --A clever lie is admirable.
 &HT;    --Blame others if you are caught doing something wrong.
 &HT;    --Break your marriage vows with impunity.
 &HT;    --You may not judge others (hear that, parents?) if you are not
perfect.
 &HT;    --Sex has nothing to do with love.
 &HT;    --Falsely swearing under oath carries no penalty.
 &HT;    --Cheaters usually prosper.
 &HT;    --Apologies serve as punishment.

Lewinsky to lie, and tried to silence her with gifts and a New York
job, but he would put the nation ahead of his own desire to be
president, and resign.
 &HT;    Since he is unlikely to take this honorable step, Congress must
impeach him.
 &HT;    Colson says, ''Impeachment, remember, is essential to preserve
the rule of law because under our Constitution, a sitting president
cannot be indicted for crimes. So the only way to make him subject
to the law, and preserve the rule of law, is through the
impeachment process.''
 &HT;    Colson prays Clinton is repentant, and that Americans will
forgive. ''But that doesn't mean he's entitled to avoid the
consequences of his sin. If the law has been broken, justice
demands a penalty be paid. Congress therefore must do its duty and
decide if the facts warrant impeachment.''
 &HT;    The Rev. Terry Fullam, an Episcopal priest and my former pastor,
recalled that the thief hanging on the cross next to Jesus showed
both contrition and justice in saying, ''We are punished justly,
for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done
nothing wrong.''
 &HT;    In an interview, George Gallup noted that at the beginning of
the Watergate hearings in June 1973, a Gallup Poll found only 19
percent of the American people felt Nixon should be impeached.
 &HT;    By the end of the year, it rose to 35 percent, still quite low.
 &HT;    But after a House committee voted for impeachment, 65 percent
supported the step, Gallup said.
 &HT;    Let the hearings begin.
 &HT;    As one insider put it, ''President Clinton can not be trusted in
any decision. He should go. He has lost all credibility, all moral
leadership. Why limp along for two more years?''
 &HT;    Or our children will learn more lessons, as Rich Davis puts it:
 &HT;    --Anything goes if you are not caught.
 &HT;    --A clever lie is admirable.
 &HT;    --Blame others if you are caught doing something wrong.
 &HT;    --Break your marriage vows with impunity.
 &HT;    --You may not judge others (hear that, parents?) if you are not
perfect.
 &HT;    --Sex has nothing to do with love.
 &HT;    --Falsely swearing under oath carries no penalty.
 &HT;    --Cheaters usually prosper.
 &HT;    --Apologies serve as punishment.

IT TAKES A VILLAGE TO RAISE AN IDIOT 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As hard as it is to believe, there are a few
things that haven't been said about Bill Clinton. Here are some
questions I haven't heard, and they're questions for both Clinton
apologists and the First Apologist himself:
</P>
<P>
   What if a married, 50ish professor had an affair with a young
woman at his university? How would the parents of the student feel?
What if the professor was president of the university?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is the parent of a young woman attending a university.
He probably would understand the anger that would be directed at a
university president who violated the trust of parents, students,
the university and the community at large by having such a
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   A university president could not escape responsibility by
claiming it was a private affair.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, we have higher expectations of college
presidents than the president of the country. If a college
president had an affair with a student, he'd be fired, with no
chance of keeping his job by taking weekly ``spiritual counseling''
sessions with pastors.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what Clinton is doing now that his affair with
Monica Lewinsky is an open 445-page dirty book. Spiritual
counseling? That's more embarrassing than impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   One of Clinton's pastors is the Rev. Gordon MacDonald, who wrote
a book about recovering from adultery called ``Rebuilding Your
Broken World.'' He says Clinton has read it twice. There's a
self-help book that doesn't help, or else says ``Help yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Other embarrassments: Clinton called Sammy Sosa to congratulate
him on his 62nd home run. Can anybody really talk to Clinton on the
phone again?
</P>
<P>
   You see how much this scandal has cost us.
</P>
<P>
   You know, Americans have peculiar ideas about the power of their
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Americans think a president controls the
economy, and vote for or against him accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Americans excuse a president for failing to
control his urges when a needy young woman flashes her
big-and-beautiful thong underwear.
</P>
<P>
   And we let him have a button that can end the world, hoping it
isn't in a place where someone can accidentally lie down on it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, we keep hearing the same stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting ``Everybody lies about sex'' (which everybody says
without giving personal examples), the three most popular phrases
of the month are: ``Kennedy did it too,'' ``Let's move on'' and
``He's doing a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kennedy did it too.'' There's an excuse. ``I read that another
guy ran a red light, officer, so you can't give me a ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, Clinton has been caught in the act, even if it was
by monomaniacal Kenneth Starr. And he was stupid enough to perform
the act while he was being sued for sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, Roosevelt and Jefferson weren't caught. Reporters may
have gone easy on Kennedy and Roosevelt, but there were Matt Drudge
equivalents in Jefferson's day, and they hounded the Founding
Father with unfounded rumors about whom he had fathered.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was a champ at cheap womanizing, but we didn't know it
at the time. If we had known he was unfaithful to Jackie, he would
have been keelhauled beneath the Honey Fitz.
</P>
<P>
   People forget that Kennedy didn't become a really popular
president until after he died. Clinton will be popular forever _
unless the economy goes down as fast as his zipper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's move on.'' As if.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, we want this mess to go away. It won't. Republicans
are constructing an impeachment process that, if they time it
right, should last until approximately 8 p.m. of Election Day in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment will fail. The Republicans don't have enough on
Clinton except embarrassing his party and the country. Clinton will
never resign. He doesn't have a dime. He doesn't have anywhere to
go, except to the Clinton Library &AMP; Peep Show.
</P>
<P>
   A resolution to censure Clinton could have the same effect it
had on Andrew Jackson _ put his picture on our money.
</P>
<P>
   We're stuck with the incredible shrinking president for the rest
of his term. At least his adventures are fun to watch.
</P>
<P>
   It's like an action movie where the bad guys can't kill the
leading man, no matter how many bullets they shoot at him. Like
those action movies, Clinton's presidency has no content.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing a good job.'' Yes, he's doing a good job of being a
vacuum of principle, creating teeny-tiny policies that do nothing,
distributing more wealth to the rich, taking benefits away from the
poor and destroying any chance Democrats might have against the
real Republicans, as opposed to Clinton's imitation Republicanism.
</P>
<P>
   From the first month of his presidency, when he dumped Zoe Baird
and Kimba Wood as nominees for attorney general because they had
nanny problems, he's done a good job of selling out his allies for
personal advantage. He's done a good job being the president for
the '90s. Tall. Sensitive. Articulate. Intelligent above the waist.
Flawed. Fake.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, that's what the people want. To quote the man
himself, I'm sorry.

TAKE COVER: TV LAUNCHES ITS AUTUMN BOMBS

<P>
   Let's get right to it. This is what you need to know about the
fall network television season:
</P>
<P>
   _ The vast majority of the new shows are either mediocre, bad,
or oh-well-these-shoes-are-ruined bad. That's the way it is every
year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Still, I counted eight shows (out of 35 reviewed) worthy of
getting a good review: ``That 70's Show'' (Fox), ``Trinity'' (NBC)
``Buddy Faro'' (CBS), ``Felicity'' (WB) ``Seven Days'' (UPN) and
``Sports Night,'' ``Fantasy Island'' and ``Cupid'' (ABC).
</P>
<P>
   When you count the two ABC summer series _ ``Whose Line Is It
Anyway?'' and ``Maximum Bob'' _ which may return at a later date,
it was a great off-season for that network.
</P>
<P>
   _ All that said, half the shows I listed above probably won't
catch on. In fact, three out of four of the new shows will end up
as tough trivia questions in two years.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you had a project about Irish, or with characters with
Irish-sounding names, or with characters who just know someone who
knows an Irishman, odds are it got on the air this fall. I counted
a half-dozen, with more coming up as mid-season replacements.
</P>
<P>
   _ Work-centered shows still dominate. But this season will see
more programs focused on families.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you have ever appeared on television before, including in a
crowd shot at a college basketball game, chances are you're
returning to TV this year. We said goodbye to Jerry, Larry, Murphy,
Dr. Quinn, Ellen, even Urkel. Now we get to say hello again to some
old characters, or at least the people who played them. Among the
returning veterans: Linda Lavin (``Barney Miller,'' ``Alice'') is
back. So is Steve Landesberg, whose Detective Arthur Dietrich on
``Barney Miller'' may have been the most interesting cop on
television. Both will be on ``Conrad Bloom.''
</P>
<P>
   Others resurrected include Bo Derek (the movie ``10'') and Lee
Horsley (``Matt Houston''), both of ``Wind on Water'' (here's a
suggestion: watch the show soon, before it gets canned), and Brian
Benben, the former star of ``Dream On'' who has a self-named sitcom
on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the younger crowd there are familiar faces. Shannen
Doherty, late of ``90210,'' is back with Aaron Spelling on the WB
show ``Charmed.'' When we last left Mark David Gosselaar, he was
the blond kid on ``Saved By the Bell.'' Today he is all grown up, a
brunette, on WB's ``Hyperion Bay.'' And Christina Applegate
(``Married ... With Children'') shows surprising range _ and brains
_ as a single mom in ``Jesse.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's not forget Rick (nee Ricky) Shroder, who has traded in his
silver spoons for a silver shield as a detective on ``NYPD Blue.''
Then there is the youngest crowd, and a crowd unto themselves: the
Olsen twins who star in the new show ``Two of a Kind.'' Scary as it
seems, cute little twins Mary-Kate and Ashley are now 11 and on the
verge of teendom.
</P>
<P>
   What else? Roseanne will have a talk show. ``Hollywood Squares''
is back, as is ``Fantasy Island.'' After last year's remake of
``Love Boat,'' anything '70s is fair game. Watch for ``Return of
The San Pedro Beach Bums.''
</P>
<P>
   This season will see four female actors from ``Twin Peaks'' on
various shows, including Sheryl Lee (``L.A. Doctors''), who played
the late Laura Palmer. Even dead people can rise again on
television.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same with bad television. It keeps coming back.

TAKE AT PEAK AT SOME PROMISING MOVIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Sept. 20)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   As usual, fall arrives with a flood of new movie releases. And,
as usual, critics across the land respond by making vague
predictions about which films might actually prove worth seeing.
</P>
<P>
   Who really knows? In the movie industry, today's good buzz is
tomorrow's bomb (remember ``54''? You mean, you don't remember
``54''?). The only forecast worth reading _ or writing _ is one
that claims no inside knowledge whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   This claims none. With no further ado, and in the spirit of
unsullied moviegoing enthusiasm, what follows are a handful of fall
movies that this viewer looks forward to seeing.
</P>
<P>
   YOU'VE GOT MAIL. The notion of remaking James Stewart's ``The
Shop Around the Corner'' might be sacrilege for some, but think
about it _ who better to whip up a frothy Yuletide concoction than
director Nora Ephron and her cutie-pie stars from ``Sleepless in
Seattle''? Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan play bookshop rivals who
unwittingly woo via e-mail. Look for smart repartee and lots of
crinkling eyes. (Dec. 18).
</P>
<P>
   BELOVED. There are so many reasons to get excited about this
one: Jonathan Demme (``Philadelphia,'' ``The Silence of the
Lambs'') directed it; Oprah Winfrey, Thandie Newton and Danny
Glover star; Richard LaGravenese, who turned out elegant
screenplays for ``The Horse Whisperer'' and ``The Bridges of
Madison County,'' co-wrote the script; and it's based on the novel
by Toni Morrison, whose vivid, intensely emotional fiction has
never before been translated to the screen. The story concerns a
slave (Winfrey) haunted by the ghost of a dead child, so expect to
be devastated. (Oct. 16).
</P>
<P>
   THE PRINCE OF EGYPT. A grown-up cartoon from DreamWorks? About
the Israelites' enslavement in Egypt? Starring Val Kilmer as Moses,
and Ralph Fiennes as Ramses and Helen Mirren as the Queen of Egypt?
(Plus Steve Martin, Michelle Pfeiffer, Martin Short and Patrick
Stewart in supporting roles?) With music by Oscar-winning lyricist
Stephen Schwartz (``Pocahantas'')? What, no Happy Meals? No
adorable, wise-cracking sidekicks? Why not? (Dec. 18)
</P>
<P>
   THE THIN RED LINE. Terrence Malick's first movie since 1978's
``Days of Heaven'' _ and only his third, period (the other being
``Badlands'') _ is already getting plugged as That Other World War
II movie, a look at an American battalion at Guadalcanal. It's
based on James Jones' novel, and it boasts a monstrous cast: Sean
Penn, Adrien Brody, Ben Chaplin, Elias Koteas, George Clooney and
scads of others. No, it probably won't be ``Saving Private Ryan'';
Malick is a much less traditional storyteller than Spielberg, and
his films have genuine cult cache. That's why we're interested.
(Dec. 25).
</P>
<P>
   WHAT DREAMS MAY COME. Start weeping now: Robin Williams plays a
loving husband who croaks in a car accident, goes to Heaven, hooks
up with celestial angel Cuba Gooding Jr. and spends the rest of the
movie searching for his wife (Annabella Sciorra), who killed
herself in despair and has plunged straight to hell. From the
trailers, the film looks heavy on computer-generated Elysian
scenery and chest-thumping melodrama _ what makes it fascinating is
its director, Vincent Ward, who gave us the radiantly romantic
``Map of the Human Heart.'' Can't wait. (Oct. 2)

CLINTON BACKERS FEAR A POWERLESS PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Key Democrats and several White House advisers now
believe that if President Clinton survives his crisis with a
censure, he will be rendered virtually ineffective for his final
two years in office, forced by a Republican Congress to abandon his
agenda and left without a moral pulpit from which to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, aides acknowledged, won't trust him. Republicans
won't respect him. And the public, though appreciative of his job
performance, won't hold him in a high enough personal regard to
allow him to represent the will of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton arrives in Boston this evening for several hours of
fund-raising, there is an uneasy but increasing sense of hope among
White House strategists and Democratic lawmakers that he will
overcome attempts to impeach him for his adulterous affair with
Monica S. Lewinsky and his subsequent pattern of lies. Still, that
hope is entangled in the reality of what Clinton's survival might
actually mean, and Democrats publicly and privately portrayed even
the best case scenario in a skeptical light.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts said Clinton's
ability to function as president would be ``seriously diminished.''
Former Labor Secretary and Clinton confidant Robert Reich said
Wednesday that Clinton ``wouldn't be so much a lame duck as a dead
duck.''
</P>
<P>
   And Democratic Leadership Council President Al From, who worked
with Clinton to inject values into the party over the last several
years, declared, ``It doesn't help to have the leader of the
movement not exactly live up to the values of his politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The country is just not going to listen to him on any serious
internal matter,'' said Marc Landy, a professor on the modern
presidency at Boston College. ``People are focusing on the
immediate matter of the release of the tapes and that kind of
thing, but the big issue for the nation is a badly crippled
presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   One key Clinton adviser said the White House is warily looking
ahead to the November congressional elections and bracing for a
backlash if there are significant Democratic losses. At the same
time, Democratic leadership aides on Capitol Hill said that as
recently as early summer, they were anticipating a five- or
six-seat gain, but now fear a loss of 20 seats or more.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the Democrats hold 54 fewer seats in the House and 11
fewer seats in the Senate than when Clinton first took office, and
have lost majority control of both chambers under Clinton's
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``One fear is the toll of the losses,'' said a Clinton ally,
speaking on the condition of anonymity. ``How much water does the
party take on before it says we have to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Though aides said they are too consumed with simply fighting the
potential for impeachment to draw plans for the coming year,
several predicted Clinton will focus increasing swaths of his time
on economic problems and foreign affairs and the worldwide
financial crisis where the two issues meet. They expect he will
travel abroad even more than he has this year, but he may be unable
to gain congressional support on funding for the United Nations and
the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope is he will find a way to carve out a sanctuary for
foreign policy,'' said David Gergen, a former adviser to Clinton at
times of crisis. ``He faces the very real process of a hollowed out
presidency. His chances of survival have gone up, but what price,
survival?''
</P>
<P>
   Other leaders and some scholars, pointing to Clinton's
propensity to do his best work when faced with his gravest crises,
declined to paint his presidency as virtually over. They routinely
point to other low points in his career, citing his loss of the
Arkansas governorship in 1980 followed by his comeback victory two
years later. Clinton badly fumbled his proposal to overhaul health
care in 1994 and saw his Democratic majority in Congress swept away
with his miscues. Shortly after, he seemed to plead for his own
relevance. But two years later, after compromising with Republicans
on welfare reform, he won reelection overwhelmingly in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He is perhaps the most chronicled president in modern history,
his strengths and failings analyzed in reams of books, novels,
documentaries and movies, his most obscure and deeply personal
characteristics bared for a nation to see. It is at times of public
humiliation, some analysts said, that Clinton summons his most
fervent desire to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a guy who's entire career has been a roller coaster,''
said Fred Greenstein, a presidential scholar at Princeton
University. At times of adversity, ``his remarkable talents then
become less a Slick Willie thing and instead focus on real problem
solving.''
</P>
<P>
   To many allies, Friday's release of the report by independent
counsel Kenneth W. Starr marked the beginning of a third
presidential campaign for Clinton _ the first two being about his
election, the current one for his redemption.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like we've gone back into election mode,'' said
Skip Rutherford, a Clinton friend and confidant from Little Rock,
Ark. ``And that's where he does his best work. Clinton has always
done best in a crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Representative Martin Meehan of Lowell said, ``He has
a better grasp of the challenges we face in the global economy and
the steps we need to take to restore growth than any president
we've had in a long, long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, meanwhile, are already sending signals that they
may force Clinton's hand in a compromise, if they are willing to
deal with him at all. Some members of the GOP already said Clinton
could affirm his belief in marriage by signing onto the Republican
plan to reduce taxes for married couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Effectively govern? That remains to be seen,'' said Mike
Collins, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee. ``He
could sign our plan to eliminate the marriage penalty, for
starters.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholars have debated the actual importance of the so-called
moral pedestal or bully pulpit, with some believing it represents
the vast bulk of a president's power, especially when he faces a
Congress controlled by the opposing party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moral authority is a huge part of the presidency and has been
since the beginning, and he doesn't have any,'' said Landy, in an
opinion echoed by such noted presidential historians as Michael
Beschloss.
</P>
<P>
   But others argued that the bully pulpit is an overrated aspect
of the presidency _ ``mythology,'' declared Greenstein _ and that
moral leadership is no longer expected from a chief executive. Some
scholars point to Jimmy Carter, who always received high personal
favorability ratings from the country, but his job performance
ratings _ below 30 percent when he was defeated by Ronald Reagan in
1980 _ doomed his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very hard to count the number of times that moral
leadership is crucial to the presidency,'' said Stephen Hess, a
presidential scholar at the Brookings Institution. ``We are really
going overboard on the moral leadership we get or should expect
from the president.''
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton's case, he has spent years preaching the importance
of personal responsibility, and such a doctrine may no longer be
valid coming from his lips, analysts said. He has also become
increasingly comfortable in the last three years exercising his
moral authority from a bully pulpit, so much so that one of his
favorite speaking venues is the inside of a church.
</P>
<P>
   ``It now becomes harder to go to the public and ask for
sacrifice,'' said Gergen.
</P>
<P>
   Gone, aides conceded, will be Clinton's attempts at education
reform, including a multibillion-dollar request to rebuild
crumbling schools. Social Security reform will probably be lost, as
will efforts to mandate tighter regulations on health maintenance
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republicans do launch impeachment proceedings, Clinton's
entire ability to garner favorable news coverage on his policies
will be crippled for the next few months. If he recovers, he will
have less than a year before the nation begins focusing on the
primary campaigns for the 2000 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is going to have a hard time shifting public attention away
from these proceedings,'' Reich said. ``He has also lost a great
deal of respect and moral authority. His extraordinarily reckless
behavior is still not fully explained.''

   SAN FRANCISCO _ A massive concrete slab plunged 32 stories from
a hotel construction site onto an adjacent firehouse, ripping
through the sleeping quarters and landing in the ground-floor
engine bay, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   But rescue personnel who responded to the firehouse Wednesday
night enjoyed a laugh of relief. The 15 firefighters who would
ordinarily have been getting ready for bed at Station No. 1 had
moved out three days earlier, in advance of structural work.
</P>
<P>
   The firefighters shook their heads as they surveyed the wreckage
caused by the 19,000-pound slab of concrete, measuring
8-feet-by-10-feet. It tore through the building about 9:30 p.m.
Wednesday. No one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had crews been in the station, we would have had a very
different situation,'' Lt. Ed Campbell said. ``It would have been
really tragic.''
</P>
<P>
   The concrete slab had been destined for the side of the 32-story
Starwood Hotel, which is being built at the corner of Howard and
Third streets, next to the firehouse.
</P>
<P>
   A construction worker, who declined to give his name, said he
and his co-workers had been unloading several of the big panels
from a truck and using a crane to raise them to the top of the
roof. Working at night is standard practice, he said, because there
is less traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, two computer technicians were loading up
their van after an evening wiring computer networks in a bank
branch when they saw the panel fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watched them take it off the street and saw them swing it
along the side of the building,'' said Robert Lynch, one of the
technicians. ``Then the cable snapped, and it came crashing right
down through the firehouse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were strands of cable raining down _ like this,'' said
Lynch, holding up an eight-inch length of frayed and twisted wires.
``We jumped out of the way and ran for cover.''
</P>
<P>
   Station No. 1 is ordinarily one of the busiest in the city,
Campbell said. Because of the construction planned for the
firehouse, the firefighters had been reassigned to other stations.

BARBARA BOXER FACES CLINTON LIABILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This US Senate race would have been tight even if
the incumbent wasn't related to Bill Clinton by marriage, even if
she hadn't led the charge against powerful Republicans accused of
sexual misconduct then sidestepped discussion of the president's
behavior for more than seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Now Senator Barbara Boxer finds herself neck-and-neck with her
little-known challenger, Republican state Treasurer Matt Fong.
Although many California voters insist they don't care about her
Clinton connection, either through party affiliation or family,
political observers say the association has to hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere she goes, Boxer is asked about Clinton, whose
brother-in-law is married to her daughter. She attacks Fong's
opposition to raising the minimum wage, and the buzz is about her
position on impeachment proceedings. Discussion of Clinton's
behavior dominated the first quarter of a recent candidates'
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Getting her message out may only get more difficult in the days
ahead. Desperate for fund-raising dollars, Boxer intends to invite
the Clintons to campaign with her this fall. Presidential problems
aside, she says he is still good for California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton isn't governing how voters view Boxer, but the first
question she gets is always, `What do you think of the Clinton
controversy?' and `Why haven't you been a big critic of his?'''
said Mark DiCamillo, director of the San Francisco-based Field
Poll, which recently showed Boxer and Fong tied at 45 percent
percent of the vote with 10 percent of the electorate undecided.
``But she already had an extremely partisan image... I think she
has a real problem this time around.''
</P>
<P>
   Swept into office by a slim margin during 1992's ``Year of the
Woman,'' the liberal, Bay Area Democrat has long been considered
vulnerable in socially moderate, fiscally more conservative
California. Now, as she told political reporters in Washington last
week, she is in ``the race of my life'' with Fong, who captured
enough of the conservative base to win the June primary but is
generally considered more of a Jack Kemp-style moderate Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt Fong is as close as he is because Barbara Boxer is a very
polarizing figure in California,'' said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a
political scientist at Claremont Graduate University. ``She is not
very popular, and I don't know how she moves those undecided
voters, especially with the static of Bill Clinton and his
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Compounding Boxer's own problems, Democratic voter turnout is
expected to be low, dampened by disgust over Clinton's initial
denial that he had an adulterous affair with a White House intern.
Last month, Clinton admitted to the nation that he did have a
relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky. Last week, Boxer took to the
Senate floor to denouce his behavior as ``immoral,'' a late slap
that political analysts say could cost her crucial crossover votes
from Republican women. Fong, a fourth-generation Chinese-American,
could also siphon off the Asian vote which, while small, could
matter in such a tight race, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt Fong is incredibly lucky, but since Barbara was
incredibly lucky last time, who is she to complain?'' said Susan
Estrich, a University of Southern California law professor. ``She
wouldn't have denounced Clinton unless she felt she had to, and I
don't blame her for it. But I don't think it will help her,
particularly since she is going to continue using him for
fund-raising.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer's campaign manager, Rose Kapolczynski, said the
candidate's strong views would have caused a close Senate contest
regardless of the opposition. As she noted, at least one recent
poll put Boxer ahead of Fong, and the movement in others has not
been dramatic despite Clinton's troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence this is hurting us,'' Kapolczynski said.
``I traveled the state with her in August and the people she was
meeting are not obsessed with the president's problems. They're
more concerned about education, women's right to choose, the
environment... The biggest impact is we can't really get our
message out.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong, who will be in Boston for two fund-raisers today, stressed
that he is running against Boxer, not Clinton. Not surprisingly,
however, he is as happy to play up the Clinton-Boxer connection on
the campaign trail as he is to push a federal tax reform package
that would eliminate capital gains, inheritance taxes, and ``the
IRS as we know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong calls Boxer a hypocrite for aggressively criticizing
Republicans accused of sexual harassment but keeping relatively
quiet about Clinton for as long as possible. An outspoken feminist
first elected to represent Marin County in Congress in 1982, Boxer
went after both Clarence Thomas during his US Supreme Court
confirmation hearings and Oregon Senator Bob Packwood, who was
forced to resign after several female employees accused him of
sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as being an issue in the campaign, it's about her
putting politics over principle by her duplicity in treating
Democrats and Republicans differently...,'' said Fong, a US Air
Force Academy graduate often teased for his wooden speaking manner
and discomfort at the podium. ``In California, as much as the
president dominates the news, I'm not running against the
president. The bottom line is Barbara Boxer can't step away from
Barbara Boxer.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, California voters don't typically pay attention to
elections until the candidates hit the airwaves with millions of
dollars in TV advertising, as both Boxer and Fong are expected to
do this fall. For now, the race could go either way. &UR;  &LR; ``People
don't look at either candidate and see a heavyweight.''

INSULATION OLD HAT? NOT WHEN IT SAVES HEATING COSTS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ho hum. Insulation again? It may be old hat to owners of new
houses that are insulated and tightened up wonderfully. It may be
old hat to those who have slaved and worked and spent good money to
have their old houses insulated.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not old hat to thousands of homeowners who know
nothing about insulation or whose houses are not insulated or only
partially insulated.
</P>
<P>
   So, herewith the annual sermon on insulation. One often reads
many stories about where you should put insulation, but too often
these stories mention nothing on how to put that insulation in
place.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
What, where, how much, and how
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So, today's sermon will not only suggest what and where to put
it in, but also how much, and how to put it in.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that insulation is the chief way to save
heating fuel. You can put in a magnificant heating system, but if
there is no insulation or inadequate insulation, that fancy system
is simply pumping heat into the house, and right out again.
</P>
<P>
   OK, where to put insulation? What kind? And how much?
</P>
<P>
   In 25 words or less: in the attic floor, in walls and in the
basement ceiling. And, in the roof over an open space, such as a
room with a cathedral ceiling. (Sorry, it took 27 words.)
</P>
<P>
   What kind? Fiberglass is still the state-of-the art material,
because it is not only a good insulator but also is flexible, able
to be put into virtually any space snuggly but not too snuggly, and
certainly not too loosely. And it is the best and easiest material
for the do-it-yourselfer to work with.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Protective clothing
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One word of caution: When dealing with any kind of insulation,
wear a mask and protective clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Cellulose is also a good choice, but mostly for blowing in the
walls or blowing into the attic floor.
</P>
<P>
   There are rigid insulations such as Styrofoam or (get this
word): polyisocyanurate, a modified urethane foam with brand names
such as Thermax and High R Sheathing. These are generally used in
new construction, and not commonly in old houses. They could be put
on the inside or outside walls of such old houses, but that would
require rebuilding walls indoors or applying new siding walls
outdoors, an elaborate, expensive undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Both types are ``best buys''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So, fiberglass and cellulose are the most common materials to
use, in new or old construction. Both are ``best buys,'' the least
expensive building materials that do the most good. Insulation
costs 25 cents and up per square foot, depending on its thickness.
That is inexpensive, if you do it yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor that complicates the insulation process is a
house that is partially insulated. We will get to that, too.
</P>
<P>
   How much insulation? Often it's what fits in the cavity. But in
places like attic floors, the sky's the limit; you can put in as
much as 18 inches of fiberglass. That gives an R factor of 57,
virtually maximum. There is little point in adding more because you
will get diminishing returns; anything additional will do less
good.
</P>
<P>
   We are not going to get into R factors, because they don't mean
a lot; more important is the thickness of the insulation, which is
restricted in all places except attic floors. An R factor, for the
record, is a measurement of resistance (that is where the R comes
in) to passage of heat from a heated area through a barrier to a
cold area. The more that barrier is insulated, the less heat will
be lost.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Attic floor: A good place to start
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shall we begin? On the attic floor. Buy fiberglass batts or
rolls 6 inches thick and as wide as the space between joists; You
can get insulation 15 and 23 inches wide, enough to fit snugly
between joists 14 1/2 and 22 1/2 inches apart, respectively. Make
the fit snug, but not so snug that it undulates, or so loose that
it leaves gaps.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no insulation on the floor, buy insulation backed by
kraft paper, or foil, which is a vapor barrier. This backing goes
down touching the ceiling below. In fact, all vapor barriers go on
the side of the space facing the heated space.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Add a little, too
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You can add another 6 inches of unbacked insulation, or
8-inch-thick Poly-wrap, Owen Corning's insulation wrapped in
perforated polyethylene. Other companies make similar products. The
poly makes it easy to move, especially over existing insulation,
and easier and safer to handle. If the insulation comes up to the
tops of the joists, add a second layer at right angles to the
joists. You can add a third layer of 6- or 8-inch insulation, but
that is enough.
</P>
<P>
   I know of one man who said the insulation in his attic floor
comes up to his belly button. That is too much.
</P>

_IN SURVEY, GUN OWNERS BACK TOUGHER LAWS   
 _FOR SOME, MENOPAUSE IS CHANGE FOR BETTER   
 _SUPERMARKET REMEDY TOPS FOR TOOTH PAIN  
</HEADLINE>

 In survey, gun owners back tougher laws
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The New England Journal of Medicine is focusing on an issue not
always considered foremost as a question of public health _ gun
control _ with a survey showing strong support, even among gun
owners, for restricting gun sales and toughening gun safety
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Every hour, guns are used to kill four Americans. Studies
sponsored by the American Medical Association and American College
of Physicians estimate medical treatment cost $145,000 per 1997
gunshot survivor. The Physicians for Social Reponsibility asserts
gun violence costs the United States $20 billion a year, including
medical costs and lost productivity.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Gun Policy and Research at the Johns Hopkins
School of Public Health in Baltimore conducted two telephone
surveys of 1,200 adults over the last three years, and found:
</P>
<P>
   _88 percent of respondents favor laws to make new guns
childproof, including 80 percent of gun owners.
</P>
<P>
   _71 percent favor ``personalization'' devices allowing only
rightful owners to use guns, including 59 percent of gun owners.
</P>
<P>
   _Between 83 and 95 percent of respondents _ and more than seven
of 10 gun owners _ favor banning gun sales to people convicted of
domestic violence, assault, menacing someone with a gun, or drunk
and disorderly conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``To make progress in preventing deaths and injuries from
firearms, it is necessary to break the existing stalemate in the
debate on gun policy'' over the constitutional right to own guns,
the survey team led by Hopkins's Stephen P. Teret writes in the
current journal. They urged ``serious consideration'' of measures
to ``make it more difficult for guns to be passed from legal to
illegal users.''
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying editorial, David Hemenway of the Harvard
School of Public Health said that the same strategies that have
been used to ensure safer use of automobiles, chainsaws, and lawn
mowers should be brought to bear on ``the gun, which, per minute of
use, is probably the most dangerous of all such products.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; For some, menopause is change for better
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From the tone of most medical news coverage, it may sound as
though menopause is an unending horror show of plunging estrogen
levels, hot flashes, moodiness, osteoporosis, and heart disease.
But a survey suggests many women find it is not so bad.
</P>
<P>
   A new Gallup survey of 752 US women aged 50 to 65 who had
reached that time of life found that 51 percent said they had never
felt as ``fulfilled and happy'' as they do now. When the other 49
percent were asked to name the most satisfying time of their lives,
10 percent said their 20s, 17 percent their 30s and 16 percent
their 40s.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was released Wednesday at the beginning of the North
American Menopause Society annual meeting in Toronto. The group's
executive director, Dr. Wulf H. Utian, told the Associated Press
that despite the frequent news about ``the negative impacts of
growing older ... when we ask women, we continually hear that they
view menopause as the beginning of many positive changes in their
lives and health.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Supermarket remedy tops for tooth pain
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two studies on tooth and jaw pain: Ibuprofen and other common
pain relievers may work better than prescription narcotics in
easing the pain of tooth extraction, contends a Minnesota oral
surgeon who led a $1 million federally funded study of wisdom tooth
removal operations.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Q. Swift of the University of Minnesota School of
Dentistry said at an oral surgeons' conference in New Orleans
Wednesday that patients who were not told what they were getting
enjoyed twice as much pain relief from ibuprofen as from
prescription painkillers such as codeine. But in practice, Swift
said, the ``placebo effect'' makes people think something the
doctor prescribes works better than a supermarket remedy.
</P>
<P>
   Other research being presented at the American Association of
Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons meeting indicates that chlamydia,
the sexually transmitted disease that can make women infertile,
also aggravates temporomandibular joint, or TMJ, jaw pain. Dr. Alan
Hudson of the Wayne State University School of Medicine, one of the
researchers, found that chlamydia bacteria were 100 to 200 times
more likely to be found in women TMJ patients than the general
population, so more TMJ patients should be screened for chlamydia
and the link between it and TMJ studied further.

SUFFOLK TRIES OUT NEW TRACK SURFACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Suffolk Downs opens its fall meeting Sept. 26, it will
become the first track to test the Polytrac surface. Polytrac is
composed of sand treated with an oil-based polymer, and the East
Boston track has installed a 100- by 80-foot section covering the
6-furlong chute. The chute is the straightaway past the backstretch
where sprinters start before reaching the main track.
</P>
<P>
   Polytrac was developed by Chuck Beardon, president of North
Carolina-based Polytrac Systems Inc. Polytrac, which will never
turn sloppy, is a successor to Equitrack, which was tried several
years ago at Remington Park. Equitrack also prevented sloppy tracks
but turned to molasses under the broiling Oklahoma sun and was
abandoned. Beardon was called in as a consultant during the
Remington trial and has found a way to keep Polytrac from melting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to see how the horses do with it,'' said Suffolk
vice president Lou Raffetto, who has been working with Beardon on
the project and believes his track will one day be entirely covered
with Polytrac. ``It will help sore horses because it has bounce to
it. In that way, it will be therapeutic. There is no bounce in
plain sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, the horses should get a better break at the start
because the material is firm; it won't break away under their
hooves. That's why we started with the chute.
</P>
<P>
   ``There won't be any slop with Polytrac because the surface
becomes like that of a Teflon pan _ water just beads on it and runs
right off. What broke down Equitrack was the ultraviolet rays of
the sun. Chuck went back to the lab and found a way to keep that
from happening. Plus, Equitrack broke down in extreme heat,
temperatures of 100-110 degrees in Oklahoma. We don't have that
kind of heat around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Suffolk purchased 12,600 square feet of Polytrac on an
experimental basis. It was put down over Labor Day weekend. Patrons
will be able to spot it with ease because it is considerably darker
than the regular sand portion of the track. Raffetto estimates the
cost of covering the entire surface would by upward of $400,000,
but he feels the advantages of having a near ``all-weather'' track
might be worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of it,'' he said. ``If this material works, there will
be no scratches because of a sloppy track. Sore horses can race
more often because the track is so kind. There would be fewer days
with a bias, less inside-outside stuff, because the surface would
be so consistent. The only days we would lose a card to weather
would be when it snows.''

WOMEN VOICE WIDE RANGE OF OPINION ON LEWINSKY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN O'BRIEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When little was known about Monica S. Lewinsky, it was easy to
cast the White House intern as the wide-eyed ingenue with a crush,
wearing a Donna Karan black beret to catch the eye of the president
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Now Lewinsky is just as well known for her thong underwear and
her aggressive sexual attitude, revealed in the testimony she
provided about a seduction she wanted desperately to continue, and
complete.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Lewinsky's place in history will be decided mainly
by women. They will be the ones to say whether she should find a
seat among the women who have been used by men in positions of
power _ men who have indulged in women's crushes and immature
fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   Or they'll decide whether Lewinsky, like Clinton, should
apologize to the country for her behavior. And whether she should
take responsibility for making a mockery of her opportunity to
work, and network, in the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   The White House scandal has launched yet another set of bad
office jokes, and disgusting Internet games, centered on sex and
women in the workplace, and many who have fought for equal
oppurtunities in offices _ and equal partnerships in sexual
relationships and marriages _ say Lewinsky has provided a sorry
image of young professional women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a curious kind of dilemma you are in if you are a
feminist,'' said Anne Bernays, a Boston &UR;  &LR; novelist.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a feminist, the word `slut' doesn't figure because
women should have the same sexual freedom as a man does, and if she
wants him, she should be able to do whatever she can.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bernays believes Lewinsky's attempts to manipulate Clinton
into providing her a better job flies in the face of feminist
principles that frown on women who buy into a system that
encourages them to sleep their way to the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you add the fact of the employer and the employee, then
it complicates things. And she felt that he owed her something _ a
job? Where does that come from? She is as far from being a feminist
as almost anybody can be. It's very complicated for us.''
</P>
<P>
   But for some women, the issue is clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had a lot of women tell me `Well, she is a kid,'' said
Dotty Volpe, 49, a former Democratic Party worker who owns ``The
Redecorators,'' a Boston &UR;  &LR; home-improvement business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I was married at 21, and I knew right from wrong,'' said
Volpe, who is married to her second husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not to say that I have always made right choices, but
no one can tell me that Monica Lewinsky didn't know what she was
getting into. I really think she owes everybody and apology _ the
whole country.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston attorney Susan Howards, 44, who specializes in
sexual-harassment cases, said she has tried, but cannot find much
sympathy for Lewinsky, and considers her more of a vixen than a
victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a chance that many young women of her generation would
have relished, and she didn't use it properly,'' Howards said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am appalled,'' she added. ``If that were my daughter, I
would be on television, apologizing to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   But others are slower to blame the girl whose inexperience came
shining through the pages of the report prepared by Independent
Counsel Kenneth W. Starr, with Lewinsky's references to the movie
``Titanic,'' so popular with lovestruck teens across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Many women shared a collective groan, some recognizing
themselves, when they read that Lewinsky fantasized about Clinton's
life changing so that they might be together.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's emotional, young, naive and starstruck,'' said Amy
Mcdonald, a 40-year-old mother of one who has delved into
Lewinsky's psyche with female friends in recent days. ``Yes, she's
aggressive and manipulative. But I don't blame her. I don't blame
her at all. He was responsible for saying `No.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Lauren Walker, a Philip Johnson Associates Inc.
marketing writer, went as far as to congratulate Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she has showed a lot of integrity for someone her
age,'' said Walker, 40. ``I think it's interesting that, in her
testimony, she has never portrayed herself as a victim. You know,
for a kid, that is not bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most women are fairly harsh about it. I think they
sort of sound like she is some kind of bad person, or an idiot,''
said Walker. ``Instead, I see her as human.''
</P>
<P>
   With age, there is apparently more empathy for Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Blackham is Republican committeewoman for the 2nd Middlesex
District, and, in the early 70s, headed the Governor's Commission
on the Status of Women. She disagrees with those who say Lewinsky
should shoulder half the blame for the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say that I have a lot of pity and compassion for her,''
said Blackham, who heads Ann Blackham Inc. Realtors in Winchester.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she is a wild-eyed and impressionable woman,'' said
Blackham.
</P>
<P>
   She said many healthy young women could fall prey to Clinton, or
other men with extroardinarly clout.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was about that age, I was just getting involved in
politics,'' said Blackham, who is 71. ``You are kind of mystified
by the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, if he's attractive, and seems to be coming on
to you, at that age, you feel so complimented.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoki Bacon, a Boston socialite and self-described
Depression-era Democrat, said she and her grown daughters have
lamented Lewinsky's actions, and her having confused the issue of
``real'' victims of sexual harrassment and abuse in schools and
workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, she said, is not a victim in the traditional sense,
but a product of a system that encourages young women to identify
themselves with a man in power.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as men hold all the power, there will be this
temptation,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that is the great tragedy here, that there was an
attempt at power through intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a setback.''

 &HT;    HOUSE POSTPONES VOTE ON VISAS FOR HIGHLY SKILLED IMMIGRANTS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By CHRISTI HARLAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republican leaders Thursday postponed a
planned vote on increasing the number of H-1B visas for highly
skilled foreign workers, citing a shortfall in Democratic support
for the measure.
</P>
<P>
   At least 30 Democratic votes are needed, because Republicans
don't have the full support of their members for a measure that
would immediately allow 30,000 more foreign workers into the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation has been awaiting a full House vote since May
20, when the House Judiciary Committee approved a bill that would
raise the number of visas from the current annual cap of 65,000.
The committee's version also required employers to attest that they
had tried to hire U.S. workers and that no U.S. workers had been
laid off from jobs being filled by foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders, bowing to pressure from the computer industry and
other business groups that want the additional visas, are pushing
for passage of a bill that will provide more H-1B visas without
demanding more from employers. The next attempt at a vote may come
Wednesday, when the House reconvenes after Rosh Hashanah, the
Jewish New Year.

FILENE'S BASEMENT PLANNING WEEKEND-ONLY CHAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Filene's Basement Corp., its sales sputtering and its stock
marked down to just over 2, will soon roll out a new chain of
discount stores that will open only on the weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Steven R. Siegel, Filene's Basement chief financial officer,
said in an interview that the company planned to open eight of the
new stores next year, starting in the spring. He wouldn't discuss
locations except to say all will be east of the Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Others are playing at the weekend-warrior retailing game.
Dallas-based Tuesday Morning Corp. has nearly 300 deep-discount
closeout stores that carry everything from housewares to toys to
seasonal items and open just four times a year for six- to 10-week
``events'' during peak selling seasons. Atlanta-based K&AMP;G Men's
Centers Inc. has 29 apparel superstores, operating only on the
weekends. And the Westwood, Mass.-based Frugal Fannie's chain
operates seven women's stores that open only on the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The point is to be open when people shop and keep payroll costs
low. Wellesley, Mass.-based Filene's Basement, like the others,
will put its stores in low-cost strip malls and even industrial
space. Those in the commercial real estate business say such
part-time retailers often end up with leftover locations because
other tenants in a strip mall, for instance, don't like having the
stores closed most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that it is executed well, it is a very, very
good concept,'' says Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail
Trend Report in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel said the stores would be far larger than the traditional
Filene's Basement outlets and far cheaper to open. The stores,
including warehouse space, would be up to 80,000 square feet, with
about 50,000 square feet devoted to selling. By contrast, the
newest Filene's Basement, set to open Oct. 1 in Ft. Lauderdale,
Fla., is just 28,000 square feet. Siegel estimated the cost of
opening one of the new stores at a third or less than a traditional
Basement store.
</P>
<P>
   The new chain will carry women's and men's apparel and
housewares and emphasize brand names, Siegel said. The stores will
be open Friday through Sunday. He would not discuss the name.
</P>
<P>
   Filene's Basement could use a boost.
</P>
<P>
   The stock has been crushed even more than other retailers in the
big market sell-off, falling 65 percent since May to 2 1/4. George
Sutton, a retail analyst for Dain Rauscher Wessels, said Filene's
Basement ``has consistently missed the plan'' for both sales and
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   August was a particularly bad month, when sales at stores open
more than a year, a key retail measure, fell 6 percent compared
with the year earlier. Those same-store sales had been up for the
previous six months. ``We had a terrible August for a variety of
reasons,'' Siegel said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first six months of the year, the company earned
$255,000, or 1 cent a share diluted, down from earnings of $1.75
million, or 8 cents a share diluted, in the same period in 1997.
The company's results have been hurt, in part, because of a
February fire at its Auburn, Mass. distribution center; the company
has said it expects to recover those losses through its insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Even as it plans to launch a new chain, Filene's Basement has
pushed ahead with its traditional stores. It has opened five stores
this year and will open the sixth in Florida next month, its first
move into the Southeast. That will push the total to 51.
</P>
<P>

 &QL; 
The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Talk about September slumps. The Red Sox look like absolute
champs compared with the market for initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Through Wednesday, the IPO market was 0 for 16 for the month of
September; not one of the initial offerings in the pipeline has
been completed this month.
</P>
<P>
   With the stock market in flux, the last IPO came Aug. 27; the
last Massachusetts IPO was July 31, says Richard J. Peterson of
Securities Data Corp. IPOs were booming in June, when there were 63
deals worth $9.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The average loss since the offering date for Massachusetts's 11
IPOs this year is 6.2 percent, compared with a loss of 15.3 percent
for all such deals, says Securities Data.
</P>
<P>
   Look for some deals still to happen this month. No deals, no
fees for investment bankers.

WITH PRIMAKOV, IT'S BACK TO THE COLD WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Often mistaken, never shy, that well-known pundit Conventional
Wisdom has weighed in on the appointment of Yevgeny Primakov as
Russia's new prime minister. On the whole, C.W. likes what he sees.
</P>
<P>
   The new premier was described, in the words of one anonymous
White House official last week, as ``a familiar face who inspires
confidence.'' The New York Times characterized him in an editorial
as a man of ``urbanity, longevity, and familiarity with
international issues'' who ``can be charming, wryly amusing and
cold-bloodedly pragmatic.'' On its news pages, The Wall Street
Journal hailed Primakov's ``flare for compromise that belies his
appearance as a stolid Soviet-era apparatchik,'' while Therese
Raphael of the paper's European edition paints him on the opinion
pages as a protean negotiator whose ascent reduces the chances of
social unrest in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   C.W. agrees with Time's characterization of Primakov as a
``respected player in international affairs.'' Sure, he has on
occasion been at cross purposes with US policy. But he is a solid,
sensible guy, C.W. believes, and there is every reason to expect,
as President Clinton's spokesman Michael McCurry put it, ``a good
and close working relationship with Prime Minister Primakov.''
</P>
<P>
   If Conventional Wisdom is right, the only thing that should
concern Americans is how best to help Primakov save Russia's
crashing economy. But what if C.W. is wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Here is a different view: Primakov's elevation to power
represents not a gain for market reforms, democracy, and
cooperation with the West, but a setback _ a return to heavy-handed
statism, a crackdown on political liberty, and a bitter revival of
anti-American hostility. Soothing noises from the State Department
notwithstanding, the new Russian premier is not someone we can do
business with, as Margaret Thatcher said of Mikhail Gorbachev; he
is someone who has singlemindedly striven to thwart US interests at
every stage of his career.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the KGB in his 20s, was trained in Arabic and English,
and became head of Radio Moscow's Arabic broadcasting service. As a
``journalist'' (read: spy), he monitored the Middle East for the
Soviet Communist Party; over time he became the KGB handler for
some of the region's most vicious dictators: Saddam Hussein in
Iraq, Moammar Khadafy in Libya, and Hafez al-Assad in Syria. When
the Soviet Union marched on Afghanistan in 1979, it was Primakov
who wrote Moscow's ideological defense of the invasion. And it was
Primakov who, as chief of the foreign-intelligence branch of the
KGB, supervised Russian spies in the United States. Among his prize
agents was Aldrich Ames, the worst traitor in CIA history.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov has repeatedly endeavored to undermine US foreign
policy. In the weeks leading up to Operation Desert Storm, he
pressed for a deal that would have allowed Iraq to keep Kuwait.
When Serbia's genocidal ``ethnic cleansing'' began in the Balkans,
Primakov defended Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian strongman. As
head of the Russian intelligence service and later as Russian
foreign minister, he was behind mass murder in Chechnya, coup
attempts in Georgia and Azerbaijan, and economic warfare against
Ukraine and the Baltic states.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Russian with whom the White House expects a ``good
and close working relationship?''
</P>
<P>
   Primakov proceeds from the assumption that Russian greatness is
measured by the ability to foil the United States. ``The goal of
Primakov's policy,'' Ariel Cohen of the Heritage Foundation wrote
last winter, ``is ... to weaken US influence in the Middle East and
in Eurasia, and to establish Russia in the Middle East as a power
equal to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, he has presided over the sale of ballistic missile
systems and nuclear weapons technology to China and Iran. He has
agreed to supply Cyprus with S-300 antiaircraft missiles, a sale
that would almost assuredly trigger a dangerous crisis between two
NATO allies, Turkey and Greece. He has shielded Saddam Hussein from
United Nations discipline with such success that the Clinton
administration no longer threatens to use force to stop Iraq from
developing weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov is also maneuvering to get UN sanctions on Iraq lifted;
it is only a matter of time before Washington backs down on that
issue as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this talk about Russia staying on the path of reform and
seeking good relations with the West _ it's all Potemkin stuff,''
says Frank Gaffney, who was Ronald Reagan's assistant secretary of
defense. ``The White House needs to put the American public on
notice that it's over in Russia. We are now dealing with people who
are real menaces to our interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Primakov's installation as prime minister marks the end of the
end of the Cold War. He is almost certain to lead the country into
further economic disaster. His first appointees have been old
Soviet apparatchiks; already there are calls for such deadly
``reforms'' as printing more rubles to pay the government's bills
and requiring exporters to surrender all hard-currency earnings to
the government. As the Russian economy tumbles into chaos, Primakov
will move to appease the public by playing the anti-America card
even more aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Security Policy, an unsentimental foreign policy
think tank, warns that Primakov is ``one of the most insidiously
dangerous men on earth.''
</P>

 By RABBI ELI HECHT  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Sunday night, Jews will gather in homes and houses of prayer to
usher in the Jewish New Year, called Rosh Hashanah; literally the
beginning of the year.
 &HT;    The holiday is marked by prayer, the blowing of a ram's horn,
called a shofar, and the dipping of an apple in honey, symbolic of
wishes for a sweet year. A festive meal includes kosher chicken and
wine, making it a special day.
 &HT;    It is considered by Jews as a day for repentance, an auspicious
time to make new resolutions.
 &HT;    This Jewish New Year I hope and pray that many of my Jewish
brothers and sisters will find time to attend a Rosh Hashanah
service, giving thanks to Almighty God and to this great country
where we can pray freely in our houses of worship.
 &HT;    Living in a free country where we can practice religion of our
choice is one of our greatest assets.
 &HT;    However, I am reminded of the times when this could not be done,
when Jews would have to hide their religion in order to practice.
 &HT;    Let me share a sad story I heard while growing up with
post-World War II refugees in Brooklyn. My teacher, a survivor,
would tell us this most horrifying story.
 &HT;    In a small shtetl called Eisysky, over 4,000 Jews were gathered
around their synagogue. There they were met by their Lithuanian
neighbors, who had joined the German tyrants in carrying out the
Final Solution eradication of the Jewish presence in that area. The
day was the Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashanah, September 1941.
 &HT;    Drunken Lithuanian guards packed the synagogue with as many Jews
as possible. Families stood in fear as the guards formed them into
groups. You could see a mother, father, son, daughter, grandson,
granddaughter, and even some great-grandchildren all huddled
together.
 &HT;    The groups were then taken to open ditches near the Jewish
cemetery, stripped of their clothing and killed. The Lithuanian
guards took their time in shooting indiscriminately, killing
generations of people, ending the 800 years of Jewish existence for
the town of Eisysky.
 &HT;    Local neighbors, some of whom had been friends of the
unfortunate Jews, were caught up in the wholesale slaughter. Some
cheered while others robbed the homes of the unfortunate victims.
 &HT;    Yet there were the few who cried inwardly, not knowing what do.
 &HT;    The volleys of the rifle shots felled family after family.
Bodies of the dying and the dead would be rolled into the pit and a
fresh group would be brought, stripped naked, and shot.
 &HT;    The diabolical commander of the guards, a man named Ostrovaks,
wore an immaculate uniform covered with a starched white apron and
matching gloves. All day, he would personally give the order to
shoot.
 &HT;    When he saw the respected Rabbi Shimon Rovowsky come dressed in
his Shabbos clothing, together with the town cantor who was wrapped
in a Jewish prayer shawl, holding the Torah scrolls, Ostrovaks
announced that he must do the killing himself.
 &HT;    He took great pleasure in shooting the rabbi, the cantor and
then the children. He loved shooting them as they were thrown over
into the ditches. It was a strange and horrible time in the killing
fields of Eisysky.
 &HT;    On this sad day a young boy, Zevy, stood naked with his father
at an open pit. Any second now the bullet would arrive, ending his
life.
 &HT;    By the mercy of God the 16-year-old Zevy fell into the pit
alive. He fell upon a group of bodies. The bullets rang out and a
new wave of bodies piled on top of him.
 &HT;    Lying there, he heard cries of anguish and pain into the night.
Zevy was completely covered with blood and dead and dying people.
 &HT;    In the middle of the night he cautiously climbed out of the pit.
The silence of the dead was deafening.
 &HT;    As far as he could see were the bodies of his fellow Jews. What
had been a vibrant Jewish community was now gone forever.
 &HT;    Naked and bloody, he began his walk out of the cemetery, toward
the homes of his friends.
 &HT;    Arriving at the home of Pavel, a peasant, he was surprised to
see piles of booty taken from the Jews. Looking through the window
he saw the Lithuanians eating and drinking.
 &HT;    What could he do? he thought. He banged on the door and yelled
``Let me in, Pavel.'' The door opened and Pavel stood there with
his family.
 &HT;    At first they were quite frightened, but then they quickly
slammed the door shut. The window opened and Pavel yelled out,
``Jew, go back to your grave, there is no hope.''
 &HT;    Each home refused him entry. Zevy knew that soon he would die
from the cold and hunger.
 &HT;    Being at his wit's end he came up with a plan. At the end of the
dark forest lived a very old religious widow. She would pray early
in the morning and then would light the candles in the church on a
daily basis.
 &HT;    He came to her home, arriving at the doorstep looking more dead
than alive. He tapped on the door gently. It cracked open and the
old Christian lady looked out.
 &HT;    Zevy said, ``I am your Lord Jesus Christ. I have come down from
the cross. I am in deep pain. See my blood for the sacrifices of
the innocent. I must enter your home. I am on a special mission.''
 &HT;    The frightened widow uttered ``Yes, my Lord.'' Looking at Zevy's
blood-stained feet she quickly covered her eyes, crossed herself
and ran to bring a basin of warm water.
 &HT;    The widow fed him and provided him with shelter and clothing.
 &HT;    Portraying himself as Jesus, Zevy blessed the livestock and the
household. ``Remember,'' he said, ``you must never tell anyone of
my secret mission on earth. The Lord's missions are special during
these times.''
 &HT;    It was raining outside as Zevy left. It seems on this Rosh
Hashanah holiday the heavens cried.
 &HT;    How macabre and eerie that the Jew is saved as a suffering Jesus
Christ. Zevy, celebrating his sixteenth Rosh Hashanah, eating bread
at the home of a Christian.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, Ostrovaks and his henchmen feasted on kosher food and
wine, singing and dancing in Jewish homes. Dipping the apples in
bowls of honey -- their hands stained with fresh blood from their
New Year's sacrifice.
 &HT;    On Rosh Hashanah I'll be in synagogue with my congregation.
There I will remember the little towns and shtetls that are long
gone and forgotten.
 &HT;    I will resolve that besides repenting for my misdeeds I will
promise to help make this world a better and safer place for all
mankind.
 &HT;    According to tradition, Rosh Hashanah is also the day on which
man was created. It would be wonderful if mankind would celebrate
by inviting God to enter their hearts.
 &HT;    I wish all mankind a happy birthday.

IN THE LONG RUN, PERSISTENCE WINS   FOR MIKE CAPUANO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANTHONY FLINT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOMERVILLE, Mass. _ Michael Capuano was looking downright
congressional, walking into the Rosebud Diner in Davis Square
Wednesday in his crisp white shirt and dark red necktie,
surprisingly fresh after only a few hours of sleep.
</P>
<P>
   People looked up from their tuna melts and cups of minestrone to
congratulate this new celebrity _ the mayor of Somerville, who
became the last-minute choice of so many voters in Tuesday's 10-way
Democratic primary for the 8th Congressional District that he is
suddenly empowered to follow in the footsteps of John F. Kennedy
and Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Rivals wondered how someone so little-known outside his
hometown, who had made enough enemies in five terms at City Hall
that questions were raised in the late stages of the campaign about
his temperament and his record, could pull away from the pack so
convincingly.
</P>
<P>
   But Capuano may have had the perfect ingredient for the race: a
restless persistence. He kept running for mayor after being
rebuffed by the political establishment twice. He was undeterred by
an unsuccessful run for secretary of state, when he tried to change
the rules for nominating candidates at the Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my father ran for office, he wasn't accepted by a lot of
people around here. He was always the outsider,'' Capuano said over
a ham and cheese sandwich at 3 p.m., his first meal of the day. ``I
didn't have as many elected officials with me as others in this
race. I didn't have as many unions. The teachers weren't with me.
We just did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Capuano held a one-point lead over former Boston mayor
Raymond L. Flynn in polls before Tuesday's voting, he wound up
beating Flynn 23 percent to 18 percent, with the others bunched up
behind Flynn. In earning his 19,301 votes, his powerful
organization made sure the Somerville base was a solid foundation _
almost 40 percent of his support came from his hometown _ but he
drew surprising strength across the district, as voters settled on
him as the alternative to others. Although he did not carry another
city in the district, he pulled more than enough from his rivals to
win the nomination. Capuano will face Republican C. Phillip Hyde
and Independent candidate Anthony Schinella in November's general
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put together the base, added the Italian ethnicity piece,
and went out and won outside of Somerville as well. He ran a
perfect race, given his positioning,'' said Michael Goldman,
consultant for former radio talk-show host Marjorie Clapprood, who
with former state senator George Bachrach and environmental
activist John O'Connor became the candidates who voters assessed
and passed up as the Flynn alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, like others, said Capuano was perceived as slightly
more moderate than those contenders, but not as conservative as
Flynn. ``He didn't have the ideological liberal rhetoric that
Marjorie or George or Susan Tracy were perceived to have. In any
other circumstance, you'd have to say he's a liberal. But in the
spectrum of this race, he was left-center. We had a bunch of
left-fielders, one guy (venture capitalist Chris Gabrieli) in
center, and one guy playing right. And the ball got hit to the guy
in left-center.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Shea, Capuano's lead consultant, said voters outside of
Somerville were convinced by his message, hammered home in his TV
ads and in candidate debates, that he had deep roots in the
district and had improved the Somerville public schools as his
chief achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a clear message and he kept repeating it. But I think
he was also the best person to carry the message. He was the real
thing. He's an innovative, urban populist. People saw in him a
combination of Dartmouth and Somerville, the best of both. He was
feisty and we didn't try to polish him or change him,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in Somerville, living in a house on Porter
Street, Capuano, 46, graduated from Somerville High School and went
on to Dartmouth College. He describes himself as an ``average
student. I didn't take any leadership roles. I graduated, much to
the surprise of some.''
</P>
<P>
   From Dartmouth he moved on to Boston College Law School, though
he decided to take a yearlong break after only a few weeks of
classes. ``I was never enamored of the law, or a student of the
law,'' he said. But he returned to BC Law School and graduated.
From there, he went to the State House, working as a staffer for
the Joint Committee on Taxation. When his first son, Michael, was
born, he left to join the Beacon Hill firm of Joyce &AMP; Joyce.
</P>
<P>
   Capuano ran for mayor of Somerville in 1979, and again in 1981,
both times unsuccessfully.
</P>
<P>
   His first win was in 1989, ``when everybody was against me,'' he
said. Determined to consolidate power, he ran City Hall in an
unflinching manner, with few scores left unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   In his unsuccessful run for secretary of state in 1994, Capuano
was dogged by campaign finance questions that continued in the 8th
District campaign. The questions centered mostly on city workers
making big contributions to his campaign. But Capuano portrays the
run as taking on the Goliath of the Democratic establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, Capuano is part of the Democratic establishment.
He got phone calls from Senator Edward M. Kennedy and House
minority leader Richard A. Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, first
thing Wednesday. He has checked in with delegation dean J. Joseph
Moakley, 9th District US representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary. It's daunting,'' Capuano said of his probable move
to Washington. But he didn't really look scared.

   Tracking makeup trends can be bewildering. First brown lipstick
is in, then pink, then plum. All the hues look good on models. But
how many of us have the time and money to spend shopping in stores,
investing in colors like cappuccino and lavender, only to find out
that _ on us _ the trendy colors look horrible?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the fashion industry has a time-saving solution that
doesn't require leaving your home.
</P>
<P>
   In the September issue of Allure magazine, a panel of makeup
artists _ not advertisers _ has compiled what they think are the
best colors for fall. In what the publication is calling a
first-of-its-kind magazine spread, Allure offers eight samples of
products for readers to test, in little packages with lift-up
flaps.
</P>
<P>
   The interactive makeup story includes berry-colored lipstick by
Revlon, a pink blush by Almay, a bronze eyeshadow by Chanel, and a
gray eyeshadow by Prescriptives.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, we've all seen magazines with perfume and
moisturizer samples inside them. But this really is different. Says
Allure, ``It gives readers a chance to try the colors we've chosen
in a real context. In natural light, for instance, at home, while
wearing jeans. (Pesky salesclerk trying to push the matching nail
polish not included.)''
</P>
<P>
   Glamour magazine is trying to offer consumers even more. In its
October issue, it will provide 12 product samples for readers to
test, including a liquid eyeliner by Clinique. Once readers decide
what they like, they can call Bloomingdale's on an 800 number and
order the goods by code.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's one-stop shopping.

   The upscale Italian menswear design house Ermenegildo Zegna will
open its first Boston store Sunday, Sept. 20.
</P>
<P>
   You might recall the published reports last month that Monica
Lewinsky gave President Clinton a $110 Zegna tie.
</P>
<P>
   Other celebrities who have sported the clothes include Al Pacino
and Keanu Reeves in ``The Devil's Advocate,'' Eddie Murphy in ``Dr.
Dolittle,'' and Kenneth Branagh in ``The Gingerbread Man.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trivero, Italy-based company, which operates seven US
stores, is known for fine fabrics and fit. It began as a fabric
maker in 1910 and expanded over the years to include tailored men's
clothing and sportswear.
</P>
<P>
   Zegna _ whose line is also sold in Neiman Marcus _ decided to
open a Boston store because ``Boston has a strong and
well-established Zegna customer base,'' said Richard Cohen,
president and CEO of Zegna, North America.

   The fashion industry has long been criticized for using teenage
girls as a symbol of ideal beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the aging of the baby boomers, cosmetics company
Revlon Consumer Products Corp. has decided to use a spokesmodel its
customers can identify with: 48-year-old actress Cybill Shepherd.
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd will star in a series of new TV and print ads for the
brand Ultima II. She says, ``I've always thought that women are
beautiful at all stages of their lives. In the next decade, almost
50 million of us will be 40-plus. I think it's really exciting to
be associated with ... a company that recognizes the individual
beauty of women like me.''

LOUISA MAY ALCOTT'S STUDY RECAPTURED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARGO MILLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, Mass. _ Fans of Louisa May Alcott _ and they extend all
the way east to Turkey and west to Japan _ have their own mental
image of the March family home she evokes in ``Little Women.'' It
comes as a shock to many to see the Victorian reality of Orchard
House, where part of the novel was written in 1868. The room most
recently transformed is Bronson Alcott's study. Although Louisa
would dip into her considerable royalties to provide ``Marmee'' and
the homestead with central heating, &UR;  &LR; it was her artistic &UR;  &LR; sister
May who undertook to redecorate their father's study.
</P>
<P>
   This he recorded with satiric good humor in his diary for April
1874:
</P>
<P>
   ``May finds my study needs to be put into fresher costume. She
has purchased a new carpet, and new sofa and arm chair are to be
crimsoned to match and she is to do the working of spreading the
same and covering with such assistance as I can render. When the
carpet is spread, and the sofa and chair are covered, it will be
found the paper needs recovering to match, and then perhaps the
paint for the doors and summers (boxed beams) and casements to say
nothing of the mantlepiece.''
</P>
<P>
   The usual picture of Amos Bronson Alcott (1799-1888) is of a
certifiably double-domed Transcendental philosopher who sometimes
didn't know enough to come in out of the rain. He was an
educational reformer _ ``The Child Is the Book,'' not the pedagogic
system _ and he was right-minded. When he was criticized for
admitting a black child to his Boston school, a fellow
Transcendentalist, Ralph Waldo Emerson, came to his defense. At
Fruitlands, the utopian community Alcott helped establish in the
town of Harvard, all would share the work. That none of them knew
how to farm brought the little commune to near starvation.
</P>
<P>
   But around the house, Alcott was full of good ideas, some
practical, some decorative. It helped that he was a good carpenter.
Before the 20th century, few houses had storage closets; Alcott
reconfigured the upper staircase hall to give Louisa room for her
books. Other built-ins included a writing desk for her. Bronson's
study had bookcases made to frame the door to May's art studio. The
parlor and study acquired elegant niches for statuary; in the 1875
stereopticon slide of Bronson in his study he is posed reading
while his likeness, a portrait bust by the young Daniel Chester
French, peers out from the fireplace wall. May had been French's
first art teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Bronson Alcott had also been a friend and admirer of Andrew
Jackson Dowling, who died tragically young, but not before giving
America's new middle classes some pointers on how to live in
harmony with self and nature. The villa was Dowling's architectural
preference. He circulated up plans for their construction and the
gardens to be planted around them, and he had ideas about colors
for interior decoration. The new wallpaper in Alcott's study may be
one of the neutrals that Dowling's books advocated for airy
serenity. Richard Nylander, chief curator of the Society for the
Preservation of New England Antiquities and wallpaper consultant
for Orchard House, thinks the Alcott study chimes with ``one of
Dowling's `fawn' colors.''
</P>
<P>
   Restoration is a form of archeology. Like the seven layers of
Troy, Orchard House had seven wallpapers; as part of her research,
Heather Wager, the house's former curator, has preserved and
displayed swatches for documentation. Four patterns post-date the
Alcotts who left Orchard House in 1882. The two earliest papers,
dating from the 1850s, were fake wood grain. It was this graining,
fashionable in its day, that May replaced with what she considered
the more stylish ``diaper,'' or diamond pattern, enclosing
fleur-de-lis, or lilies. Though the 1875 photo doesn't catch the
effect, the flowers seem to shimmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If in Emerson's study perpetual twilight reigns,'' wrote a
visitor to Orchard House in 1874, ``in Alcott's it is always noon.
The great sun shines in it all day, the great fireplace roars, and
the warm crimson hangings temper the sunlight and reflect the
firelight.''
</P>
<P>
   The wallpaper that May Alcott chose went back to the 1790s. In
the days of illumination by candle and fireplace, people went to
enormous lengths to introduce more light into dark rooms. The
secretary-desk in Bronson's study, had it been a grander piece,
would have had mirrored door panels to reflect candle light. By the
process of ``satining'' wallpapers, rooms got the same glow as the
shiny dress fabric. Satining required two steps, says Nylander, a
leading historian of wallpapers. ``The whole paper was first glazed
to create a very shiny finish. Then you printed over this with a
flat color, and that flat color became the background.'' Such
papers were popular in the 1840s and 1850s. When revived again in
the 1860s, the use of aniline dye made the colors very brilliant.
By the 1870s, the calming influence of Dowling was apparent. With
firelight dancing over May's new paper, the lilies glowed silver.
By day, this receded and the walls turn buff with a light brown
pattern of diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   Against this, Bronson Alcott's red carpet comes as a shock. Just
as noisy was the new emerald green carpet for the Alcott parlor.
This too was a fashion of the times, to carpet the principal living
rooms in complementary colors. But as Nylander says, the idea of
house museums ``is to educate people to period taste, rather than
what we've become comfortable with.'' For further information about
Orchard House and its guided tours and many programs, telephone
978-369-4118.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the study's wallpapers, samples of its carpeting have not
survived to the present day. To find a period reproduction, Orchard
House turned to John Burrows, whose J.R. Burrows &AMP; Company of
Rockland deals in Victorian carpets, many of which are still in
production in England. When Burrows blew up the 1875 photo, he
could see the red carpet had a vigorous arabesque pattern. He found
something similar at Woodward Grosvenor &AMP; Co, Ltd., of
Kidderminster, near Birmingham, whose patterns go back to the
mill's founding in 1790.
</P>
<P>
   There would soon come a time when the Alcotts' bright carpets
were out of fashion. Already the Arts &AMP; Crafts movement in England
was frowning on primary and secondary colors, says Burrows, and a
sort of podge would take over. Gilbert &AMP; Sullivan satirized it in
``Patience.'' Yet for the Alcotts to choose a green carpet took
daring of another kind. A few decades earlier the color had been
associated with arsenic poisoning and there was a public health
campaign warning of greens. ``Even though arsenic was not used in
carpet-making,'' says Burrows, ``the color green disappeared for 20
or 25 years.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next few years, Orchard House will be very much a work
in progress. The next room to be restored will be May's bedroom.
She grew up to be a talented artist and Allison Leopold's
forthcoming biography will give May her due. Royalties from
``Little Women'' _ May was the novel's Amy _ paid for her European
training and she was good enough to have a still life displayed at
the Paris Salon in 1877. At a time when copying famous paintings
had its place in the art world, she was famed for hers of the great
English romantic, J.W.M. Turner. Marriage to a Swiss businessman
and musician, Ernest Nierker, she delivered the bliss of
``painting, music, love'' but it was short-lived. She died in 1879,
six months after the birth of her daughter, Louisa May. Called
Lulu, the child was sent to Concord to be raised by ``Aunt Weedy.''
</P>
<P>
   May's room at Orchard House is noted for her murals ``after
Flaxman'' of ancient Greek scenes. As a girl, she'd been entranced
with Emerson's volume of Flaxman engravings and would study them
under his library table. ``Take them home with you!'' Emerson said
and she did; and one reason why so many of May's Flaxman murals
feature chariot horses may be because she adored riding. She and
the future ``Aunt Weedy'' would ride for hours over Concord's lanes
and fields.

AUDIO BOOKS: `PET SEMATARY' OFFERS AN EARFUL OF ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Sept. 20)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
 _____  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (``Pet Sematary,'' by Stephen King. A fully dramatized
multivoice presentation by the British Broadcast Corp. Abridged,
approximately three hours. Simon &AMP; Schuster Audio. $18)
</P>
<P>
   Most books are read by a single actor, or, on rare occasions, by
the author. Which is why ``Pet Sematary'' is unique and a treat in
the world of audio books. This is a fully dramatized multivoice
presentation performed by the BBC and now reissued by Simon &AMP;
Schuster Audio.
</P>
<P>
   While plot is the real ruler in best-selling author Stephen
King's thrillers, sound effects and the voices of more than a dozen
talented readers make ``Pet Sematary'' crackle with tension it
would not have otherwise. Even children age 10 and up, who have
been exposed to some of the tamer horror movies, will be entranced
by this audio book, thanks mostly to the unique presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of King's books, ``Pet Sematary'' is set in rural
Maine, where a young doctor has relocated his family in order to
raise their children in a tranquil place. But a pet burial ground
located near their home makes life anything but peaceful for the
Creed family. Listener, beware, and listeners, be advised: If fully
dramatized, multivoice presentations are the next wave for audio
books, it will be a fun ride.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   (``Power Plays Politika,'' created by Tom Clancy and Martin
Greenberg. Read by Jay O. Sanders. Abridged, approximately three
hours. Simon &AMP; Schuster Audio. $18)
</P>
<P>
   Tom Clancy fans, and they are many, should be warned.
``Politika'' is not a novel, per se, but a novel based on the Red
Storm Entertainment computer game in which Clancy is a creative
partner. The giveaway is on the box containing the two audio
cassettes: Clancy is listed as the creator, not the author.
</P>
<P>
   Read by the actor Jay O. Sanders (``Tucker: A Man and his
Dream'' and ``Glory,'' among other films), who smoothly alters his
voice to capture various Russian politicos as well as Americans,
``Politika'' is a thriller set on the cusp of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The pace is quick, the action decisive, the descriptions
surprisingly well written. But the men and women are caricatures,
devoid of complexity. This is what happens, I suppose, when you try
and breathe life into characters whose existence begins in a
computer game.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (``Bloodstream,'' by Tess Gerritsen. Read by Jan Maxwell.
Abridged, approximately three hours. Simon &AMP; Schuster Audio. $18)
</P>
<P>
   Internist-turned-thriller-writer Tess Gerritsen has cashed in _
in a way the medical establishment never would have permitted _
with two best-sellers: ``Harvest'' and ``Life Support.''
</P>
<P>
   She has found a formula that works and is determined to pump it
for all it's worth. ``Bloodstream'' is her third book in three
years.
</P>
<P>
   A murderous epidemic has broken out in Tranquility, Maine, where
Dr. Claire Eliot has moved with her teen-age son. Eliot feels
compelled to uncover the epidemic's bizarre medical cause, no
matter how evil its roots.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Gerritsen's plot is so far-fetched and her
characters so poorly developed that her success as a writer is a
sorry indicator of how far the book-buying public's standards have
sunk. If quality was the determining factor, Gerritsen might well
be on the phone as we speak, contacting health care companies for
per diem work.

   TAKE-BOS  
 UNDATED: ... is too much.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember, do not put insulation in the overhang of the roof,
into the eaves. This would block any vents there, and even if there
are no vents, it could cause serious condensation, with resulting
water that could soak insulation and ruin it. If there is
insulation in your eaves, take it out.
</P>
<P>
   If there are floor boards in the attic, you can blow cellulose
or fiberglass into the cavity. That is all you can get in, maybe 5
1/2 to 9 1/2 inches, below the recommended thickness. When blowing
insulation under the floor, take special care not to let it spew
into the overhang.
</P>
<P>
   You could put more insulation on top of the floor boards, but
it's not recommended. To add insulation, remove those boards.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The basement ceiling? Sure
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Next easiest place is the basement ceiling. But why bother?
Doesn't warm air rise? Yes, but heat can be lost through a barrier
in any direction: up, down, and sideways.
</P>
<P>
   Put 6-inch backed insulation between the joists, with the
backing (vapor barrier) up, touching the floor above. Hold the
insulation in place with pointed wires, called insulation hangers;
they come in lengths to accommodate 14 1/2- to 22 1/2-inch spaces.
The points grab the joists, and the wires almost always stay in
place.
</P>
<P>
   Or, in a basement ceiling, staple polyethylene plastic to the
ceiling, then install 8-inch Polywrap with the hangers. This will
give an extra bit of insulation and also, because it is wrapped in
poly, keep the fiberglass out of your hair if you happen to brush
against it.
</P>
<P>
   If you have just insulation in the basement ceiling, and don't
like the idea of exposed fiberglass, and don't plan to finish off
the basement as living space, staple Tyvek on the bottom of the
joists. It will not only keep the fiberglass where it belongs but
also, being white, will make the basement lighter.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Toughest way: in the walls
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The final place for insulation is in the walls. One way to do it
is to have cellulose or fiberglass blown in the walls by an
installer.
</P>
<P>
   Professionals do it by removing clapboards or shingles at
appropriate places, drilling holes through the sheathing into the
wall cavity, inserting a hose into each hole, and filling the
cavity. Holes must be drilled between studs at the top and bottom
of each stud space, so that means a helluva lot of holes. Can't be
helped.
</P>
<P>
   The holes are then covered and the clapboards and shingles
returned, so you really don't know anything was done, except when
you check your heating bills. Insulation can be blown in virtually
any house _ sided with vinyl, aluminum, brick, stucco, even
asbestos cement siding and other materials).
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the holes are made inside, particularly on brick
and asbestos cement sided houses. This is OK, except that the
insulation men are installers, not plasterers, and the patching of
the holes may leave much to be desired.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of blowing in insulation (60 years ago), the
blown-in material often sagged over time, leaving gaps at the top
of the stud space. Even a small gap reduces the value of the
insulation. Today, the material is blown in under pressure, and
sagging is minimal.
</P>
<P>
   You can do this yourself, renting a blower and cellulose
insulation at rental stores. But if you find that there are too
many holes to drill, it might pay to have a pro do it.
</P>
<P>
   Blown-in insulation does not provide a vapor barrier. However,
you can paint the walls with a vapor barrier paint; most interior
wall paints are vapor barriers. And, vinyl-coated, foil, and
Wall-Tex type (vinyl-coated cloth) wall coverings are also vapor
barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to insulate walls is to take off the plaster or
plasterboard wall, put in the insulation and vapor barrier, and put
up new walls.
</P>
<P>
   Ugh. That's a lot of work. Although, it has been done, but for
other reasons, and if you don't have those reasons, you really
don't want to do it, do you?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Cathedral ceilings
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One more place to insulate is a cathedral ceiling, although most
cathedral ceilings are in new houses, which are already well
insulated.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, to insulate this space, you have to take off the
ceiling, and install insulation with 1 inch of air spce between
insulation and roof boards; that insulation should have a vapor
barrier facing the room. Then put up a new ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   A complicating feature in this project is that that 1-inch air
space must be ventilated, which means you have to put in soffit
vents (a soffit is the underpart of the roof overhang) and a ridge
vent on the roof to get that air moving.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve that 1 inch of air space, and keep it open, staple
proper vents or rafter chutes on the inside of the roof. The vents
provide automatic spacing and keep the space open.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there is a way of getting around this complicated
business. Install 1- or 2-inch Styrofoam or polyisocyanurate
directly on the old ceiling, then put on a new ceiling. Two inches
of this will provide an R factor of 10 to 14, less than 6 inches of
insulation in the cavity itself, which provides an R factor of
about 19.
</P>
<P>
   Still another way is to install 2- to 4-inch rigid insulation on
the roof, then reroof over that. That's pretty good in new
construction, but pretty expensive as a retrofit.
</P>
<P>
   That's about it for insulation and vapor barriers, but that is
not all for saving heat. You could save up to 50 percent of your
heating costs with the insulation suggested above, but you can save
even more by tightening up the house: caulking and
weatherstripping.
</P>
<P>
   And that is the subject of next Sunday's sermon.

CAN WE SURVIVE A TOXIC WORLD? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We spent a morning last weekend, marking trees at the edges of
our property in Vermont. My daughter, Julie, was wielding a spray
can of fluorescent paint, but a broken nozzle leaked the paint over
her hand and down her arm. As we stood deep in the woods, Julie
read the label: ``This product contains a chemical known to the
state of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other
reproductive harm.''
</P>
<P>
   I did some research when I got home. Toluene, the poison in
question, is so widely used in paint products, stain removers,
dyes, nail polish, and cosmetics that in some places it has made
its way into the water supply. According to ``Generations at
Risk,'' a report by the Greater Boston Physicians for Social
Responsibility, toluene increases the risk of spontaneous abortion
by two to fivefold in those exposed at workplace levels, causes
birth defects, and may disrupt hormones, particularly in men.
</P>
<P>
   I sat in my office, stunned. Must we distrust everything?
</P>
<P>
   Who reads the warning on spray paint? Who imagines that it
contains a poisonous solvent that you can inhale or absorb through
the skin. Who wants to believe that commonplace objects can set in
motion forces that will result in cancer or a child damaged for
life?
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to look at this world without turning away, sickened.
We can't trust manufacturers to use only harmless ingredients.
Corporations routinely wage campaigns to convince us that
life-threatening products, like tobacco, won't hurt us. Unless we
cultivate a constant, unswerving wariness, a moment of inattention
in a hardware store can end up exposing your daughter to an
alarming hazard.
</P>
<P>
   We're lucky Julie wasn't pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   I hate questioning the wonders of technology. Every time I'm
alerted to a new danger, my first response is to protest that I'm
resisting too many things already. Still, I feel this urgent desire
to protect, not only myself, but all living things. Why else fill
my head with all this stuff?
</P>
<P>
   I used to think only crazies feared invisible electromagnetic
fields. Cell phones a threat? Power lines a danger? Isn't that for
paranoids?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not. I'm familiarizing myself with the research findings
on the effects of electromagnetic radiation.
</P>
<P>
   The scientific studies sitting two inches high on my desk offer
compelling evidence that radio frequency radiation at non-thermal
levels can cause biological disruption in cells in animals and in
humans, leading to brain function changes, attention deficit, sleep
disruption, reproductive problems including miscarriage, DNA
breakage, and immune system impairment leading to cancer (by
suppressing our body's production of melatonin, a powerful
antioxidant which inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells).
</P>
<P>
   This is what struck me most powerfully. In 1990, the
Evironmental Protection Agency prepared a report classifying
extremely low frequency radiation, as a ``probable human
carcinogen,'' and other radio frequency and microwave radiation as
a ``possible human carcinogen.'' That report was never released,
supposedly because of budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Congress delighted the telecommunications industry by
passing the Telecommunication Act, which prohibits state and local
government from regulating wireless facilities on the basis of
their environmental effects. Soon satellites will have every inch
of the earth in the beam of digital cellular antennas. All this in
the absence of any standards, except thermal limits, for human
health and safety.
</P>
<P>
   Human beings are bioelectrical systems. The activity of our
cells is governed by the flow of electromagnetic fields. For the
first time in history, we are being bombarded by manmade background
radiation which has risen by factors of millions since the World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   How long will corporate America repeat the pattern of
irresponsibility that marked the early handling of asbestos, DDT,
thalidomide, and radioactivity? Is it rational always to market in
haste and regret in leisure? The Gloucester (Mass.) City Council
recently denied a company permission to mount three cellular towers
atop a hospital, despite threats of litigation. As evidence mounts,
a citizen-led worldwide revolt against the wireless revolution is
in the making. According to the American Cancer Society, the risk
of getting cancer in your lifetime is now 1 in 2 for men, 1 in 3
for women, up from 1 in 20 in my grandparents' generation.
</P>
<P>
   Will we wait to take precautions until the rate is 1 in 1?

BOOK STIRS DEBATE OVER ROLE OF PEERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just how important are peers in the lives of our children? Not
nearly as important as Judith Rich Harris says.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, a New Jersey grandmother and former college textbook
writer, has created quite a stir with her book, ``The Nurture
Assumption: Why Children Turn Out the Way They Do'' (Free Press).
She argues that, except for the genes we pass on, parents don't
count. Peers do.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was a frightening thought for parents, this is it.
Undoubtedly, that's why the media has jumped on this book; it
certainly isn't because of her original research (she hasn't done
any) or her academic credentials (she doesn't have any). But while
her concept may be appealing to media types for its controversy and
sensationalism, Harris and her theories are being widely
discredited by researchers and professionals who work with parents
and children.
</P>
<P>
   Child psychologist Jerome Kagan of Harvard University,
nationally known for his work on children's temperament, has been
the most vocal and the most blunt. ``What she says is just silly,''
he says. ``Any parent knows that intuitively.''
</P>
<P>
   Gail Biancucci, a mother of two, certainly does. Her 4
1/2-year-old daughter, Stephanie, is a social child, the kind of
little girl who would be next door at her friend's house at 7 a.m.
every day, whether the family was awake or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teaching her that you can't have free reign in someone else's
house, that there are boundaries and rules about how you interact
in the world, this is part of my role. Lately, she turns down
invitations to go there until she checks with me,'' says Biancucci.
That alone is proof to her of the myriad of known, unknown, and
unknowable ways she influences her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   That Harris discounts the influence parents like Biancucci can
see for themselves puts her in a minority except among a body of
scientists known as biogeneticists, who stress the importance of
genetics and evolution in human development. Harris's detractors
agree each child is born with an individual temperament, but they
say that's only half the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personality is what you are born with. Character is what
parents shape,'' says researcher and developmental psychologist Bob
Selman of Harvard and Judge Baker's Children's Center in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Peers play a role in how a child develops, too, agree Selman,
Kagan, and their Harvard colleague, Howard Gardner. But Kagan
notes, ``To say it happens to the exclusion of parents is a flawed
argument.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the nation's top researchers on peer relationships also
say Harris goes too far. ``Peers are important, I've been saying
that for years,'' says psychologist James Youniss of Catholic
University in Washington, D.C. ``But I also believe you need the
parental relationship. Harris uses my work but drops that piece of
it,'' he says, noting that Harris did no original research of her
own. She also has no academic credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologist William Damon, a professor at Stanford University
who also is well known for his work on peer relationships, says the
fact that children are even able to enter into friendships is
because parents lay the groundwork for them in their first six
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way parents relate to a child shapes the way a child
relates to others,'' says Damon. For instance, babies and toddlers
whose parents engage in verbal turn-taking and who are generally
reliable in their mood and response _ when they want hugs, you
don't push them away one day and embrace them the next _ are more
likely to engage in turn-taking with peers and less likely to be
moody, inconsistent, and temperamental. In other words, they make
good playmates.
</P>
<P>
   That parents provide a sense of orderliness to the world is also
critical. ``You wake up and eat breakfast and you eat cereal, not
candy. This structure gives a child security,'' says Youniss, and
it's what enables him or her to feel safe enough to operate in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Parent educator Linda Braun, a professor at Wheelock College and
director of Families First in Cambridge, Mass., says a child also
needs a positive sense of herself to be able to engage peers. This
comes from parents, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn how you appear in the world, what you can do in the
world and how to evaluate the world from the mirror image of
yourself that parents reflect back to you,'' says Braun. ``Just a
minor adjustment in a parent's response can change a child's
outlook on the world. I see it happen all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   If parents do a good job laying the foundation, at about age 7,
children begin to evolve from being playmates brought together by
circumstance into friends who choose peers based on mutual
admiration and interests.
</P>
<P>
   And guess what? Who they choose has a lot to do with us.
</P>
<P>
   Harris says the most parents can do is live in a good
neighborhood so that the pool peers come from is of high quality.
Developmentalists say our role is far less passive.
</P>
<P>
   ``How intellectual is your home?'' asks Gardner. ``Do you talk
about books, movies? How truthful is your home, how responsible is
it? Are you honest in your dealings? Do you act on your values? If
a child is used to interesting conversations, to people who tell
the truth and pull their weight, she won't want friends who are
boring or who lie or are unreliable.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometime between the age of 8 and 12, the power of peers'
influence increases. Ours, however, doesn't necesssarily decrease.
``It just becomes different,'' says Gardner.
</P>
<P>
   Damon's research shows there are certain things children learn
better from peers than from us, for instance, cooperation, loyalty,
a sense of fairness, and even some cognitive skills. ``They're
better able to learn some abstract math skills like ratios and
proportions from peers in a cooperative context than they are from
adults who teach forumulas,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also things they only learn from us. It's our job
to provide the moral overlay for the relationships, according to
Damon. ``Without discussions about what constitutes legitimate
authority, justice, and kindness, kids are lacking in social,
historical, and cultural perspective. They're wild and
undisciplined,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   They also don't feel good. Many studies, including Selman's,
show that children who feel like they're on their own, whose
parents aren't supportive, caring, or involved, are panicky and
insecure, have difficulty with relationships, and are more likely
to act out in aggressive, antisocial ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in this period of 8 to 12, when she says her best friend
is the most important person in her and you feel like you don't
count, she still needs to know you are present in spirit,'' Selman
says.
</P>
<P>
   It's in this context that researchers say Harris's book is
potentially dangerous. ``It gives parents permission not to pay
attention,'' says Selman. ``My research shows, if you pull the
invisible hand away, all hell breaks loose.'' This is true for all
children but especially for those with emotional and/or behavioral
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Because Harris is also an adoptive parent who says her theory
was formed in part by the lack of influence she says she had on her
adopted daughter, specialists in the adoption community are
particularly worried about the book. Cambridge psychologist Joyce
Pavao of the Center for Family Connections says it is emotional
abandonment if adoptive parents buy into Harris's thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was destructive 20 years ago to believe genetics has
nothing to do with who (adoptive) kids are, and it's destructive,
flippant, and offensive to think the parents who raise a child have
nothing to do with how that child turns out,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Youniss says the bottom line is that parents and peers are both
important in children's lives, each in a different way, each with a
different function. Damon says, ``I want parents to know ... (your
influence) doesn't stop, ever.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SUGGESTIONS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _With children 3 to 7, parents' role vis a vis peers is to serve
as middlemen, helping children connect to each other and then
interpreting the connections.
</P>
<P>
   _With older children, our role is mediator, helping them reflect
on friendship issues, problem-solving with them and putting issues
in a context that reflect our values.
</P>
<P>
   _That American children pay so much attention to peers is a
cultural phenomenon, not a developmental one.
</P>
<P>
   _Research shows that children under 7 years of age assume a
parent's qualities also belong to them. Thus, positive qualities
(warmth, responsiveness) have a positive influence on a child's
sense of self and therefore on how she relates to others, and
negative attributes, a negative one.

HOW DO I GET RID OF PIGEONS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have pigeons on my roof, and the fact that it is a Mansard
roof makes things more complicated. Their droppings are ruining the
house. I put up wind chimes some time ago, and the pigeons left,
but now they are back with a vengeance. What else can I do?
</P>
<P>
   KATHY DWYER, South Boston
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Move to Iceland, maybe, but that's not practical, and
besides, the seagulls and other seabirds might come instead of the
pigeons. There are a number of things you can do, but it is iffy
whether any of them will work. Although pigeons get used to
``scarecrows,'' such as dummy owls, one thing that might work a
little better is a balloon with a big eye or eyes on it,
representing a predator; it might make the pigeons at least
nervous, and may even make them leave for greener pastures. The big
eye balloons are sold in novelty and household goods stores. Moving
the wind chimes occasionally might also work.
</P>
<P>
   Another deterrent is Fly-Away or Roost-No-More, sold in
building-supply stores. These are sticky substances that the birds
don't like on their feet. Much of the roof should be treated
because if only a small area is treated, the birds will just move
farther up the roof. And, the material must be renewed when it is
washed away by rain. The handyman was castigated for suggesting
these sticky materials because, according to the castigator, the
materials are a health hazard to the poor little birdies. As far as
pigeons are concerned, the handyman says, they will have to take
their chances along with the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a series of needle boards might do the trick. These are
fierce-looking strips of metal with long, needlelike spikes
sticking out at all angles. Apply these to the roof and the pigeons
will have no place to light. The needle boards are made by Nixalite
of America, 1025 16th Ave., Box 727 Dept. PN, East Moline, IL
61244, 309-755-8771 or 800-624-1189, and Ecopic, 725 South Adams
Rd., Suite 270, Birmingham, MI 48009, 248-647-0505.
</P>
<P>
   One other way is to set up a mannequin in a rocking chair as a
scarepigeon. The wind blows, the chair rocks, and poof go the
pigeons. A reader said this worked on a balcony for her, but your
problem is where to put the rocking chair.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What should be put on the wall under new vinyl siding that
looks like shingles?
</P>
<P>
   JOE FITZGERALD, Danvers, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Generally, siding contractors put up 3/8- to 1/2-inch
Styrofoam insulation for two reasons: First, it smooths out the
wall to allow proper installation; and secondly, it adds a bit of
insulation to the wall. Another reason it should be done: It
insulates the outer wall to prevent any moisture that can get into
the wall cavity or the insulation in the wall cavity from
condensing. This condensation has been a big problem in recent
years, and any kind of insulation to keep the sheathing boards
warmer is a good idea. Tyvek, if it is used, can go over or under
the Styrofoam.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I live in a ranch house with slab on grade. The original
aluminum gutters have deteriorated badly, and I was wondering if I
could take them down and have no gutters at all? The roof overhang
is about 18 inches.
</P>
<P>
   TOM BITTELARI, Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Your situation, with a concrete floor directly on the ground,
with no basement or crawl space, is ideal for no gutters. With no
gutters you might create a drip line on the ground where the water
runs off the roof, but this can be handled with a trench of crushed
stone or even an apron made of concrete or patio blocks, which you
say you already have.
</P>
<P>
   Gutters are designed to prevent runoff water from dripping into
the ground, down the foundation, and into the basement. If they do
that, fine. With no basement or crawl space, there is simply no
need for gutters. The same goes for the garage. The handyman has
received critical letters from roofers for his statements on
gutters, but he will stick to his guns. There simply is no need for
gutters in many situations.
</P>
<P>
   Places a gutter may be needed is on an eave above an entrance,
or on an eave above a garage door. Gutters here will keep water
from cascading down your neck when you're at the entry or trying to
get into the garage.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I bought a new kitchen set including a farm table, which I
was told is wood, but I can't wash it, and every little mark and
spill shows. The man at the store suggested I polish it, but I
really don't want to get into that habit if I can help it. How can
I keep it looking new and free of blemishes, marks, and spills?
</P>
<P>
   MARGARET CARROLL, Winthrop, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It's unusual that it could be unfinished wood, unless it is
designed to be finished by the owner. If it is bare wood, then it
cannot be polished; that makes no sense. So, if it indeed is not
finished, you can sand off the blemishes and varnish it or apply a
stain of the color of your choice, then varnish it with two coats
of an oil-based polyurethane varnish. This will make it resistant
to spills and marks and blemishes, and easy to clean. Then you can
put a piece of plate glass ( 1/4-inch thick) on the top. A glass
company can cut a piece with slightly rounded corners and beveled
edges. Also, buy some self-adhesive rubber bumpers and put one in
each corner of the glass, plus two in the middle, to keep the glass
away from the table.
</P>
<P>
   If the blemishes are not too severe and the top looks OK now,
you can wash the top with paint thinner, then go ahead with the
glass.
</P>
<P>

THE LEAKING'S OVER, FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; You could almost sense an air of desperation in some of the
last news stories before the Sept. 11 release of Ken Starr's report
on the White House scandal. After nine months of relying on media
accounts from mysterious ``sources,'' the public was finally going
to know what the reporters knew. So for journalists, it was a last
call for leaks.
</P>
<P>
   NBC reported that ``a law enforcement source'' said the semen on
Lewinsky's dress matched the president's DNA. USA Today cited ``a
lawyer'' saying Starr will allege obstruction of justice but no
suborning of perjury. The New York Times said ``lawyers familiar
with Mr. Starr's plan'' indicated that he would try to prove
perjury, obstruction of justice, and abuse of power. In a matter of
hours, such speculation would be a matter of record.
</P>
<P>
   When the report was made public last Friday, viewers saw
television correspondents rushing to spit out the details even as
their role of information middlemen was being phased out.
(According to pollster Andrew Kohut, an impressive 13 percent of
the citizenry took the report directly off the Internet.)
</P>
<P>
   For Craig Crawford, editor of the Political Hotline newsletter,
the sight of the scrambling TV journalists marked a turning point
in the story. ``Suddenly, they're out of the picture,'' he says.
``If you're really interested in finding out something, you don't
have to wait for Dan Rather.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for the first in nine months the media was reporting
about allegations,'' says Kohut, of the Pew Research Center.
``Since nine months have passed, the baby's born.``
</P>
<P>
   And with the birth of that baby _ the Starr report that CNN
Washington bureau chief Frank Cesno calls the great ``leveller
because everybody's got it'' _ the media landscape changed
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   No longer can journalists dole out the crucial currency of
forbidden or secret information. For the first time since January,
that dynamic will not drive the story. Instead, the Lewinsky saga
now moves into the public domain _ to presidential press
conferences, Congressional deliberations, new releases of
Starr-related information, and most importantly, to the court of
public opinion. Information has suddenly been democratized. The
journalism becomes more reactive, and as a consequence, journalists
may become more popular.
</P>
<P>
   Both admirers and detractors of the press understand the new
circumstances. ``The Lewinsky reporters are now liberated from
their role of lap dogs,'' says media analyst Andrew Tyndall. ``All
of these people have depended on this drip of leaks. They become
reporters now rather than repositories of leaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek's Michael Isikoff, who did most of the serious work in
unearthing the Clinton/Lewinsky mess, says ``The story has changed
... from doing real reporting. ... It moves into a forum, Congress,
where there's a lot more sources. Before, there was a finite number
of sources who knew something.''
</P>
<P>
   In the week since the release of the Starr report, the tenor of
coverage has been noticeably different. Pulse-taking headlines like
``Women Voice Sympathy and Disgust,'' ``Nation Showing its Dismay
and Reluctance,'' and ``Most Support is for Censure,'' have
replaced breathless revelations about grand jury testimony and
possible tryst eyewitnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Even the punditocracy has evolved. Back in January, people like
NBC's Tim Russert, opining that Clinton had very little time to
respond to the allegations, or ABC's Sam Donaldson, suggesting his
presidency could be ``numbered in days,'' defined the dialogue.
Last weekend's lineup of television talking heads was loaded down
with the lawyers and lawmakers who will actually decide the
president's fate.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, polls show a disconnect between the media's avid
pursuit of the scandal and the public's stubborn resistance to it.
``There is a public disgust with the story,'' acknowledges Isikoff,
even as he points out how accurate much of the reporting has been.
And though he believes public opinion on the issue may be fluid,
Cesno admits that many citizens think the media have ``taken this
and beaten it to a pulp.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts, however, view the media's new role _ chronicling
the fallout from the Starr report instead of trying to preempt it _
as an opportunity to get back in the public's good graces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reporters will be able to present the president's case and the
critics' case,'' notes Rob Snyder, editor of the Freedom Forum's
Media Studies Journal. ``That should actually redound to the credit
of the press. People get suspicious of reporters who overmediate
the event.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The public wants a press that's less intrusive and reports the
controversy instead of drives it,'' adds Kohut.
</P>
<P>
   But Tom Rosenstiel, vice-chairman of the Committee Of Concerned
Journalists, warns that with a story this volatile, all media
cycles are fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right at the moment we are in one of those fortunate phases,''
when reporters are content to do the reaction stories, he says.
``We get into trouble when the amount of new facts begin to dry up
and we have a lot of pent up expectations ... I'm continually
surprised by how fast things happen and how little patience we
have.''

SEEING THE STARR REPORT ON THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I'm not on line, there's a good chance I'm watching C-SPAN,
the public affairs TV channel that features political speeches and
congressional hearings. I'm not terribly political _ I just like
bathing in the blue glow of pure information.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet offered much the same experience to millions of us
who downloaded Ken Starr's report on President Clinton. Liberated
from the pundits, we could read and decide for ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Predictions of a Starr-spawned Internet meltdown never made
sense. Of the 50 million people in North America who have access to
the Internet, about 13 million use the America Online computer
network, and another couple of million use CompuServe. Neither are
truly part of the Internet. AOL and CompuServe are private
networks, with server computers that distribute information
exclusively to their members. And one of those servers contained a
copy of the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the frenzy, I hopped on to AOL and got a copy
with no trouble. As of Wednesday, more than 750,000 AOL customers
had done the same. Each of those downloads is a rebuke to the
skeptics who predicted the Internet would kill AOL.
</P>
<P>
   It was harder to read the Starr report than it was to download
it, and not just because of its gamy content, or its 445-page
length. Worse yet, there was little effort to create an
easy-to-read electronic version.
</P>
<P>
   Computers make dreadful books. Monitors are hard on the eyes and
hard to carry to the bathroom. Besides, most on-line sources of the
report threw the data up on the Web either as a plain text file, or
with primitive Web page formatting.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad, because documents like the Starr report can actually be
easier to read on computer. The report is filled with
cross-references and footnotes _ the sort of thing that physicist
Tim Berners-Lee had in mind when he invented Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   Web-based versions of the report include crude but serviceable
hyper-linked footnotes. When did Betty Currie decide Monica
Lewinsky had become ``a pain in the neck''? Click note 484. Care
for a cigar? Light up note 42.
</P>
<P>
   The system works, but not very well. The footnotes are linked to
separate Web pages, so it's clumsy to hop between notes and text.
And for a handy overview of the complete document, it's back to the
contents page.
</P>
<P>
   To see the Starr report done right, visit
www.trellix.com/icreport. This site was set up by Trellix Corp. of
Waltham, Mass., makers of an unusually good Web design tool.
Trellix software has been used to turn the complex Starr report
into a comparatively easy read.
</P>
<P>
   The report itself occupies a large window inside the browser.
Above it is a ``document map'' with clickable links to each section
of the document. To the left is an outline of the document, with
abbreviated subject headings. Again, you can click these headings
to move through the report. And at the bottom is a window that
displays footnote data. Click footnote 42. The document stays put,
but the relevant citation appears in the footnote window.
</P>
<P>
   Trellix founder Dan Bricklin hopes government agencies will
someday issue their documents in Trellix format. It's not a bad
idea. Starr's original report was written in WordPerfect, the
favorite word-processing program of attorneys, but little used by
the rest of us. Trellix produces documents in HTML, readable by
everybody with a browser.
</P>
<P>
   But good text formatting is not enough. The government's Web
servers were overwhelmed by demand for the Starr report, and were
forced to fall back on mirror sites. What's needed is a permanent
arrangement for the Internet publication of government documents.
The model for such a system already exists: C-SPAN, a private
entity funded from the profits of cable TV companies.
</P>
<P>
   With billions of dollars at their disposal, the nation's
computer software and hardware companies can easily create an
equivalent service for the Web, to serve up Web versions of vital
government documents. It's the sort of idea that the Clinton
administration would have hailed _ right up until last week.

STAMP EVOKES ERA OF STYLE, ELEGANCE ON RAILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIMOTHY CAHILL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In the 1930s, the 20th Century Limited delivered
first-class train travel. Now it delivers first-class mail.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most famous images of the celebrated bullet-shaped
train, an icon of railroading glamour and power, is part of the
collection of the Albany Institute of History &AMP; Art. Earlier this
month, the U.S. Postal Service announced that the depiction, a
color lithograph poster by Leslie Ragan, had been transformed into
one of its newest 32-cent stamps.
</P>
<P>
   The institute's image of the 20th Century Limited, from a
promotional poster for the New York Central Railroad, was used by
the Postal Service as one of 15 images in the Postal Service's
``Celebrate the Century Collection'' of 1930s people, events and
imagery.
</P>
<P>
   The commemorative stamp honors ``Streamline Design'' as one of
the symbols of the '30s. Other images in the stamp line include the
Empire State Building, Franklin Roosevelt, the Depression, Superman
and the game Monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a classic mid-1930s look,'' says Tammis Groft, chief
curator at the institute. The 1938 poster was created, she adds,
``to encourage passengers to look to the railroad for elegance and
modern travel.'' The poster is on display at the institute.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as depicted on the 2-foot-by-3-foot poster painting, the
20th Century Limited was not simply a train. Its round-nosed
locomotive, pulling a long line of opulent and state-of-the-art
passenger cars, was a rolling metaphor of efficiency, confidence
and brute will, not just for the New York Central, but for the
country as well.
</P>
<P>
   Ragan was a graphic artist for the railroad company, given the
assignment to announce the train's 16-hour service between New York
and Chicago. He depicted the 20th Century barreling down the track,
into the sunshine glinting on the nose of its engine. Ragan's train
was no mere people-hauler, but a roaring juggernaut racing into the
light of an unlimited future.
</P>
<P>
   Ragan, who died in 1972, was a celebrated illustrator of
travel-related imagery before and after World War II. In addition
to working for the New York Central, he had many clients in the
railroad and steamship industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through his images of rail, he's entered the public
consciousness,'' Groft says. His image of the 20th Century Limited
found its way into Hollywood and the popular imagination. The
train's streamline design, with its rounded edges and curvaceous
lines, found its way into products from automobiles to blenders in
the '30s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It characterizes a national style,'' says Groft, that ``came
to symbolize progress and the elimination of all kinds of
friction.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Central Railroad was headquartered in Albany until
1959, when it closed its offices here and offered its artifacts to
the Albany Institute. More than 1,000 items, from tickets to
original paintings, were obtained by the museum, among them Ragan's
wood-framed poster.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service approached the institute two years ago about
using the image. ``We were sworn to secrecy,'' Groft says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very famous poster,'' says Postal Service spokesman Don
Smeraldy. ``It represents well the bullet shape and modernistic
design of that period.''
</P>
<P>
   The stamp was chosen from among thousands of designs and
subjects studied by the Citizens Stamp Advisory Committee, a group
appointed by the postmaster general.
</P>
<P>
   Ragan's poster contains advertising copy in the sans-serif
typeface of the day. The stamp crops out not just the type, but
much of the foreground of Ragan's original, emphasizing the
locomotive's sleek lines.
</P>
<P>
   The poster is a chromo-lithograph print of an original
watercolor painting. Groft says she does not know the location of
the original painting, or even if it still exists.

 &HT;    Overstepping the bounds of privacy
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Atlanta -Only the U.S. Supreme Court has shaped our democratic
institutions, construed our Constitution _ until now. But the
impeachment process as the forefathers envisioned it _
deliberative, fair, dignified, cautious _ is forever changed by a
prosecutor lacking the discretion and restraint that distinguishes
powerful officials.
</P>
<P>
   I have difficulty understanding why President Clinton or any
leader who cared about his family and country would not resign,
given the nature of his behavior in the Lewinsky affair and the
public revelation of it.
</P>
<P>
   But that view does not prevent me or thousands of other
Americans from believing that independent counsel Kenneth Starr has
permanently damaged some democratic institutions. He has utilized
seedy tactics and caused unnecessary harm to innocent people in an
investigation that should have been of a higher caliber. The
``sieve'' operation that Starr's lawyers provided to news media of
secret grand jury testimony (the media is not blameless in taking
full advantage of the illegal leaks) is itself abusive of the
public trust. As House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) was declaring
last week that no one would have access to the Starr report until
Congress voted to release it, Starr's lawyers were leaking it bit
by bit to top Washington news reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Even those early leaks demonstrated that the literary writers
Starr hired (at taxpayer expense) were effective and colorful _
more suited for the The National Inquirer than a serious legal
document. But Starr is a study in overkill, even on the claims
devoid of lurid sexual details.
</P>
<P>
   And example is the claim of abuse of the power of high office.
The president, the report claims, waged court fights ``to impede
the grand jury investigation.'' But I believe a president or any
high official who failed to challenge Starr's exceptions to
historic precedents in Anglo-Saxon law would be neglecting his own
responsibility to the people and the justice system. Questioning
invasion of lawyer-client privilege and the time-honored
relationship between the Secret Service and the president is hardly
abuse of power. All former presidents who are still living had
publicly opposed Starr's quest to make the Secret Service testify
before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has always seemed to lack a dimension of judgment that
someone in his place of unlimited power should have. He exhibited
that lack of discretion when he continued to represent Brown &AMP;
Williamson Tobacco Corp. against the federal government (the
people) while he was representing the people in investigating the
president. He had no problem advising the Republican Party while he
was supposed to be above partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   Starr seemed to relish giving the public the sordid details of
Clinton's behavior. He is, in part, the reason for the demeaning
public conversation that continues ad nauseam _ the dirty jokes at
the water coolers in workplaces all over the country, the incessant
gibberish of tabloid sex promoters.
</P>
<P>
   I wish Bill Clinton had resigned to save us and our children
from having to hear the details of his immoral behavior. And I wish
Kenneth Starr had to write 100 times a day the rest of his life the
1928 definition of the right to privacy crafted by Justice Louis
Brandeis: ``The makers of the Constitution ... sought to protect
Americans in their beliefs, their thoughts, their emotions, their
sensations. They conferred as against the government the right to
be let alone, the most comprehensive of rights and the right most
valued by civilized man.''
</P>
<P>
   While Starr and his literary advisers grovel around in the
sordid details of Clinton's sexual encounters with Lewinsky,
Brandeis towers. The presidency itself will survive Bill Clinton.
The question is whether the right to privacy can survive Ken Starr.

 &HT;    Don't rush to catch Jackie Chan's latest
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an opening scene of ``Rush Hour,'' Hong Kong police detective
Lee (Jackie Chan) playfully says goodbye to his star martial-arts
pupil, the adorable 11-year-old daughter of the new Chinese consul
to the United States. Lee wishes her luck in America, calling it
``a friendly place.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the far-off, noisy, nasty nation she arrives in turns
out to be anything but friendly, and the girl is soon kidnapped on
her way to school. Nor is this alien land all that friendly to
Chan, encasing the likable chop-socky action stunt performer in a
wheezy Hollywood formula odd-couple buddy picture, making him take
a back seat to his hot-shot comic co-star, Chris Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   There was something terribly endearing about Chan's earlier,
badly dubbed, awkwardly acted Asian supercop sagas (``Rumble in the
Bronx,'' ``First Strike,'' etc.) that have not translated well to
Western ways. Entertaining, at least in a guilty pleasure sense,
they possess a naive exuberance that gets knocked out of them when
money and cinematic polish are thrown their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rush Hour'' _ an odd title for a movie that isn't going
anywhere _ contrives to pair Chan with a loose cannon, egotistical
cop named James Carter (Tucker). They're two misfits who bungle the
case, wreaking havoc on the streets of Los Angeles, until they
eventually bring the bad guys to justice.
</P>
<P>
   Carter is a loudmouth embarrassment to the L.A. police, a sorry
collection of civil servants who are not easily embarrassed.
(``We're the most hated cops in the free world,'' says Carter. ``My
mother tells people I'm a drug dealer.'') Tucker, who re-teams with
director Brett Rattner after last year's overloud, underfunny
``Money Talks,'' must be an acquired taste. If you like him, you'll
be pleased to know there's a lot of him in ``Rush Hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, to keep Carter busy, he is assigned to babysit Detective
Lee, who is just another nuisance as far as the police and FBI are
concerned. Reluctantly, Carter takes Lee to such tourist spots as
Mann's Chinese Theatre, where Lee gives him the slip and heads off
to rescue the girl.
</P>
<P>
   Reunited, Carter teaches Lee a few cool, street-smart moves;
they bond singing Beach Boys songs; and a few buildings blow up
real good. Chan gets to scale a few walls, does a little
kick-boxing and manages a free-fall off an exposition center
catwalk. Somehow, it doesn't add up to much.
</P>
<P>
   Chan fans will be pleased to hear that director Rattner includes
a handful of outtakes of botched action sequences _ a Chan
trademark _ at the end of ``Rush Hour.'' But even they seem flat
and false, as if someone got an idea for an amusing misstep, and
then Ratt-ner filmed it until he got it wrong.

 &HT;    No false notes: 'True thing' uses fine cast, moving tale
 &HT;    By Gary Schwan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``One True Thing'' could have struck many false notes. The plot
is perilous _ a mother fighting cancer and a daughter whose
feelings toward her grow from resentment, to understanding, to
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   A tear-jerker? Amazingly, no, even if it is adapted from a novel
by the former New York Times sob sister, Anna Quindlen. Even a
choir warbling Silent Night doesn't turn the movie to mush.
</P>
<P>
   Why? It has actors of some note _ Meryl Streep, William Hurt and
Renee Zellweger, who is excellent in a role requiring a multitude
of emotions. Add the moody yet sober direction of Carl Franklin
(``Devil In A Blue Dress''). He largely forgoes visual showboating
for close-quarters observation of the human beings at the heart of
this melodrama _ people whose most fleeting expressions speak
volumes.
</P>
<P>
   The film also has a narrative structure that keeps a real
mystery percolating in the audience's mind until the final frame.
Finally, the story offers several truisms about the human heart and
the meaning of marriage. They aren't profound truths, but they are
presented in non-preachy fashion. They spring from the
circumstances and characters, and are startling in their
common-sense wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   This movie is about the people more than their predicament,
which is all too familiar, alas, and thus could have been milked
for cheap sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Streep plays Kate Gulden. She's a loving, Martha Stewart
homemaker, whose very cheeriness is irksome to her daughter Ellen
(Zellweger). Ellen is an ambitious rookie writer at a New York
magazine who has vowed not to lead a life like her mother's.
</P>
<P>
   Hurt is paterfamilias George Gulden, a tweedy, somewhat
self-absorbed professor who has won acclaim as an essayist but who
still yearns for recognition as a novelist. When his wife is
diagnosed with cancer, he simply assumes that his daughter will
move back in with the family and serve as a kind of nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen's resentment is put on boil. As Kate's illness inexorably
progresses, Ellen's conflicted emotions affect her relationship
with her mother, father, brother and boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen's shifting sensibilities are traced through an
accumulation of telling minor domestic incidents. Although
judgmental by nature, she comes to see her family as human beings,
with human frailties, even suspecting her father of having affairs.
But she also makes more than peace with them. She grows to love
them in profound and surprising ways.
</P>
<P>
   The story is told in flashback, with Ellen speaking to an
investigator. We realize that her mother has died, and we
eventually figure out that there is some question about whether the
death was natural.
</P>
<P>
   Streep's Ellen is a woman whose eternal optimism and
unconditional love could easily prove annoying. A consummate
actress, Streep doesn't employ accents or even remarkable tics or
gestures to convey character. It is her entire physical presence
that is impressive _ the many different ways she carries her body
as the cancer eats at her.
</P>
<P>
   With his crinkly eyes and deliberate manner, Hurt makes a good
intellectual with a sly sense of humor. He manages to create a
character who is both very sympathetic and slightly suspicious. And
sadly human. Watch his face fall when he realizes that his
intellectual hero has no idea or interest in the fact that he is
writing a novel.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these two heavyweight actors, it's Ellen's story at
bottom, and Zellweger's movie. As her mother withers, she grows.
Although a young professional woman, she is still really a kid as
the movie opens. Her resentments, confusions, disappointments and
insights are all conveyed with admirable under-state-ment. A nice
decision is filming her in extreme close-up during the
interrogation scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``One True Thing'' rises above a simple story to become a very
true thing.

<P>
   There are so many ways to amuse yourself while you watch the
Miss America pageant this Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   You could try to reach a consensus about which contestant is
most likely to be abducted by aliens.
</P>
<P>
   Or which is most convinced that God is on her side.
</P>
<P>
   Or which has spent the most money on electrolysis.
</P>
<P>
   You can work up a point-by-point comparison of pageant hosts
past and present, Bert Parks versus Boomer Esiason.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming you're old enough to remember Bert Parks.
</P>
<P>
   And if you are, you know there's no comparison.
</P>
<P>
   You can compose your own Big Questions for the finalists.
</P>
<P>
   Example: ``If you were Hillary Clinton would you run for
president in 2000?''
</P>
<P>
   Or, ``What would you, as an individual, do to solve the Y2K
problem?''
</P>
<P>
   Or, ``With three games left in the season, the Red Sox have a
four game lead for the American League wild card spot. Explain how
they can lose.''
</P>
<P>
   You can think up interesting platforms that might be adopted by
future contestants.
</P>
<P>
   Pedestrian rights.
</P>
<P>
   Or stamping out phobophobia, the fear of fear itself.
</P>
<P>
   Or changing the name of the pageant to Ms. America.
</P>
<P>
   You can speculate wildly about which contestants have had
cosmetic surgery and what they've had done.
</P>
<P>
   Then you can decide if the results are worth it.
</P>
<P>
   You can try to figure out how many finalists are taking Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   And how many should be taking it.
</P>
<P>
   You can guess who's suffering from PMS.
</P>
<P>
   Or who's nervous about her tattoo showing.
</P>
<P>
   Or who's thinking: There must be an easier way than this to win
a college scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Stage a mini-debate. Resolved: Intelligent life doesn't begin
before age 30.
</P>
<P>
   Have a lively discussion about what exactly people mean when
they use the word ``normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Compare and contrast theories about why it's been 65 years since
someone from New England was crowned Miss America. What does this
say about us as a people?
</P>
<P>
   You can sit there and quietly hope that one of the finalists
will be a ventriloquist.
</P>
<P>
   Or somebody who plays ``Dueling Banjos'' on the accordian.
</P>
<P>
   Or roller skates to ``Amazing Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, when you're disappointed, you can try to guess what the
contestants real talents are, as opposed to the ones on display.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Vermont: cow-tipping.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Delaware: parallel parking.
</P>
<P>
   Miss California: ``X-Files'' trivia champion, Western states
division.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Connecticut: currently memorizing the opening paragraphs of
the 100 greatest novels of 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Mississippi: has assembled the world's largest collection
of deviled egg plates.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Maine: juggles lobsters.
</P>
<P>
   You can try to guess how many contestants are dog people and how
many are cat people.
</P>
<P>
   And how many have actually described themselves as ``people
persons.''
</P>
<P>
   Decide which finalist looks the most different in real life,
i.e., when she's not wearing big hair and makeup.
</P>
<P>
   And which is most likley to be in big hair and make up all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Be grateful that you never had to parade around in a swimsuit in
front of 50 million people.

TED JOHNSON SAYS PATRIOTS DEFENSE OUT OF SYNCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Patriots had decisively beaten the
Indianapolis Colts, 29-6, Sunday night in Foxborough, but you
wouldn't have known by looking at Ted Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   He looked beat. Disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt like we couldn't get into a rhythm on defense,''
said Johnson. ``They were hurting us on first down. And there's no
need for that. We weren't real sound in our rough zone and they
creased us. It's frustrating when you have second and third and
short the whole game. It's no fun. We did what we had to do on
second and third downs, but it seemed on first down, we were just
awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Faulk ran for 127 yards on 29 carries, breaking the
defense's streak of 11 games without allowing a 100-yard rusher.
This was a great source of pride to the defensive players,
particularly those like Johnson who are considered run-stoppers.
</P>
<P>
   The skinny was that the Patriots allowed only one touchdown, and
that was by the second defense. Johnson's group didn't allow a
point. The defense also executed the game plan of forcing Peyton
Manning into mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Johnson has the sense that the Patriots are capable of doing
it all. They must do that this week against the Tennessee Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers' offense had one of its worst days last week in a
13-7 loss to San Diego, but the Patriots still have to contend with
one of the best running backs in the NFL, Eddie George, and the
emerging Steve McNair, who led all quarterbacks in rushing (674
yards) last season and is a threat to escape pursuit and throw on
the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll say it every week,'' said Johnson. ``We have to shut down
that running attack. We know what Eddie is capable of doing. He
might have had an off week last week, but I know they're probably
not happy with their offensive line. We have to shut down Eddie and
make McNair beat us throwing the ball. We have to contain McNair
and not let him get first downs by running the ball on third
down.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair is the best runner among NFL quarterbacks, but he's not
quite at the level of John Elway, who can escape pressure and make
the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still got a lot to learn,'' said Johnson. ``As far as his
ability to run, he's as good as Elway. But as far as creating plays
after he's been contained, he's not in Elway's class yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson thinks the game plan will be a little different on
defense this week. Last week's was more specifically designed to
disrupt Manning. The Patriots had had so much success against Faulk
that they may have overlooked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we got a little bit too aggressive in our thinking (on
Manning), and Marshall was able to crease us,'' said Johnson. ``The
Colts were expecting that from us and they did what they had to do
to protect Marshall. They kept us off balance with the run, and
when it was time for the pass, they decided to mass-protect and
keep Peyton clean. It was tough to get going.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is aware that every time a running back has a big week,
people will point to him as the one who couldn't stop him.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, of course, people look at the running statistics and
they equate that with my play,'' he said. ``I was frustrated
because we'd always had success against Marshall. He's a hell of a
back, don't get me wrong, but he had a really good game against us.
We should have done better than we did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots haven't faced the Oilers since 1993, so none of the
players from the Drew Bledsoe era are familiar with them. All they
have to go by is film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie George has got real explosion in the hole,'' said
Johnson. ``He's not the fastest guy, but he has good quickness and
he explodes out of his cuts really well. I'd say he's not on the
level of Terrell Davis, but he reminds me a little bit of him
because of his leg strength. He has that vision. He's a very good
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is more determined than ever not to let a running back
beat the defense. He thinks the Patriots were fortunate to escape
with a win against Indianapolis, given the way the defense played.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's panicking,'' said Johnson. ``There was some good
play-calling on their part. We got our butts kicked. For Marshall
Faulk to have as many yards as he did was disappointing to me.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, George had his worst day as an Oiler last week,
running for 11 yards on 15 carries. Bad news for the Patriots:
George has produced seven of his 12 100-yard games after losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our running game has been our strong point,'' said George via
conference call from Nashville. ``We'd like to throw more to
balance our attack and keep the defense on their heels. I think the
defense will have to respect Steve's ability to throw downfield and
our ability to run.''
</P>
<P>
   George said his offensive line has done a great job opening
holes the past two years, but that wasn't the case against San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't see too many 10-man fronts against the Chargers. We
didn't have a rhythm. We shot ourselves in the foot with penalties.
We became predictable after a while.''
</P>
<P>
   George respects the Patriots' defense and considers it the
toughest the Oilers have faced. He's already seen film of the
Patriots and considers Willie McGinest, Chris Slade, Johnson,
Lawyer Milloy, and Ty Law the best run-stoppers on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their front seven is incredible,'' said George. ``It's going
to be a challenge for us to get the ball downfield.''
</P>
<P>
   What Johnson would like more than anything is for George to
utter those words after Sunday's game.

THOMAS JUST AS ADEPT AT TEACHING AS PLAYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Brandon Mitchell is standing in a Foxboro
Stadium parking lot, pretending to be Allen Iverson. He is bobbing
his head and flailing his arms, saying, ``Sometimes instead of
trying to run over your man, you gotta finesse him. It's like when
you're playing basketball, you try to fake him one way and go the
other.''
</P>
<P>
   The imaginary crossover dribbles continue for the Patriots
tackle. At one point, the 289-pound Mitchell laughs and says,
``Allen Iverson, baby. You gotta have that crossover.'' Mitchell
then tells you that bulky linemen such as himself sometimes have to
take on the mentality of tightrope-thin point guards like Iverson.
You ever see Iverson, who is roughly half the size of Mitchell,
turn a basketball into a blur in less than a second? The 76ers
guard has a vault of moves. Mitchell wants to be like that.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't always think that way while he was at Texas A&AMP;M. But
when he came to the Patriots last season, he met a man every young
defensive lineman should meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry,'' says Mitchell. ``Henry taught me a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep,'' says the 23-year-old Mitchell. ``Henry's older. He's
been around a long time. He knows a lot. When a question needs to
be answered, everybody asks Henry. And me? I'm right on his hip.
Like, `Hey, Henry, explain it to me, talk to me.' You know? He's
been real patient with me, teaching me a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Thomas, 33, is the oldest Patriot. Older than Bruce
Armstrong and Zefross Moss and Tom Tupa. When he was in Minnesota,
he took aside John Randle and Roy Barker and showed them a few
secrets. He is doing the same with Mitchell and anyone else who
wants to listen. You might think he does this because he wants to
coach when he finishes his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he bellows. ``They work too damn hard, man. When I'm
finished playing this game, I'll be done with it. I'm definitely a
player. You know that old saying? It's better to burn out than fade
away.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas says coaching comes to him naturally. And Mitchell is
right: The man seems to know everything. Sometimes he rides down
Route 1 on a Harley-Davidson he redesigned and rebuilt. He turned
himself into a 19-handicap golfer, down from 27, in one offseason.
Since he lives in Houston, he told himself he needed to take
Spanish lessons (don't ask him anything in Espanol yet; he's
working on it). And he has three guitars in his home because he
wants to learn how to play lead blues guitar, a 277-pound John Lee
Hooker or B.B. King. His wife bought him his third guitar, a
limited-edition Harley-Davidson, for his 32d birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're on display at my house. Everybody comes over and says,
`You can play the guitar?' I say, `Yeah. I can play the first part
of the national anthem,''' Thomas says.
</P>
<P>
   He is told that if he learns just a few chords, he could get by
in a band or something.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to know just chords.'' He frowns. ``That's the
guy who stands in the back and just goes ...'' He begins imitating
a backup guitarist. The point is clear. He wants excellence. It's
the same way for himself and the young men he has watched learn the
defensive line. He tells them all that football is mostly mental,
since everybody in the NFL usually is physically prepared to be
there. He also tells them that if they accept criticism and study,
they can gain an advantage over the men across from them, men
trying to protect quarterbacks and create holes for runners.
</P>
<P>
   Once Randle heard the encouraging words of Thomas, the Viking
became nearly unstoppable. We're talking about unstoppable on the
field. And running his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah,'' Thomas says. ``He's a chatterbox. You get him
charged up and you can't shut him up. What does he say? You don't
want to know. Everything. A few years ago, they were going to try
and mike him for TV. They thought about it and decided it wasn't a
good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Since there are 53 players on NFL rosters, it is clear that
every team needs someone like Thomas. You can point to Pete
Carroll's 15 assistant coaches and assume that players already have
enough instruction. But there are things Thomas sees and
experiences that make him a favorite of the players. Thomas told
Mitchell he didn't have enough moves and needed to expand his
strategy of simply trying to overpower people. Mitchell listened.
He improved so much in the offseason that he helped create true
depth on the line, so much so that popular veteran Mike Jones was
traded to the Rams before the season.
</P>
<P>
   Now Mitchell, Thomas, and the rest of the line have to focus on
the Oilers and running back Eddie George. You can be sure Mitchell
listened to Thomas when the older player said George will be angry
Sunday since he didn't play very well against the Chargers. And
Thomas is sure Mitchell will do all right for himself. And not just
here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brandon Mitchell is going to be _ in the next year or so _
he's going to be a definite force to be reckoned with,'' Thomas
says. ``He has great talent. He's explosive off the line of
scrimmage. He's strong. He's smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Aren't there a lot of guys like that in the NFL?
</P>
<P>
   ``But he wants to do it,'' Thomas says. ``You have a lot of guys
who have the talent and don't want it. You have guys who can rush
the passer, guys who can play the line. He can do both. And he's
very smart. He learns very well from his mistakes and he learns
from, you know, just being coached.''
</P>
<P>
   Take it from Henry. He knows a lot. But if you want to stump
him, ask him about Mitchell's progress. In Spanish.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Would the woman named Leslie who met the writer Alexander
Theroux at a wedding in the winter of 1989, if she reads this,
would she please try to contact us?
</P>
<P>
   We're curious to know what happened, exactly.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because, well, because we recently came across a used copy
of one of Theroux's novels, and inside was a steamy note he sent to
Leslie. Now we have on our hands this story within a story, and so
far we know only this: that Alex and Leslie met briefly nine years
ago, and afterward the writer, enchanted, sent a novel and a note
to her.
</P>
<P>
   We found the novel, titled ``An Adultery,'' at a used-book sale
in Chilmark on Martha's Vineyard, Mass., its back up, in a long row
of worn-out paperbacks. The going price for the 1987 work was the
same as all the other books on the table: 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Leslie, with all my love,'' Alex Theroux had inscribed on
the cover page. We skimmed the pages, realizing we'd never actually
read anything by Theroux but still knew about him: not as well
known as his younger brother, the writer Paul Theroux, but the
author of a number of literary novels acclaimed for their wit,
style, and linquistic command.
</P>
<P>
   Then the handwritten note fell from the book's pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dearest Leslie,'' began the private correspondence, ``I told
you Wednesday I'd send you a book of mine, so here it is.'' Further
on, the writer urged: ``Please stay in touch with me _ I thought
you were the dearest person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Write to me. Let's do something fun!''
</P>
<P>
   Nine years ago the writer had put these words into circulation,
albeit privately, dispatching them on faith, almost like a message
in a bottle. He imagined and surely hoped for a certain kind of
response _ a letter, perhaps, or a phone call (``Hello, Alex? Alex,
this is Leslie....''). But here it was, this message in a book
washing up from a sea of tattered tales at a midsummer sale.
</P>
<P>
   We wondered whatever happened to Alex and Leslie?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Theroux lives alone in a white Victorian house on Cape Cod, and
at the appointed hour he at first didn't hear our knocking at his
door. By this time, a week after discovering the old book, we'd
read up a bit on Theroux and, in particular, the novel, ``An
Adultery.'' Writing for The New York Times in 1987, author Ron
Hansen called Theroux's look at infidelity a ``bitter, brooding,
Jacobean tragedy of being used and getting even. Exhausting,
sexist, perversely cloistered, relentlessly expository, it is
nevertheless a serious and perceptive novel, an odd and hynoptic
pleasure to read, a book you dislike and can't do without,
simultaneously.'' For The Los Angeles Times, author Susan Cheever
praised the novel as ``fascinating and eloquent'' and said
Theroux's prose style was ``orchestrated like a full symphony.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides his half-dozen or so novels, Theroux, now 59, has
written essays, poems, short stories, and plays, and he has taught
at Harvard, Yale, MIT, and Phillips Academy in Andover. Next year
he expects to publish a new novel, ``Laura Warholic, or The Sexual
Intellectual.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Come in, come in,'' he greets us, finally, the author standing
tall in the frame of his front door. He's wearing blue jeans, a
sky-blue T-shirt, and tinted eyeglasses. His unruly hair, once
black, is now rust. He ushers us inside and after a quick tour of a
study and library that are jammed with books, and during which he
points out the neatly typed manuscript of his new novel resting on
a desk, he settles into a chair at a table in the kitchen.

<P>
   ``Leslie?'' he had asked on the telephone when we called and
told him about the note. ``Is that a man or a woman?'' But he, too,
was intrigued and willing to excavate this long-ago moment.
Presented now with our findings, he takes the note and reads it
aloud, right through to the end, slowly turning over the words used
in his come-on to Leslie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a lot of love in my heart for you, even though I talked
to you a few minutes,'' says Theroux, reading the closing to the
note. Now Theroux puts down the card. ``Oh my God.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea who this is.''
</P>
<P>
   No idea?
</P>
<P>
   No idea, he says, beyond the vaguest recollection of a woman at
a wedding. Nothing else, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what's particularly interesting to me is to read a letter
of such semi-passion and not remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Say again?
</P>
<P>
   He continues. ``If you have ardor for someone, but they don't
meet you on that _ don't answer you, for instance, and she surely
did not answer this letter _ how can you even remember them?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is bread upon the water, a potential love of my life,
someone I badly wanted to meet, and maybe wanted to continue
seeing. The overture here is a bit strained, in my opinion, and she
just completely said, bugger it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Theroux is on his feet, the note a fuse, his circuitry now
afire. He disappears into his study and returns in a flash.
``There's a poem I wrote that speaks to this,'' he says as he opens
up the collection and flips through its pages until he finds the
poem he has in mind, ``Contrasting Fruitage.''
</P>
<P>
   He clears his throat.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(Begin poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Would the girl I took to see
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH PACIFIC in 1957, if she reads this,
</P>
<P>
   Please try to contact me.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One rainy Saturday night,
</P>
<P>
   We took my parents' old maroon Dodge.
</P>
<P>
   I had two tickets in the loge.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You had on wicked silver shorts,
</P>
<P>
   Were shy, wore a gardenia in your hair,
</P>
<P>
   Whose scent went down inside me. ...''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ten more sensual stanzas follow, and afterward Theroux says,
``This is about a girl I took to the movies and, seriously, she was
a beautiful Italian girl from Medford where I was born, and I could
never remember her name.'' Indeed the poem ends: ``And I can't
remember your name.''

MANN HOPES HE HAS STAYING POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the fall of 1995 when Cameron Mann participated in
his first NHL training camp, he played on a line with Ted Donato
and Steve Heinze. No one expected Mann to make the Boston roster
then. He had been drafted with the Bruins' fifth pick (fourth
round, No. 99 overall) that year, and after a taste of pro camp, he
was on his way back to his junior team in Peterborough, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday Mann was teamed with Heinze and second-year center Joe
Thornton in an intrasquad scrimmage at the Ristuccia Center in
suburban Wilmington. But now the situation is different. With
Donato, Jason Allison, and Anson Carter sitting out in contract
disputes, Mann has the opportunity to make an impact.
</P>
<P>
   His four camps have seemingly brought him full circle. His first
one was just for the proverbial cup of coffee. His second was
pressure-filled _ he was regarded as the second coming of Cam
Neely, who had been forced to retire. Last year he was a
disappointment and spent most of the season in Providence. This
year Mann wants to stay in Boston, and his play so far bears that
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time that he has to really come forth and make himself
seen,'' said coach Pat Burns. ``He had his year in the American
League and he's coming off high hopes in junior. If he's prepared
to step up, we'll give him the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns is looking for more consistency from the younger players,
including Mann, who in the past looked strong at times and was
invisible at others.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't come up and impress and taper off,'' said Burns.
``You've got to come up and impress and continue to impress. Their
agents will tell them they're great, they're mommies and daddies
will, their girlfriends will, but I might not necessarily tell them
they're that great.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann admits that in the past, he hasn't reached his potential.
Most of the reason, he said, had to do with focus and how he
handled pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to let some little things bother me, but now that I've
got my feet wet, I've got more confidence in my game and that I can
play,'' said Mann, who collected 21 goals and 47 points in 71 games
with Providence. ``Maybe I had started doing some things that
weren't my game (in an effort to be noticed). I've got to play my
game; that's what I have to bring to the table. Maybe I was putting
too much pressure on myself, but I've learned a lot these past
three camps. Last year was a bad year but it was a a good year at
the same time. I was on a losing team in Providence. You don't want
to be there again. You realize how bad you want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann, 21, was eased into the Boston mix last season for a short
time. He was brought up from Dec. 18 to Jan. 4 and had one assist
in eight games. He was then recalled for the playoffs as a taxi
squad player.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first game last year, I played against Philly,'' he said.
``It was a dream come true.''
</P>
<P>
   That stint and watching what went into his teammates'
preparation for the postseason whet Mann's appetite for a full
season in Boston. His performance in the early going of training
camp has him on track for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're never satisfied,'' he said. ``I can say I've worked
hard and the bounces have gone my way. I'm enjoying myself out
there. I'm joking around a little bit more, just trying to stay
focused and relaxed. It's a big opportunity. If the spot is there,
I'm ready to take it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it puts a little pressure on the guys who are out right
now to want to get in there because maybe the spot is being
jeopardized. I don't know for sure but I hope they come back.
They're a big part of the team. In the meantime, I'm capitalizing
on the opportunity.''

NATIONAL STUDY FOCUSES ON HEREDITARY PROSTATE CANCER IN AFRICAN
AMERICANS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LESLIE SOWERS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Horace Woodard was not experiencing pain. His family doctor had
done the suggested screenings for prostate cancer. And an
ultrasound revealed nothing amiss. He felt fairly secure about his
health, though his family's death toll from this disease always
nagged at the back of his mind.
</P>
<P>
   His nephew, Raleigh Woodard, 54, didn't like the odds and the
slight, but unexplained elevation in his uncle's PSA (prostate
specific antigen) test. Both men had watched so many other family
members suffer and die.
</P>
<P>
   They name fathers, sons, uncles, nephews, cousins, who have been
lopped sadly and too soon from the family tree. All shared a
familial form of prostate cancer that seems to hit particularly
hard in African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   At Raleigh's urging, Horace sought a second opinion about his
prostate condition at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, where Raleigh
had already had prostate cancer surgery. As a result of a thorough
screening, Horace learned his prostate gland was, indeed,
cancerous. Today, after recent surgery to remove it, the
68-year-old Woodard announces he is ``flying good.'' He no longer
has that fear nagging at him.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon told him his prostate gland was the size of a
baseball when removed. Normally, this gland that produces the fluid
that carries and nourishes sperm cells, is about the size of a
walnut.
</P>
<P>
   Both Woodards and some of their relatives participated in a
study of hereditary prostate cancer in African-American men ongoing
in seven cities, including Houston. Several local institutions are
participating. The $3.5 million national research project seeks to
identify the gene or genes involved in the familial form of the
disease. The ultimate goal is development of a genetic test to
identify those at high risk.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard appreciates the irony that participating in a medical
study led to his life-saving treatment. Memory of the infamous
Tuskegee Syphilis Study still fuels misgivings in the black
community about participation in medical research. In the Tuskegee
study, black men with syphilis were misled and deliberately left
untreated for decades, leading to a congressional investigation in
1973.
</P>
<P>
   This resulted in federal regulations that incorporate ethical
standards for human research subjects, and a $10 million settlement
for the Tuskegee victims. Nonetheless, the erosion of trust has
never been fully repaired.
</P>
<P>
   To promote trust for the prostate cancer study, funded by the
Human Genome Institute and Howard University, the lead
investigators have sought minority involvement at all levels.
</P>
<P>
   African-American urologists were recruited. Blood samples and
DNA extractions are sent to Howard University, a leading black
institution. From clerical to administrative to scientific staff,
the bulk of the study personnel are themselves African-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``The familial form of prostate cancer strikes earlier, more
aggressively and at a higher grade in African-Americans,'' said Dr.
Curtis Pettaway, principal investigator in Houston and a physician
at M.D. Anderson. ``We'd like to find out why.''
</P>
<P>
   The study seeks confirmation of earlier research findings
linking an area on chromosome 1 with the familial form of prostate
cancer in African-Americans. It will also attempt to narrow the
area of the link to a specific gene or genes. The study supports a
White House initiative announced earlier this year to eliminate the
disparities in health between racial and ethnic minorities and
white Americans by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Pettaway said prostate cancer is curable when it is confined to
the prostate gland. This makes earlier, asymptomatic detection
crucial. But since the cancer may not be detectable until men reach
their 40s, Pettaway said the development of a genetic test would
improve survival rates by earlier identification of those at high
risk. They could then seek earlier, more frequent testing and make
lifestyle changes that promote cancer prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Pettaway said the hereditary link might be responsible for
perhaps 3 percent of all cases of prostate cancer, a disease which
will develop in an estimated 184,000 men this year. About 39,000
will die from it. More than twice as many African-American men are
expected to die than Caucasian men. Hispanic men are also at
significantly higher risk of being diagnosed with advanced disease,
according to the Prostate Cancer Education Council.
</P>
<P>
   The council advocates a digital rectal exam performed together
with the PSA blood test as the most effective way to detect this
cancer at an early, potentially curable stage. Since early prostate
cancer has no symptoms, following screening guidelines based on age
and race may help save lives.
</P>
<P>
   Because black men die more frequently with this cancer, the
American Cancer Society recommends they begin getting annual tests
at age 40, compared to 50 for white men. Yet only one in four black
men get annual tests for prostate cancer, compared to one in two
white men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most members of the community are not educated to prostate
cancer running strongly in families,'' said Raleigh Woodard. ``They
are blind to the situation. When you feel pain, it's too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Both uncle and nephew have made certain their own sons have been
screened early, and they work on friends and acquaintances as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has hit so many males in our family, and now another
generation is starting,'' said Raleigh. ``Now, maybe they can come
up with a solution. I'm willing to participate because it might
help my two sons or maybe somebody else's family.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettaway hopes to recruit at least 14 high-risk families over
the two-year study period. Families should have three to four
members with prostate cancer available for testing. Physicians at
Baylor College of Medicine, Kelsey-Seybold Clinics and MacGregor
Medical Association will also be recruiting participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that having African-Americans at all levels will
dispel the myths about blacks participating in clinical trials,''
Pettaway said.
</P>
<P>
   Study participants will receive prostate screening, any
necessary follow-ups, biopsy if recommended and necessary medical
attention, once enrolled and accepted. Call Pamela Roberson,
713-792-4639 if interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a lot of nephews coming along,'' said Raleigh
Woodard. ``That's the reason I'm not afraid or ashamed to
participate. And I'm glad to be alive.'' &QL;

 UNDATED: ... remember your name.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do you see the connection? he asks. We do. But Alex cannot even
recall Leslie, so haven't we hit the end of the line? Maybe not.
Theroux keeps going. He is full of possibilities. Ever the
novelist, he fills in the empty space, creating all kinds of
storylines and what-ifs to explain Leslie's failure to respond _
and we are swept up in the sheer pleasure of a Therouxvian
performance. It's a monologic rumination on memory, on ardor, on
the artist, and unrequited romance, on writers and the hurt of
coming across rejected books. In Theroux's hands, stories harvest
stories, and so we decide to kick back, loosen our gumshoes and let
our own orginal storyline metamorphose.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
-------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what's interesting?'' Theroux says, grasping the book
he actually cannot remember ever sending to Leslie. ``This novel
(``An Adultery'') is a very dark book.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very dark and labyrinthian novel, psychological
darkness. She might well have read the novel _ I don't know if she
liked me to begin with or even thought about it _ but after reading
the novel, she might have thought, `God, that's like going into a
black hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know another interesting detail, since we're rinsing out
this, squeezing out this sponge: She kept the letter! She kept the
letter, probably as a bookmark! There's another great question you
could ask: Was the letter kept as a bookmark, which is hideous, or
as a momento?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because there is a huge difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, sinking into his chair, Theroux sighs deeply.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the fact that she never got back in touch with me is _
typical. And sad. You know, it's like a tennis ball not coming back
over the net; there's no game.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been a player in many a game, he acknowledges, although
adding he has never married. ``I was thinking of the movie, `Love
Is a Many Splendored Thing.' If I can make an analogy of myself to
Jennifer Jones, who's this Eurasian doctor, and she meets William
Holden and she says she's just involved in her work, that she's
given her heart to her work, and that's kind of the case with me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really go out with anybody. I just write, and, I mean,
I would like to meet some nice person ...''
</P>
<P>
   To him, the overture becomes metaphor for the risk-taking that
characterizes artists generally. ``It's really that the artist is
always flirting with the possible. It's kind of like living on the
edge, because _ have you read ``Death In Venice'' by any chance?
It's really like that writer Gustave von Aschenbach, lives in
Munich and goes down to Venice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's entirely possible that at this wedding, or this social
event, I had met this person, that I was just _ she might not have
even looked at me twice. But it might have been a total projection
of what I wanted, of pursuing beauty in a way, if I can make the
analogy, that Aschenbach is pursuing that beautiful boy (Tadzio) in
that story.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, it's the pursuit of El Dorado.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he's done, Theroux displays a full arc of emotions:
irked, offended, dismissive, and comic. He cross-references himself
into movies and novels, a dissertation that practically needs
footnotes for the unread.
</P>
<P>
   He places Leslie's book into a larger context. ``Every writer
has had the ignominious experience of seeing his book under less
than illustrious conditions, in a bin, or selling for a quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   In his own past, there was the time a Cambridge bookseller
disclosed to him that a teaching colleague of Theroux's, to whom
Theroux had given an inscribed copy of his first novel, had come
into the store and sold the book for $2.50. ``You have to
understand that preceeding my giving this man the book was a year
of his hectoring me for it,'' exclaims Theroux. ``So I thought it
was particularly humiliating _ then I was thinking, then wracking
my brain, because this is the kind of ontological worry you have:
Did I offend him? I mean why would anybody _ $2.50! It's not even
enough for a Buddy's Sirloin Pit hamburger.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, there's the discarded-book story making the
rounds in writing circles involving his brother, Paul, and V.S.
Naipaul. ``Authors can get very upset. I don't know if you're aware
of my brother Paul and Naipaul?'' In his new book about the two
writers' long friendship _ and the end of it _ Paul Theroux
describes the betrayal felt upon discovering that a novel he'd
inscribed to Naipaul as a gift in 1968 was being marketed by a
bookseller.
</P>
<P>
   But Alex Theroux circles back to the intrigue presented by his
own chance encounter with a woman, and now, no matter what Leslie
might really have thought of him, her failure to respond is a cold
fact that eventually provokes Theroux.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lack of imagination,'' he decides. ``I think, on a
literary level, that woman Leslie should have responded to me, if
only to just drive down that highway for five minutes, see what I
was about. If I sound like anger, I'm not in the slightest bit. But
I've always thought the lack of imagination, not talking to the
person in a given circumstance, is a real flaw ... It's spiritual
sloth, it's lack of vision, it's an amazing inability to be
alive!''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the hour, the Therouxvian deconstruction has been,
as critics have called his prose, exhausting, odd and hypnotic.
``You know, this is like seeing a wedding gown: For Sale, Never
Used.'' Like that wedding gown, a mystery hovers about Leslie _
still _ as our encounter with Theroux has turned out to be about
nothing and everything, simultaneously. Thus our call for Leslie to
contact us remains outstanding, just as Theroux long ago importuned
in a poem for his date from 1957 to get in touch with him.
</P>
<P>
   But for now an unfinished story is finished. Leaving Theroux, he
refuses our bid to give him back the book and note. ``You know what
you should do with this book?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You should keep this book, and when you write the article, put
it in here and just keep it in your shelves, and, are you married?
When you get married and have kids, sell the book. For your kids,
sell the book. The book is going to be worth some money, because my
ship is going to come in next year, I promise, and the book will be
worth some money. That's what I would do with the book.''
</P>
<P>
   He's smiling, and so he's asked if he makes the same prediction
for his El Dorado each time he has a new book coming out.
</P>
<P>
   He confesses, yes indeed. ``I'm long overdue.''

BYRON NELSON: A GOLFING LEGEND _ AND A GENTLEMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   CANTON, Mass. _ The swing that rarely failed him, so automatic
and so fluid, is a distant memory, but the dignity that has defined
his life is very much present. He is, at 86, the ultimate gentleman
in a sports world that has too few of them, an ambassador who
represents so much of what is great about golf.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Nelson, his passion for golf dating back to 1925, hasn't
competed competitively for more than 50 years, but his spirit has
never been stronger. ``I love the game, love to be around it,'' he
said. ``Always have, ever since I first played when I was 13.''
</P>
<P>
   The man affectionately called Lord Byron graced the
Massachusetts golf landscape Wednesday, a visitor to Ponkapoag Golf
Course, where his stepson, John Tangeman, is a member. Had it not
been for an accident in his woodworking shop, Nelson would have
teed it up, as he has in other visits; instead, his left thumb
wrapped in a bandage thanks to 16 stitches, he was content to
reminisce, to answer questions, to watch his stepson play golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does he ask you for advice?'' Nelson was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course. Oh, sure he does,'' said Nelson. ``But he plays
pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   Polite praise from a man who has spent his life around this
game; a man, it must be said, who at one time came closer than
anyone to doing the impossible _ playing perfect golf. It was 1945.
Between March 8 and August 4 Nelson won every tournament he entered
_ 11 straight. No one has come close and doubtful anyone ever will.
In this summer when a treasured home run record got a double
smashing, let it be said with confidence that Nelson's feat of 53
years ago is not only the sport's most remarkable, it is
unbreakable.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson agrees, but he is so very humble, he says the record will
survive not because the players aren't good enough, but because the
sports world in 1998 is far different from 1945. ``There's so much
pressure today,'' said Nelson. ``I feel sorry for Tiger Woods. I
really do. He needs an escort to get to the practice tee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter Jacobsen won two straight tournaments a couple of years
ago and he told me, `I don't know how you did it. (The pressure) is
already getting to me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But it never bothered me. Golf wasn't that big back then. When
I won the Masters in 1937, I went to the locker room and there was
one reporter. One. O.B. Keeler. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are those who will try and discredit Nelson's incredible
feat and tell you the competition was thin, that the war years took
some great players (Ben Hogan in particular) away from the Tour. To
those cynics, there is only one response, and it came from Jackie
Burke years ago, after he had won four straight Tour stops, the
closest anyone has come to matching Nelson: ``I don't care if he
was playing against orangutans, winning 11 straight is amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally incredible is the fact that Nelson, a year removed from
11 straight wins and 18 in the season, called it quits, retiring at
34 to a ranch just north of Fort Worth that is still home. ``I had
set goals in my mind. I decided it was important to win all the
major tournaments (the 1939 US Open; two Masters; two PGAs) and I
had done that. But I didn't make any money.''
</P>
<P>
   So he became a cattle farmer and lived happily away from the
rigors of travel and competition. But he has never really left the
game of golf, for which the sport should be entirely grateful. We
know Ken Venturi is. So, too, Tom Watson. And Phil Mickelson makes
three pros who owe many thanks to the quiet gentleman who has
walked with golf's giants, from Bobby Jones to Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Forever, though, Nelson will be linked with Hogan. They grew up
in Fort Worth, caddied at the same course, got into pro golf around
the same time, and for many years they and Sam Snead made up the
sport's greatest trio, each so very different. Hogan was the
recluse, Snead flamboyant, Nelson the consummate gentleman.
</P>
<P>
   While they were not the closest of friends, Nelson and Hogan
shared moments that will live forever in golf folklore. Their
Masters playoff in 1942 (Nelson won), for instance. Or their
four-ball match against a couple of amateurs in the 1950s, for
another.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Lowery, who caddied for Francis Ouimet in his epic US Open
triumph in 1913, owned a hugely successful auto dealership in the
San Francisco area in the 1950s, and two of his employees were
Venturi, then an amateur, and Harvey Ward. ``Venturi had beaten
Ward in the finals of the San Francisco City Championship,'' said
Nelson, whose friendship with Lowery was the reason he came out of
retirement just to play in the Crosby Pro-Am. (Even today, Nelson
keeps in touch with Margaret Lowery, Eddie's widow.)
</P>
<P>
   At a dinner party, Lowery was talking great things about Venturi
and Ward. ``He said they could beat anybody. George Coleman, one of
Eddie's friends and a friend of mine and Ben's, said: `Anybody.'
And Eddie said: `Anybody.'''
</P>
<P>
   The wheels started turning, said Nelson, and Coleman went to
work. He called Hogan at a hotel (``Of course, Ben wasn't at the
party. Not Ben.'') and the guys from Fort Worth accepted the
challenge. ``George told Eddie he had two guys, and Eddie asked
who. George said, `Hogan and Nelson.' There was quiet for a moment,
then Eddie said, `They'll beat them, too.'''
</P>
<P>
   And they nearly did, as the match went to the 18th hole at
Cypress Point and wasn't decided until Hogan made a birdie on top
of Ward's birdie to clinch a 1-up win. ``Best four-ball match I
ever saw,'' said Nelson. ``The four of us were 27 under. We didn't
get our first lead until the 10th hole when Ben holed out for an
eagle-3. Ben and I shot 59.''
</P>
<P>
   His life is one great memory after another, nearly all of the
details intact in his razor-sharp mind.
</P>
<P>
   The 1939 playoff loss to Henry Picard in the PGA Championship?
``I was 1-up and put a chip shot to about 3 feet on the 36th hole.
Picard knocked it to about a foot, absolutely stymied me. Now I'm
trying to be as honest as possible, though losers always
exaggerate.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1937 British Open, his first appearance in that event? ``I
finished fourth and won $187. It cost me $3,000 to make that trip
and take a month off from my job at a club in Reading, Pa.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1939 Massachusetts Open at Worcester CC? His good friend,
Jugs McSpaden, was the head pro and Nelson laughs: ``The only
reason he invited me was because it was his home course and he
figured he could beat me.''
</P>
<P>
   But McSpaden, who made himself famous for finishing second to
Nelson in many of those memorable 11 tournaments, came up short.
``On the 16th hole we were tied, but I holed out from a bunker.''
More laughter. ``I stayed with him and ate his food and beat him.
Jugs was a great friend.''
</P>
<P>
   He is a legend, yes, but he's a legend from an era long before
ESPN and teleconferences, pregame shows, and talk radio. Certainly,
Nelson was a legend long before million-dollar contracts were
handed out like politicians hand out fliers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``In 1945, I got one endorsement that year,'' said Nelson.
``Wheaties, for $200.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson let that sink in. Years later, he said, he met people who
told him Pete Rose had just signed with Wheaties. ``For $880,000.''
Nelson laughed heartily, not a hint of bitterness in the warped
irony: A player who disgraced his sport being paid so much more
than a player who added so much class to his.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Nelson appreciates the great life he has had, and
continues to live. He shared ``50 years and 4 months'' with his
beloved first wife, Louise, who died in 1985. About a year later he
married Peggy, and the two make quite a team; yesterday she drove
the cart as they watched her son and some friends play golf.
</P>
<P>
   Not much of a fuss was made about Nelson's appearance. A few
women two fairways over yelled out their best wishes and some
gentlemen stopped by to tell Nelson that it was their pleasure to
meet him. He smiled, shook hands, and somehow you got the feeling
that Nelson felt the honor was his.
</P>
<P>
   True legends are like that.

HURT BY COMMENTS, DE LA HOYA WANTS TO MAKE CHAVEZ PAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LAS VEGAS _ It is not often that The Businessman takes things
personally. There is no room for such emotion in Oscar De La Hoya's
world because such a thing could blow the deal and everything he
does and says is about creating the next deal.
</P>
<P>
   Everything, it seems, but what he has been saying this week and
plans to do Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Then The Businessman will fill the Thomas and Mack Center with
friends and enemies, both of whom will be there to see him destroy
Julio Cesar Chavez, the once proud Mexican champion who has not
been what he used to be for a long time. Certainly, Chavez wasn't
two years ago when De La Hoya sliced him open 90 seconds into their
first meeting by hitting his eyebrow with a jab that caused a cut
sustained in sparring several weeks earlier to split wide open.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez had hidden the injury from Nevada boxing officials with
makeup because he wanted the more than $8 million he figured to
earn and because he believed he was still Chavez and De La Hoya was
merely a mijo, a small boy from the barrios of East Los Angeles who
meant nothing to him but a payday.
</P>
<P>
   But the mijo busted him up, breaking his nose and leaving his
face a sea of red before the bout was stopped in the fourth round.
When it was over, he had seemingly also broken Chavez's heart
because instead of acting like a fallen champion, he acted like a
spoiled brat, refusing to give De La Hoya even an ounce of respect.
</P>
<P>
   That night, Chavez dismissed De La Hoya with a wave of his hand
at a postfight press conference, then launched into a litany of
absurd excuses.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed the loss on his sparring partners, his unwillingness
to postpone the fight, and even his young son, who Chavez said
reopened the cut the week before the bout while roughhousing with
him. All these things had conspired against him, Chavez whined, but
De La Hoya?
</P>
<P>
   ``He hits like nothing,'' Chavez snapped.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the tirade, De La Hoya was an afterthought, something
he had not been since long before he won a gold medal at the 1992
Olympics in Barcelona. He did not like it, and unfortunately for
Chavez, he has not forgotten it, which is why he insisted this week
that Friday night's pay-per-view match for the World Boxing Council
welterweight title is not a business meeting, as most of his other
fights have seemed to be.
</P>
<P>
   This fight is not about a championship or the $6 million purse
he figures to gross or even about the prospect he and Chavez might
set a pay-per-view record for sales of a non-heavyweight title
fight.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, such things consume De La Hoya, who once modeled a
line of sportswear bearing his name a day before he was to defend
one of his titles. But this time boxing's Ultimate Businessman
insists it is not about business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is personal,'' the undefeated (28-0, 23 knockouts) De La
Hoya said Wednesday. ``The first fight, I went in with respect for
him. This fight, I'll show no respect. I'll not be satisfied unless
I have a devastating knockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe this guy had the nerve to make all those
excuses. If he was a real champion, he would have said, `Oscar beat
me tonight, but there'll be another night.' He was my idol once,
but I found out he wasn't what I thought he was. I didn't lose
respect for his accomplishments but I have no reason to respect him
outside the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is bad blood between us. I don't respect the guy. He's
not my next opponent. He's my next victim. That's the way I see the
guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to know what kind of person he was the first fight, and
I just don't like the guy. He's very arrogant. That's his choice,
but I don't have to like it. He don't like me and I don't like him.
Inside that ring, I'll hate him more.''
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to believe such words are coming from the mouth
of boxing's Golden Boy. Although his image has been tarnished in
recent months with the birth of a son out of wedlock and news that
his promoter, Bob Arum, believes he has enough of a gambling
problem to ask Las Vegas casinos to hold him to a $25,000 limit, De
La Hoya never speaks this way.
</P>
<P>
   He has always honored his opponents publicly _ the greats like
Chavez and Pernell Whitaker and the near greats like James Leija
and the not so great like Patrick Charpentier and David Kamau. All
have been covered with De La Hoya's charm, both before they fought
him and after he destroyed them.
</P>
<P>
   All, that is, until now, because this time something is
different. This time the mijo wants to be a man, so he brags that
he will destroy a fighter who once was his idol.
</P>
<P>
   He says he will knock out Chavez not for a 10 count but ``for a
20 count,'' to prove to him who is the better man. From most
fighters, such talk would mean nothing. It would be what you expect
of them, what they do in the days leading up to a confrontation
like this to steel themselves as much as to con their opponent.
Most often, it is meaningless air.
</P>
<P>
   But Oscar De La Hoya is not most fighters. He is the sport's
rising ATM machine, a fighter everyone wants to do battle with
because along with the beating comes a big payday and a smile.
</P>
<P>
   He is, as he says, his own conglomerate, a man-child at 25 who
made $38 million last year and figures to make more this year not
because he can fight but because he can smile and fight and charm
and fight and model and fight and talk and fight and sell and fight
and persuade women to buy pay-per-view to watch him fight.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, he does all these things before a fight, but this time
he has not. This time he has glowered. This time he seemed nervous
at the final press conference and filled with something bad for
Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   This night, he says, he will come to the Thomas and Mack with
bad intentions. He will go there to do only one thing. Not to fight
the legend of Julio Cesar Chavez, but to destroy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of fighters can't admit it's over,'' De La Hoya said.
``It's tough to accept. Being on top so long, you don't want to
admit you're losing it. That's when they start to get hurt. A
fighter like Chavez will never admit he lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking nothing for granted. I'm well prepared. But I'm
faster. I'm stronger. I've prepared like for no other fight. The
first fight, there was more respect because of his name and his
record, but now I know what kind of fighter he is. I've felt his
power and seen his speed. There won't be any respect for him this
time. He says he's ready to die up in that ring. Good. I'm dying to
knock him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``After this fight, Julio Cesar Chavez should retire. He knows
this is his last big event. He knows that. After this, it's over
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   A businessman doesn't talk like that about his partner unless
they are to become partners in only one thing. Pain.
</P>
<P>
   That is the business boxing's Ultimate Businessman will be about
Friday night. The pain business ... on the inflicting end.

THE PROPER DEGREE OF PANIC 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the rush to describe the recent turmoil as simply a fit of
collective market irrationality, it's easy to overlook some
important truths that underlie what's happened, not just in Asia
but also in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The best example of this is Brazil. Last week Brazil looked like
it was on the verge of devaluing its currency. This week the
country has enjoyed a remarkable stock-market rally that's sent the
market up 45 percent in three days. (A rally that itself smacks of
some hysteria, it has to be said.)
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is obviously key to the entire future of Latin America,
and for that matter of the global economy. And under President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the country has made a remarkable
recovery from the days of hyperinflation and high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, the punishment Brazil has taken at the hands of
currency traders in the past few months must have been difficult to
bear. And it's understandable why economists like Joseph Stiglitz
of the World Bank would argue that investors willing to put their
money into Brazil are demanding interest rates too high for the
small amount of risk involved.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that Brazil in some sense was asking for
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, after pushing through a constitutional
amendment that would allow him to run for president again, Cardoso
promised to push through spending cuts (or, more unlikely, tax
increases) that would trim the country's budget deficit. Almost
none of those cuts have been realized, in part because Cardoso is
in an election campaign and doesn't want to alienate anyone.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Brazil's budget deficit is now 9 percent of the
country's GDP. The equivalent for the United States would be a
budget deficit of $630 billion. With a deficit that size, is it
really surprising that interest rates are high, or that currency
traders are skeptical of the value of the Brazilian real? For all
the good that he's done, Cardoso has essentially been living on
IOUs for the past year. At some point those were bound to come due.

WHY ECONOMISTS AREN'T ALL RICH 
</HEADLINE>
  By HERBERT STEIN 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You are falling into a common error (if you) think that
economists know how to manage investments in the stock market, or
other markets, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   I was recently at a party where there was a superstar, whose
name I will not mention, but who undoubtedly had a very large
income. I was introduced to him as an economist, and he immediately
said to me, ``If you're an economist tell me why I don't have more
money.'' I tried to comfort him.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists have been good private investors. J.M. Keynes is
said to have been one of them. I have heard of a few living ones
who have made a lot of money by their investments. But there are
also a lot of liquor storeowners and anesthesiologists who have
made a lot of money by their investments.
</P>
<P>
   If economists, qua economist, knew how to make a lot of money
there wouldn't be so many of them grading papers in obscure
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   I don't remember ever seeing the name of an economist on the
list of the 100 richest people. David Rockefeller may have been an
exception. He had a Ph.D. in economics from the University of
Chicago. But that isn't how he became rich.
</P>
<P>
   Markets and the economy are two different things. Maybe the
point is that economists are not capable of talking about anybody's
money but are capable, or feel themselves capable, of talking about
everybody's money. Everybody's money being, of course, the subject
of fiscal and monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   I often wonder whether we are really capable of talking about
that. But everything is relative. Economists may not be very good
at talking about fiscal and monetary policy; they are just better
at it than other people.

BACK IN VOGUE, DESSERT TAKES THE CAKE AT WEDDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Sept. 20)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ It's Saturday morning of Labor Day weekend and
wedding bells are ringing.
</P>
<P>
   Which means this is crunch time for Dan Raymond, the one-man
wedding cake decorator at Vanilla Bean Bakery. He has booked 26
cakes for the weekend, with 16 of his butter cream creations due to
be delivered this day.
</P>
<P>
   A disco beat from a portable CD player sends waves of energy
throughout the ground floor of the anonymous red brick building, a
former garage, across from the Fourth Street bakery. This is
Raymond's shop. At 10 a.m. he has been on the job for four hours, a
workday that promises to continue through the early evening.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond sits in front of a white-frosted cake, a parchment paper
cone for applying frosting in his right hand, his wrist squeezing
in rhythm to the lively disco sound as he applies a ruffle border
to one tier of the cake. The faded tattoo of a dragon on his right
forearm pulses with each squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   ``The faster the beat,'' he says, ``the faster I decorate.''
</P>
<P>
   In less than 15 minutes he will add butter cream string and lace
to the border, pearls, and plastic columns coated with frosting on
which the next tier of the cake will rest. The finished product, a
chocolate mousse five-tier traditional Simple Treasury-style white
cake, all 90-degree angles, is not scheduled to be delivered until
4:30.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to give it a personal touch, so it has a little oomph
to it,'' Raymond says, putting flourishing decorations on one of
the layers. ``I don't want it to be just roses.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the cake is the second most important thing to the
wedding. The bride should be the most important. It's her day, and
I'm not trying to upstage her. But the cake is the showpiece of the
room.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't dismiss Raymond's observation as mere artist's pride.
Wedding cakes, a symbol of both bounty and good luck, have been a
centerpiece of wedding celebrations since the 17th century, when a
French pastry chef invented the first tiered, edible cake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the piece de resistance at every wedding reception,''
says Millie Martini Bratten, editor-in-chief of Bride's magazine.
``The cake is very, very important to people. They're eager to have
something beautiful and memorable and something the guests will
comment on.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanilla Bean Bakery, like most cake suppliers, charges on the
estimated number of servings, with the price increasing based on
extra decorations requested. Vanilla Bean's basic price range is
$1.35 to $3 per person; its cakes for a 250-person reception
generally cost between $500 and $600. If this sounds like a pretty
penny for dessert, consider that in 1998 the average cost for a
wedding of 200 of your closest relatives and friends is $19,104,
Bratten said.
</P>
<P>
   Before hiring Raymond three years ago, Vanilla Bean owners
Buster and Debbie Alberino decorated all of their wedding cakes
themselves. It was tedious and time-consuming for the Alberinos,
whose business was growing quickly.
</P>
<P>
   They needed to find someone who could turn their cakes into
treasures to remember. They found Raymond, and it has by both
accounts been a solid marriage, with the wedding cake business more
than doubling during the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   In August they turned out 147 wedding cakes, and that might have
been a mere warm-up. September and October are among the busiest
months of the year for weddings. This particular part of the bakery
has been so successful that later this fall the Alberinos will open
a wedding cake gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt Dan could bring something more to the table for us. In
the industry, his peers know he's very good,'' Buster observes.
``He's very professional. He's seen everything and he can handle
the stress and the pressure very well.''
</P>
<P>
   As organized and efficient as he is artistic, Raymond, 35, is
also the bakery's administrator for all wedding cakes. He takes the
orders, preferably at least three months in advance, and works with
the bride-to-be and her family as they try to determine exactly
what style of cake they desire as well as how they want it
decorated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brides of today, for the most part, know what they want, and I
think Martha Stewart is a major reason why,'' he explains. ``She
does a book every year on weddings and wedding cakes, and it's had
a huge impact. Most of the families that walk in here have a good
idea what they want for a wedding cake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, I think Martha Stewart has helped make the wedding cake
important again. I think not so long ago it didn't used to be such
an important issue.''

 &HT;    $500 MILLION-PLUS IN THE HOLE, US BUSINESSES MULL FATE IN RUSSIA
 &HT;    (ED: With optional add beginning at 750 words.)
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (f) Financial
categories.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ American and other multinational corporations doing
business in Russia have lost nearly $500 million so far in the
country's severe economic crisis, and some companies could pull out
of the shriveling market altogether.
</P>
<P>
   In a disastrous month that began with the ruble's devaluation on
Aug. 17, many American and other Western firms -- including
SmithKline Beecham, R.J. Reynolds International and Proctor &AMP;
Gamble -- have been forced to lay off hundreds of Russian employees
and stop bringing goods to the Russia market because of the
paralyzed banking system.
</P>
<P>
   The situation could turn bleaker if Russia's new government
implements protectionist measures and Soviet-style currency
controls being considered to weather the crisis, business leaders
in Moscow warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want us here or not?'' Scott Blacklin, president of the
495-member American Chamber of Commerce in Russia, told a news
conference Thursday. It was a blunt message for Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov as he continues to form a new government and
construct a crisis plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We -- all of us -- believed in the reform process, believed
that real progress was being made, and it turned out that we were
wrong,'' Blacklin said.
</P>
<P>
   The further fall Thursday of the ruble did nothing to change
attitudes. The ruble ended the day at an official rate of about 15
to the dollar, and traded as low as 17 on the street. The Russian
currency was 6.2 to the dollar in mid-August before the crisis
erupted.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's central bank, now headed by a Soviet-era banker Viktor
Gerashchenko, announced that it would print more rubles to pay
state debts and wages to public employees, raising fears that
rampant inflation could follow.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers
told the House International Relations Committee Thursday that
Western creditors would only advance fresh money to Russia if it
fulfilled reform pledges.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Russia authorities) must resist pressures to spend and
lend which will doom the economy to another bout of high, perhaps
hyperinflation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Banking and finance companies have been hardest hit by the
economic crisis so far, laying off as much as 75 percent of their
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a lot of empty office space,'' said Neil
Greer, chief executive officer of Regent European Securities Ltd.,
which has fired about 40 percent of its Moscow staff.
</P>
<P>
   The makers of consumer goods and food products also have
suffered, mainly because their Russian distributors have been
unable to pay them since their money has been frozen in Russian
bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The situation has prompted foreign companies in Russia to
essentially suspend business -- selling off inventories already in
the country, but holding off on further incoming shipments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've stopped importing stock,'' said Paul Carter, of
SmithKline Beecham, the cosmetic and pharmaceutical giant that
imports Aquafresh toothpaste and other products to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of Russians still want to buy products. But the company
is currently owed $20 million by its Russian distributors.
</P>
<P>
   SmithKline Beecham is not alone. About 50 major companies have
lost nearly half a billion dollars in Russia since the crisis
began, according to a chamber of commerce survey.
</P>
<P>
   The losses already could reach into the billions of dollars
figuring unpaid debts and the decline of potential sales for the
hundreds of American companies in Russia, Blacklin said.
</P>
<P>
   RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.'s R.J. Reynolds International tobacco
unit, which has invested more than $400 million opening production
facilities in Russia since 1992, told Reuters news agency that it
has temporarily ceased making cigarettes at its factories there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you today there's no production going on,''
spokesman Adam Byran-Brown said, adding that he could not say when
production would restart. ``There's very little trade going on.
We're still selling cigarettes, but it is a struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Proctor &AMP; Gamble, the No. 1 advertiser last year
on Russian television, declined to be interviewed. But the
consumer-products company said in a statement that it, too,
``halted shipments'' for a period and that the economic turmoil
``made it very difficult to determine the appropriate pricing.''
</P>
<P>
   A multinational like Coca-Cola Co., which has built a network of
regional bottling plants in Russia, is more immune from the
problems than a company which must import to replenish its
inventory. But a spokesman acknowledged that it also has suffered
problems in the turbulent market.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   There is little that American and other foreign companies can do
to recover the money owed them. The Russian court system is flawed
and overburdened, meaning it is unlikely that firms could
successfully sue to seek money owed them.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian banking freeze also means that some foreign and
Russian companies have had difficulty paying their local employees,
whose salaries were directly deposited in Russian accounts before
the crisis and now cannot be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a business point of view, it is simply horrible. We've
worked years training local staff, building relationships with
Russian clients, earning trust and learning who to trust. Now
that's all vanishing,'' said the Moscow head of a Fortune 500
company doing business in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Yet one segment of the market is relishing the crisis. Shipping
and moving companies say they are turning away business because
demand is so great.
</P>
<P>
   Vladislav Dubov, sales manager for the Allied Pickford moving
company, said business has increased 40 percent since late August.
</P>
<P>
   The new clients are mainly investment and finance companies who
are moving out -- in some cases moving employees' belongings, but
keeping the staff in Moscow for now, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most major firms have decided to remain in Russia, awaiting to
see how Primakov and his new government deal with the crisis. But
decisions on whether to dramatically cut staff and expenses will
soon be made, said officials at several multinational companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, the business community feels like it was hit by
a neutron bomb, and we've all been irradiated, which means that we
are all alive today, but in 30 days, 60 days, 90 days some of us
are going to die. And the rest of us will recover, but will have to
lay around and throw up for a while,'' said Blacklin, of the
chamber of commerce.

STREEP-MOVIE (Los Angeles) _ ``Oh, the sacrifices!'' Meryl Streep
is gently mocking herself, something she's surprisingly good at
doing. She has been talking at some length about motherhood and the
things one must forfeit when there are four children in the home,
which, for Streep, has involved giving up choice movie roles and
shunning the stage for the past 16 years. By Glenn Whipp. 
. 
TRUE-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ ``One True Thing'' is a smarter than
average, generally well-acted Mom's dying movie. It can hardly
maintain a certain dignity with a cast of Meryl Streep, Renee
Zellweger and William Hurt, and change-of-pace direction by the
hugely talented Carl Franklin (``Devil in a Blue Dress''). 3 Stars.
By Bob Strauss. 
. 
MIDNIGHT-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ There's nothing new here, just
another drug story and a poorly told one at that, based on writer
Jerry Stahl's hyped memoir about his descent into drugs while
cranking out scripts for godawful sitcoms like ``ALF.'' 1{ Stars.
By Glenn Whipp.

SOLDIER-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ This Ivory-Merchant production, ``A

story about smart, privileged people leading eclectic yet earthy
lives. 3 Stars. By Bob Strauss. 
. 
RUSH-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ Take away Jackie Chan stunt work from a
Jackie Chan movie, and what are you left with? ``Rush Hour,'' a
hapless comedy-mayhem hybrid now limping into theaters. 2 Stars. By
Glenn Whipp. 
. 
SAMURI-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ ``Six-String Samurai'' looks good but
plays like a series of punch-drunk poses. 2 Stars. By Bob Strauss. 
. 
EMPRESS-STAGE (Los Angeles) _ Korea isn't the first country that
leaps to mind when you think of Broadway-style musicals. But that
could change with a few more shows like ``The Last Empress,'' a $10
million Korean production that's currently midway through its L.A.
premiere, having already prompted comparisons with Andrew Lloyd
Webber-esque showmanship. By Reed Johnson.

POP-BEAT (Los Angeles) _ At rehearsals last week for the 1998 MTV
Video Music Awards at the Universal Amphitheatre, teen r&AMP;b divas
Monica and Brandy reportedly got into a fistfight with one another.
By Fred Shuster. 
. 
DISCS-MUSIC (Los Angeles) _ Finally out on disc is Patti Smith
guitarist Lenny Kaye's seminal examination of the first generation
of punk, first issued by Elektra in 1972 and squeezed onto Disc 1
of ``Nuggets: Original Artyfacts From the First Psychedelic Era
(1965-68). Along with the original double-album, this entertaining
118-track, four-CD box offers a wealth of obscure singles and
pungent examples of '60s garage punk from regional scenes
throughout the country. By Fred Shuster. 
. 
ANGELS-VIDEO (Loa Angeles) _ L.A. never seemed so heavenly. In the
film of the same name, the City of Angels becomes a literal image
as we see celestial beings in long coats sitting on signs over the
whirl of a freeway or standing sentry atop a high-rise as a
breathtaking city panorama spreads out below. By Rob Lowman.

MERYL'S ONE TRUE THING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Oh, the sacrifices!''
</P>
<P>
   Meryl Streep is gently mocking herself, something she's
surprisingly good at doing. She has been talking at some length
about motherhood and the things one must forfeit when there are
four children in the home, which, for Streep, has involved giving
up choice movie roles and shunning the stage for the past 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   Streep no longer goes on location unless it's summer and she can
take her husband of 20 years, sculptor Don Gummer, and the kids
with her. And though her heart is aching to do a play, she won't
because the theater necessitates working nights and weekends, the
two time periods she sees her children.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the sacrifices, indeed. Streep's brood must really
appreciate what she's doing, right? Um ... right?
</P>
<P>
   ``They have no sense of that at all,'' she says, incredulous at
the mere mention of such prescience on the part of her four
children, Henry, 18; Mary Willa, 15; Grace, 12; and Louisa, 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm not raking them over the coals of guilt ... yet,''
Streep adds, laughing. ``I want them to feel free. Let them have
kids someday and then they'll know. They'll get that first glimmer,
that first clue of the size of the love and the anxiety and
everything else that goes along with being a parent. And,
hopefully, I'll be right there smiling and spoiling the
grandchildren rotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Streep, 49, has been thinking about such circles of life a lot
in the past year. Her latest film, ``One True Thing,'' centers on a
mother and grown daughter, different as day and night, who come to
appreciate and understand each other for the very things that once
drove them apart.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the novel by Anna Quindlen, the movie is alternately
funny, sad and incisive in the way it deconstructs how children,
even after becoming adults, fail to see their parents for who they
are _ flawed human beings doing the best they can. In the kids'
eyes, Mom and Dad will always be Mom and Dad, a strange perception
that Streep herself owns up to.
</P>
<P>
   Streep, you see, just took her oldest child, Henry, to college.
She's reluctant to say where he's going because just as she's
seamlessly vanished into countless memorable roles over the past 20
years, Streep likes to disappear into motherhood as well. She and
Gummer and the kids live on an 89-acre estate in northwest
Connecticut, far removed from premieres, parties and the public
eye. There, she cooks dinner, picks the kids up after school, goes
to PTA meetings and shares with Gummer all the endless tasks that
come with the 24-hour-a-day job of being a parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not very exciting, but beautiful stuff'' is how Streep puts
it.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, she and her husband helped Henry pack and took him to
college. When it came time to say goodbye, Streep just lost it,
thinking this is it, she's never going to see her baby again and
ruminating that it was just yesterday _ wasn't it? _ when she was
dropping him off at kindergarten. All the things that Streep's own
mother says she experienced when she left a 17-year-old Meryl at
Vassar College way back when in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember that day so vividly,'' Streep says, smiling. ``I
remember wondering, `What is the big deal anyway? Why are these
people crying? I'm going to be back in a month. And then there's
Thanksgiving and Christmas ... it's not like I'm going to be gone
forever'.''
</P>
<P>
   Streep pauses and transports herself forward in time more than
30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Henry, it's very sad, but I'm very proud of him at the
same time,'' she says. ``I spoke at his graduation, you know. I
think he liked that, although with that pride came the fear that
I'd somehow embarrass him. And now he's off on his own and it's all
so bittersweet, but that's what parenting is all about. If you've
done your job right, they're probably going to be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Franklin, who directed Streep in ``One True Thing,'' says
that the priority she puts on parenting informs everything she does
as an actress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her main consideration is always what's needed at home,''
Franklin says, citing Streep's daily commute from Connecticut to
the New York set as the most obvious example of her commitment.
``It's one of the things you take into account, working with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Rene Zellweger, who plays Streep's career-minded daughter
in the film: ``She just understands life and what it means to
experience it. It's magic. It comes from inside. You can't take
notes on it, although I wanted to try. All I know is that it's been
a gift to know someone so intelligent, gracious, gifted, warm and
compassionate.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all such a contrast to Streep's public image. Since she
luxuriates in her privacy, most people have formed their ideas of
Streep based on the long succession of difficult women she has
played throughout her career _ brittle women (``A Cry in the
Dark''), disagreeable women (``Kramer vs. Kramer.''), melancholy
women (``A French Lieutenant's Woman''), fragile women (Sophie's
Choice''), tough women (``Out of Africa'').
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Streep tried to soften the public's perception,
signing up for a series of comedic films (``She-Devil,''
``Postcards From the Edge,'' ``Death Becomes Her'' among them) that
never quite caught on with audiences. She even grabbed an oar and
became an action hero defending her family (what else?) in ``The
River Wild.'' But the performances often seemed a little forced
and, of late, Streep has returned to dramas like ``The Bridges of
Madison County'' and ``Marvin's Room'' where she seems most
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disagreeable women are much more fun to play,'' says Streep,
who will be seen playing another one later this year in the
heart-wrenching Irish family drama ``Dancing at Lughnasa.''
</P>
<P>
   Rarely, though, do any of these performances present a glimpse
into the warmth of the woman or her wry sense of humor. Streep
really does seem to relish life, embracing it in all of its
absurdities. And she's flat-out funny, her laughter surprising
anyone who meets her for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be honest; I was completely intimidated at the
prospect of working with her,'' Franklin says. ``She's a legend,
but she certainly doesn't let you know it. She doesn't walk around
in character. She keeps things light and is really down-to-earth. I
never thought I'd be able to say it, but Meryl Streep is really a
sweetheart of a person.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one role Streep isn't going to confess to. But she does
have a funny story that neatly encapsulates the dichotomy between
the woman and the image.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to France a couple of years ago to publicize `Marvin's
Room' and a young journalist told me, `You know, when I told people
I was going to interview Meryl Streep, they were so excited ... at
least, the women were. The men ... they are afraid of you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Streep roars with laughter and then says, ``And that's fine. I
can accept that.'' Then she lowers her voice in a conspiratorial
tone and adds, ``You know, a tiny bit of fear comes in handy
sometimes _ especially when you're the mother of four children.''

WRITER'S DRUG NIGHTMARE COVERS FAMILIAR GROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 1{ Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Call it ``Fear and Self-Loathing in Los Angeles.''
Or maybe ``Dazed and Confusing.'' Call ``Permanent Midnight''
anything, but don't call it a good movie. Doing so would make me
suspicious that you're high on something.
</P>
<P>
   ``Permanent Midnight'' is based on writer Jerry Stahl's hyped
memoir about his descent into drugs while cranking out scripts for
godawful sitcoms like ``ALF.'' Writing for a show about an
extraterrestrial puppet could explain Stahl's compulsion for drugs,
but this movie's paper-thin story isn't much interested in
character development or insight. There's nothing new here, just
another drug story and a poorly told one at that.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Stiller, appropriately sullen and self-absorbed, stars as
Stahl, who comes to Los Angeles to ``get away from drugs.'' (And
palm trees, too?) He makes some contacts, writers and junkies, and
ends up marrying a Brit (Elizabeth Hurley) so she can get a green
card and stay in the country. The prospect of waking up next to
Elizabeth Hurley, even if she is a bad actress, would be enough for
me to kick heroin, but for Stahl, it only seems to make matters
worse.
</P>
<P>
   The film unfolds as one long flashback as Stahl relates his
story to a former addict (``ER's'' Maria Bello) while they spend
the night in a seedy motel room. It's an awkward structure, and the
film sputters in fits and starts because of it. It doesn't help
either that we know little of Stahl's own history before he moves
to L.A., which gives us no rooting interest in what happens to him.
Instead, the film has a clinical feel to go along with a certain
off-putting smugness.
</P>
<P>
   Even what's supposed to pass as dark comedy rarely works because
the script (written by the film's first-time director David Veloz)
never manages to capture the banalities of this industry town.
Stahl could well have been a real-estate agent for all we learn of
the world of television writing. (I did get a kick, though, out of
the scene where Stahl, in a drug-induced stupor, imagines he's
being attacked by an ALF-like puppet.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Permanent Midnight'' does have an interesting cast, which
includes cameos by Owen Wilson, Fred Willard, Cheryl Ladd and the
always entertaining Janeane Garofalo, the latter playing a literary
agent who never seems to comprehend that her would-be client is as
high as a kite. Stahl himself turns up in one scene as a
straight-talking doctor at a drug-treatment center who tells his
screen alter-ego that kicking drugs involves a lot more than just
saying no.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad Stahl didn't spend a little more time counseling
the filmmakers. Maybe then his life's story could have been
something more than another bad movie.

TAKE A HANKIE TO `TRUE THING'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``One True Thing'' is a smarter than average,
generally well-acted ``Mom's dying'' movie. With a cast headed by
the always-thoughtful Meryl Streep, Renee Zellweger and William
Hurt and change-of-pace direction by the hugely talented Carl
Franklin (``One False Move,'' ``Devil in a Blue Dress''), it can
hardly help but maintain a certain dignity, even as it barrels
full-out toward weepy martyrdom.
</P>
<P>
   However, a more intriguing story than the one that's ultimately
presented here keeps promising to break through but never does. On
the other hand, the film's continued attempts to paint
well-educated, ambitious people as selfish and emotionally
constricted never really stick, either. The film accepts the fact
that nobody's perfect (with the possible, very safe exception of
Mom), which makes it either admirably humanistic or pretty wimpy,
depending on your perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times columnist Anna
Quindlen's novel, the movie is incalculably aided by Zellweger's
self-involved but measuredly vulnerable portrayal of _ what else? _
a savvy, driven young journalist. While Streep depends a bit too
obviously on her formidable technique this time around, Zellweger
finds a spiky naturalness that helps the movie through its more
maudlin, retrograde moments.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Gulden's desk at New York magazine's office is rarely
unmanned, day or night, and is buried in empty coffee cups to prove
it. It's obvious why the careerist's relationship with fellow Ivy
League grad Jordan (Nicky Katt) is a free-floating, second-thought
kind of affair.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen takes after her dad, George (Hurt), an admired academic
who dominates the English department at a small-town college. She
is conversely mortified by her mother, Kate (Streep), who has
apparently devoted whatever brainpower she has to becoming Martha
Stewart, minus the genius for self-promotion. Our first extensive
exposure to the disconcertingly chirpy, somewhat ditzy Kate has her
all done up in pigtails and gingham like Dorothy from ``The Wizard
of Oz''; it's George's birthday, and she's throwing a surprise,
come-as-your-favorite-literary-character party.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in fashionable black (it's the late 1980s), Ellen sneers
that she's come as Sylvia Plath. For a little while, George seems
to share his daughter's condescension, though it's instructive that
he never specifically aims his sharp critical faculties at Kate.
The next day, Ellen thinks she learns why: Mom's got cancer, and
George implores Ellen to move home and care for her.
</P>
<P>
   This is something that supposedly slow Kate understands Ellen is
singularly unprepared to do. Not only does her daughter possess
zero domestic skills, but the two women have never gotten along.
Reluctantly, resentfully dutiful, Ellen soon tumbles onto the fact
that it's her idolized father who really needs taking care of; the
man cannot pursue his brilliant work without some woman keeping his
home in order.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, Ellen learns that Kate's got more on the ball than
she ever suspected while, just as predictably, her admiration for
George is systematically shattered. None of this plays out as
cut-and-dried as it would in a TV movie, though. Oversanctified as
Kate becomes with every degenerative step of her disease, Streep
keeps her tied to this world of ours by keeping the character
slightly and persuasively ridiculous. Meanwhile, George may well be
as awful as a disillusioned daughter can imagine _ but Karen
Croner's intermittently insightful script suggests that Ellen may
indeed be imagining the worst.
</P>
<P>
   These touches are welcome in a story whose overriding agenda is
ultra-emotional mother-daughter bonding, sealed with kisses and all
the tears that are fit to jerk. The film does that expertly. Too
bad it's just as deft at avoiding the pricklier, doubtlessly more
interesting aspects of life in a family with such pronounced
intellectual imbalances. At one heavily acted point, Kate cries to
her grumpy child that ``it's so much easier to be happy.'' Despite
its promise of naked family psychodrama, that might as well be the
movie's motto.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most adroit aspect of the film is the way it
depicts Ellen's acceptance of her mother's happy homemaking tips,
which range all the way from proper bulb-planting techniques to how
to stay in love with a mate whose behavior you never thought you'd
tolerate. The daughter's fears of turning into a mental marshmallow
don't materialize; considering how close the film comes to
screaming that a woman's place is in the home, that's a fairly
breathtaking balancing act.

NO NEED TO RUSH FOR THIS `HOUR'
</HEADLINE>

OUR RATING: 2 Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jackie Chan has gone Hollywood, and audiences are
a little poorer for it.
</P>
<P>
   Chan, the Hong Kong action star best known for doing all of his
own stunts, headlines ``Rush Hour,'' a hapless comedy-mayhem hybrid
now limping into theaters. Since the movie was made in the United
States, Chan no longer can leap from planes, trains and automobiles
with impunity. Studios simply won't insure him.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure Chan, even at age 44, wasn't happy with the decision,
but his fans are going to be even more disappointed. After all,
take away Jackie Chan stunt work from a Jackie Chan movie, and what
are you left with?
</P>
<P>
   Short answer: not much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rush Hour'' is another in the long line of insipid action
movies that pairs mismatched cops who buck the system to solve a
crime. Chan is a cop from mainland China sent to Los Angeles to
help the FBI rescue the daughter of a Chinese diplomat. The FBI
wants no part of the foreign agent, though, and pairs him with a a
Los Angeles police officer (Chris Tucker) whose mouth is as big as
his ego.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I don't know about you, but for me, Tucker is about as
funny as a kidney stone passing through your urinary tract.
Asian-Americans might find him _ and the movie _ a little
offensive, too. The ethnic put-downs fly fast and furious, such as
when Chan first steps off the plane and you hear the stereotypical
crash of a gong and cymbal. Tucker then proceeds to put him through
the ringer, at one point screaming, ``DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE WORDS
THAT ARE COMING FROM MY MOUTH?!?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Chris, we do. And at times like this, we wish we were deaf.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker's obnoxious presence detracts from Chan's action work,
which, while neutered, still has a few lightning-fast fun moments.
And even though Tucker could stand to chew on some Ritalin, he and
Chan manage the occasional spark of chemistry between their
contrasting personas of bombast and politeness.
</P>
<P>
   The closing credits continue the Chan tradition of showing
highly entertaining outtakes. In the past, this has meant watching
Jackie break some bones while he leaps out of a train or from a
speeding car, attempting take after take until he satisfies his
artistic sense of how the stunt should work. Here, since the action
is limited, we see Chan flub some lines and clown with Tucker.
Interestingly, these scenes contain more warmth and charm than
anything else in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   The likable Chan certainly deserves better. Maybe he should
worry less about scoring a Hollywood hit and go back to what he
does best _ being a man of action. And tell the composer to leave
the gong and cymbal at home.
</P>

`SOLDIER'S DAUGHTER' A WINNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
Our rating:3{ Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Functional families have problems, too. They just
tend to handle them better.
</P>
<P>
   That's the refreshing message of ``A Soldier's Daughter Never
Cries,'' a movie that dares to suggest that love, communication and
open-minded common sense may not be a formula for solving
everything, but it beats the usual alternatives. The kind of quiet,
observational film that director James Ivory often turns into
cinematic starch unless it's set in an English manor house,
``Soldier's Daughter'' avoids tedium with an emphasis on youth and
a ban on brittle characterizations.
</P>
<P>
   The film is based on a semi-autobiographical novel by Kaylie
Jones, the daughter of James Jones, the author of the classic World
War II novels ``From Here to Eternity'' and ``The Thin Red Line,''
which has been made into a film set for a Christmas Day release.
Mixed with some of Ivory's own ideas and memories (he shares script
credit with Merchant-Ivory regular Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, who won a
screenwriting Oscar for the outfit's ``Howards End''), ``Soldier's
Daughter'' is a simple but always intriguing story about smart,
privileged people leading eclectic yet earthy lives.
</P>
<P>
   The story is divided into three segments; the first two are set
in Paris in the 1960s, the last on the U.S. East Coast in the early
'70s. In the first part, the fictional Willis family _ crusty but
affable father Bill (Kris Kristofferson), high-strung but fun
mother Marcella (Barbara Hershey) and resentful, preteen daughter
Channe (Luisa Conlon) _ welcomes its new, 6-year-old adopted son,
Benoit (Samuel Gruen), into their impressive Paris apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The parents immediately lavish the boy with warmth while Channe,
miffed at the prospect of competition, takes a much longer time to
accept her new brother. The little French kid remains practically
skeptical; he's so used to being shuttled between orphanages and
foster homes, he keeps his tiny valise packed at all times. The
main crisis of this section is whether Benoit's young mother will
ultimately sign the adoption papers. The real drama, though, is in
the children's discovery that they can allow themselves to love and
be loved.
</P>
<P>
   The second part takes place a few years later. Benoit has
changed his name to Billy as an expression of trust in his American
father, and the adolescent Channe (played for the rest of the movie
by ``Deep Impact's'' Leelee Sobieski) has taken up with a
flamboyant, effeminate school friend, Francis (Anthony Roth
Costanzo). The platonic relationship is an intense, invigorating
and intellectually stimulating one, but as Channe's hormones drive
her toward more masculine boys, the friendship strains and cracks.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, Bill's failing health forces the family back
to America. The older Billy, who is played by Jesse Bradford
(Steven Soderbergh's ``King of the Hill''), responds sullenly to
the new environment. Channe takes a different tack and soon
develops a fast French girl's reputation among the high school
boys.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting ``facts of life'' discussion between father and
daughter has got to be the smartest and sweetest ever filmed. Even
if you've found the film a little slow and insignificant up to this
point (the Merchant-Ivory house style may seem wan, but it's
deceptively tenacious), you've got to be knocked out by this
scene's straightforward elegance and wisdom _ and by
Kristofferson's best-ever screen moment. Never a great actor, he
expresses a worried but respectful parent's conflicting emotions
beautifully and without changing his trademark growly persona.
</P>
<P>
   But if ``Soldier's Daughter'' is a showcase for any of its
uniformly fine actors, it's Sobieski's. Playing that rarest of
movie creatures, a fundamentally sensible teen-age girl, she shines
with accumulating intelligence through a vastly complex series of
confusing discoveries and realizations. The young actress bears a
remarkable physical resemblance to Helen Hunt; this movie indicates
she also possesses a similar degree of talent.
</P>
<P>
   A few things seem to be missing from the leisurely proceedings.
You'd think such an intellectual, artistic family would be more
engaged than is shown with the era's political issues _ especially
a war-obsessed nonconformist like Bill. The family also takes its
moneyed comfort for granted; again, something smart people at least
discussed, often with a sense of guilt, at the time.
</P>
<P>
   But the focus here is family. And when you've got one as
honestly wonderful as Kaylie Jones' Willises, it's satisfying
enough just to spend some time with them at home. &UR;

`EMPRESS' COMES ON STRONG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Different countries have different cultural
affinities. Nobody does opera quite like the Italians, ballet quite
like the Russians, or rock music quite like the, um, French.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, Korea isn't the first country that leaps to mind when
you think of Broadway-style musicals. But that could change with a
few more shows like ``The Last Empress,'' a $10 million Korean
production that's currently midway through its L.A. premiere,
having already prompted comparisons with Andrew Lloyd Webber-esque
showmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason is its heroine, the Empress Min, a
larger-than-life figure in Korean history with a cult following
comparable to that of Britain's Elizabeth I or Argentina's Eva
Peron. Though little-known in the West, she was the powerful
matriarch in the late-19th-century of the Lee Dynasty (1392-1910),
and presided over Chosun (as the country was then called) as it
began its painful turn-of-the-century transition from isolated,
feudal kingdom to modernized nation.
</P>
<P>
   But the queen's strong will couldn't halt Imperial Japan's
territorial ambitions. Japan invaded its neighbor and assassinated
the empress in 1895, opening a wound that was further inflamed by
World War II and still has yet to heal fully.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Last Empress'' tells this story on a Busby Berkeley scale,
in 56 scenes, with a company of 50 singers and dancers decked out
in 600 opulent costumes. Performed in Korean with English
supertitles, the 2{-hour show has had two brief engagements in New
York City. Although director Ho Jin Yun acknowledges the production
has lost money so far, he's hoping its New York and L.A. runs will
give it a beachhead for future expansion.
</P>
<P>
   And while epic entertainment is the musical's primary purpose,
Yun also thinks the show can set a few records straight, both about
the empress and about a sensitive chapter of Japanese-Korean
relations. Until now, he says, the empress ``was only portrayed as
not a good kind of person, because she always had trouble with her
father-in-law and she was too strong for a woman at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Actress Taewon Kim, who alternates the demanding title role with
Wonjung Kim (no relation), says her character hardly fits the
profile of the meek and martyred Asian woman, a staple of Western
popular culture from ``Madame Butterfly'' to ``Miss Saigon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The stereotype of Asian women, Korean women, is that they were
quiet, very gentle, not saying anything,'' says Taewon Kim. ``But
she was too smart, too strong. The only thing they could do was
kill her.''
</P>
<P>
   A classically trained mezzo-soprano who recently played Lady
Thiang in the Broadway revival of ``The King and I,'' Taewon Kim
moved to the United States with her family when she was 15 and grew
up in Flushing, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Before she discovered acting, her ambition was to be a pilot.
She applied to the Air Force Academy, the Naval Academy and West
Point, but couldn't get in because she wasn't a U.S. citizen.
Instead, she entered Juilliard on a scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``The Last Empress'' requires her to spend much of her
time in a 40-pound wig, Kim understandably is more concerned about
her voice than her hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens is, as a singer, my voice gets kind of dry,'' she
said recently over coffee in a Koreatown hotel. ``So that's one bad
thing, but you can't have everything. I'm a very pushy kind of
girl, so I don't (always) take care of my voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Director Yun says that American missionaries first imported
Broadway musicals to Korea after World War II. He developed his own
love of the form in the 1980s when he came to Manhattan to study at
New York University's School of Drama. By 1993, he had founded his
own production company, A-Com, and produced his first U.S. musical,
a revival of ``Guys and Dolls.''
</P>
<P>
   With its ultra-patriotic themes and stirring, anthemlike
melodies, ``The Last Empress'' became a smash in Seoul. How its
sensitive subject matter will play to audiences elsewhere in Asia
is worth contemplating: Yun plans to take it to Japan and, if
possible, North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this will be the best way to reach other people,'' he
says. ``The first thing that needs to be done is to open up all
this hidden history and make it known to everybody. And if we show
our culture to them and they show theirs to us, that's the
beginning of a new and better relationship.''

c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
MARY CUTRUFELLO/``When the Night Is Through'' (Mercury)
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's definitely something about Mary, and it isn't just the
dreadlocks, the all-black outfits or her heartland soul. Like Tom
Petty and John Mellencamp, the Houston singer-songwriter and
guitarist writes affecting populist rock tunes with genuine
swagger. The many road miles Yale grad Cutrufello has racked up
give world-weary standouts like ``She Can't Let Go,'' ``Tired and
Thirty'' and ``Sad, Sad World'' the ring of hard-won truth. Then
there's the cast of high-profile musicians, including Wallflowers
keyboardist Rami Jaffee, session drummer Kenny Aronoff and bassist
Bob Glaub. On ``When the Night is Through,'' Cutrufello captures
something that will never go out of style. 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SHAWN MULLINS/``Soul's Core'' (Columbia)
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's award-winning Mullins is an old-fashioned guy: He
crafts gorgeous character studies on acoustic guitar and works them
out in front of live audiences more than 200 nights a year. This
summer, Mullins received an unexpected lift when one of the
country's most influential pop-rock stations added the hook-filled,
electro-acoustic saga ``Lullaby'' from this album. There are other
winners here, too, such as the heart-tugging homeless ballad ``Twin
Rocks, Oregon'' and ``The Gulf of Mexico,'' a still life of a
barmaid in a biker hangout. Be sure to stick around for
``Shimmer,'' the bonus track on this rewarding major label debut. 3
Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
VARIOUS/``Nuggets: Original Artyfacts From the First Psychedelic
Era (1965-68)'' (Rhino)
</P>
<P>
   Finally out on disc is Patti Smith guitarist Lenny Kaye's
seminal examination of the first generation of punk, first issued
by Elektra in 1972 and squeezed onto Disc 1 here. Along with the
original double-album, this entertaining 118-track, four-CD box
offers a wealth of obscure singles and pungent examples of '60s
garage punk from regional scenes throughout the country. Although
there are goodies galore from the likes of the Knickerbockers,
Chocolate Watchband, Mouse &AMP; the Traps, and Paul Revere &AMP; the
Raiders, plus bizarre and long-forgotten numbers by the Humane
Society, the Groupies, and the Rationals, this is still a bit much
to take in one sitting, especially on an empty stomach. In any
case, let a thousand flowers blossom. Again. 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
JOHNNY ADAMS/``Man of My Word'' (Rounder)
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans soul man Adams _ dubbed the Tan Canary _ sadly died
this week at age 67 after a long battle with cancer. His ninth solo
album for Rounder finds him in stirring voice, singing as
beautifully as ever and maintaining the high standard of excellence
in terms of both musicianship and material he set years ago. The
songs here are rooted in the deep soul of such icons as Ann
Peebles, Al Green and Otis Clay. On the sturdy ``Man of My Word,''
Adams covers William Bell's classic ``You Don't Miss Your Water''
and the Brook Benton/Dinah Washington chestnut ``Looking Back,''
and handles new tunes by such terrific writers as Dan Penn and
Bobby Charles. There's also a slow, gritty blues with an ironic
title _ ``This Time I'm Gone for Good.'' 3{ Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ANDY BEY/``Shades of Bey'' (Evidence)
</P>
<P>
   Jazz singer-pianist Bey's latest effort ventures far from
traditional jazz renditions and instead explores more challenging
shades of material, from Brazilian to Afro-Cuban to atmospheric
interpretations of Nick Drake's ``River Man'' and Thelonius Monk's
``Straight, No Chaser.'' Backed by a hard-working, creative group
that sometimes includes alto saxophonist Gary Bartz and drummer
Victor Lewis, Bey is at his understated but powerful best on the
poignant requiem ``Blood Count,'' where he perfectly captures the
song's bittersweet essence. 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
BEN WEBSTER/``Ultimate Ben Webster'' (Verve)
</P>
<P>
   Verve's ``Ultimate'' series enlists modern jazz artists to
select favorite Verve cuts from past greats. On this wonderful
volume, saxophonist James Carter sifts through Webster's work for
the label, delivering a highly enjoyable album that shows off the
onetime Duke Ellington orchestra member's many strengths. Although
he's not considered an innovator, the late Webster stood tall as a
tenor who could purr on ballads and tear his way through
boogie-woogie stompers. Both are in abundance here, and the album
includes vocals by Dinah Washington and the Ravens, solos by Gerry
Mulligan and Oscar Peterson, plus prime cuts with the Ralph Burns
Orchestra. Webster even puts down the saxophone and plays piano on
the album's first and last tracks, just like he would when
performing. It's a warm tribute to a man whose sunny way with the
saxophone has never quite been equaled. 4 Stars.
</P>
<P>
   _ Glenn Whipp &QR; 
 &QL; 
STEFON HARRIS/``A Cloud of Red Dust'' (Blue Note)!off!
</P>
<P>
   Vibraphonist Harris is one of the rising stars of jazz. Those
who caught his work with Joe Henderson at either the Jazz Bakery or
Catalina Bar &AMP; Grill earlier this year have been anxiously awaiting
this debut, and Harris does not disappoint, delivering a passionate
disc full of interesting songs that pull from a wide variety of
influences. Harris likens the songs on this CD to chapters in a
novel, linking them together with short, smooth musical
transitions. It's an intriguing concept that doesn't always work,
but the album contains plenty of exciting moments. Harris' playing
is marvelous, and he gives musicians like pianist Mulgrew Miller,
trombonist Steve Turre (who also utilizes seashells), and
saxophonists Greg Osby and Steve Wilson plenty of room to explore
post-bop fare. A complex, rewarding work. 3{ Stars.
</P>
<P>
   _ Glenn Whipp &QR; 
 &QL; 
PLASTILINA MOSH/``Aquamosh'' (EMI)
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican duo of Alejandro Rosso and Jonas has come up with a
genre-busting and musically diverse concept. Album-opener ``Nino
Bomba'' is a gritty trip-hop tune that samples ``People Say'' by
Big Easy funk legends the Meters. The title track is also funk
driven, with a spacey ambient middle eight. ``I've Got That Milton
Pacheco Kinda Feeling'' _ named for the Mexican big-screen
heartthrob _ links drum 'n' bass with lounge-style organ, while
``Mr. P. Mosh'' is a hook-heavy pop ditty complete with blues harp
and scratch rhythms. Ultimately, Plastilina Mosh is all over the
place _ but in a good way, like Beck. Some of this stuff will drive
ants from your house, the rest might even please your parents. 2{

   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; In an alternate universe, where the Soviets have
conquered America but collapsed anyway, the last bastion of freedom
and glamour is a place in the Nevada desert called Lost Vegas. When
the city's king dies, Elvis-impersonating martial artists cross the
burning sands to compete for the crown in a royal battle of the
bands. Of course, to get the chance, they have to survive a hostile
landscape filled with ``Road Warrior'' rejects, Death himself and
at least one cute-as-a-button little feral kid.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds bad on paper; looks good but plays like a series of
punch-drunk poses on the big screen. ``Six-String Samurai'' is a
first feature from recent Loyola Marymount graduate Lance Mungia
that had the makings of a fever dream but packs all the impact of a
tepid bath.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed in Death Valley without the budgets enjoyed by those Mel
Gibson speed spectacles in the Australian outback, ``Samurai'' is
understandably listless between fight scenes. But, although the
film's pacing problems can be forgiven, its annoying mishmash of
dusty pop-culture references reach an intolerability plateau about
10 minutes in. Naturally, they don't let up until the end.
</P>
<P>
   Our hero is a guy with thick glasses named Buddy (like Holly,
get it?). Played by American Kung Fu champion and Hong Kong action
movie star Jeffrey Falcon, who also co-wrote the screenplay with
Mungia, Buddy swings a mean sword and purportedly plays hot licks
on his guitar. But he's usually too busy fighting off packs of
barbarians, sitcom-inspired cannibal families and rival would-be
kings to serenade us much.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Buddy seems most interested in making pompous statements
about his prowess/destiny in hipster lingo so absurd he comes off
about as cool as that finger-snappin', moon-headed guy in the
McDonald's commercials.
</P>
<P>
   There are also the matters of the Kid (Justin McGuire), a
nonverbal, dirt-encrusted orphan who attaches himself to the
reluctant warrior/guy-who-needs-a-better-act and always requires
rescuing. And then there's Death (Stephane Gauger), who, with his
murderous minions, stalks Buddy's trail for supernatural reasons
that, like the rest of this sun-blasted narrative, make slim sense.
</P>
<P>
   The fight sequences are fairly well-staged in a
Sergio-Leone-tries-Prozac kind of way. They're self-consciously
ironic to a fault, but they generally possess enough zing to at
least break up the boredom of wandering through the desert with a
guy who's too enamored of his own, bizarro saviorhood _ led by a
director who thinks any kitschy idea that pops into his head
somehow deserves to be immortalized on screen, whether it belongs
there or not.
</P>
<P>
   But then, maybe anything goes in a movie about sword-swinging,
post-apocalyptic Elvises in desperate need of baths. Though he may
have a knack for parched, junkyard imagery, judicious selection of
material is not one of Mungia's strengths. &UR;

NO BRANDY-MONICA BRAWL

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Rumors that teen r&AMP;b queens Monica and Brandy
duked it out during rehearsals for the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards
were strenuously denied by the singers' management.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Post and various Internet gossip sites reported
without attribution that the divas _ duet partners on the smash hit
``The Boy Is Mine'' _ got physical at the Universal Amphitheatre
last week, resulting in a shiner for Brandy and a swollen lip for
Monica.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there are certain individuals who are trying to
create a rift between Brandy and Monica,'' said a joint statement
issued by the respective camps. ``Such ongoing negativity is
totally unfair to these two gifted teen-agers, both of whom are
simply working hard to build successful careers in a very tough
business.''
</P>
<P>
   The managers said Brandy and Monica spent substantial time
together at the awards show, participating in interviews, posing
for photos, sitting side by side in the audience and holding hands
and praying together prior to going on stage to perform the
chart-topping duet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've even been talking about the possibility of going on
tour together,'' the statement added.
</P>
<P>
   For three years, the r&AMP;b stars have been painted as adversaries,
although their managers insist such talk is simply unfounded
gossip.
</P>
<P>
   However, there was no denying that the Jesus and Mary Chain's
Reid brothers were at it again last weekend at the House of Blues.
</P>
<P>
   The battling siblings knocked over microphone stands and got
into a shouting match during an aborted show that ended after just
15 minutes, audience members said.
</P>
<P>
   After the brief, sloppy gig, the elder Reid, William, jumped on
a plane and returned to London, leaving brother Jim and the rest of
the gang to carry on after just two U.S. tour dates.
</P>
<P>
   PHONING IT IN: Josh Wink used the mail to collaborate with Nine
Inch Nails' Trent Reznor on the Philly DJ's new album, ``Herehear''
(Ovum/Ruffhouse).
</P>
<P>
   ``With Trent, we sent tapes back and forth and spoke on the
phone a lot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wink, who splits his time as a recording artist and party disc
jockey, threw a variety of dance styles into the current album,
including drum 'n' bass, electronica and dub rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure I'm an artist who is also a DJ,'' Wink said. ``I make
music out of music, and I like to create mood. I'm someone who
shapes others' moods. I have a passion for what I do, and I balance
making music and DJ-ing.''
</P>
<P>
   Wink _ who will spin at an all-ages show Sept. 26 at the Shrine
Expo Hall downtown with the Crystal Method and Doc Martin _ got his
start working for a mobile DJ service at age 13.
</P>
<P>
   The gigs weren't glamorous, but he learned to make the
temperature of a party soar.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, he hooked up with fellow Philly native and disc jockey
King Britt, whose interests included rap and acid-jazz.
</P>
<P>
   MORE FROM LESS THAN JAKE: The six-member Gainesville, Fla.-based
ska outfit Less Than Jake releases its second album for Capitol on
Oct. 6. ``Hello Rockview'' marks the lively band's fifth
full-length disc.

WHERE ANGELS GET DOWN TO EARTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The idea of heavenly beings perched above the city
of L.A. is a comforting thought. In the film of the same name, the
City of Angels becomes a literal image as we see celestial beings
in long coats sitting on signs over the whirl of a freeway or
standing sentry atop a high-rise as a breathtaking city panorama
spreads out below. L.A. never seemed so, well, heavenly.
</P>
<P>
   While no one will mistake the Nicolas Cage-Meg Ryan film for a
heavy meditation on life, death and the afterlife, its lightness is
mildly intoxicating.
</P>
<P>
   Based on German director Wim Wenders' 1987 film ``Wings of
Desire,'' ``City of Angels'' tells the story of an angel named Seth
(Cage) who falls in love with a troubled young surgeon, Maggie
(Ryan). It is the loss of a patient on the operating table that has
Maggie questioning her profession. ``I feel like none of this is in
my hands. And if it isn't, what do I do with that?''
</P>
<P>
   Seth comes upon her when he escorts the spirit of the dying man
``home,'' as he calls it. He is immediately taken by her as she
anguishes over the loss. But Seth is like the other angels who
spend their time at the downtown library eavesdropping on the
thoughts of the readers or congregating at the beach each morning
to hear music in the sunrise: He is unable to experience physical
sensations. What good is having wings, asks a little girl he is
escorting, if you can't feel the wind on your face?
</P>
<P>
   One day, Maggie spots Seth outside the door of one of her
patients, Nathaniel Messinger (Dennis Franz). Amazed that she sees
him, Seth begins showing up around her, asking her questions (``How
does a pear taste?''), fascinated with the sensual. His questions
remind us how much we take for granted. Seth then finds that he _
like humans _ has free will (something else we take for granted),
and that he can choose to ``fall'': give up his celestial powers
for the life of a human, a life he can share with Maggie. But it's
also a life of feelings, including pain.
</P>
<P>
   For those who have seen ``Wings,'' there will be inevitable
comparisons, but ``City'' can stand on its own. There is a
sincerity about it that overcomes its few schmaltzy aspects, and
Ryan and Cage keep their characters interesting in a low-key way
that avoids the delicate balance the film tries to maintain. And
any notions that the film might be too precious, however, are
easily dispelled by lively performances by Franz and recent Emmy
winner Andre Braugher, who plays Seth's celestial friend, Cassiel.
</P>
<P>
   Wenders' ``Wings'' is also worth checking out. Starring Bruno
Ganz, the film, with its stark black-and-white photography, has a
more meditative and less sensual feel than ``City.'' But it has
been called a ``visual poem,'' which is an accurate way to describe
its lyrical qualities. Wenders won the 1987 Cannes Film Festival
award for best director.
</P>
<P>
   SPEAKING OF HEAVEN: Twenty years ago, there was another film
that dealt with angels, romance, Los Angeles and was a remake.
Warren Beatty's ``Heaven Can Wait'' was a remake of the 1941 film
``Here Comes Mr. Jordan,'' starring Robert Montgomery, not director
Ernst Lubitsch's 1943 ``Heaven Can Wait,'' starring Don Ameche.
</P>
<P>
   Confused?
</P>
<P>
   Don't be. They have three things in common: They picked up
numerous Oscar nominations, they're all delightful, and they're all
worth renting.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty's ``Heaven Can Wait'' tells the story of Joe Pendleton
(Beatty), a Rams quarterback (remember when L.A. had a pro football
team?) who is spirited out of his body too soon by an overzealous
angel (Buck Henry, who co-directed) when it looks like he's going
to die horribly in a crash. Since it wasn't Joe's time to die, the
powers that be must find another body for Joe to live out the 50
more years he was slated for _ and not just another body but one in
which he can continue his pro career. The romantic complication
ensues when Joe in his new temporary and out-of-shape body _ that
of a wealthy industrialist _ falls in love with a woman (Julie
Christie) protesting his company's policy.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Jordan,'' Joe (Montgomery) is a boxer who was fighting for
the world heavyweight crown.
</P>
<P>
   In the other ``Heaven,'' the newly deceased Henry Van Cleve
(Ameche), a Casanova, finds himself asking the devil for a passport
to hell. To decide if he qualifies, they look back at his rakish
life.
</P>
<P>
   One of our greatest directors, Lubitsch was a master of light
satire (``the Lubitsch touch'' as it was called), and like Van
Cleve, this ``Heaven'' is wickedly charming.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Legal gambling brings out the latent puritan in many Americans.
The right detests gambling because it promises something for
nothing. The left hates it because it enriches corporations by
emptying the pockets of the gullible lower classes.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone seems to detest legal gambling--everyone, that is,
except the public. Americans spend nearly $51 billion a year on
various games of chance--twice as much as they spend on movies,
plays, operas and spectator sports combined.
</P>
<P>
   Now gambling's place at the table is threatened by the puritans,
who've used their political muscle to help establish a National
Gambling Impact Study Commission. They hope its June 1999 report
will prove their claims that gambling wrecks lives, stimulates
crime, saps local economies, mercilessly exploits human weakness,
and sustains itself through bribery and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   A review, then, and a brief refutation of their best arguments:
</P>
<P>
   People Become Addicted to Gambling: The critics warn of an
exploding epidemic of addicted gamblers, but a recent study by
researchers at Harvard Medical School's Division on Addictions
argues against this notion. An estimated 1.6 percent of American
adults will become pathological gamblers, compared with 6.2 percent
who will succumb to drug addiction and 13.8 percent who will become
alcoholics. A study published last year claimed that the
legalization of casinos causes an increase in suicide rates.
Indeed, Nevada's suicide rate is the highest in the country, double
the national average. But New Jersey, home of Atlantic City, enjoys
the lowest rate. Mississippi, the South's gambling Mecca, falls
slightly below the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Legal Gambling Fosters Crime: Exhibit A for the prosecution is
Atlantic City, which went from being No. 50 among American cities
in crimes per capita to being No. 1 after the arrival of casinos.
This increase fails to account for the city's huge influx of
tourists, who on any given day outnumber residents by more than
2-to-1. As noted in a study by University of Maryland Professor
Peter Reuter, homicides barely increased at all, despite the influx
of outsiders, and assaults rose only about as fast as the average
daily population. The real increases have come in robbery and
aggravated assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, though, it's impossible to detect any consistent
relationship between the existence of casinos and the prevalence of
lawlessness. Jeremy Margolis, who headed the Illinois State Police
when the state introduced 13 riverboat casinos, has testified that
``crime has not been a problem.'' Looking at rural Colorado, Texas
A&AMP;M scholar Patricia Stokowski found that with the arrival of
casinos, ``the likelihood of becoming a crime victim in Gilpin
County has decreased.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal Gambling Causes Corruption: Casino operators are portrayed
as the Typhoid Marys of political corruption, the usual evidence
being their lavish bankrolling of politicians. But of the 16
industries that gave ``soft money'' to the two major political
parties in 1996, the gambling industry ranked 16th, according to
the ultrafastidious Center for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   Casino owners are right to take a greater-than-average interest
in the workings of government. 1) Until recently, their industry
was illegal almost everywhere. 2) They cannot operate without
hard-to-get government licenses. 3) Their many enemies want to
legislate them out of existence.
</P>
<P>
   As long as we're talking about corruption and exploitation, we
should not forget that the wickedest gambling sharpies don't live
in Las Vegas but in the state capitals, where the lotteries are
headquartered. The lotteries' pitiful payout--about half of all
money wagered, compared with 92 percent or so at your average
casino--rightly draws cries of outrage. If the critics were
interested in remedying the lotteries, they'd have the states
repeal their monopolies on these games and let the market compete
away the excess profits.
</P>
<P>
   Whose Life Is It, Anyway?: Gambling's opponents never tire of
reciting statistics and anecdotes to suggest that the costs of
legalized gambling dwarf any possible benefits. But they fail to
count the central benefit--the diversion and pleasure it provides
to millions of people. Until 1978, casinos were accessible only to
people with the means to travel to Las Vegas. The relaxation of
prohibitionist laws has brought them within easy reach of most of
the American public, and the public has voted for them with its
feet. The overwhelming majority of these patrons gamble responsibly
and impose no burden on their fellow citizens. They treat games of
chance as exactly that--games.
</P>
<P>
   Yet critics insist on portraying gamblers as a pitiable class of
suckers, enslaved by fantasies of unearned wealth. It's hard to see
why. No one accuses movie theaters or gardening-supply outlets of
ruthlessly exploiting the weaknesses of clients who turn over their
money only because they lack the self-control to refuse. Most
people who patronize the lottery, the track, or the slot machines
end up poorer, with nothing to show for the transaction--which is
also true of people who eat in restaurants and attend concerts. To
incurable bluenoses, gambling is an infuriating scam. But why
assume gamblers are being fooled? It's more reasonable to assume
that they know they will probably lose but are happy to take that
chance for 1) the pleasure of playing and 2) the chance of coming
out ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, that's a decision they ought to be free to make,
unimpeded by moralists and social reformers who think ordinary
people cannot be trusted to look after their own interests. If
gambling were the grim scourge portrayed by its opponents, it would
not have gone from a contemptible vice to an innocent diversion in
a single generation. People who have visited casinos and played the
lottery have seen that misery and damnation don't necessarily
follow, either for themselves or for surrounding communities.
Gambling has become a widespread pastime for the simple and
unassailable reason that it adds to the sum of human happiness.
That's reason enough to leave it alone.

   The entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well, not only in the
many new start-ups spawned by the revved-up economy, but inside
corporate America. On Sept. 23, The New York Times will examine
this attitude in ENTREPRENEURS, a special news section filled with
instructive stories on ventures that worked _ and some that didn't
_ along with information useful to anyone interested in enterprise,
no matter what the scale.

A GUIDE TO THE QUICKIE STARR PAPERBACKS  
</HEADLINE>
  By TIMOTHY NOAH 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Flytrap aficionados will need to purchase one of the three
paperback versions of the Starr report, which hit the stores
Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   They are Pocket Books ($5.99), Prima ($9.99) and the Washington
Post's Public Affairs edition ($10).
</P>
<P>
   Here's how they match up:
</P>
<P>
   Format: The Washington Post edition) is a trade paperback, with
bigger-sized pages and a more pliant spine. Unlike the other two
editions, it can be stretched out and laid on a table while you
munch a sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   Introductory material: In the Pocket Books version, Phil Kuntz
of the Wall Street Journal writes a five-page intro that is an
economical-but-thorough explanation of how a 1992 New York Times
story about Whitewater by Jeff Gerth led to a 1998 report about
Monica Lewinsky by Ken Starr. This is precisely what readers will
need to be reminded about, especially in a few years, when the
details become hazy in everybody's mind.
</P>
<P>
   Fairness: The Pocket Books and Post versions both reprint the
preliminary rebuttal from Clinton's lawyer. The Prima version does
not. None of the three paperback versions contains the rebuttal
Clinton's lawyers produced after they actually had a chance to read
the report.
</P>
<P>
   Did Journalists Get Rich Off This?: The Pocket Books version
earned Kuntz an undisclosed sum, but he won't be getting royalties.
The Post reporters whose articles are being reprinted in the Post
edition won't get paid at all, because they don't own their
stories. The Prima version contains no material from journalists at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Overall Winner: The Post version, entirely on the grounds that
it's a trade paperback. But the Pocket Books version is the more
practical choice for those who don't need to worry about eyestrain.
The Prima version places a distant third.

ultimately unimportant. What can be said, perhaps, is that Gershwin
was the most American composer, in the democracy and eclecticism of
his idiom, and in the brash energy and earthy imagination that

SEATTLE FANS CAUGHT UP IN HOMERUN RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Between swings, sips and shift changes Wednesday,
Seattle tapped its chest a few times and blew a two-fingered kiss.
The object of this affection was Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   People who live in and around the Emerald City decided, at least
on a Wednesday afternoon under lazy blue skies, that this man _ not
Mark McGwire _ should own baseball's single-season record for home
runs when the last ball has been crushed 11 days from now.
</P>
<P>
   A random sampling by the Post-Intelligencer of those buying
espresso drinks, pumping gas, hitting baseballs themselves or
simply soaking up the sun showed that 57 percent favor the Chicago
Cubs slugger rather than McGwire. Both players have 63 home runs,
surpassing Roger Maris, Babe Ruth and every other player who has
put on a major league uniform.
</P>
<P>
   They fans like Sosa because he is the underdog. They like him
because, unlike McGwire, he is drug-free.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for the man,'' said Sai Tausili, a Franklin High
School freshman, as he ate a greasy mini-mart chicken wing. ``When
he hit No. 62, there was no 10-minute delay for him. Besides, he
takes Flintstone vitamins like I do.''
</P>
<P>
   From the Rainier (Ave.) Laundromat to Alladin Rug Collection in
Pioneer Square, more than 60 people were asked for their opinion on
this matter of national importance. Forty-two had a definitive
answer, though many of them expressed disappointment that Ken
Griffey Jr. wasn't involved in the chase. Ten people said they
wanted Sosa and McGwire to share the record. At least 10 others,
including a quaintly dressed couple from Germany, had no idea what
any of this meant.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was fairly well split between men and women, young and
old, Caucasians and African-Americans. However, there was no
fence-sitting among the half-dozen people of Latino ancestry
encountered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sosa 67, McGwire 65,'' predicted rug-store employee Jorge
Santos, like Sosa, a native of the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Santos had been leaving work early to watch his hero at home on
television. Since the homer-related games left the network
airwaves, he has followed Sosa on the internet, getting a
pitch-by-pitch account. In the meantime, he practically drove his
boss, Sharam Assary, an Iranian-American, crazy until Assary swore
his allegiance to Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody here is a Sosa fan,'' Assary said. ``That's all we
talk about all day long.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jose Camarena, a Mexican-American: ``Latins are close to
him because of the spirits.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the Kingdome Wednesday, there were only Sosa backers at
mid-afternoon, clutching newly purchased Mariner tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighter Franklin Russell was one. A 48-year-old
African-American man, he suggested that racial overtones were
responsible for McGwire receiving a more pronounced celebration for
his record-breaking efforts than Sosa. He said the same thing
happened to Hank Aaron when he overtoook the career homer record
that belonged to Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   Also buying tickets was Nate Watson, a 30-year-old neurology
resident at the University of Washington. Drugs helped him pick his
hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see Sosa do it because he's not taking
androstenedione, which is illegal in the Olympics,'' Watson said.
``I think it's unhealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   At laundromats and bus stops across the city, people recite the
most intimate details about both sluggers, gleaned from a bevy of
news accounts. Sosa, one of 10 children, once used a catcher's mitt
to play elsewhere. McGwire, doting father, Ruthian power.
</P>
<P>
   All it takes is a lot of home runs to shrink the world a little.
Anastasia Diamond is a 24-year-old Seattle woman, Midwest
transplant and Cubs fan as long as she can remember. Sosa ties her
past and present together, brightening her day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like his attitude,'' she said.

AUTHOR RAISES GENERATION X ISSUES, BUT FALLS SHORT OF TITLE'S
PROMISE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Teresa McUsic 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So, you're having trouble understanding kids.
</P>
<P>
   It's a classic problem, with one generation of middle-age
managers trying to figure out what motivates and inspires
fresh-faced college graduates in their first years on the work
force.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's time for baby boomers to plumb the minds of the
post-boomers entering the workplace _ the members of the so-called
Generation X who are beginning to put their stamp on the work
world.
</P>
<P>
   For a glance at the mind-set of the youngest work-force members,
read ``Rational Exuberance: The Influence of Generation X on the
New American Economy'' (The Penguin Group, $24.95, 274 pages).
</P>
<P>
   Meredith Bagby neatly outlines the social and economic pressures
facing the group born after 1964, portraying the generation not as
slackers living in their parents' basements, but as a group driven
to self-reliance and entrepreneurship by fear that no one else will
support them.
</P>
<P>
   Bagby, 25, writes that her peers are consistently told that
their generation will be the first to be poorer than its
predecessors. Bagby blames the situation on a new structure driven
by ballooning Social Security entitlements.
</P>
<P>
   One statistic highlighted in the book is telling. For every $5
spent on government programs for the elderly, $1 is spent on
educating and improving the lot of younger people, Bagby writes.
Many young people don't vote, so they lose out when it comes time
for handouts from Washington, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through programs like Social Security and Medicare, the
government has become a kind of intergenerational Robin Hood _
taking money from the young and giving it to the old,'' Bagby
writes.
</P>
<P>
   What Bagby writes is true enough. But most of it is hardly news
to business-oriented professionals who stay even mildly aware of
big-picture issues.
</P>
<P>
   The book is disappointing in some ways, because from its title
and its first 50 or so pages, readers can begin to hope that they
are sinking their teeth into a classic work that clearly defines
the working psyche of a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the writing quickly turns into an inside-the-Beltway
check list of political issues supposedly presented through the
prism of Generation X thinking. It's all covered: income
inequality, welfare, national debt, free trade, affirmative action,
educational performance. It's a work that would make any
self-respecting lobbyist proud.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Bagby promised to tell us how Generation X will
change the economy _ either through different work styles, buying
patterns or saving habits.
</P>
<P>
   What the reader gets instead is a book that asserts, in detail,
that Generation X is a victim of the economy. The issues certainly
are important and should be discussed. But this book is being
packaged and marketed as a glimpse at the work style and the psyche
of Generation X, and it falls short of delivering what is promised.
</P>
<P>
   A few nice touches make the book worthwhile. One-page profiles
of young entrepreneurs are sprinkled throughout, lending a human
face to the generational trends.
</P>
<P>
   But better editing could have made for a more palatable read.
Bagby cites some very relevant points, such as a survey showing
that more Generation X members believe in UFOs than believe that
they will someday collect Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But she takes those nuggets and mentions them over and over and
over, turning a clever insight into an annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   Bagby provides a good overview of the economic life and times of
Generation X but falls short of delivering a readable, useful look
at the generation's work psyche.

   ``Upstart Start-ups: How 34 Young Entrepreneurs Overcame Youth,
Inexperience, and Lack of Money to Create Thriving Businesses''
</P>
<P>
   By Ron Leiber
</P>
<P>
   Broadway Books, $19.95
</P>
<P>
   Learning by example is one of the best ways to be inspired and
pick up some great business tips. This book looks at 34
entrepreneurs who run businesses from a trendy New York spa
franchise to a company producing those magnets that let you put
your poetry on the fridge. Chapters on marketing, finance, business
partners, customers and consultants as they pertain to start-up
businesses are also included. Ron Leiber is a ``Fortune'' magazine
writer.

Profits and Expand Your Business''
</P>
<P>
   By Jeff and Marc Slutsky
</P>
<P>
   Career Press, $12.99
</P>
<P>
   This book has some good ideas presented in 52 quick-hit
chapters. Example: make customer complaints turn into more
customers by resolving problems on the spot, the authors suggest.
The complainer will tell an average of five people how the problem
was taken care of, they say. That chapter then goes on to talk
about resolving customer complaints, with a few pages of ideas. The
chapters are called ``thought starters.'' The authors run a
consulting firm called Street Fighter Marketing.

Whiskey and Winning''

</P>
<P>
   President Grant joins the ranks of Machiavelli, Attila the Hun,
and even Winnie the Pooh as subject matter for management books.
Although Grant was certainly an interesting historic figure, his
autobiography would probably be more informative than this attempt
at turning his story into management lessons. The book is scheduled
to come out in mid-October.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PEPPERWOOD, Calif. _ Three dozen awed spectators watched Tuesday
as a special team of state loggers brought down a majestic but
dying redwood tree that officials feared would fall onto motorists
along the famed Avenue of the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the only sign of the tree's demise was a slight
creaking that pierced the silence of southern Humboldt County's
redwood forest.
</P>
<P>
   Then a deafening staccato of explosion-like sounds erupted as
the 185-foot-tall giant splintered and came crashing down, leaving
the ground shaking.
</P>
<P>
   For several minutes, a thick cloud of dust and debris showered
down on spectators who had waited all morning to witness a
spectacle that few outside the timber industry ever see.
</P>
<P>
   It had taken two experienced timber fallers just 75 minutes to
fell the towering tree, which for 1,000 years had stood sentinel
over Holmes Flat, along the scenic route that is part of Humboldt
Redwoods State Park. The redwood, which measured 43 feet around,
was so large that had it been hauled off to a mill it would have
taken eight logging trucks to remove the wood, which could have
been worth as much as $80,000.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, state officials will leave much of the huge trunk where
it fell in the midst of other redwoods. A section of the tree that
dropped into a clearing will be salvaged for park projects.
</P>
<P>
   Loggers Bob Murdock and Darin Sullivan brought the huge tree
down. They used chain saws to slice through the tree's thick bark,
revealing the ruby-red interior that distinguishes the world's
tallest trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``''What an incredible sight! It was truly a once-in-a-lifetime
experience,'' declared Althea Relyea.
</P>
<P>
   Relyea and George Fielding, both Kelseyville residents, were
among about 35 utility workers, park employees and others who
gathered early Tuesday at the site after reading about plans by the
California Transportation Department (Caltrans) to fell the redwood
because of safety concerns. There were no protesters.
</P>
<P>
   During the past winter's storms, the towering tree began to lean
across the Avenue of the Giants, a 35-mile-long route that attracts
travelers from around the world. After months of monitoring, state
park officials last week finally approved the tree's cutting after
it tipped another foot within three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Few trees the size of the giant felled Tuesday are left
anywhere. In the surrounding Humboldt Redwoods State Park, home to
the largest contiguous tract of ancient redwoods left in the world,
the old trees are permanently protected from chain saws. They are
most likely to fall from old age or when their shallow roots give
way to strong winds.
</P>
<P>
   In some rare instances, however, a timber faller is allowed to
intrude.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We try to avoid cutting any redwoods within the state and
federal park system, especially the giants. But sometimes in areas
of heavy public use, we have no choice,'' said Ken Anderson, a
state park resource ecologist.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who reluctantly approved the tree falling after
prodding from worried Caltrans officials, breathed a sigh of relief
Tuesday after viewing the rotted core of the giant redwood's base.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the right decision,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   To make the final cuts, Murdock and Sullivan wielded their
6-foot chain saws while standing on a half-circle of old-fashioned
``''spring boards'' about 25 feet up the tree's base. They decided
upon the seldom-used technique because state park officials wanted
the towering stump to remain.
</P>
<P>
   Murdock is the master tree faller of a six-man Caltrans tree
crew that works along state highways from Sonoma County to the
Oregon border. Sullivan recently moved to Eureka from Ukiah. The
other crew members who practice a dying art include Jason Hayes of
Willits, Brennan Ladao of Redwood Valley, Carl Snibbe of Ukiah and
Shad Rose of Boonville.
</P>
<P>
   ``''It's not often that we get to tackle a tree this size. We
usually take turns so each of us get the experience,'' Murdock
said.
</P>
<P>
   Murdock has been falling big trees since he was 19 and fresh out
of the Marine Corps in his native Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``''We don't do this because we like to take down redwoods. We
do this because sometimes they simply have to come down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among spectators Tuesday, the adrenalin was pumping when Murdock
and Sullivan, their ``''tree saddles'' secured by thick ropes to a
nearby tree, swung free of the towering giant as it began to
splinter and crash.
</P>
<P>
   Murdock, once back on the ground, took it all in stride:
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, as a young man I felt a thrill when I cut my first big
tree. But now, I'm sobered by the fact that we can within minutes
cease existence of something that has lived for centuries. It
doesn't seem right. But I understand why I have to do it.''

defense this week, asserting that he still retains the moral
authority to lead the nation. At a forum on religion, morality and
politics sponsored by the Washington, D.C.-based Interfaith
Alliance Foundation, nine clergy members from various denominations
voiced support for Clinton, who faces impeachment proceedings for
alleged perjury and obstruction of justice in connection with the
cover-up of his affair with Monica Lewinsky. By Eric Rosenberg.

<P>
   CLINTON-RELIGION-BOS (Washington) _ As 3,500 members of the
Christian Coalition began gathering here for their annual
convention, Randy Tate, the group's executive director, said
President Clinton must resign and the November elections should be
a national referendum on values and morality. ``He is no longer
someone we can look to with moral authority in the White House,''
Tate said of the president. ``He has defiled the office. He must
step down.'' By Mary Leonard.

`A SOLDIER'S DAUGHTER': AN IVORY-MERCHANT STROLL ALONG A YOUNG
LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I'm a (italics)writer's(end italics) daughter,'' the young
heroine of ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries'' finally insists,
though her father, a World War II veteran, has always repeated the
title phrase in times of trouble. ``It's okay then,'' he assures
her. (italics)``They(end italics) cry all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   On the evidence of James Ivory's latest film, another thing
writers' daughters do is recall with abundant sensitivity the
experience of growing up in the shadow of literary celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Adapted by Ivory and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala from an
autobiographical novel by Kaylie Jones, daughter of the author of
``From Here to Eternity'' and ``The Thin Red Line,'' the film
describes how Charlotte Anne Willis (Leelee Sobieski) reaches her
own maturity while closely watching the world of her father. He is,
like James Jones could be, described as a writer of ``brutal but
honest'' prose.
</P>
<P>
   In a film that, like ``Jefferson in Paris'' and ``Surviving
Picasso,'' creates a colorful panorama of people and places while
also suffering from autobiographical sprawl, the
Merchant-Ivory-Jhabvala team brings as much careful detail to this
young girl's story as they have to E.M. Forster or Henry James.
</P>
<P>
   But with no real narrative shapeliness and a loosely anecdotal
pace, ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries'' must rely on more than
historical interest to hold attention. In Ms. Sobieski, who was
only 14 when the film was made and has the cool, alert look of a
younger Helen Hunt, the story finds a sympathetic adolescent
heroine.
</P>
<P>
   But Charlotte Anne (nicknamed Channe) remains a more slender and
peripheral figure than the film's wide-ranging ambitions require.
</P>
<P>
   If this anecdotal account of Channe's formative years lacks an
essential focus, it's also broad enough to accommodate a large and
interesting cast in supporting roles.
</P>
<P>
   The film begins with the lovely French actress Virginie Ledoyen
writing a message to her unborn baby, an image that will take on
added meaning years later when her son arrives at Channe's home.
The boy's name is Benoit, and he is welcomed in (for Channe)
bewilderingly short order by her parents, Bill and Marcella Willis.
</P>
<P>
   As Bill, Kris Kristofferson makes a gruffly affectionate
literary lion who can't easily pull off a line like ``I should be
there more for you, but this book's driving me crazy.'' As
Marcella, Barbara Hershey flaunts a garish exoticism that makes her
the most unpredictable figure in the story.
</P>
<P>
   In narrative sections that are named for three male figures
around whom Channe's life revolves, the film dwells first on the
events in Paris that cement Benoit's place in the Willis family.
(By his own request, he is eventually renamed Billy.)
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, with a diarist's thoroughness, Channe notices the
culture clash at her bilingual school, the boozily flirtatious
circle of friends around her parents, the startling vulgarity of
American children who come visit and an encounter with a budding
French rapist who tries to seduce Channe with the help of large
snails. (He insists that she take off her shirt and let them crawl
on her skin.)
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Ivory vividly conjures the family's bustling
existence on the Ile St.-Louis and watches as Channe forms an
important friendship in the film's middle chapter. ``I'm
(italics)crazy(end italics) about opera!'' exclaims Francis
Fortescue, a musical prodigy with a merrily bohemian stage mother
(Jane Birkin), as he blusters his way eagerly into Channe's life.
</P>
<P>
   Though Francis, played exuberantly by the newcomer Anthony Roth
Costanzo (who does his own operatic singing), is seen only in this
middle section and not heard from again, his character is treated
with particular fondness and fascination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Francis, both as a small boy and later as a teen-ager,''
Ivory has said, ``I lived a life of constant self-dramatization, a
fact most people meeting me now might not imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   The last and least centered part of the film chronicles the
Willis family's move back to the United States, where the film
describes high-school cheerleading as dutifully as it has an
avant-garde Parisian performance of ``Salome.''
</P>
<P>
   It is here that Channe's sexual awakening coincides with her
father's physical decline. ``I can't take any more emotion,''
someone says during this fraught stage of the story, but in fact
even the film's most dramatic moments are presented with
decorousness bordering on detachment.
</P>
<P>
   If this soldier's daughter never cries, that may be because the
colorful, rambling tale of her early years has few obvious moments
of high drama. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries'' is rated R (Under
17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes
mild profanity and sexual references.(end italics) &QL;

`SOMEWHRE IN THE CITY': A TENEMENT TESTAMENT LAUGHS IN THE
SHADOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Che, a gorgeous young revolutionary with a cell phone, is always
being interrupted by calls from his mother. Graham, a truly
talented actor and acting coach, is constantly being horrified by
students who know nothing (``Have you ever done any Chekhov? Ibsen?
Strindberg? O'Neill? Williams? Sam Shepard? Mamet? Neil Simon? Have
you (italics)heard(end italics) of these guys?'').
</P>
<P>
   Frankie, a determined but incompetent crook, tries to pull off a
jewel heist but is persuaded to stop and deliver a baby. Lu Lu is a
young virgin from China who is willing to marry just about anybody
for a green card. Betty is a single white vegetarian who talks to
teddy bears and screams a lot during sex. She appears to be a
therapy patient but turns out to be the therapist. There are
others.
</P>
<P>
   These characters live in the same dumpy Manhattan building and
inhabit ``Somewhere in the City,'' a well-intentioned but basically
baffling film billed as a ``noir screwball comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Great concept, but easier to imagine than to pull off. Ramin
Niami, the director, co-writer and co-producer, an Iranian living
in New York, says he was inspired by Maxim Gorky's ``Lower Depths''
(which he felt he was living while staying in an illegal sublet on
East Third Street).
</P>
<P>
   Some of the vignettes are funny, and Niami has a good eye for
the residents of the city's underbelly. But in the end, the result
is a jumble of sketches trying a little too hard to be delightfully
wacky.
</P>
<P>
   The cast generally does a nice job. Peter Stormare is
particularly strong as Graham, who is strong and completely in
charge until a young man he is obviously secretly in love with
walks in. Paul Anthony Stewart is also appealingly helpless as Che.
</P>
<P>
   But Sandra Bernhard, a brilliant comedian and a star attraction,
plays Betty in a sort of throwaway acting style that makes her
stand out like a self-conscious diva in a chorus line. The former
Mayor Ed Koch turns up in a cameo as a kidnap victim. For a guy who
can't act and knows it, he does very well. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SOMEWHERE IN THE CITY
</P>
<P>
   Written and directed by Ramin Niami; co-written by Patrick
Dillon, inspired by Maxim Gorky's ``Lower Depths''; director of
photography, Igor Sunara; music by John Cale; production designer,
Lisa Albin; produced by Niami and Karen Robson; released by
Artistic License Films. At the Quad Cinema, 34 West 13th Street,
Greenwich Village. Running time: 90 minutes. This film is not
rated. &QL;

HYDE AND RODINO FORM THE LINK BETWEEN NIXON AND CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For Release Sunday, September 20)   (For Use By the New York Times News Service Clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c. 1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the evening of July 27, 1974, after the House
Judiciary Committee had approved its first article of impeachment
against President Richard Nixon, committee chairman Peter Rodino of
New Jersey hurried to his office to telephone his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pray that we did the right thing,'' said the shaken and
perspiring 65-year-old New Jersey congressman. ``I (had) hoped it
didn't have to be this way.''
</P>
<P>
   According the account of the incident contained in ``The Final
Days,'' by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, Rodino, a Democrat and
decorated World War II combat veteran, was trembling and his eyes
were filled with tears when he emerged from the committee room. By
a vote of 27-11, the committee had charged Nixon with obstruction
of justice in trying to coverup the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt said last week is that the
power of impeachment is, next to a declaration of war, the most
important action the members of Congress can take.
</P>
<P>
   Only once in U.S. history has the House voted to impeach the
president. That action in 1868 was led by Republican radicals
seeking to oust Andrew Johnson from the White House because of his
post-Civil War policies of reconciliation with the defeated South.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's embattled presidency was saved by a single vote in the
Senate, which sits in judgment in impeachment trials and must
muster a two-thirds tally to convict. The charges against Johnson,
who succeeded to the presidency on the death of Abraham Lincoln,
were purely political and had nothing to do with the constitutional
requirement that a president can be impeached only for treason,
bribery or high crimes and misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   Rodino in 1974, like the courageous senators who helped
exonerate Johnson in 1868, met history head-on and etched his name
forever in its pages. After the July 27 action, the Judiciary
Committee passed two more articles of impeachment and, on August 9,
Nixon resigned before the full House had even taken up the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is Henry Hyde's turn. He was elected to the House from
Illinois three months after Nixon bowed out. When he took his seat
on the Judiciary Committee, Rodino still was chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, an articulate, white-maned 74-year-Republican from
suburban Chicago, found himself in controversy last week over an
extra-marital affair he had with a married woman from 1965 to 1969.
Hyde dismissed the revelation, saying: ``The statute of limitations
has long since passed on my youthful indiscretions.''
</P>
<P>
   History's important events sometimes are stitched together in
improbable ways. In the case of Nixon's troubles and those of
Clinton, the continuity is embodied in two men from very different
backgrounds and different political parties, Hyde and Rodino.
</P>
<P>
   But they have some qualities in common. Both are regarded by
their congressional colleagues as men of integrity and fairness.
Both also are Catholics who saw military service in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In the current House, no member on either side of the aisle is
more highly regarded than Hyde. If a Democratic president must
trust his fate to a Republican, he could find no more decent
Republican than the gentleman from Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   As with Rodino, Hyde must undertake an onerous task that could
lead to the president of the United States being found guilty of
conduct that falls under the umbrella erected by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   He and the committee's top Democrat, John Conyers of Michigan,
have pledged to conduct the probe in a strictly bi-partisan manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this ordeal is over,'' Hyde told the House, ``...we will
have vindicated the rule of law...(which) is the only alternative
to tyranny.''
</P>
<P>
   But the impeachment process is not one that every member of
Congress wants to be involved with _ especially when public opinion
polls continue to demonstrate that roughly 60 percent of the public
supports Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In his memoirs, the late Speaker of the House, ``Tip'' O'Neill,
recorded a similar attitude toward the impeachment of Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, most members in both parties were bitterly opposed
to the idea of impeachment proceedings,'' wrote O'Neill, who was
majority leader at the time. ``For a long time, nobody even wanted
to talk about it. Congress hadn't dealt with a situation like this
for a century, and most of the members didn't want to touch it.
Perhaps, if they ignored it, the whole sordid business would just
go away.''
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, it didn't go away.
</P>
<P>
   It was O'Neill's opinion that Nixon's downfall ``was almost
guaranteed'' in 1972 when 30-year-old Elizabeth Holtzman beat
84-year-old Emanuel Celler, the long-time Judiciary Committee
chairman, in a Democratic primary in Brooklyn. With Celler out,
Rodino moved up to the chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celler was no friend of the president,'' O'Neill explained,
``but he would have insisted either that the charges against Nixon
were too weak to be taken seriously or that the whole issue was
beyond the scope of his committee.''
</P>
<P>
   The former speaker conceded that he gave Rodino a hard time
because the new chairman moved so cautiously and so slowly during
the Watergate investigation. But, O'Neill added, ``when the rest of
us are all forgotten, he's the one who will be in the history
books. People forget who worked behind the scenes, but they
remember what the results were...And they remember that Peter
Rodino performed his duties so carefully and so well.''
</P>
<P>
   If Henry Hyde fulfills his pledge to conduct hearings into
Clinton's behavior fairly and in a bi-partisan manner, someday the
same can be said of his performance in a constitutional crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the House, Hyde recalled Theodore Roosevelt's
declaration that ``no man is above the law and no man is below the
law.'' Paraphrasing Roosevelt, he then said that ``no man is above
the Constitution and no man is below the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution is in good hands when those hands belong to men
like Henry Hyde of Chicago and Peter Rodino of Newark.

`RUSH HOUR': KICKS, SWIVELS AND WISECRACKS ON HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the set of funny outtakes that end the Jackie Chan vehicle
``Rush Hour,'' Chan is seen delighting in the way Chris Tucker, who
appears with him in this kick-happy buddy film, messes up his one
line of Chinese dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Ha! Now somebody else knows how it feels. Chan's own struggle
with the language barrier has made him not only the current author
least likely to have written his own English autobiography (``I am
Jackie Chan'') but also a relatively silent partner in this film.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, being the Buster Keaton of martial arts, he makes a
doleful expression and comedic physical grace take the place of
small talk.
</P>
<P>
   In a story that treats cliche as a virtue, Chan and Tucker play
one of those odd-couple police teams who grouse and fight for the
first half-hour, then turn into pals for the rest of the adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Chan plays an ace Hong Kong detective who is summoned to America
when the Chinese consul's daughter is kidnapped. He arrives here as
a trim, extremely sporty tourist, the sort who can hang on to a
Hollywood Boulevard road sign from the top of a double-decker bus,
then vault through a mobile home and flip into a taxi.
</P>
<P>
   At regular intervals the film stops short for similiarly nifty
Chan choreography, letting the star flip, swivel, scamper up walls
and hurl large objects with his feet.
</P>
<P>
   His prankster's ease at such moments is the biggest selling
point of Brett Ratner's lively but routine action story, which
involves a conspiratorial Hong Kong crime lord whose tentacles
reach across the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Much screen time is also devoted to Tucker's more manic and
truculent version of Eddie Murphy's ``Beverly Hills Cop''
character. Tucker wisecracks tirelessly and works references to the
human posterior into just about everything he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rush Hour,'' a fancier than usual showcase for Chan's poise
and agility, features all the obligatory scenes in which the two
main characters enhance their buddyhood. Chan shows Chinese food to
his partner; Tucker teaches Chan to dance; Chan perfects a delicate
little glide for hopping into Tucker's black Corvette convertible.
</P>
<P>
   These minor bits of business are often more amusing than the
putative plot, which holds less mystery than it ought to. Third
billing for debonair Tom Wilkinson, who was so wonderful in ``The
Full Monty'' and appears only fleetingly in the film's first hour,
gives too much away. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)``Rush Hour'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly
cautioned). It includes jokey, balletic violence and jive profanity
from Tucker that's mild but nonstop.(end italics) &QL;

IMPEACHMENT QUESTION: IS PERJURY AN IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE?

 (For release Sunday, Sept. 20)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With President Clinton widely accused of perjury
for twice denying under oath that he had sex with Monica Lewinsky,
the House Judiciary Committee will have to determine whether lying
under oath is an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   How that issue is resolved will be crucial when the House
Judiciary Committee measures the charges in the report by
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr against the constitutional
definition of impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton legal team is claiming that perjury in the context
of private misconduct is not an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Private misconduct, or even public misconduct short of an
offense against the state, is not redressable by impeachment,''
Clinton's lawyers, David Kendall and White House Counsel Charles
F.C. Ruff, argued in their rebuttal to Starr.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, lying under oath about official government
business would be impeachable, but lying to cover up an
inappropriate relationship would not be.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall and Ruff cited Alexander Hamilton's statement that
impeachment is appropriate for ``the abuse of violation of some
public trust,'' and that the misdeeds of the accused must ``relate
chiefly to injuries done to the society itself.''
</P>
<P>
   To Starr, however, adherence to the law is the very essence of
the president's public function.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the president's constitutional responsibility to ``take
care that the laws be faithfully executed,'' the Starr report said:
``The president has a manifest duty to insure that his conduct at
all times complies with the law of the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the Judiciary Committee have already debated
whether lies to cover up an illicit sexual relationship are ``high
crimes and misdemeanors'' that warrant impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., tended to side with the president's
lawyers. She told CNN's ``Crossfire'' last week that the purpose of
impeachment ``is not to punish misbehavior on the part of the
president, but to protect the country from serious misbehavior that
would threaten the constitutional form of government,'' said
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., on the same program, responded that
perjury is not something that can be brushed off lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though it might not affect the constitutional form of
government, it certainly ... has a tremendous impact on our
institutions of democracy and our criminal justice system,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report alleges Clinton lied when he:
</P>
<P>
   _ Denied in his January deposition in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment case that he had sex with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   _ Repeated that denial in his Aug. 17 grand jury testimony when
he continued to insist his previous testimony was truthful. Clinton
also denied he touched or fondled Lewinsky despite her grand jury
testimony to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   _ Claimed not to recall whether he had ever been alone with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   _ Claimed not to recall the quantity and type of gifts the two
exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, legal scholars also disagree on whether perjury
about private activities could amount to ``high crimes and
misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Low Bloch, a constitutional law professor at Georgetown
University, leans toward Starr's position when she argues that
presidential perjury can be impeachable because ``he is the person
who is supposed to take care that the laws are faithfully
executed.''
</P>
<P>
   However, she added, ``just because something is impeachable
doesn't mean you have to impeach ... The purpose of giving Congress
impeachment power instead of the courts is to give the country a
mechanism if the public loses confidence in the president.''
</P>
<P>
   A contrary standard was voiced by Mark Tushnet, associate dean
at Georgetown University law school.
</P>
<P>
   While lying under oath is ``a public act,'' Tushnet said,
Clinton's lawyers appear to argue that since ``private conduct'' is
at issue, perjury about that conduct is not impeachable because the
lying is ``bound up with private activity.''

   PERJURY-IMPEACHMENT (Washington) _ With President Clinton widely
accused of perjury for denying that he had sexual relations with
Monica Lewinsky, the House Judiciary Committee will have to
determine whether lying under oath is an impeachable offense. The

   THOMPSON-COLUMN (Washington) _ Impeaching the president is a
decision that House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt said is next to a
declaration of war in terms of the most important action the
members of Congress can take. Congress' first brush with
impeachment occurred in 1868, when Republican radicals sought
unsuccessfully to oust Andrew Johnson from the White House because
of his post-Civil War policies of reconciliation with the defeated

   BBN-ASTROS (Houston) _ The impact of the Randy Johnson trade has
been felt in many ways for the Houston Astros. The team won 31 of
its next 40 games to vault into the upper echelon of baseball. The
franchise has drawn the five biggest crowds in team history since
Johnson's arrival. But the biggest impact has been on his
teammates, who have collectively lifted their game to a new level.

 &HT;    $500 MILLION-PLUS IN THE HOLE, US BUSINESSES MULL FATE IN RUSSIA
 &HT;    (ED: With optional add beginning at 750 words.)
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (f) Financial
categories.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ American and other multinational corporations doing
business in Russia have lost nearly $500 million so far in the
country's severe economic crisis, and some companies could pull out
of the shriveling market altogether.
</P>
<P>
   In a disastrous month that began with the ruble's devaluation on
Aug. 17, many American and other Western firms -- including
SmithKline Beecham, R.J. Reynolds International and Proctor &AMP;
Gamble -- have been forced to lay off hundreds of Russian employees
and stop bringing goods to the Russia market because of the
paralyzed banking system.
</P>
<P>
   The situation could turn bleaker if Russia's new government
implements protectionist measures and Soviet-style currency
controls being considered to weather the crisis, business leaders
in Moscow warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want us here or not?'' Scott Blacklin, president of the
495-member American Chamber of Commerce in Russia, told a news
conference Thursday. It was a blunt message for Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov as he continues to form a new government and
construct a crisis plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We -- all of us -- believed in the reform process, believed
that real progress was being made, and it turned out that we were
wrong,'' Blacklin said.
</P>
<P>
   The further fall Thursday of the ruble did nothing to change
attitudes. The ruble ended the day at an official rate of about 15
to the dollar, and traded as low as 17 on the street. The Russian
currency was 6.2 to the dollar in mid-August before the crisis
erupted.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's central bank, now headed by a Soviet-era banker Viktor
Gerashchenko, announced that it would print more rubles to pay
state debts and wages to public employees, raising fears that ramp

 &HT;    CHECK-CASHING INDUSTRY SEES OPPORTUNITY ON THE HORIZON
 &HT;    With CHECK-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories for release Saturday, Sept. 19.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD and ELLIOT JASPIN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an odd twist of economic fate, a new federal
program to do away with paper checks is benefiting check-cashing
stores, which charge stiff fees to provide cash for a mostly
low-income clientele.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates and anti-poverty activists say the government
program, designed to save taxpayers about $100 million a year and
cut down on fraud, is inadvertently spawning what the Boston-based
Organization for New Equality calls an ``unholy alliance'' between
banks and check cashing stores that will cost the poor dearly.
</P>
<P>
   But the check cashers say they are merely providing a
much-needed service to people who have been abandoned by the
banking industry. ``We are brick and mortar'' in marginal
neighborhoods long deserted by banks, said Henry Shyne, executive
director of the National Check Cashers Association.
</P>
<P>
   And check cashers are fighting hard to maintain their hold on a
lucrative and nearly risk-free part of their business that will
begin in January 1999 when the federal government hopes to start
paying a majority of Social Security, veterans' and income
supplement benefits electronically instead of sending out paper
checks.
</P>
<P>
   Check-cashing stores, which are largely unregulated, have
traditionally existed at the fringes of the banking industry. Kept
at arms length by state and federally chartered banks, they have
prospered in low-income neighborhoods where, for a stiff fee, they
offer cash immediately for almost any check.
</P>
<P>
   But fearful that they will no longer be cashing the
approximately $16 billion the government sends out yearly to
Americans who have no bank accounts _ economists call them the
''unbanked'' _ check-cashing stores are making alliances with
financial behemoths.
</P>
<P>
   These alliances have already taken several forms as the U.S.
Department of the Treasury develops regulations for full-scale
electronic fund transfers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the SecureCheck program run by a check cashers association
in Illinois, for example, check-cashing stores anywhere in the
United States can set up special accounts for their customers at
Illinois-based Corus Bank . The sole purpose of these accounts is
to receive electronic funds from the federal government. Once the
money is in the account, the check-cashing store has the authority
to print a check for the recipient, then cash it. In addition to
the normal check-cashing fee, usually 1 or 2 percent, customers
must also pay a ``bank handling'' fee of approximately $1.10 if the
check casher is in Illinois and $1.60 if the store is out-of-state.
</P>
<P>
   Under another arrangement scheduled to begin next month, this
one sponsored by Shyne's New Jersey-based organization,
check-cashing companies will provide their customers ATM-like cards
to withdraw money from bank accounts controlled by Citibank into
which government benefits have been wired. Even though the
cardholders do not have traditional bank accounts, they can use ATM
machines or check-cashing companies and withdraw their money _ for
a fee.
</P>
<P>
   Shyne said fees will vary from state to state but could go as
high as $1.50 per withdrawal. He also said there may be
restrictions on how much money a person can withdraw at any one
time. That would allow allied check cashers and banks to reap
additional profits through the use of the funds without paying
interest to the customers _ a prospect Senate Banking Chairman
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., has called ``outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar ATM-style check-cashing programs are also charging
customers a monthly maintenance fee of as much as $9.95.
</P>
<P>
   Shyne argues that his group's fees are justified because of the
convenience they offer customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We provide location, service and convenience,'' Shyne said.
``Many check cashers are open seven days a week ... 10 to 12 hours
a day. They are located in neighborhoods where there aren't any
banks. I believe we are entitled to a fee for providing those
services.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials are not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's an environment where the check casher has no risk of
non-negotiability,'' explained Donald Hammond, acting fiscal
Assistant Secretary at the Treasury Department. ``They know the
money is in the account. They know the individual recipient is the
appropriate recipient for the funds. Yet they may charge a typical
check-cashing fee for turning that piece of paper into cash. That
seems at best a market inefficiency and at worst a potentially
abusive practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammond acknowledged that the federal government is concerned
about the alliances between check cashers and banks. However, ``We
don't at this point have any regulations governing those types of
relationships,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The unfolding relationships between check cashers and banks is
yet another step in the development of parallel financial systems
that has accompanied the income gap between rich and poor in
America: one for the affluent and a separate, more expensive
alternative for low-income families. These check cashers have
become more important for many middle- and lower-income Americans
as their real wages have shrunk over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The number of check-cashing stores has more than doubled to
about 5,600 since 1986. As they have expanded, check-cashing stores
have taken on a bank-like feel, offering a host of financial
``products,'' ranging from money orders to the latest promotion _
``payday loans'' with annual interest rates that typically range
from 400 percent to 1,024 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Today, annual business in what economists call NBFI _ ``non-bank
financial industry'' _ accounts for approximately $200 billion in
transactions, with check cashing the most profitable component at
just over $1 billion in profits on $55 billion worth of checks a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups are as outraged with the federal government as
with the check cashers and banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If alternative providers of financial services are permitted
to be conduits of federal payments, that would constitute the
federal government's blessing of grossly abusive practices against
low-income and elderly people,'' Margot Saunders, managing attorney
of the National Consumer Law Center in Washington, recently told
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In a study published in March, the Organization for a New
Equality concluded that unless the Treasury Department builds in
safeguards, including federal and state regulation of check
cashers, poor Americans will become increasingly reliant on
financial institutions that charge them stiff fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless something is done to protect poor people without
banking relationships, the cost to them could be enormous,'' said
Charles Stith , the organization's president.
</P>
<P>
   Check cashers have benefited from the consolidation of an
increasingly electronic banking industry with its minimum balance
requirements and rising fees for individual account holders and ATM
users. In some urban areas, check cashers, pawn shops and
rent-to-own franchises outnumber banks according to Stith.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department estimates as many as 10 million
Americans, or 20 percent of U.S. families, are ``unbanked.'' They
are the prime customers of check-cashing outlets. According to the
Federal Reserve Bank in Washington, four of every 10 ``unbanked''
Americans they don't have enough money to open or maintain a bank
account.
</P>
<P>
   But even ``banked'' Americans sometimes have to do business with
check-cashing stores, especially if they are one of the more than 7
million ``working poor'' in America with earnings near the official
poverty level but too high to qualify for most government
assistance programs.
</P>
<P>
   As he slumped on a bench in a downtown Washington check-cashing
store last week, Mamadou Traore, a native of Mali trying to start
his own contracting business, explained that he turns to
check-cashing stores only in an emergency .
</P>
<P>
   This ``emergency'' was to cash a $1,200 down payment check on a
$4,200 drywall job. He needed to buy supplies, but his bank would
not cash the down payment check for him. He had only $400 in his
checking account.
</P>
<P>
   Traore does mostly small jobs for homeowners. ``From A to Z _
the house,'' he boasts. Most months, he grosses about $2,500, from
which he must buy materials and tools and support his wife and two
children, ages 2 and 7.
</P>
<P>
   When the check-cashing store clerk handed him his down payment
money, it was minus the store's $120 fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much,'' he muttered. ``Too much.''

 &HT;    CHECK-CASHING INDUSTRY SEES OPPORTUNITY ON THE HORIZON
 &HT;    With CHECK-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories for release Saturday, Sept. 19.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD and ELLIOT JASPIN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an odd twist of economic fate, a new federal
program to do away with paper checks is benefiting check-cashing
stores, which charge stiff fees to provide cash for a mostly
low-income clientele.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates and anti-poverty activists say the government
program, designed to save taxpayers about $100 million a year and
cut down on fraud, is inadvertently spawning what the Boston-based
Organization for New Equality calls an ``unholy alliance'' between
banks and check cashing stores that will cost the poor dearly.
</P>
<P>
   But the check cashers say they are merely providing a
much-needed service to people who have been abandoned by the
banking industry. ``We are brick and mortar'' in marginal
neighborhoods long deserted by banks, said Henry Shyne, executive
director of the National Check Cashers Association.
</P>
<P>
   And check cashers are fighting hard to maintain their hold on a
lucrative and nearly risk-free part of their business that will
begin in January 1999 when the federal government hopes to start
paying a majority of Social Security, veterans' and income
supplement benefits electronically instead of sending out paper
checks.
</P>
<P>
   Check-cashing stores, which are largely unregulated, have
traditionally existed at the fringes of the banking industry. Kept
at arms length by state and federally chartered banks, they have
prospered in low-income neighborhoods where, for a stiff fee, they
offer cash immediately for almost any check.
</P>
<P>
   But fearful that they will no longer be cashing the
approximately $16 billion the government sends out yearly to
Americans who have no bank accounts _ economists call them the
''unbanked'' _ check-cashing stores are making alliances with
financial behemoths.
</P>
<P>
   These alliances have already taken several forms as the U.S.
Department of the Treasury develops regulations for full-scale
electronic fund transfers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the SecureCheck program run by a check cashers association
in Illinois, for example, check-cashing stores anywhere in the
United States can set up special accounts for their customers at
Illinois-based Corus Bank . The sole purpose of these accounts is
to receive electronic funds from the federal government. Once the
money is in the account, the check-cashing store has the authority
to print a check for the recipient, then cash it. In addition to
the normal check-cashing fee, usually 1 or 2 percent, customers
must also pay a ``bank handling'' fee of approximately $1.10 if the
check casher is in Illinois and $1.60 if the store is out-of-state.
</P>
<P>
   Under another arrangement scheduled to begin next month, this
one sponsored by Shyne's New Jersey-based organization,
check-cashing companies will provide their customers ATM-like cards
to withdraw money from bank accounts controlled by Citibank into
which government benefits have been wired. Even though the
cardholders do not have traditional bank accounts, they can use ATM
machines or check-cashing companies and withdraw their money _ for
a fee.
</P>
<P>
   Shyne said fees will vary from state to state but could go as
high as $1.50 per withdrawal. He also said there may be
restrictions on how much money a person can withdraw at any one
time. That would allow allied check cashers and banks to reap
additional profits through the use of the funds without paying
interest to the customers _ a prospect Senate Banking Chairman
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., has called ``outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar ATM-style check-cashing programs are also charging
customers a monthly maintenance fee of as much as $9.95.
</P>
<P>
   Shyne argues that his group's fees are justified because of the
convenience they offer customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We provide location, service and convenience,'' Shyne said.
``Many check cashers are open seven days a week ... 10 to 12 hours
a day. They are located in neighborhoods where there aren't any
banks. I believe we are entitled to a fee for providing those
services.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials are not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's an environment where the check casher has no risk of
non-negotiability,'' explained Donald Hammond, acting fiscal
Assistant Secretary at the Treasury Department. ``They know the
money is in the account. They know the individual recipient is the
appropriate recipient for the funds. Yet they may charge a typical
check-cashing fee for turning that piece of paper into cash. That
seems at best a market inefficiency and at worst a potentially
abusive practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammond acknowledged that the federal government is concerned
about the alliances between check cashers and banks. However, ``We
don't at this point have any regulations governing those types of
relationships,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The unfolding relationships between check cashers and banks is
yet another step in the development of parallel financial systems
that has accompanied the income gap between rich and poor in
America: one for the affluent and a separate, more expensive
alternative for low-income families. These check cashers have
become more important for many middle- and lower-income Americans
as their real wages have shrunk over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The number of check-cashing stores has more than doubled to
about 5,600 since 1986. As they have expanded, check-cashing stores
have taken on a bank-like feel, offering a host of financial
``products,'' ranging from money orders to the latest promotion _
``payday loans'' with annual interest rates that typically range
from 400 percent to 1,024 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Today, annual business in what economists call NBFI _ ``non-bank
financial industry'' _ accounts for approximately $200 billion in
transactions, with check cashing the most profitable component at
just over $1 billion in profits on $55 billion worth of checks a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups are as outraged with the federal government as
with the check cashers and banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If alternative providers of financial services are permitted
to be conduits of federal payments, that would constitute the
federal government's blessing of grossly abusive practices against
low-income and elderly people,'' Margot Saunders, managing attorney

increasingly electronic banking industry with its minimum balance
requirements and rising fees for individual account holders and ATM
users. In some urban areas, check cashers, pawn shops and
rent-to-own franchises outnumber banks according to Stith.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department estimates as many as 10 million
Americans, or 20 percent of U.S. families, are ``unbanked.'' They
are the prime customers of check-cashing outlets. According to the
Federal Reserve Bank in Washington, four of every 10 ``unbanked''
Americans they don't have enough money to open or maintain a bank
account.
</P>
<P>
   But even ``banked'' Americans sometimes have to do business with

`CHICAGO CAB': THE BEST TIP OF ALL: GET ANOTHER JOB AND TAKE THE
BUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is 6 a.m. and 20 degrees below zero on a late December
morning in the Windy City, and an unidentified cab driver (Paul
Dillon) picks up his day's first passengers, a middle-class couple
and their squirming young daughter who are on their way to church.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of entering his vehicle, the husband and wife
begin prating about Jesus and pressuring the driver to worship with
them. After nastily ordering their little girl to say how old she
was when she was ``saved,'' the hostile child mumbles, ``4.''
</P>
<P>
   These obnoxious, unbelievable religious fanatics are only the
first in a long list of irritating caricatures who come to occupy
the back seat of the battered, dirty taxi in which most of
``Chicago Cab'' was filmed.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which opens Friday at the Quad Cinema, purports to
show a typical day in the life of the driver, who is driven into a
screaming fury by the collective demands of his rude, often
pathological clientele.
</P>
<P>
   The overdrawn stereotypes include a taloned lawyer who claws at
him from the back seat and invites him home with her; a raving
crackhead in search of a connection; an adulterous couple in
sunglasses who exchange dirty talk and have quickie sex; a
shrieking, pregnant woman who begins to give birth on the way to
the hospital, and a couple of drunken businessmen from New York who
pick a fight by slinging crude anti-Chicago insults.
</P>
<P>
   All together there are more than three dozen passengers, most of
them walking (or should I say riding) nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with ``Chicago Cab,'' which Will Kern adapted from
an original play, isn't that these characters aren't recognizable.
It's that they're shrill one-dimensional exhibits in a cinematic
freak show that bellows a hackneyed one-note message: Hell is other
people.
</P>
<P>
   Kern's overwrought dialogue has the hammy desperation of
kitchen-sink realism trumped up for a playwriting exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The actors do their best to bring their designated passengers to
life, and occasionally they succeed against the odds. Some of the
better-known actors with cameo roles include Laurie Metcalf,
Gillian Anderson, John Cusack and Julianne Moore. &QL;

FAREWELL TO A PIONEER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c. 1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is sad to bid farewell to Geraldine Ferraro,
finished now in politics but immortalized forever in history as the
first and only woman to become the vice presidential nominee of a
major national party.
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade ago, she stood alone as an inspirational
professional beacon for women struggling to shake off the
traditional cultural and political shackles of gender
discrimination. And she did not let women down, despite some
predictable hooey about whether she knew how to bake muffins.
</P>
<P>
   But the defeat of her comeback bid this week is not a tragedy.
American women owed her a debt of gratitude for her political
breakthrough, but New York voters did not owe her a Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro, 63, was trounced in a three-way Democratic Senate
primary by a more energetic and articulate candidate, veteran Rep.
Charles Schumer, who is 16 years her junior. She said this would be
her last campaign effort to return to public service.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, it had seemed that her celebrity would make her the
strongest Democrat to take on incumbent GOP Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, a
tough street fighter. But she had been out of public service for so
long she couldn't remember how to run a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, by contrast, forgot nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In politics, timing can be everything. Ferraro's time had
passed.
</P>
<P>
   It was 14 years ago this summer that Walter Mondale picked
Ferraro, then a congresswoman from Queens, as his running mate. The
ticket carried only one state and the District of Columbia against
President Ronald Reagan, but nobody blamed her. Given Mondale's
weaknesses, he would have lost even if the Pope had been his
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   American politics has undergone a sea change in the subsequent
decade. International geopolitics has been transformed by the end
of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union. Domestically,
the nation has become steadily more conservative, moving away from
the traditional liberalism of Mondale and Ferraro.
</P>
<P>
   With many of their early goals achieved, today's feminists are
less strident and more pragmatic than those who were stirred by
Ferraro's nomination. Even Ferraro's pioneering role seems in
retrospect more like a quaint stunt than the powerful feminist
symbol it was regarded at the time.
</P>
<P>
   She demonstrated that she could hold her own in the rarefied
male-dominated atmosphere of presidential-level politics, shredding
a widely held public notion that women couldn't hack it.
</P>
<P>
   But her impact was limited to a brief moment in the sun. Back
then, she alone most embodied female empowerment. Now, there are
thousands of female role models, giving most women encouragement to
feel they may have the opportunity to go to the top themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It is the hordes of women elected to local and statewide offices
in the past decade who have made gender discrimination
unacceptable, both through their own example and the policies they
have pursued. Although Ferraro helped to lead the way, the real
work of integrating women into the major political power circles
and of advancing issues of particular interest to women was left to
others.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, when Mondale tapped Ferraro for the national Democratic
ticket, she was one of only 21 women in the House of
Representatives. There were only 2 women in the Senate. Women in
the Cabinet or other top-ranked federal jobs were rare. The
political dialogue did not include issues like sexual harassment,
family leave and day-care assistance.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 53 women sit in the House, where their presence is
increasingly felt on major issues and in leadership positions.
There are nine female senators. The secretaries of State, Health
and Human Services and Labor as well as the attorney general are
women. Two governors and 18 lieutenant governors are women.
</P>
<P>
   There was about Ferraro a sense of the distant past, rather than
the imminent future. She also tried to get to the Senate in 1992
and lost that Democratic Senate primary, too. It didn't get better
the second time around.
</P>
<P>
   Her presence in the marble halls of Congress might have evoked
some fond memories. But her absence sends no signal that the
growing importance of women in politics is ending. That goes on
without her.

`ONE TRUE THING': A TIME TO HOLD, A TIME TO GO HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes at end)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Meryl Streep first appears in ``One True Thing,'' she is
clownishly dolled up to look like Dorothy from ``The Wizard of
Oz,'' in a billowing blue-and-white-checked dress and ruby
slippers, her hair knotted in pigtails strung with ribbons.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Streep's character, Kate Gulden, the supermom to end all
supermoms, is throwing a surprise costume birthday party for her
husband, George (William Hurt), a college professor and author of
some note.
</P>
<P>
   Entering this suburban Oz, Kate's daughter, Ellen (Renee
Zellweger), an ambitious New York journalist, visibly winces when
Mom entreats her to join the jolly carnival and dress up as
something, anything.
</P>
<P>
   From this giddy moment, the film, directed by Carl Franklin in a
style that shrewdly blurs the line between tear-drenched suds and
serious drama, strips away the frills and pleasures of Kate's life.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the party, Kate learns she has cancer and
undergoes surgery. Ellen, sternly goaded by her father, reluctantly
takes a leave of absence from her high-powered job as a political
reporter for New York magazine and moves back home to care for her
increasingly ill mother.
</P>
<P>
   That old phrase ``You can't go home again'' echoes through the
rest of the film as Ellen finds herself in the excruciating
position of being a grown-up child in the house where she grew up,
forced to care for an ailing parent who is reluctant to surrender
control.
</P>
<P>
   As Kate's condition deteriorates, Ms. Streep's face turns ashen,
her eyes seem to sink into her increasingly hollow cheeks, and a
wool cap covers the stringy remains of her once lustrous hair.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the film's most painful scenes, Ellen picks up Kate,
naked and emaciated, from a bathtub that her mother has become too
weak to get out of on her own, and carries her to bed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Streep's performance is as uncompromised as any she has
given. Once disease has reduced Kate into a huddled ball of misery
and she announces in a dull hopeless tone, ``This isn't living,''
you feel her despair and wish her a speedy end.
</P>
<P>
   ``One True Thing,'' adapted from the best-selling novel by Anna
Quindlen, a former columnist for The New York Times, deserves
enormous credit for plainly portraying and exploring the
treacherous emotional depths of a situation that most of us must
face at some point in our lives.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zellweger's Ellen registers all the attendant emotions _ the
spasms of grief, sadness, helplessness, frustration and anger both
at the universe and at the dying parent for forcing her to
interrupt the independent life she was leading to go back home and
deal with a possibly hopeless situation.
</P>
<P>
   But since the Guldens are a loving, closely knit clan with
abundant resources who live in a roomy suburban dream house, this
may still be the best possible scenario for a story about terminal
illness.
</P>
<P>
   Because it's a square-in-the-mainstream Hollywood film, with
Bette Midler songs inserted to juice up the suds factor, ``One True
Thing'' isn't as powerful as ``Marvin's Room'' or ``Longtime
Companion,'' two relatively recent films that gazed unflinchingly
at mortality.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is also saddled with a mechanical structure so
unwieldy you can hear it clank. The story is told in flashbacks
from Ellen's interview with a grim district attorney who is
conducting an informal inquiry after an autopsy has disclosed that
Kate died from an overdose of morphine.
</P>
<P>
   Right up until the end, the film plays an annoyingly coy game of
whodunit to drum up a spurious suspense that taints the essential
human drama.
</P>
<P>
   If everything to do with Kate's illness and death and the
feelings they stir up cuts to the bone, the screenplay, by Karen
Croner, is far less convincing in evoking the texture of the
Guldens' family life and the reverberations surrounding the
revelation that over the years George has carried on a succession
of flings with younger women.
</P>
<P>
   The scenes of Ellen in her office and of her accosting a
scandal-ridden senator for an impromptu interview feel false and
trumped-up. The movie gives Ellen a boyfriend and a younger brother
who are so superficially developed they might as well not be in the
film.
</P>
<P>
   Although George is a serious intellectual, the Guldens' table
talk fails to capture the elevated conversational tone of an
academic household. And Hurt, saddled with dialogue that sounds at
once clunky and evasive, seems miscast as George. He is too suave
by half.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay does, however, capture the closeted egotism and
hero worship that grown-up intellectuals tend to camouflage under
high-flown academic airs. When a famous writer who was George's
college mentor descends on the household at an inopportune moment,
George turns into a gushing groupie who is crushed when his idol
can't remember encouraging him to write his first novel.
</P>
<P>
   But in outlining the psychological dynamic of Ellen and her
parents, ``One True Thing'' is bluntly, poignantly believable.
Ellen, who is Daddy's Little Girl, is loath to follow her mother's
example and be another supermom, yet she turns out to be a better
caretaker than she had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with her father's infidelities, denial and selfishness,
she reacts like an uncontrollably angry child. In evoking Ellen's
professional brass and the part of her that can still dissolve into
hurt rage when disappointed, Ms. Zellweger gives a performance that
is understated and entirely credible.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Ms. Streep's Kate is a bit too noble to be true and Hurt's
George a little too dashing, and Ms. Zellweger's Ellen a trifle too
resilient. But ``One True Thing'' is still real enough to be a film
you can believe in. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)``One True Thing'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly
cautioned). It has some strong language, and its scenes of illness
are harrowing.

WOMAN SAYS SHE DIDN'T KNOW HYDE WAS MARRIED AT TIME OF AFFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HENRY KRAUSSE  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTIONO _ The woman who had an affair in the 1960s with Rep.
Henry Hyde, the head of the House Judiciary Committee, said she
didn't know Hyde was married when they began their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Cherie Soskin said Wednesday that she had had an affair with
Hyde, who in turn acknoweleged ``youthful indiscretions'' after a
political magazine on the Internet reported the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, R-Ill., will lead the investigation of allegations that
President Clinton committed perjury, abused his power and tried to
obstruct justice in an effort to conceal an extramarital affair
with a young intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the process of starting divorce proceedings ... I was
no longer living with my husband,'' Soskin, now 62, said in a
telephone interview from her San Antonio home.
</P>
<P>
   She said Hyde had told her he was single.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not know he was married. He portrayed himself as a
single person and I didn't bother to check or anything like that,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Soskin declined to say at what point she found out Hyde was
married, and declined comment when asked if the revelation ended
the affair.
</P>
<P>
   Soskin did say her relationship with Hyde ended on amicable
terms. She couldn't recall when she last talked to Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even remember. You're going back over 30 years,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco-based Salon magazine reported the affair,
prompting Hyde, who is now 74, to acknowledge ``youthful
indiscretions.'' Hyde's wife, Jeanne, died in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have accused the White House of investigating the
private lives of key members of Congress, and characterized the
Internet magazine as being aligned with the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said Wednesday the magazine article was ``an obvious
attempt to intimidate me'' and vowed it wouldn't affect any
impeachment proceeding against the president.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of her affair with Hyde, Soskin was married and had
three children. Her former husband, Fred Snodgrass, told Salon that
the relationship hurt their children.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Hyde a ``super hypocrite,'' Snodgrass said he suspected
his wife was having an affair when she began staying out until 3
a.m. and coming home drunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was so miserable; she said she loved us both,'' Snodgrass
told the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Soskin denied coming home drunk and said her ex-husband was
publicizing her affair with Hyde out of ``revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a blamer. He could never accept responsibility for his
own actions and blamed everything on Hank,'' Soskin said.
</P>
<P>
   Soskin also said she did not want to become part of a media
circus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a very great life down here and I don't want it ruined
with all this craziness right now ... and my (former) husband would
like nothing better than to do that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The affair reportedly lasted from 1965 to 1969 at a time when
Hyde was just beginning his political career in the Illinois House
of Representatives. He was first elected to Congress in 1974.

   BALTIMORE _ Here's the unvarnished truth from Red Sox closer Tom
Gordon, minutes after he broke Jeff Reardon's club record for saves
with No. 41 in Wednesday night's 4-3 win over the Baltimore
Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm nervous every day,'' he said. ``Every day. I think that
may be one reason I come to the park so early, to get past it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Boddicker once said to me, `When you're not nervous, it's
time to quit.' There's nothing wrong with being nervous. Just don't
be scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night Gordon admitted his nervous system was on
overload. He tried hard, he said, not to think about the record.
His teammates reminded him of it, he said. So did family and
friends. There were six messages awaiting him when he arrived at
the team's hotel here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only one guy here had 40 saves,'' Gordon said, referring to
Reardon, the bearded one who saved 40 games for the Sox in 1991.
``Now there are two, and only one guy today has 41.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's a blessing. Thank God for that.''
</P>
<P>
   After watching Gordon's dress rehearsal for the role last season
_ he had 11 saves in 13 chances after taking over for the traded
Heathcliff Slocumb _ pitching coach Joe Kerrigan expected big
things from him. He's the one who had sold manager Jimy Williams
and general manager Dan Duquette on the idea and convinced Gordon
it was the best move he could make for his career.
</P>
<P>
   But 41 saves and counting in his first full season on the job?
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sitting around the hotel bar one night this spring,''
Kerrigan said. ``And I don't remember who said it, maybe (Bob)
Schaefer or Sammy (Ellis), but somebody said, `You know, if the guy
gets the opportunity, he can save 40 games.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, when you win 90 games, somebody has a chance to save 40.
So no, it doesn't surprise me. Not the way his work ethic is. Total
concentration.''
</P>
<P>
   The burden of the moment, Gordon admitted, caused him to depart
from his usual approach. He fretted too much about throwing strikes
instead of just throwing his ``nastiest'' stuff.
</P>
<P>
   That changed after he gave up a double to Cal Ripken and singles
to B.J. Surhoff and Lenny Webster, which cut the Oriole deficit to
4-3 and put the tying and winning runs on base.
</P>
<P>
   ``He turned it up to 97 on Becker,'' Kerrigan said, referring to
one of the fastballs Gordon threw pinch hitter Rich Becker, who
struck out for the second out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon then retired Robbie Alomar on a liner to Damon Buford in
center to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad it's over,'' Gordon said. ``I really don't know what
to do. I've never been in this position. Do I buy myself a bottle
of Dom Perignon?''
</P>
<P>
   What he should do, Dennis Eckersley said, is savor the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had a difficult job, especially in Boston,'' Eckersley
said. ``That ballpark is not an easy place to close games out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we wouldn't be where we are without him. He's as
much our MVP as anybody. If he blows four or five games, we're
scuffling.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The ninth inning may have seemed like an eternity
and the eighth inning only a little shorter, but after two straight
wins, the Red Sox are making pages fly off the calendar again, with
October dead ahead.
</P>
<P>
   With cardiac units on alert from Block Island to Old Orchard
Beach, closer Tom Gordon gave up a ninth-inning run on three
straight hits and put the tying and winning runs on base with one
out but recovered for his club-record 41st save in the Red Sox' 4-3
win over the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   The win, Bret Saberhagen's 14th of the season, preserved the
Sox' four-game lead over the Toronto Blue Jays, 2-1 winners over
Detroit Wednesday night, in the American League wild-card race. It
also reduced to eight the Red Sox' magic number for a playoff berth
with a dozen games left.
</P>
<P>
   Any combination of Sox wins or Blue Jay losses totaling eight
and Boston will be in the playoffs for the first time since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But those pleasantries meant little in the ninth inning after
Cal Ripken doubled off the center-field fence, B.J. Surhoff singled
him home, and Lenny Webster followed with another base hit, all
with one out.
</P>
<P>
   Was Jimy Williams nervous?
</P>
<P>
   ``He should have been,'' said Gordon, who had entered in the
eighth and retired Rafael Palmeiro on one pitch after the one
batter Dennis Eckersley faced, Eric Davis, bounced into a double
play with runners on first and second and nobody out.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the most I've sweated in a long time,'' Gordon added.
``I mean, it was hot out there (95 degrees at game time), but it
wasn't that hot.''
</P>
<P>
   How hot was it? It was so hot, Eckersley was sweating, too, and
he was sitting in the air-conditioned visitors' clubhouse at Oriole
Park at Camden Yards, where a crowd of 42,676 was imploring its
team not to lose here for the first time this season against the
Sons of Jimy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was not an easy win,'' said the Eck, who is now within
three of tying Hoyt Wilhelm for most career pitching appearances
(1,070). ``It was tough to watch that last inning. I'd rather be
doing it than watch it.''
</P>
<P>
   The doing was left to Gordon, after a visit from pitching coach
Joe Kerrigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I came in with a two-run lead, this was the
biggest game I've pitched in,'' said Gordon. ``I was so nervous. It
meant something to me. It meant something to my teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a chance to win two in a row, and I had a chance to
break a record.''
</P>
<P>
   Mission accomplished on both scores. Gordon struck out pinch
hitter Rich Becker _ with one fastball clocked at 97 miles an hour,
according to Kerrigan _ then induced Robbie Alomar to line out to
center. He thus broke Jeff Reardon's 7-year-old club mark and tied
Jose Mesa's 1995 major league record for consecutive saves in a
season with his 38th.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is awesome,'' said Eckersley, one of four relievers to
pitch in the eighth after Saberhagen allowed just two runs on six
hits, including Mike Bordick's 13th home run, and one walk in 6 2/3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking how if I had stayed in St. Louis, we would have
been playing the last month of the season with not much happening
(McGwire, si; playoffs, no). It would have been a drag. It would
have been hard to say goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this makes it exciting. Last winter, it was like, `I want
to play for Boston. I hope they have a good year.' Hey, just roll
'em.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight game, the Red Sox rolled out their bats,
too. They had 14 hits, their most in 22 games and the first time in
a dozen games they've reached double figures.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra had two doubles and a single and scored two
runs; Troy O'Leary had three singles, scored one run, and drove in
another; and rookie Trot Nixon, Williams's fourth leadoff hitter in
four nights, had two singles and scored a run.
</P>
<P>
   The game was close only because the Red Sox left the bases
loaded twice and stranded 11 runners in all. But they scored enough
for Saberhagen, who has won more games than in any season since
1994 and made more starts (29) than in any season in the last 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do the job well is a great feeling,'' said Saberhagen, who
received highlight-reel help from rookie second baseman Donnie
Sadler, who somehow speared Webster's bad-hop ground ball while
falling backward with two on and two out in the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time since I've pitched a meaningful game in
September. I did in 1995 with the Rockies, but my arm was already
blown out.''
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong with his arm _ or his heart _ now.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see why he won all those awards early in his career,
can't you?'' Williams said. ``The way he competes?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a tribute to the man _ and I mean the man _ on that
mound.''

   Fall Zombies And Ghosts
</P>
<P>
   Autumn sounds a klaxon in video circles: holidays, gifts, a raft
of low-priced titles.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when videos of big action films and other so-called
adult titles sometimes sell as well as they rent, this year's
selection of movies-to-buy moves far afield from the fare parents
traditionally scoop up for the littlest ones to watch over and
over. How grown-up they are depends on one's definition, but this
fall movies like ``The X-Files,'' ``Armageddon,'' ``Godzilla'' and
``The Mask of Zorro'' will all be officially priced from $15 to
$23.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with so many small children clustered at the sales
bull's-eye, stores are a sea of comic book action figures, ghosts,
witches, goofy-looking dogs and the goofier people who dote on
them. They've changed, though: as a genre, video entertainment for
the 8-and-under set has never been more accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, for example, Warner will release ``Addams Family
Reunion,'' a live-action feature starring Tim Curry and Daryl
Hannah, and ``Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island,'' a well-made 77-minute
animated feature based on the long-running television series.
</P>
<P>
   Next week Fox will issue ``Casper Meets Wendy,'' another live
feature, starring Cathy Moriarty, Shelley Duvall, Teri Garr, George
Hamilton (portraying a comically evil warlock who, like a
counterpart from another fairy tale, takes tips from a seer in a
mirror), and Hilary Duff as a child witch who, in a warming of
usually chilly witch-ghost relations, befriends the young (and
animated) ghost Casper.
</P>
<P>
   None of these films appeared on the big screen. ``Casper Meets
Wendy'' and ``Addams Family Reunion,'' of course, are derived from
bigger movies that played in theaters, following the lead of ``The
Return of Jafar'' (1994), Disney's straight-to-video sequel to
``Aladdin'' (1992).
</P>
<P>
   The hound Scooby-Doo and his human companions, from the reporter
Daphne Blake to Scooby's handler, Shaggy, who is known to eat dog
food, are also proven commodities. ``We have a library of
franchises we know people love,'' said Dan Capone of Warner Home
Entertainment. The idea is to cut costs, with savings passed along
to the consumer. ``Entertain the family without going to the
theater and spending, say, 8 bucks times four,'' Capone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island'' is officially priced at $19.95,
but straight-to-video titles often sell for $10 to $15. ``Quality''
means that the movie has recognizable stars and high production
values. ``It needs to be an idea that should get made,'' said Pat
Wyatt, president of Fox consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   A straight-to-video movie isn't necessarily cheap to make. Fox
won't divulge the exact figure, but ``Casper Meets Wendy'' cost
about $10 million. Ms. Wyatt said that sales should reach several
million copies. Promotion is important, especially with a multitude
of children's and cartoon faces grinning from the boxes of more
cheaply produced videos.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the promotion approximates that given a larger feature
film. Capone and Ms. Wyatt said that if the characters are familiar
and the film appealing, customers don't care whether it had a
theater release. ``People understand that direct-to-video isn't
what it was in the 80's,'' Capone said.

the identity of U.S. undercover agents, he becomes the target of
the oily Nicholas Kudrow (Alex Baldwin), perhaps the only National

   In his own quest to be a movie star, Max (Gheorghe Muresan)
learns to wear sunglasses and say, ``Thanks, man.'' Fired in
Romania by a petulant client, Sammy the agent (Billy Crystal) needs
another client. Up (and up) pops Max, who on size alone (almost 8
feet tall) makes good action-epic material. Max is also able to
vomit on cue, which can't hurt in a Hollywood movie. Even Steven
Segal (quite funny in a cameo role) feels threatened by Max's
height and won't appear on the same set. But Max is such a sweet,
loving soul that even Sammy is inspired to change his wheedling,
gouging ways in a film that ``affectingly describes the plight of a
good-hearted pariah'' (Janet Maslin).

the recently kidnapped sister of one of the boys. But only Walken
stays cool in a film that desperately wants to be hip. Though
there's nothing wrong with the performances, other principal

   ``JACK PAAR: AS I WAS SAYING . . . AND MORE.'' The 1997
``American Masters'' presentation on PBS, drawn from Paar's Friday
shows through 1965 and other material, makes up two 60-minute
tapes. For this video series, he helped put together a third hour
of his favorite moments throughout his career. Not to drop names,
but there are stories of dinner with Robert Kennedy and moments on

   ``THE EVIL DEAD.'' Back on tape after an eight-year hiatus, Sam
Raimi's first feature film makes George Romero's ``Night of the

the college-age crew who worked on the Raimi film) look like a
first-aid class. A camping expedition stumbles on slumbering
demons, striking geysers of gore. Depending on the demographics of
your neighborhood, the video's box will show one of three pictures
of the star, Bruce Campbell, on the front. In one he's a camper in
the L.L. Bean mold, unsoiled and looking alertly into the distance;
in another, obviously some scenes later, he's bloodied up and

`EAST AND WEST': A NOT-SO-FOND CHEERIO TO HONG KONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Hong Kong approached its return to Chinese control in 1997,
the governor of the British colony, Christopher Patten, was treated
with all the considerable vituperation of which the press in China
is capable.
</P>
<P>
   As he reminds us in ``East and West,'' his wittily
common-sensical reflection on his experience as Hong Kong's last
British governor, he was called ``the whore of the East,'' a
``serpent,'' a ``criminal who would be condemned for a thousand
generations.''
</P>
<P>
   China's official distaste for Patten led his original publisher,
HarperCollins, owned by Rupert Murdoch, who is intent on expanding
his business in China, to cancel publication. Patten does not speak
directly of this, although the fact is being used to promote the
book. Still, he might have had Murdoch in mind in a pertinent
passage on the ancient Chinese custom of kowtowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remain skeptical of the proposition that all boards of
directors are ethics-free zones,'' Patten remarks. ``It is just
that a few captains of industry work hard to give that
impression.''
</P>
<P>
   Patten gets in other licks in this book, which is a spirited
defense of his policies and a lucid analysis of some of the larger
issues that confront the West in its dealings with Asia. The most
important of these broader issues is Patten's eloquent and
good-humored repudiation of the idea that there are uniquely Asian
values that make Western human-rights criticism of Asian
dictatorships inappropriate and culturally biased.
</P>
<P>
   But Patten also covers such other topics as how to deal with the
rising strength of China (actually, he doesn't think China is going
to be all that powerful) and what has been learned about the role
of government and the management of economies from the experience
of Hong Kong and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Patten seems passionate and sensible, the master of British
understatement but also of the British skill at fighting back with
stinging words. He tends to be repetitive and to meander, so it is
not always easy to tell exactly what theme he means to be holding
before us. On occasion, he delivers a ponderous truism, as when he
sagely intones that ``corruption does serious damage in all
countries to the standards of public life.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``East and West'' is nonetheless a fresh, unblinkered and in
places iconoclastic look at Hong Kong, China and the West that
challenges some of the received wisdom on these subjects and
marches with spirit and independence toward its conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Patten's first chapters, about the final years of British rule
in Hong Kong, are the most concrete and interesting, especially the
detailing of his quarrels with China during his effort to establish
an elected legislature before the British lease expired. Critics of
that effort argued that it was unnecessarily provocative for
Britain to try to install a democracy in Hong Kong after failing to
do so for 150 years.
</P>
<P>
   Patten offers two rejoinders. He concedes that Britain failed to
make provisions for a legislature earlier, and he makes no excuses.
But precisely because Hong Kong was being turned over to an
authoritarian government, he says, it became a British
responsibility to insure that it had the tools and institutions to
defend its way of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the claims about democracy were not some trivial sideshow _
cakes for the public, ale for the press,'' Patten writes. ``They
appeared central to the government's understanding of its own
purposes and to its claims about its good intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   The other reason for pressing ahead with direct elections for a
legislative body, in Patten's interpretation, is that it was an
important part of the Joint Declaration by which China and Britain
had agreed to Hong Kong's reversion. This is not China's version of
matters, but ``East and West'' is Patten's book and he makes no
effort to spare Chinese feelings in what he describes as China's
Kafkaesque effort to undermine the spirit of that agreement, all
the while accusing the British of betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   ``One after another, Chinese officials _ over the table or from
the depths of their white antimacassared chairs _ would accuse me
of having broken the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law,'' Patten
writes. `` `How have I done so?' I would respond. `Show me where.'
`You know you have done so,' they would reply. `You must have done
so, or else we wouldn't have said it.' `But where?' `It is not for
us to say; you must know that you have erred.'''
</P>
<P>
   Patten is venting, but he does so not just against the rulers in
Beijing. Among his favorite other targets are businessmen and
diplomats who consider democracy culturally inappropriate, possibly
even harmful to Asian countries. Patten's position is that the same
ingredients that created prosperity in the West also work in the
East.
</P>
<P>
   Patten, a former Conservative member of Parliament, describes
what sounds like a conservative platform as he identifies these
ingredients: frugal government, low taxes, high savings and
investment, good education, the rule of law and a self-sufficient,
hard-working population.
</P>
<P>
   On the supposed role of Asian values, Patten notes that many of
that concept's most ardent supporters, who also criticize the West
for its high crime rates and social disintegration, buy homes ``on
America's and Europe's violent streets'' or send their children to
``the West's drug-infested, wildly liberal schools and
universities.''
</P>
<P>
   Patten makes an eloquent case for universal values, and for the
importance of human rights, even quoting that exemplar of Asian
values, Confucius, in support of his position. The arguments are
not quite original, but Patten gives them forceful and personal
expression in this heartfelt and clear-sighted book.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Wit'' is the chilling chronicle of a professor
dying an agonizing death in a teaching hospital. The instructor is
an expert on the 17th-century poet John Donne, which proves
entirely apt, because the performance at the center of the play is
pure poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Chalfant, the veteran stage actress best known for her
work in ``Angels in America,'' draws around herself the brittle,
unsparing aura of Vivian Bearing, the dying teacher, like a
frost-encrusted cloak. Vivian is a vastly recognizable character
out of academia: intimidatingly disciplined, accustomed to pushing
herself to the maximum and expecting her students to do the same. A
deep love of literature and a career devoted to analyzing Donne's
poems down to their punctuation marks have both sharpened her
mental prowess and limited her capacity for empathy; like a miler
in tip-top condition, she runs so far ahead of the pack, she no
longer thinks of herself as part of it.
</P>
<P>
   That makes her a wonderfully compelling subject for Margaret
Edson's brutally human and beautifully layered new play, which
opened Thursday night at the MCC Theater in Chelsea. Ms. Edson, an
Atlanta elementary school teacher who once worked in a hospital
oncology unit, is herself a lover of mind-expanding irony: she
finds poetry in the reading of a sonogram and science in the
deconstruction of a sonnet. It is no coincidence, either, that the
poem Vivian made the subject of her doctoral thesis contains
Donne's immortal valediction, ``Death be not proud.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, ``Wit,'' directed with care and clarity by Derek
Anson Jones, is an eggheady piece, continually drawing our
attention to parallels in the worlds of words and wards. (One of
the satisfactions is Ms. Edson's unabashed crush on language and
her skillful demonstration of the ways in which words both humble
and inspire.) But the play never totally leaves its senses. By the
moment of the stunning, final fadeout _ in this instance, actually,
a flare-up, thanks to the gifted lighting designer Michael
Chybowski _ you feel both enlightened and, in a strange way,
enormously comforted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wit'' was presented last season by the Long Wharf Theater in
New Haven with the identical cast and creative team; it has only
improved in its New York restaging. One advantage here is MCC's
claustrophobic space on West 28th Street. In a larger theater in
New Haven, Ms. Chalfant, dressed in a hospital gown and robe, and
wearing a red baseball cap to hide the effects of her character's
chemotherapy, seemed to discourse into a void. In the more compact
theater, it's as if we are sitting in Vivian's hospital room,
sharing her trials rather than merely witnessing them. Ms.
Chalfant, too, is more at ease now; the proximity appears to
invigorate her.
</P>
<P>
   Set in a research hospital in an unnamed city _ Ms. Edson
smartly provides only as much biographical detail as is absolutely
necessary _ ``Wit'' is a turning of the tables, a case of a
detached examiner who becomes an increasingly needy specimen. In
the hospital, it's the doctors who are emotionally at a remove.
Vivian's academic accomplishments mean zilch to them. What they
care about is the viability of her innards, her ability to
withstand the onslaught of the toxic chemicals they pump into her
body to try to thwart her advanced ovarian cancer. Vivian,
predictably, views her struggle as a graduate-level course in
humility. ``It's highly educational,'' she says of the degrading,
painful rounds of medical procedures. ``I am learning how to
suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Intriguingly, though, ``Wit'' is not so much concerned with
coming to terms with death, as with love. Vivian reveals little
about her history outside the classroom; no one, for instance,
comes to see her in the hospital. She neither expects nor rejects
the kindness of others; accepting or giving affection was
extraneous to her life of the mind, muscles she never exercised.
</P>
<P>
   In this regard she meets her match in her ambitious young
doctor, Jason Posner (the appealing Alec Phoenix), a brilliant if
heartless cancer researcher who looks upon patients as little more
than complex structures to be decoded _ not unlike the way Vivian
seizes on Donne's poems.
</P>
<P>
   It's not, however, the intense cerebration, in her career or
treatment, that ultimately consoles Vivian. ``Wit'' is an
exploration of what transpires when words fail, as they always
must, of how, in the end, art and science are equally useless,
equally detached. No, Vivian at last wants only to be enfolded in
the arms of another caring being, embodied in Ms. Edson's play by
one representative of the medical world, her nurse Susie Monahan
(Paula Pizzi), and one from the academic, her mentor, the professor
E.M. Ashford (Helen Stenborg).
</P>
<P>
   As played so warmly and affectingly by Ms. Pizzi and Ms.
Stenborg, the nurse and the teacher are almost fantasy figures; you
would want each of them at your own bedside. The nurse's defense of
Vivian's dignity, in the face of Dr. Posner's excessive efforts to
keep her alive, is both gentle and ferocious, an unvarnished
expression of respect. Ms. Stenborg, too, is sublime in a
heartbreaking, final scene _ perhaps a delusion of Vivian's
confabulating mind _ as she kicks off her shoes, climbs into the
hospital bed and reads to her dying acolyte from the tender
children's classic ``The Runaway Bunny.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chalfant's performance, as intelligent and uncompromising as
you're likely to come across on a New York stage these days, is
what matters here the most, of course. She hooks us with her
openness to the closed corners in Vivian's life, her own pleasure
in finding the sense of occasion in a woman's last, great struggle.
Ms. Chalfant is as convinced of the urgency of Vivian's story as
Vivian is in the vitality of Donne's poems. And she'll convince
you, too.

 &HT;    TECH INDUSTRY FRETS AS ISSUES LANGUISH IN CAPITAL
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories for
release Saturday, Sept. 19.
 &HT;    By MARY BETH REGAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the Upside technology ``summit'' this week at
the swank Mayflower Hotel, tech industry executives were offered a
field trip dubbed ``the DC Scandal Tour'' by a comedy troupe called
the Gross National Product.
</P>
<P>
   But the industry isn't chuckling at recent Washington
distractions, because lawmakers have failed to pass key technology
legislation in the midst of the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to do any business in Washington these days,''
grumbled Eric Benhamou, chairman and CEO of the $5.6-billion 3Com
Corp. of Santa Clara, Calif. ``And that's having an impact on
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Execs were counting on lawmakers to use the last weeks of this
Congress to push through bills on a number of key issues. But with
lawmakers caught in a constitutional crisis, the high-tech agenda
is getting bumped to back burner.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Trent Lott, R-Miss., admitted: ``We aren't doing
anything that takes two or three days of discussion. We just don't
have time.''
</P>
<P>
   The impact on the tech sector could be major, because even
free-market advocates admit some government direction is needed.
``These are very tough balancing acts,'' said Roberta R. Katz,
senior vice president and general counsel for Netscape
Communications Corp. ``Some say let the Net regulate itself, but
others acknowledge government has a role to play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are issues that need to be addressed,'' agreed David W.
Dorman, a former Atlanta executive who heads PointCast Inc. in
Sunnyvale, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   High on the industry's agenda:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Internet taxes. Companies such as America Online Inc. fret
that states may stall the growth of electronic commerce and the
Internet with burdensome local taxes. A ban on Internet access or
sales taxes is expected to become law, but the House and Senate
still need to decide on the duration of the ban, expected to be
between three and six years.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Visas for tech workers. Companies facing a shortage of workers
are pressing for an increase in the number of H-1B visas for
high-skilled foreigners. A measure that raises the ceiling to
115,000 per year in 2001 is pending in the House, but the White
House is holding out for additional protections for U.S. workers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Encryption. Programs needed to safeguard business information
and reassure customers in electronic commerce. Despite efforts by
the White House on Wednesday to relax export controls on encryption
codes, U.S. companies want to sell software and hardware with the
most powerful codes available globally.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Copyright protections for digital material. Business leaders
claim pirated software costs U.S. companies $11.2 billion a year in
lost revenue.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Digital signatures. The debate likely won't be settled in this
Congress, but next year, the Commerce Department may be directed to
set standards for digital signatures to be used for government
transactions such as renewing drivers licenses.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tax credits. Republican lawmakers are pushing to reinstate a
tax credit equal to 20 percent of research spending above an amount
tied to company receipts. Clinton has threatened to veto the entire
$80 billion tax package.
</P>
<P>
   To get tech issues back in the ball game, at least two dozen
CEOs blanketed Capitol Hill this week to press this agenda, as well
as broad issues such as fast-track trade authority.
</P>
<P>
   While the industry won't come to a standstill if bills languish
on Capitol Hill, whatever bills fail to pass before the 105th
Congress adjourns will die, and lawmakers will have to reintroduce
them in January.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook for the tech agenda is mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Executives will watch the White House closely for a shift on the
issue of increasing visas for foreign-born skilled workers, which
may win final congressional passage as soon as Wednesday. The
increase is critical, they say, because the current cap was reached
in May, seven months after the current fiscal year began last Oct.
1, and congressional staffers believe U.S. firms will gobble up
fiscal 1999's allotment even faster if the ceiling isn't lifted.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is balking at an increased cap unless a federal
regulatory agency is given authority to ensure that U.S. firms
aren't overlooking American workers to hire foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton is under pressure to please the tech industry, a
major financial supporter of the Democratic Party. Benhamou, a
member of the industry's TechNet lobbying effort, says it would be
``very unfortunate'' for Clinton to tarnish his relationship.
</P>
<P>
   On Internet taxes, most observers expect a moratorium to be
signed into law.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't cigarettes, and we're not trying to keep people
from inhaling tobacco,'' says Ross Garber, chairman of Vingette, an
Austin, Tex.-based software startup. ``We want to get people on the
Net as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Case, chairman and CEO of America Online, agreed: ``It
would be a big mistake to have 30,000 taxing jurisdictions impose
their own laws, rules and rates on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   It also appears likely that Congress will revive the R&AMP;D tax
credit, which expired June 30. But Clinton is threatening to veto
the GOP's entire $80 billion tax cut, arguing that projected budget
surpluses should be used to preserve Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   But there likely will be disappointment on copyright protections
and encryption. Some lawmakers, such as Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va.,
put chances of passing a digital copyright bill at only 50-50. The
House and Senate have approved measures to give digital works more
protection and they've extended liability protection to online
service providers for pirated software. But there's still debate
over the public's ``fair use'' of some information.
</P>
<P>
   Even optimists say legislation to address the encryption problem
isn't going anywhere. The Clinton administration took a step toward
relaxing export restrictions Wednesday by saying companies could
export software and hardware that uses 56-bit encryption codes to
all countries except seven suspected of terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's encouraging,'' said Gordon Eubanks, CEO of the $500
million Symantec Corp. of Cupertino, Calif., ``but it still doesn't
address all the problems.''

ANTIQUES: FURNITURE PACKED WITH SURPRISES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stars must be in an odd alignment. Normally, you
would have to go to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Louvre, the
Victoria and Albert or the Hermitage to see a Roentgen antique.
Now, for some reason, the firmament has released a few stellar
examples.
</P>
<P>
   Who is Roentgen?
</P>
<P>
   David Roentgen was probably the greatest German furniture maker
and certainly one of the most successful 18th-century cabinetmakers
in Europe. Goethe said his cabinets were like palaces in fairyland.
His 24-person workshop made furniture, clocks and musical
instruments for Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, Pope Pius VI and
Catherine the Great of Russia, yet he never abandoned his hometown,
Neuweid, a port on the Rhine north of Koblenz.
</P>
<P>
   In May, at the Christie's sale of the collections of the Princes
Reuss in Germany, there were three Roentgens for sale, including a
writing table with ormolu mounts, circa 1780, that sold for just
under $400,000, the top lot in the sale.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, Dalva Brothers on East 57th Street has two
important Roentgen secretaries, for $180,000 and $725,000. In
Paris, the dealer Didier Aaron has a pair of Roentgen mahogany
games tables, circa 1780-1790, at the XIX Biennale Internationale
des Antiquaires, which opens today and runs through Oct. 4. In
Munich, Konrad Bernheimer is selling a marquetry Roentgen table
with hidden drawers for $290,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely rare to find Roentgens, especially the late
18th-century neo-classical pieces,'' said Antoine Cheneviere, a
London dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the most famous ``French'' cabinetmakers of the 18th
century were Germans. Masters like Carlin, Molitor, Oeben, Riesener
and Weisweiler all set up workshops in Paris. Roentgen is so
associated with them that Christie's has put a tulipwood and
sycamore marquetry Roentgen games table in its ``Arts of France''
sale in New York on Oct. 23.
</P>
<P>
   The Roentgen story starts with Abraham, David's father, who was
sent to apprentice in the Netherlands and Britain in the 1730s.
While in London, he became a master at marquetry (veneers of wood
mosaic) and a religious convert. When he returned home, he joined
the Moravian brotherhood in Neuwied. He opened a workshop in 1742
and trained his sons. David, the only son to share his father's
religious devotion, took over in 1772.
</P>
<P>
   As Cheneviere writes in ``Russian Furniture'' (Vendome Press,
1988), David Roentgen had ``all the assets necessary for success: a
highly developed esthetic sense inherited from his father, fluent
French, polished manners, freedom from restrictions imposed by the
German guild (he refused to join), a talent for speculation and
audacity.''
</P>
<P>
   Though individual pieces of furniture may look spare, in general
the work is sumptuous in materials, design, decoration and
execution. The Roentgens excelled at trompe l'oeil marquetry, which
were pieces veneered with bits of wood or ivory to create pictures
in wood, mostly chinoiserie or allegorical scenes. They used
Caribbean mahogany, cherry, walnut, rosewood, beech, birch and
maple. The casework was enhanced with ormolu mounts, inlaid brass
flutes and brass fillets.
</P>
<P>
   The Roentgens were also known for their innovative mechanical
devices. Furniture doors would magically spring open, revealing
hidden drawers, music boxes, and writing compartments. Each games
tables that Didier Aaron has, for example, has three tops. Push a
button and up pops the first top, a square felt-lined surface for
playing cards. The second top is fitted with ivory and ebony inlaid
boards for chess, checkers and backgammon. The third has a
leather-covered top that can be inclined to become a writing desk.
The price for the pair is $900,000.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron's son Herve said Roentgen is back in fashion. ``David
Roentgen was forgotten in the 19th century because his work was too
simple,'' he said. ``Today people appreciate that simplicity, its
modernity, the superb quality and the sophistication of the
mechanisms.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Marino, a New York designer, said: ``Roentgen's
neo-classicism was the first breath of modernism. Americans like
his work the same way they like Russian furniture; they are both
knockoffs of the French, but the lines got straighter.'' (This may
also explain the admiration of Adolf Loos, the famous Austrian
architect who developed functionalism and denounced ornament in the
early 1900s.)
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Roentgen furniture costs a fortune. It may have
been unfashionable in the 19th century, but in this century
Consuelo Vanderbilt, wife of the Duke of Marlborough; Marjorie
Merriweather Post, and Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza have
all collected it. ``Roentgen was always the pinnacle,'' said Leon
Dalva of Dalva Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1964, a Roentgen marquetry commode a vantaux (a chest
of drawers with doors) sold at Sotheby's for $176,400, the record
for a piece of furniture at that time.
</P>
<P>
   David Roentgen was a good salesman. In 1783, he lugged 50 pieces
of furniture to St. Petersburg when he first called on Catherine
the Great. He presented her with a mahogany desk decorated with
gilt bronze mounts. It also played music, with two flutes and a
clavichord accompaniment. According to Hans Huth's book ``Roentgen
Furniture'' (Sotheby Parke Bernet, 1974), the Empress was
impressed; she paid him 20,000 rubles plus a bonus of 5,000 rubles
and a fine gold snuff box.
</P>
<P>
   But their next meeting didn't go so well, Cheneviere said. The
Empress received Roentgen, and they were conversing in German when
he started to proselytize. He told her he was against slavery. The
Empress got up and stomped out. The next day, she told him she
would buy two desks but pay for only one, to punish him. As she
later wrote to a friend: ``The furniture paid for, keys delivered,
he had to pack up his beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Roentgen sold dozens of pieces to Russian nobility,
which is why the Hermitage has a roomful of his masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   Fate ultimately turned against Roentgen. During the French
Revolution, his stock was liquidated in Paris. Furniture he had
made for the royal family was sold at official auctions. In 1795,
French Revolutionary troops invaded the area near Neuwied and,
according to Cheneviere, burned half of his workshop. He tried to
move his operation to Prussia but failed. He died in Neuwied in
1807.
</P>
<P>
   But the Roentgen legacy lives. On Oct. 15, the John Widdicomb
Company of Grand Rapids, Mich., will introduce an adaptation of a
Roentgen table in its new V &AMP; A Museum Furniture Collection. The
original, which was donated to the Victoria and Albert Museum in
1882, has an oval parquetry top (a geometric pattern in marquetry)
with satinwood and mahogany veneers and square tapered legs.
Widdicomb says it will cost about $4,900, making it the only
affordable Roentgen on earth for most of us.

ART REVIEW: GAINING PERSPECTIVE ON A GLOOMY ELEGANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the Mark Rothko retrospective now at the
Whitney, a question arises: what has changed about our perception
of him since the Guggenheim's big survey 20 years ago?
</P>
<P>
   Well, among other things, the messy legal battle over his
estate, which after several years was finally settled in favor of
his orphaned children over his dealer and trustees, is history. A
whole generation has grown up that either knows nothing about it or
doesn't care, as happens with all basically irrelevant affairs
eventually.
</P>
<P>
   We are also a generation removed from Rothko's original
hagiographers, writers steeped in the transcendental prose of the
1950s who dutifully followed his erratic lead. Volumes of citations
were culled from Jung, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Joyce, the cabala _
whatever could be used to prop up Rothko's messianic desire that
his colored rectangles be regarded as sublime mythic expressions of
a spiritual dimension.
</P>
<P>
   By the early '60s, the rhetoric began to cause even some of his
admirers to squirm. As Robert Hughes once put it, Rothko's life was
a ``long, troubled preparation for a failure that eluded him'':
increasingly rich and successful but always unstable and paranoid,
Rothko insisted on seeing himself as a victim. If anything, he was
a victim of the impossible pronouncements made on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   About his late paintings, for example, in which his palette,
like his spirits, darkened increasingly to gray and black, it
became a given among Rothko's biographers that these pictures were
ineffable tragedies on the order of Aeschylus, a view grimly
supported when he killed himself in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   The curator of the Guggenheim show wrote that Rothko ``had
attained a harmony, an equilibrium, a wholeness in the Jungian
sense that enabled him to express universal truths in his
breakthrough works, fusing the conscious with the unconscious, the
finite and the infinite, the equivocal and the unequivocal, the
sensuous and the spiritual.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't think so. People still sometimes write these sorts of
things about his art, but at least conditions have changed enough
that it is now conceivable to see his pictures in comparative
silence.
</P>
<P>
   Today, his last paintings above all seem gloomily elegant, an
expression of creative exhaustion: Rothko apparently had taken his
art as far as he could. He had spent more than two decades, since
hitting upon his signature mode in the late '40s, doing variations
on pretty much the same thing, and finally he ran aground, not
because there were no more color combinations to be tried or
arrangements of fuzzy rectangles to be fiddled with but because he
refused to concede that his art might be, in the end, about colors
and forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only that subject matter is valid which is tragic and
timeless,'' was his famous remark, which left him with the problem
that abstract art of the kind he produced could not, despite the
incantations of his worshipers, sustain all he had hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   It was resonant but obstinately vague. It could be awesomely
beautiful (Rothko's best paintings are some of the most beautiful
paintings by an American artist). but beauty can attach itself to
the sublime (Titian, Rembrandt) or to the merely decorative, and
Rothko's pictures have always looked alarmingly good hanging over
sofas in Upper East Side apartments.
</P>
<P>
   We forget how many New York School painters ended up facing this
problem. Motherwell, Still, Newman, Gottlieb: they all invented
trademark styles, apocalyptically symbolic but formulaically
repeated, which became the stuff of corporate lobbies. A painter
like Guston seems all the more remarkable in the context of this
generation for having abandoned, against everyone's advice, what
had made him identifiable. I suspect he was just trying to keep
himself alive as an artist.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change in Rothko's later years was to embark upon
murals. This must have seemed like a natural step. He'd made
increasingly big paintings, partly because he wanted his works to
envelop the people looking at them. But even the biggest pictures
were never quite wide enough to span a viewer's visual field.
Murals commanded a whole environment. In his mind the idea recalled
Pompeii and the Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the projects never quite panned out as he
envisioned them. He withdrew from the commission to decorate the
Four Seasons restaurant, giving some of the works to a museum
instead; his murals in a Harvard dining hall ended up ruined. A
restaurant and a college dining hall aren't exactly dream sites for
a painter of his spiritual aspirations. Then there is the Rothko
Chapel in Houston, which many people admire. It seems theatrical
and strained to me, a vacant space.
</P>
<P>
   Do I sound down on Rothko? I am not, but his case, more than
most, begs for careful modulation. If he had died in 1948, when he
was already 45, he would be virtually unknown today. He began in
the 1930s as a fairly inept painter of unremarkable landscapes and
moody sub-Ashcan urban scenes that in retrospect obviously
contained elements of his mature pictures in embryo: architectural
spaces flattened into discrete rectangular forms or planes, the
forms stacked, with figures standing in front of them or apart.
It's a little as if these figures became the viewers that Rothko
later imagined looking at his abstractions.
</P>
<P>
   A Surrealist phase in the 1940s produced swimmy watercolors of
vague twittering shapes barely distinguishable from what artists
like Gorky, John Graham and Andre Masson were doing, except that
Rothko made something different of his thin washes and scraped
surfaces when, in 1947, he suddenly began to paint colored pictures
of diluted, randomly disposed blurs.
</P>
<P>
   He'd been looking at Matisse, and Milton Avery was always a
major influence. Who knows whether, to a lesser degree, someone
like Bonnard affected him, too, although Bonnard was regarded as a
decorative lightweight then, and Rothko, in the way that people
tend to reject whatever they are naturally inclined to, hated his
own work to be thought of as decorative.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, it took a couple of years before he stripped
away the squiggles and handwriting marks that were holdovers from
Surrealism and simplified his compositions to arrive at what we now
know as a Rothko.
</P>
<P>
   At the Whitney, the rooms of pictures from the next several
years of his career are astonishingly, breathtakingly moving. The
colors all seem to be ecstatic and springlike: chartreuse, pink,
peach, orange, saffron, lavender and white, layered in veils with
the quality of breath on a pane of glass.
</P>
<P>
   They radiate light. The images seem to project off the walls.
You stand in front of them as if before the sun, basking. There's a
sense of surrender by Rothko to some exquisite and mysterious new
discovery _ a feeling akin to new love. And it's shocking to see
after the rooms of his dour and unoriginal early work. Rothko's
progress had been incremental, building on itself, until he
underwent this change between the mid-'40s and the early '50s that
was his leap into history.
</P>
<P>
   Then what? Jeffrey Weiss, who organized this exhibition for the
National Gallery of Art in Washington, has tried to diminish any
sense that Rothko just kept doing the same thing over and over.
Quite intelligently, he stresses discrete groupings of works and
motifs. As the show was installed in basement rooms in Washington a
few months ago, it still seemed repetitive. At the Whitney, on two
upper floors in spaces of varied sizes, the same pictures somehow
look much better.
</P>
<P>
   Someday it would be good to see a Rothko exhibition in natural
light. It's not that he always painted in it _ sometimes he did,
sometimes he didn't _ but I suspect that changing as it does,
natural light would reveal how the pictures can seem to be organic,
shifting in appearance, chameleonlike. Part of their strange magic
is a palpitating luminosity whose particular meaning floats freely.
</P>
<P>
   About the Guggenheim show 20 years ago, Hilton Kramer said that
if, ultimately, there is a religious dimension to Rothko's art, it
is its estheticism. I agree. In Rothko's own depressive terms, this
may have constituted a failure, but it is a condition of his
abstraction.
</P>
<P>
   Important artists often don't achieve the goals they set for
themselves, but they achieve something else, which they may not
appreciate. Rothko was one of those artists.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark Rothko'' remains on view at the Whitney Museum of
American Art, 945 Madison Ave., at 75th Street, through Nov. 29. It
has been installed by Adam Weinberg of the Whitney in collaboration
with Jeffrey Weiss of the National Gallery of Art. The show travels
this winter to the Musee d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris.

 &HT;    TECH INDUSTRY FRETS AS ISSUES LANGUISH IN CAPITAL
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories for
release Saturday, Sept. 19.
 &HT;    By MARY BETH REGAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the Upside technology ``summit'' this week at
the swank Mayflower Hotel, tech industry executives were offered a
field trip dubbed ``the DC Scandal Tour'' by a comedy troupe called
the Gross National Product.
</P>
<P>
   But the industry isn't chuckling at recent Washington
distractions, because lawmakers have failed to pass key technology
legislation in the midst of the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to do any business in Washington these days,''
grumbled Eric Benhamou, chairman and CEO of the $5.6-billion 3Com
Corp. of Santa Clara, Calif. ``And that's having an impact on
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Execs were counting on lawmakers to use the last weeks of this
Congress to push through bills on a number of key issues. But with
lawmakers caught in a constitutional crisis, the high-tech agenda
is getting bumped to back burner.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Trent Lott, R-Miss., admitted: ``We aren't doing
anything that takes two or three days of discussion. We just don't
have time.''
</P>
<P>
   The impact on the tech sector could be major, because even
free-market advocates admit some government direction is needed.
``These are very tough balancing acts,'' said Roberta R. Katz,
senior vice president and general counsel for Netscape
Communications Corp. ``Some say let the Net regulate itself, but
others acknowledge government has a role to play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are issues that need to be addressed,'' agreed David W.
Dorman, a former Atlanta executive who heads PointCast Inc. in
Sunnyvale, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   High on the industry's agenda:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Internet taxes. Companies such as America Online Inc. fret
that states may stall the growth of electronic commerce and the
Internet with burdensome local taxes. A ban on Internet access or
sales taxes is expected to become law, but the House and Senate
still need to decide on the duration of the ban, expected to be
between three and six years.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Visas for tech workers. Companies facing a shortage of workers
are pressing for an increase in the number of H-1B visas for
high-skilled foreigners. A measure that raises the ceiling to
115,000 per year in 2001 is pending in the House, but the White
House is holding out for additional protections for U.S. workers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Encryption. Programs needed to safeguard business information
and reassure customers in electronic commerce. Despite efforts by
the White House on Wednesday to relax export controls on encryption
codes, U.S. companies want to sell software and hardware with the
most powerful codes available globally.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Copyright protections for digital material. Business leaders
claim pirated software costs U.S. companies $11.2 billion a year in
lost revenue.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Digital signatures. The debate likely won't be settled in this
Congress, but next year, the Commerce Department may be directed to
set standards for digital signatures to be used for government
transactions such as renewing drivers licenses.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tax credits. Republican lawmakers are pushing to reinstate a
tax credit equal to 20 percent of research spending above an amount
tied to company receipts. Clinton has threatened to veto the entire
$80 billion tax package.
</P>
<P>
   To get tech issues back in the ball game, at least two dozen
CEOs blanketed Capitol Hill this week to press this agenda, as well
as broad issues such as fast-track trade authority.
</P>
<P>
   While the industry won't come to a standstill if bills languish
on Capitol Hill, whatever bills fail to pass before the 105th
Congress adjourns will die, and lawmakers will have to reintroduce
them in January.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook for the tech agenda is mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Executives will watch the White House closely for a shift on the
issue of increasing visas for foreign-born skilled workers, which
may win final congressional passage as soon as Wednesday. The
increase is critical, they say, because the current cap was reached
in May, seven months after the current fiscal year began last Oct.
1, and congressional staffers believe U.S. firms will gobble up
fiscal 1999's allotment even faster if the ceiling isn't lifted.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is balking at an increased cap unless a federal
regulatory agency is given authority to ensure that U.S. firms
aren't overlooking American workers to hire foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton is under pressure to please the tech industry, a
major financial supporter of the Democratic Party. Benhamou, a
member of the industry's TechNet lobbying effort, says it would be
``very unfortunate'' for Clinton to tarnish his relationship.
</P>
<P>
   On Internet taxes, most observers expect a moratorium to be
signed into law.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't cigarettes, and we're not trying to keep people
from inhaling tobacco,'' says Ross Garber, chairman of Vingette, an
Austin, Tex.-based software startup. ``We want to get people on the
Net as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Case, chairman and CEO of America Online, agreed: ``It
would be a big mistake to have 30,000 taxing jurisdictions impose
their own laws, rules and rates on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   It also appears likely that Congress will revive the R&AMP;D tax
credit, which expired June 30. But Clinton is threatening to veto
the GOP's entire $80 billion tax cut, arguing that projected budget
surpluses should be used to preserve Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   But there likely will be disappointment on copyright protections
and encryption. Some lawmakers, such as Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va.,
put chances of passing a digital copyright bill at only 50-50. The
House and Senate have approved measures to give digital works more
protection and they've extended liability protection to online
service providers for pirated software. But there's still debate
over the public's ``fair use'' of some information.
</P>
<P>
   Even opimists say legislation to address the encryption problem
isn't going anywhere. The Clinton administration took a step toward
relaxing export restrictions Wednesday by saying companies could
export software and hardware that uses 56-bit encryption codes to
all countries except seven suspected of terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's encouraging,'' said Gordon Eubanks, CEO of the $500
million Symantec Corp. of Cupertino, Calif., ``but it still doesn't
address all the problems.''

<P>
   INDIAN-RESERVATION-TOURISM-NYT (Umatilla Reservation, Ore.) _
American Indian reservations, long considered economic deserts
amidst a landscape of general prosperity, are finding that they
have a lot more to offer the world than casinos and art galleries _
they have their homes, their backyards, their stories. Visitors,
especially a growing number of Europeans, are traveling to some of
the country's most remote places, like this Indian reservation in
central Oregon, in search of life many Americans overlook on their
vacations. By Timothy Egan. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-COLLINS-BOS (Antwerp, Belgium) _ St. Peter has confided
to a Belgian pal of mine that the commandment Moses overlooked _
the Eleventh _ is to be found right here. By Bud Collins.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-COSTARICA-COX (Alajuela, Costa Rica) _ How did I get
myself into this? Here I am, pedaling a 21-speed ``hybrid'' bike up
and down the mountains of Costa Rica. I'm bouncing along jagged
roads and squeezing the hand brakes at every downhill turn. It
sounded like a good idea at the time By Dale Fuchs.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-TOLUCA-COX (Toloca, Mexico) _ Toluca, Mexico, 40 miles
southwest of Mexico City, weaves an authentic spell. By Kristin
Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   LIMERICK-COX (Limerick, Ireland) _ even though Limerick ``and
the surrounds'' offer a treasure of Irish history, music, museums,
castles, gorgeous green hillsides _ and, a little farther out,
stunning ocean vistas _ the city's image has been that of a gritty,
blue-collar city.
</P>
<P>
   BRITISH-COLUMBIA-COX (Vancouver) _ During late July and early
August, Sally and I spent three nights in Vancouver, and two nights
in Victoria, on Vancouver Island, which is an hour-and-a-half ferry
ride from Vancouver. The only unkind words we heard during our
whole trip were from an old lady who was ragging on her husband on
the ferry from Seattle to Victoria, aboard the Princess Marguerite
III.
</P>
<P>
   SCANDINAVIA-COX _ (Oslo) _ On balance, we visit Scandinavia for
the pretty scenery and the pretty people. Yet Scandinavia deserves
an extended stay. Because these countries were spared the full
brunt of modern wars, their physical pasts remain remarkably
intact. Thus, the culturally curious visitor should make special
efforts to visit some small historical or art museums in the cities
of Oslo, Bergen, Stockholm and Copenhagen. By Michael Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   CALIFORNIA-COX (San Francisco) _ The descriptive term
``breathtaking'' is overused. Admit it, we all hate it. The canopy
of trees was breathtaking. Her beauty was breathtaking. The new
Mazda is breathtaking. Nonetheless, I'm traveling north on the
Pacific Coast Highway through Big Sur and I can't think of any
other word to describe the cragged cliffs, the crushing sea as it
meets the rocks. By Greg Kallenberg.
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL-COX (Montreal) _ Montreal offers a pleasant mix of
European and American sensibilities and features. With its museums,
first-class shops and ethnic neighborhoods, it does resemble a
cleaner, smaller New York. And because of its French heritage and
largely French-speaking population, Montreal does have a European
flair. By R. Michelle Breyer and Jody Seaborn.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-YOGA-COX (Nassau, the Bahamas) _ The boom of a gong
pierced the silence of the night promptly at 5:30 a.m., which is
mighty early on Paradise Island. This is the time to go to bed
after a night at the casinos and bars, not to get up to meditate
and to do yoga positions that turn your body into a pretzel. Do
people really want to do this on vacation? By Cheryl Blackerby.
</P>
<P>
   TRAILSEND-COX (Trails End, Minn.) _ It's clear paddling into the
Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness that the name refers to more
than just the border between the United States and Canada. This is
the boundary line past which superfluous things like money and cars
and TV Guide don't matter _ or even are usable. Of course, a light
canoe helps in that quest, as we found out the hard way. By Chris
Riemenschneider.
</P>
<P>
   KINGSVILLE-TX-COX _ The getaway just keeps getting better, as
the Youngs take B-Bar-B in Kingsville, Texas, from its beginnings
as a hunting lodge into a year-round resort stop for hunters,
birders, tourists and adults just wanting to hide out in comfort
for a few days. By Mike Leggett.
</P>
<P>
   HOME-ALCOTT-BOS (Concord, Mass.) _ _ Fans of Louisa May Alcott
have an image of the March family home she evokes in ``Little
Women.'' It comes as a shock to many to see the Victorian reality
of Orchard House, where part of the novel was written in 1868. By
Margo Miller.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-SAFRICA-NYT (Johannesburg, South Africa) _ South Africa
learns that tourism is fragile. By Donald G. McNeil Jr.

Her favorite island is Jamaica. ``Don't you find some people there
a tad aggressive toward tourists?'' I asked. ``Oh, they don't
bother me ... I only go to the all-inclusive resorts and never
leave until it's time to fly home.'' How sad. By Harry Shattuck.

 (Attn: N.J., Md.)   (af)  
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Shortly after he finished the film ``Happiness'' Todd
Solondz, its writer-director, changed the telephone listing in his
New York apartment and got an unlisted number.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am nervous,'' the 38-year-old filmmaker said quietly. ``The
film is unsettling. It's disturbing. There are crazy people out
there. There are people who may have a strong reaction to it.''
</P>
<P>
   No one would disagree with him.
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour and 15-minute film, which opens next month, has
been the talk of the Toronto Film Festival. A startling and
depressing vision of the middle class, the film largely focuses on
the lives of three sisters in New Jersey (as well as their unhappy
parents in Florida) and the secrets that shape them.
</P>
<P>
   One of the sisters, the most chirpy and self-satisfied, is a
married homemaker whose husband, a psychiatrist, molests little
boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in pedophilia, per se, I don't know
anything about it,'' Solondz said. ``It was a way of me exploring
themes of greater interest to me, themes of alienation, desire,
connection, disconnection.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``As far as that subject goes, there's nothing taboo
in this movie that you can't see addressed or discussed in any
tabloid or talk show any day of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   Solondz made another bleak but far less controversial 1995 film,
``Welcome to the Dollhouse,'' about an 11-year-old girl with
unloving parents and no friends. The relative success of that film
_ it cost less than $1 million and grossed $5 million _ opened the
way for October Films to spend $2.5 million on ``Happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   But October Films was forced by its parent, Universal Pictures,
to drop the movie because of its content. It will be released by
Good Machine, a production company, with no rating.
</P>
<P>
   The film has several overlapping stories about relationships,
all of them, more or less, hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially the film is a series of love stories on the
simplest level,'' Solondz said. ``I never wanted to shock _ that
doesn't interest me.''
</P>
<P>
   The film has no nudity, but it has several powerful scenes, none
more shocking than a dialogue near the finale between the
pedophile, who has been unmasked, and his young son who questions
him as brutally as the father answers the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Solondz said the idea of writing about a pedophile came several
years ago when he read a newspaper article about a fact-based HBO
drama, ``Citizen X,'' which dealt with a Russian investigation of a
serial killer of children. ``What struck me was that the article
said that he had a wife and two children _ and I had to know, what
is that really about, what does that mean, how does that exist?''
</P>
<P>
   Solondz said he was aware that many viewers will be repelled.
``What excites me, what gets me moving, is trying to look at
characters who in any other movie would be the villain or a
demon,'' he said. ``There's nothing more bracing than in fact
trying to dig underneath that veneer and discovering what makes
them tick.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that before making the movie, he assessed classics like
Fritz Lang's harrowing ``M,'' in which Peter Lorre played a child
murderer, as well as Alfred Hitchcock's ``Strangers on a Train,''
and the Valadmir Nabokov novel ``Lolita.'' He said: ``It's not
about sympathy. Forgiveness is not an issue here. But to understand
and recognize that there is a human here with a tragic condition,
to recognize that makes us more human for that ackowledgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Solondz, who grew up in Livingston, N.J., made it plain that he
has a warm spot for the state, where he made the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like that New York snobbery, cheap shots at New
Jersey, which are tiresome and never funny,'' Solondz said. He
acknowledged, though, that as a young adult he disparaged the
split-level ranch home community in which he was reared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then about 10 years ago, some Russian relatives who had
emigrated came to visit us in the suburbs and we took a walk and
they looked around at the vista and said, `This is my dream, one
day I'll live here.' And I realized, I couldn't argue. It wasn't so
bad, after all.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Waters is offended. When a reporter asked if he was raised
in the kind of blue-collar Baltimore neighborhood that he depicts
in his films, the 52-year-old creator of such trashy and
hilariously offensive movies as ``Pink Flamingos'' and ``Female
Trouble'' (starring the female impersonator Divine), and the more
recent ``Hairspray'' and ``Serial Mom,'' seemed quite taken aback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't grow up in blue-collar Baltimore but in middle-class
Baltimore,'' Waters said. ``I was raised to praise and almost
worship good taste. And that's why I made a career out of
glorifying bad taste.''
</P>
<P>
   He exclaimed: ``My parents voted for _ and look like _ George
and Barbara Bush. And they don't get mad when I say so.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Waters' newest movie, ``Pecker,'' was shown at the Toronto Film
Festival and is set to open next week. It is a surprisingly gentle
(for Waters) film without the grossouts of, say, ``Pink
Flamingos.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie deals with a slightly goofy sandwich shop employee
named Pecker (so-named because of his childhood habit of pecking at
his food), who takes photographs of his family and friends, and
stumbles onto fame when a fancy New York art dealer discovers him.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, some of the subjects of his pictures rebel at their
unwanted attention _ something that happened in real life to Waters
after he used some quirky Baltimore residents in his films.
</P>

   ``Some loved the attention, others didn't, they felt used by
it,'' Waters, 52, said. ``Everyone says this is autobiographical,
but it's not, it's really not.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's cast includes Edward Furlong as Pecker and some
Waters regulars like Patricia Hearst and Mink Stole. There are
familiar Waters touches: an older sister works in a gay bar; a kid
sister is addicted to sugar; his grandmother engages in prayer
sessions with a a talking statue.
</P>
<P>
   Waters, who seems as shrewd as he is charming, said he remained
close to his Republican parents, who gave him thousands of dollars
in the early 1970s to complete the notorious ``Pink Flamingos,''
which turned Waters into a cult celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've never seen the movie _ it would be parent abuse for
them to watch it,'' said Waters, whose first film was an 8-mm short
in high school called ``Hag in a Black Leather Jacket,'' that he
made while in high school. ``It's taken my parents really 30 years
to begin to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Waters said he attended New York University in 1966 for one
month. ``I was thrown out in a pot bust.'' He returned to
Baltimore, and never left. His films, which often eke out a small
profit, are especially popular ``around places with water,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do fine in New York and L.A., they do fine in Chicago
where there's a lake, where there's water, it works.'' He laughed.
``I mean, if there's a stream, I do well. Don't ask me why. It has
to be a puddle. It can be a leak. That's all I ask for. Please, let
it rain the day I open. Just give me some water.'' &QL;

   Janet Leigh saw Orson Welles only once after they made ``Touch
of Evil,'' but she's still disturbed, even angry, at the way
Hollywood treated him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Touch of Evil,'' the masterful 1958 film about a murder
investigation in a sleazy Mexican border town, was re-edited by
studio executives before its release, causing a furious Welles to
flee Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The movie has now been restored to be closer to its original
form, based on a 58-page memorandum written by Welles describing
his suggested changes to the studio cut.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Leigh, in Toronto to promote the re-release of the restored
film, which also starred Charlton Heston, Marlene Dietrich,
Mercedes McCambridge and Akim Tamiroff, said working on the movie
was one of the more pleasurable experiences of her career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started with rehearsals; we rehearsed two weeks prior to
shooting, which was unusual; we rewrote most of the dialogue, all
of us, which was also unusual, and Welles always wanted our
input,'' she said. ``It was a collective effort, and there was such
a surge of participation, of creativity, of energy. You could feel
the pulse growing as we rehearsed.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued: ``You felt you were inventing something as you
went along,'' she said. `` Welles wanted to seize every moment, he
didn't want one bland moment. He made you feel you were involved in
a wonderful event that was happening before your eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Leigh said Hollywood's treatment of the director of the
classics ``Citizen Kane'' and ``The Magnificent Ambersons'' was
appalling. Welles never directed another film in Hollywood after
``Touch of Evil.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After his version of the film was taken away, he went to
Mexico and Europe,'' she said. ``I was so saddened. I was angry.
When I saw this version, and saw the reaction by critics and
moviegoers, it made me angry when I thought that if this had been
released in his form, and had been accepted, he would have gone on
and made the five-picture deal they had offered him. Even now I
think: What have we been robbed of? What have we been cheated of?
We might have had five more masterpieces. We'll never know. It's a
shame.''

then stayed a step ahead of the competition the rest of the week,

nationally televised game against the New York Giants, he will not
be alone. His teammates and coaches vow they will not let the

Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-DOLPHINS-MARINO _ DAVIE, Fla. _ Jimmy Johnson and Dan Marino
aren't buddies, and don't need to be. The difficulty is in the

agitation. (Stoda, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   POWERBOAT-FOREMAN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ It's no accident that Roddy
Foreman is having his best year in power boat racing, capturing

the most frightening one of his 17 years of racing, helped make his
current dream season possible. In the very first event last year,
his boat apparently hit something, suffered a puncture and then
went violently out of control. (Maher, Austin American-Statesman)

adjustment of one man to the other. Johnson is, by title, the boss.
He's the head coach. Marino is, by reputation, the icon. He's the
superstar. Therein lies the potential for conflict, or, at least,
agitation. (Stoda, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   POWERBOAT-FOREMAN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ It's no accident that Roddy
Foreman is having his best year in power boat racing, capturing
another national championship recently. But an accident last year,
the most frightening one of his 17 years of racing, helped make his
current dream season possible. In the very first event last year,
his boat apparently hit something, suffered a puncture and then
went violently out of control. (Maher, Austin American-Statesman)

   CALIFORNIA -- UMBERG. Working on project. Zaret
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO -- SKAGGS/SCHAEFER. (Working.) Project. Zaret
</P>
<P>
   CONNECTICUT -- TAX. Despite the threat of a presidential veto,
Rep. Barbara B. Kennelly joined most of her Democratic colleagues
on the House Ways and Means Committee in voting for a GOP tax cut
plan. Maggi
</P>
<P>
   IDAHO -- KEMPTHORNE. Sen. Dirk Kempthorne is expected to attach
his Endangered Species Act as an amendment to the Interior
Appropriations bill. Critics say this is a sneaky, last-minute ploy
to get the bill passed without having to fix some serious
environmental concerns. (Working.) Brown
</P>
<P>
   LOUISIANA -- TOX. Almost half a billion tons of toxic chemicals
are being dumped into the Mississippi River by just three Louisiana
petrochemical companies, according to a just-released study. But
Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-Chackbay, said through a spokesman that most
of the alleged danger of such dumping is unclear. Stricherz
</P>
<P>
   MAINE -- ABORT. On the eve of another controversial vote on
late-term abortions, a group of moderate Senate Republicans and
Democrats try to forge a middle-ground approach that would outlaw
many abortions after the fetus has reached the point of viability.
But Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins admit that their plan
won't become law any time soon. Kane
</P>
<P>
   MASSACHUSETTS -- COURT. The U.S. District Court in Springfield
is not safe for judges or jurors, and a new courthouse needs to be
built, a federal judge from Massachusetts told a Senate committee
Thursday. Preston
</P>
<P>
   MULTICHANNEL -- SMUT. A bill aimed at protecting children from
online smut passed a House subcommittee Thursday, despite some
lawmakers' claims that the measure would expand the Federal
Communication Commission's jurisdiction over the Internet. Maggi
</P>
<P>
   OHIO -- APPALACHIA. Rev. Jesse Jackson joined labor officials
Thursday to kick off a bus tour of the Appalachia region, including
stops in Ohio, and a march in Athens County. Gorman
</P>
<P>
   -- FARMERS. With dueling philosophies, Ohio farm group
representatives descended on Capital Hill this week to lobby for
solutions to the farm crises facing rural America. While the
National Farmers Union pushed for removing loan caps and
re-evaluating the 1996 Farm Bill, the Pork Producers Council and
Farm Bureau concentrated on increasing trade opportunities by
getting funding for the International Monetary Fund and passing
fast-track legislation. Will include quotes from Reps. Oxley, Ney
and Boehner. Hurt

   -- TRAFICANT. Calls have been flooding congressional offices
since the Starr Report became public last Friday. A look at calls
to Rep. Jim Traficant's office. (Possible.) Gorman
</P>
<P>
   -- EPA-LIVESTOCK. (Re-sent.) The EPA and USDA Wednesday released
their long-awaited national strategy proposal for dealing with
water pollution associated with waste from livestock farms
Wednesday. The draft strategy proposes all livestock and poultry
operations develop and implement comprehensive nutrient management
plans in the next 10 years that will reduce water quality and
public health impacts. Hurt
</P>
<P>
   PENNSYLVANIA -- CALLS. Call it an information overload. Like the
Schuylkill Expressway at rush hour, the Capitol Hill e-mail system
has been backed up for hours on end since the Starr report was
unveiled a week ago. At the same time, congressional staffers
haven't had a moment's rest as their phones have been ringing off
the hook. Unlike any issue since maybe the Persian Gulf War, the
public has just seen and heard too much about the escalating intern
scandal and have been calling, e-mailing and writing their
lawmakers to express their outrage. Kane
</P>
<P>
   -- CALL. Calls have been coming in at a heavy load to Rep. John
Murtha's office ever since the Starr report was released a week
ago. With about a 50-50 split, Murtha's constituents appear divided
over whether President Clinton should finish out his term. But
those calls are nothing compared to what some Republicans are
hearing. While Murtha's office has fielded about 250 calls all
week, Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Everett, received almost that many in one
day -- and there was an overwhelming tilt against the president.
</P>
<P>
   -- HILL. Just a few hours after the latest congressional
peccadillo was unveiled on the Internet -- Rep. Henry Hyde's
long-since-passed affair in the 1960s -- an aide to a Senate
Democrat put down his beer Tuesday night and reflected: ``Who's
Next?'' Kane

   TEXAS -- AID. House Republicans announced a $3.9 billion aid
package for farmers and ranchers hit by drastically low commodity
prices and severe drought conditions. Brown

   VIRGIN ISLANDS -- GRANT. The Virgin Islands Housing Authority
will use most of a $6.7 million federal grant to repair property
damage caused by hurricanes Marilyn and Bertha. Williams

   -- FORUM. V.I. Delegate to Congress Donna Christian-Green is
taking part this afternoon in a Congressional Black Caucus forum on
U.S.-Caribbean policy. (Working.) Williams

<P>
   WISCONSIN -- SENSENBRENNER. Democratic members of the Judiciary
Committee say that Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., is unfit to be

MERCEDES E430 RUNS LIKE ROCKET  
 (EMBARGOED FOR SATURDAY, SEPT. 19) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - OK, all you wealthy dudes contemplating a midlife
crisis, listen up. Here's a road-burning hot rod that won't offend
Aunt Tillie or cause your ritzy neighbors to roll their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   For the paltry sum of $50,000, you can drive a 275-horsepower
``wunderkind'' that accelerates like a rocket and handles like a
bobsled, all the while looking like any standard-issue sedan from
the Mercedes-Benz E-class.
</P>
<P>
   Powered by a fresh, new all-aluminum V-8, the E430 was unveiled
in January to replace the former V-8 model, the E420. This engine
also motivates the new ML430, which is the V-8 version of Mercedes'
wildly popular sport-utility vehicle, and the CLK430 sports coupe.
</P>
<P>
   The V-8 is a pretty trick piece of engineering, producing more
torque at a lower RPM than the previous V-8 because of a two-stage
intake system. It propels the nearly 2-ton E-class sedan to 60
miles per hour in just 6.4 seconds. And, using three valves and two
spark plugs per cylinder, it also meets the standards of a low
emissions vehicle and turns in decent gas mileage.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's an engine that's politically incorrect and
politically correct at the same time. Just the thing for those
midlifers who want to be unabashedly irresponsible, but in a
responsible way.
</P>
<P>
   As well as being fast off the line, the E430 gobbles up the
highway miles as if they aren't even there. On the freeway, 75
miles per hour feels like you're just crawling, as you roll quietly
along thinking, ``Why don't WE have Autobahns?''
</P>
<P>
   I wish I could have sampled its natural cruising speed, which is
probably well above the century mark. All day long. Oh, well.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the V-6 version of the E-sedan is no slouch, with its
221-horse engine. But the V-8 is just the icing needed for this
cake. Smooth, quiet, responsive, it inspires boundless confidence
with its effortless performance. Of course, the eight does cost
about $4,000 more than the six. But in this rarefied price range,
that's shopping-spree cash.
</P>
<P>
   The five-speed automatic transmission delivers the power with
precision, enhanced by a computerized shifting system that monitors
the driver's behavior and road grades, and adjusts its shifting
accordingly. I wasn't crazy about this system, though, feeling more
as if the tranny was trying to second guess me than work with me. I
found it hard to anticipate downshifts, often experiencing an
unpleasant moment's lapse between hitting the throttle to pass and
having anything actually happen.
</P>
<P>
   The ride is stiffer than that on most luxury cars, such as the
E430's competitor, the Lexus LS400, or the Cadillac Seville,
Lincoln Continental and Infiniti Q45. That's fine for handling,
which is excellent, but drivers used to a plusher ride might object
to road noise and expansion-strip rumbles on concrete surfaces, as
well as the occasional jounce.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the suspension will easily soak up the rough
stuff, such as potholes, without the Benz losing its poise. There's
also an optional sport-suspension package that firms things up a
bit more, with better handling to match.
</P>
<P>
   The speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion steering also may feel heavy
to luxury-car drivers, but once you get used to it, you'll find it
quick and precise. The firm suspension and tight steering add to
the confidence level in fast cornering. The sedan may feel heavy as
it barrels into a curve, but it will stay level and balanced.
</P>
<P>
   The interior is usual E-class stuff, conservative and
businesslike, with easy-to-read gauges and good-looking wood
accents. While the sedan is a midsize, part of Mercedes' medium
range of cars, the interior is surprisingly commodious, with lots
of headroom and a good back seat that's fit for three normal
humans.
</P>
<P>
   What I really like in here is the tremendous amount of leg and
shoulder room for an oversize driver (like me). The power seat
glides back forever, and the steering wheel adjusts telescopically
to match. At 6-foot-6, mostly legs, I'm not always real happy with
automotive legroom, but the Mercedes seems to be the best in all
its models, except the little SLK sports car.
</P>
<P>
   What I don't care for is the hard perch provided by the leather
seats. I know, these will break in and be soft and molded to the
driver's personal derriere, but I drove a new Mercedes and I got
sore.
</P>
<P>
   Although the interior space is expansive, trunk space is another
story. It's fine for grocery getting and other such domestic
chores, but it's really pretty small for, say, a week's vacation
for four. Compared with its competitors, the E-class needs a
trunk-space transfusion.
</P>
<P>
   These complaints may seem like small change, but when you spend
this kind of money on an automobile, you might want it to be pretty
near perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the E430 is fully equipped with safety features,
including side air bags, anti-lock brakes, advanced traction
control and a new electronic braking system, called Brake Assist,
that actually shortens emergency-stopping distances by sensing a
panic stop and quickly applying full braking force faster than any
driver could.
</P>
<P>
   Options on our tester included a $900 CD changer to complement
the superb stereo system, a rain sensor that automatically adjusts
wiper speed to rainfall and an $1,100 glass sunroof, expensive but
appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the wheel, you can enjoy your secret rebellion, while
your passengers enjoy the ambience. Just remember, we don't have
Autobahns, but we do have traffic cops. &QL;

EFFORT TO SAVE ANTI-ABORTION BILL EXPECTED TO FAIL IN SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Anti-abortion forces in the Senate conceded
Thursday they do not have the support to overturn President
Clinton's veto of a bill that would outlaw a controversial
late-term abortion procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert C. Smith, a key supporter of the bill to ban what
opponents call ``partial-birth abortion,'' said he did not have the
67 votes needed to override the veto.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are three votes shy and there are a dozen senators that are
looking inward,'' Smith, R-N.H., told a news conference. The vote
is expected Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats identified as possible swing votes _ including
Joseph Lieberman and Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, Dale Bumpers
of Arkansas and Tom Harkin of Iowa _ said they intended to vote to
sustain the veto.
</P>
<P>
   The House has twice overridden the president's veto, but the
Senate could not muster the two-thirds majority needed for an
override when it last voted on the issue in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The late-term abortion procedure involves a physician pulling
the fetus out of the birth canal feet-first, puncturing the back of
the head and removing the brain. That allows the skull to be
partially collapsed and removed from the birth canal.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., a vocal opponent of the procedure,
described it as ``shocking,'' and ``barbaric'' and said it ``has no
place in civilized society.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., the only physician in the Senate, said
the procedure ``is inhuman and painful to the fetus'' and is not
taught at any medical school in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely unnecessary and ethically unacceptable,''
Frist said, adding that the procedure is dangerous to the mother
because it can cause hemorrhage and infection. ``It's too close to
infanticide to justify its continued use.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Sen. Richard J. Durbin, D-Ill., introduced
legislation that would ban all post-viability abortions except when
both the attending physician and a second doctor certify that
continuing the pregnancy would threaten the mother's life or risk
``grievous physical injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Physicians consider a fetus viable at about 23 or 24 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is unlikely to come up for a vote until a new
Congress convenes next year.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Olympia J. Snowe, R-Maine, a co-sponsor of the Durbin bill,
said the legislation was narrowly drawn to allow late-term
abortions in cases where the mother may suffer from cardiac
failure, hypertension, uterine rupture that may lead to
infertility, or may require chemotherapy for breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said the bill appropriately balances ``the moral
anxieties we feel about abortion with the law of the land.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1973 Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court decision legalized abortion
prior to fetal viability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The line to draw here is the stage of the pregnancy, not to
begin making judgment on a particular procedure,'' Lieberman said.

 &HT;    DONNA RICE HUGHES TALKS ABOUT OVERCOMING SCANDAL
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (l) lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Before Monica, there was Donna.
</P>
<P>
   The explosive mixture of politics and sex and scandal and media
is a familiar story in the nation's capital, and not one that Donna
Rice Hughes is anxious to rehash.
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade has passed since the tabloids ran a picture
of her sitting on Gary Hart's lap on the yacht ``Monkey Business,''
and the ensuing uproar forced the married Democratic senator from
Colorado out of the 1988 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Rice gained worldwide notoriety almost instantly.
Obscurity has been harder to achieve. After an unfortunate
experience modeling ``No Excuses'' jeans, the aspiring actress
altered the course of her life _ changing careers, turning down TV
talk shows and million-dollar book deals, and ``returning to faith
to seek God's guidance.''
</P>
<P>
   She married a man with a teenaged son, moved into a house in
suburban Virginia, and went to work for a non-profit
anti-pornography group called ``Enough Is Enough.'' A few years
ago, she ventured online and found a crusade _ protecting kids from
smut and sexual predators in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked when someone showed me what was on the
Internet,'' she recalled. ``Kids can get for free what their
parents would have to buy in a triple-X rated bookstore.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as fate would have it, 40-year-old Donna Rice Hughes is
promoting her new book, ``Kids Online: Protecting Your Children in
Cyberspace,'' at the time the nation is riveted by a new sex
scandal. For cybersmart kids, the lurid details are just a click
away after Congress put the report by Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That does a couple of things in respect to issues I'm dealing
with,'' she said in an interview Thursday. The release demonstrated
``the power of the Internet to disseminate vast amounts of
information quickly. And it also raised the visibility to parents
... that much of this information is perhaps inappropriate for
their children to see.''
</P>
<P>
   She is comfortable and knowledgeable talking about the dangers
of cyberspace and the need for parents to bridge the
``technogeneration gap'' to guide and protect their children on the
Internet. She said her book teaches even technophobic grown-ups how
to keep up with cybersavvy kids and how to use a ``digital
toolbox'' to regulate what they can see on their computer screens.
</P>
<P>
   She is less comfortable taking about the 1987 scandal that
prompted publishers to offer her ``a blank check'' to write a
tell-all account of her brief affair with Hart. She offers no
advice to Monica Lewinsky, whose agent is reportedly shopping
proposals for a book on her White House relationship with President
Clinton and the resulting scandal that continues to unfold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the decision early on to make all the pain and trauma
count for something,'' she said. ``I was not going to exploit the
notoriety.''
</P>
<P>
   An honors graduate and former cheerleader from the University of
South Carolina, then-Donna Rice was a commercial actress living in
Miami when she met Hart. Indeed, she recalled that when the scandal
broke, she was appearing as a young mom in a Sears commercial and a
wife in two Folger's coffee spots that were airing on TV. So, after
unintentionally and unexpectedly becoming a household name, she
accepted an offer to model No Excuses Jeans in an advertising
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agreed to do it as an actor. It was what I did for a living
at the time,'' she recalled. ``As it turns out, it was very much
exploited. I learned that I couldn't just be a no-name person in a
commercial again.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said turned down offers to appear in TV movies and
rejected a $1 million offer to do a question-and-answer session
with Playboy Magazine _ ``no posing'' required. She did a TV
interview with Barbara Walters, but decided to put it all behind
her, she would have to get out of the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was being painted as someone I wasn't,'' she said, so she
``went underground'' to regain a private life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was out of the public eye until I started working on these
high-tech issues,'' she said, explaining that her book was written
as a ``service'' rather than to make money. Published by Revell, it
costs $11.99. However, Hughes said most of the information can be
found for free at her Web site (http://www.protectkids.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a tool and a resource,'' she said. ``There's a
challenge because children are more computer-literate than their
parents. But if you don't understand the Internet, you don't know
the risks.''

   ``I made the decision early on to make all the pain and trauma
count for something,'' she said. ``I was not going to exploit the
notoriety.''
</P>
<P>
   An honors graduate and former cheerleader from the University of
South Carolina, then-Donna Rice was a commercial actress living in
Miami when she met Hart. Indeed, she recalled that when the scandal
broke, she was appearing as a young mom in a Sears commercial and a
wife in two Folger's coffee spots that were airing on TV. So, after
unintentionally and unexpectedly becoming a household name, she
accepted an offer to model No Excuses Jeans in an advertising
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agreed to do it as an actor. It was what I did for a living
at the time,'' she recalled. ``As it turns out, it was very much
exploited. I learned that I couldn't just be a no-name person in a
commercial again.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said turned down offers to appear in TV movies and
rejected a $1 million offer to do a question-and-answer session
with Playboy Magazine _ ``no posing'' required. She did a TV
interview with Barbara Walters, but decided to put it all behind
her, she would have to get out of the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was being painted as someone I wasn't,'' she said, so she
``went underground'' to regain a private life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was out of the public eye until I started working on these
high-tech issues,'' she said, explaining that her book was written
as a ``service'' rather than to make money. Published by Revell, it
costs $11.99. However, Hughes said most of the information can be
found for free at her Web site (http://www.protectkids.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a tool and a resource,'' she said. ``There's a
challenge because children are more computer-literate than their
parents. But if you don't understand the Internet, you don't know
the risks.''

NEW DIVERSITY PROGRAM FOCUSES ON CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing; moved 9/15)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How do you eliminate bias?
</P>
<P>
   ``You begin with the children,'' says workplace diversity expert
Julie Baskin Brooks of New York-based QED Consulting.
</P>
<P>
   A former director of diversity at Xerox Corp. in Stamford,
Conn., Brooks came to this realization two years ago after her
7-year-old son was attacked by three fifth-grade boys who held a
pocketknife to his neck and declared, ``You're no good because
you're burnt.''
</P>
<P>
   Kameron Brooks is African-American. The boys who accosted him
are white.
</P>
<P>
   For Kameron, the experience was devastating. He withdrew from
his family; he became sad and angry; and his school work suffered.
Even more troubling, recalls Brooks, was the boy's declaration that
he hated himself. ``I'm tired of being invisible,'' he told his
mother.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a therapist, Brooks and her son got through a
difficult period, but the experience still troubled her.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced other parents and children could use help with racial
and diversity issues, Brooks approached Xerox about developing a
way to help change attitudes about race, gender, and other
differences.
</P>
<P>
   With a $68,000 contribution from Xerox, Brooks and Arlene
Tannenbaum of WFD Inc. of Brookline, a corporate work-life services
provider, created a diversity tool kit for children age 3 to 8 and
their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``Who Am I? Who Are You? Raising Children In a Diverse
World,'' the kit includes an audio cassette tape of conversations
with parents, construction paper in shades similar to skin colors,
multicultural crayons that include white, brown, beige, burnt
sienna, and black, a list of books for children, and two workbooks
designed to help adults expand their children's horizons and their
own.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, thousands of Xerox employees and nonprofit
organizations have used the tool kit. In January, the diversity
tool kit will be made available to companies served by WFD, which
has clients nationwide. Brooks says she also has received inquiries
from schools, churches, the Girl Scouts, and other groups
interested in promoting diversity.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the package seems little more than a game. Take
a closer look and certain activities do more than entertain. In a
section called Questions to Ask Yourself, the authors urge parents
to take a close look at themselves Among the questions:
</P>
<P>
   _What kind of role model am I for my children? How do I respond
to a racist or biased remark. What do I say when someone else makes
a thoughtless or demeaning remark about my own background?
</P>
<P>
   _Do I show a positive attitude toward people who are different
from me? Do I invite them home?
</P>
<P>
   _Have I made assumptions about an entire group of people based
on my experience with one person from that particular group?
</P>
<P>
   While racial and gender biases readily come to mind when
thinking about diversity in the workplace, Brooks wanted children
to understand that differences are more complex and include
education, style, language, the way you carry and express yourself,
your height, weight, beliefs, and values.
</P>
<P>
   With those differences in mind, the tool kit offers several
activities for engaging children. Among them: construction of a
family heritage album that encourages children to talk to various
family members about their lives and work experiences; creating a
costume box with props that permit children to be someone else; and
a recipe for ``people cookies'' _ homemade gingerbread cookies
fashioned with a dough that ``lets your children make cookies that
look more like real people.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like fun, but can a workbook, a cassette tape, and a few
games really make a difference?
</P>
<P>
   Tannenbaum believes they can. ``Some people may see this as a
tangential or back-door way of getting into the issue, but in order
to work with children you really have to examine yourself,'' she
says. ``Sometimes people are willing to take a harder look at
themselves because of their love for their children than they would
if the employer said, `You've got to do this.'''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Brooks: ``When I learned what had happened to my son, I was
appalled. And yet, I did not want him to see how upset I was. I
said to him, `We will figure out how to fix this.' I also told him
that I needed him to be very honest about his feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have very easily encouraged my son to be violent, but
I did not want to send that message. There was a lot of therapy and
the message to Kameron was that there are many, many different
people in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Will adults get the message?
</P>
<P>
   ``The adults who will get it are the ones who are sensitive and
want to send the right message to their children,'' concedes
Brooks. ``The others won't. But that's OK. Some people cannot be
saved. So, if the kit makes a difference to one child and one
adult, it will be worth it.''

GROUP KICKS OFF EFFORD TO COUNTER CHRISTIAN COALITION'S INFLUENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As more than 3,000 Christian Coalition activists
descend on the capital Thursday to lobby Congress and prepare for
their national convention this weekend, another organization has
announced a national effort to counter the group's political
influence among churchgoers.
</P>
<P>
   Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, a
private nonprofit group, said it intends to warn congregations and
pastors throughout the country about alleged partisanship in the
coalition's upcoming election voter guides.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Lynn, the group's executive director, said it would use
activists, mailings and the Internet to get out its message.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition's guides that often are distributed just before
election day, he said, traditionally make ``Republicans appear
nearly saint-like and Democrats looking like they're the biggest
sinners in town.''
</P>
<P>
   Denying partisanship, coalition spokesman Arne Owens described
the guides as ``supplements'' to the candidate information found in
the news media and in campaign advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no endorsement, either implied or direct,'' he said.
``It's all in line with both the law and spirit of the law. These
efforts on the part of Americans United are really thinly veiled
efforts to paint our organization with negative messages so our
voice can be marginalized during the election season. We recognize
what up they're up to.''
</P>
<P>
   For November's election, the coalition expects to distribute 45
million voter guides.
</P>
<P>
   While not specifically addressing the issue, Christian Coalition
President Randy Tates told an audience at the National Press Club
on Wednesday, ``The Christian Coalition does not endorse
candidates. We support individual issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition is expected to be the target of another
broadside Thursday when People for the American Way, a private
nonprofit civil rights organization, attacks the group for
allegedly ignoring or circumventing election laws.
</P>
<P>
   And the Federal Election Commission asked a federal judge this
week to rule that the coalition improperly aided Republican
candidates through its election guides and other activities during
the 1990, 1992, and 1994 elections. In the meantime, the Internal
Revenue Service continues to investigate whether the coalition
deserves tax-exempt status.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition, which has asked the courts to dismiss
the FEC lawsuit, says its voter guides typically highlight issues
of concern to its members. The 1998 questionnaires sent to
candidates contained more than 100 questions on a variety of
subjects, including abortion, homosexual rights, pornography,
health care, taxes, foreign policy and government reform.
</P>
<P>
   Milton Cerny, a Washington tax attorney who handled tax-exempt
issues at the IRS for 28 years, said a church receiving an election
guide must ensure that the guide is nonpartisan.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo prepared for Americans United, he said, ``A voter
guide may implicitly favor a candidate even though it does not tell
people how to vote or evaluate candidates with a `plus' or `minus'
signs.''

DECISION TO APPROVE THE DEATH PENALTY FOR MORE CRIMES CAN BE
COSTLY, PANEL FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The decision of Congress to mete out the federal
death penalty to a wider range of criminals has meant a much higher
cost to taxpayers, according to a judicial panel.
</P>
<P>
   Defense of a death penalty case costs an average of $218,112,
compared to $55,772 if the death penalty is not sought.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecuting death cases cost even more, about $365,000 for each
defendant, according to the report released this week by a
subcomittee of the Judicial Conference of the United States. The
group was asked to recommend ways to save money on capital cases.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the 1994 crime bill, the number of cases where
the attorney general has approved seeking the death penalty has
grown from five in 1993 to 31 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Federal death penalty prosecutions are large-scale cases that
are costly to defend,'' the report said. ``They require more
lawyers, working more hours at a higher hourly rate than other
federal criminal matters.''
</P>
<P>
   The results of the study came as no surprise to those in favor
of the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knew that,'' said Allan Kagnoli, spokesman for Rep.
George Gekas, a Pennsylvania Republican and sponsor of the crime
bill. ``These are the ultimate cases and they bear the ultimate
costs.''
</P>
<P>
   The growth in death penalty cases stirred concern among some
judges and lawmakers, especially in the wake of the highly
expensive defense of Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols for the 1995
Oklahoma City bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The Judicial Conference appointed a subcommittee to look at the
costs and submit a report to Congress, which reinstated the federal
death penalty in 1988 and broadened it six years later in a
tough-on-crime movement.
</P>
<P>
   Cost can be a practical argument against the death penalty, said
David Bruck, a South Carolina criminal defense lawyer who advises
defense lawyers in capital cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The death penalty is one of those things people think of in
the abstract _ are you for or against it?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way you have to think about it is: Is it the best way to
use scarce law enforcement dollars?'' Bruck said. ``Then the issue
looks a little different. How many laid-off police officers is one
execution worth?''
</P>
<P>
   In passing the Federal Death Penalty Act of 1994, Congress added
about 50 types of murder and drug related crimes to what is subject
to the death penalty, including charges of conspiracy to commit
murder even if no murder occurred, Bruck said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, there were 153 federal defendants charged with
offenses punishable by death in 1997 compared to 28 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more cases we have, the more it's going to cost,'' Bruck
said. ``There's no gimmick or cost-saving mechanisms that will
change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the death penalty said Congress responded to the
public's will in expanding death penalty offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's akin to defense spending _ there are certain things the
government must do,'' said Charles Orndorff, administrative vice
chairman of the Conservative Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee of judges who wrote the Judicial Conference
report do not pass judgment on the death penalty nor do they allege
wasteful spending. In the report, the judges emphasize the need to
appoint competent lawyers who have experience in death penalty
cases, but those lawyers can be expensive and the cases can be
prolonged, the judges said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruck said death penalty cases take so much time and attention
that lawyers usually have to shut down the rest of their practice.
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection and the trial itself take longer in death penalty
cases, partly because there are two phases _ one to determine guilt
and then another to decide if the death penalty is warranted.
</P>
<P>
   There also tends to be much more research and analysis of the
defendant's personal and criminal background to argue for or
against death. Expert witnesses are more prevalent in such cases,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Among money-saving recommendations from the judges committee:
</P>
<P>
   --The Department of Justice should speed up review of cases
where the death penalty is requested but seems unlikely to be
approved. An early decision not to seek the death penalty would cut
defense costs.
</P>
<P>
   --Courts should not appoint more than two defense lawyers, but
should permit use of other lawyers on a limited basis when time and

MAKE CHARITY INSPIRING, NOT TIRING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every time I see a little yellow rubber duck, I think about
grocery shopping at 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there's a connection.
</P>
<P>
   The yellow ducks are a common fund-raising gimmick. Buy a duck.
Stick it in a pond or a creek along with swarms of others. If yours
bobs to the finish line or gets plucked out first, you win the
raffle prize.
</P>
<P>
   The more people buy ducks, the more money is raised for the
sponsoring charity. This is good. These raffles provide vital
support for philanthropies.
</P>
<P>
   But there comes a point in the lives of most working stiffs when
even someone who's congenitally unable to walk past a Salvation
Army kettle without dropping something in is maxed out. And
sometimes, despite good will, the answer isn't to give time instead
of money.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what I think when I'm dodging midnight stock
boys in the grocery store's aisles. That's when I know that my best
time-management tip _ sleep less _ is not going to help me be a
better philanthropist. In short, I have no more time to give.
</P>
<P>
   All this raced through my mind _ faster than those duckies swim
_ as I listened to Stacy Palmer, editor of ``The Chronicle of
Philanthropy,'' speak recently. Palmer talked about national trends
in personal giving, technology, corporate giving and volunteering.
</P>
<P>
   The trend that burrowed into my rubber-ducky synapse was ``the
elevated role of the corporate volunteer manager.'' In other words,
Palmer said staff members charged with being cheerleaders and
organizers of staff volunteer work were getting busier.
</P>
<P>
   This, too, is good. Getting more people off their couches and
into do-gooder activities is a wonderful thing _ for society and
for the individual. But the increased call for worker commitment is
exacting a price.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just that many lives are so full that midnight food
shopping becomes a necessity. It's that many workers would really,
truly like to volunteer but feel stretched as tight as a cheap
celery band as it is.
</P>
<P>
   Workers are getting tired of being asked by their employers (or
their designated volunteer managers) to commit more volunteer time.
They don't have enough time for self and family as it is.
</P>
<P>
   There's also growing resentment in a work force that's already
being asked to ``do more with less'' on the job. Some employees
admit (though not very loudly) that they're miffed at being prodded
to spend more of their precious commodity _ time _ to carry their
employer's corporate-giving flag.
</P>
<P>
   The wisest employers, Palmer said, are solving the time crunch
by giving workers paid time off for volunteer work. Sometimes it's
an hour or two a week. Sometimes it's just one day a year.
</P>
<P>
   Wise employers also are finding out what volunteer work their
employees already do and providing paid time or direct financial
support for those philanthropies. That often sits better than
calling on workers to support the corporation's charitable choices.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the commitment, well-managed volunteer efforts are a
way for everybody to win. The philanthropic organization gets good
help. The corporation gets good PR. And the volunteer feels good _
not strained and drained.

STILL A GEM, DESPITE ITS ROUGH EDGES

<P>
   TOWARD HOMER, ALASKA _ During a brief visit to Alaska a dozen
years ago, the impression gotten from two days on the road was of
disheartening clutter.
</P>
<P>
   The carcasses of old buses, converted to lodgings and then
abandoned _ artifacts of broken hopes _ rusted among the trees just
off the highway.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic trash bags, split at the seams, spilled their contents
along the ditches. Derelict cabins rotted and leaned.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska was, and is, the nearest thing we have to an American
frontier, and frontiers seldom are tidy. The northern winter is
long and hard. Outside the major towns, services are few. Other
needs take precedence over neatness. The worn-out and the useless
get flung aside.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it seemed the last time. But the intervening years
have brought noticeable change.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's a result of oil prosperity. Or maybe it's just a sign
of the frontier's maturing. But the traveler today is met by a more
orderly look.
</P>
<P>
   Which isn't to say the amenities are just like home.
</P>
<P>
   There's a book, available in better book stores here, titled
/{Outhouses of Alaska./} It's a hard-bound volume, not a flimsy
pamphlet. And, after bear attacks and death by freezing, the
subject it memorializes is one of the more terrible features of
Alaskan life.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier today we stopped for a stretch and a bit of refreshment
at a clutch of buildings beside the road. The gas station had no
restroom. In fact, it turned out that the hamlet was without any
running water at all.
</P>
<P>
   The lady at the tiny store where we bought homemade cakes
pointed the way to her sanitary facility, outdoors and around to
the side. I regret to say I visited the place. ``Treat this toilet
as you would your own,'' said a hand-printed sign on the door.
Well, if it were mine I'd dynamite it.
</P>
<P>
   In their capacity to inspire horror, the outhouses here are in a
class with those just across the Bering Sea, in Siberia. Indeed,
they are a reminder of the historical connection.
</P>
<P>
   First came Vitus Bering and the other Russian explorers in the
mid-18th century, followed in 1784 by the merchant-explorer Grigori
Shelikhov, who founded the Russian settlement at Kodiak.
</P>
<P>
   On their heels came a stream of fellow Russians, determined to
make their fortunes in furs and spread outhouse architecture
throughout the Alaska colony, perhaps even as far south as
California.
</P>
<P>
   This afternoon, after turning southwest at Soldotna to parallel
the shore of Cook Inlet, we find ourselves at Ninilchik village,
one of the places where those early colonists planted their hopes.
</P>
<P>
   The day is drawing on, the sun lowering, but with only a bit
more than 40 miles farther on to Homer, our night's stopping place,
there is time to linger and explore.
</P>
<P>
   Ninilchik was settled in the early 1800s, where a small river of
the same name runs down to the coast. More than 200 people once
called the place their home. They were fishers and hunters, and one
easily can imagine the hardness of their existence.
</P>
<P>
   Time has savaged most of the early log buildings, though some
look to be in various stages of restoration. From somewhere nearby
can be heard the rapping of a hammer, the whine of a saw, as one of
the weathered structures gets the promise of a new life.
</P>
<P>
   The original Russian Orthodox church burned, but was rebuilt
about 1900 on a promontory overlooking the village, and still is in
use. Until 1912, when Ninilchik got a territorial school, children
here got instruction only in Russian at the church school, taught
by the priest.
</P>
<P>
   We climbed the steep footpath to the handsome and well-kept
little structure. In the cemetery alongside, many of the names
echoed the place's history.
</P>
<P>
   There lay the Reverend Father Michael Garassim Oskolkoff, and
his wife, Matushka Zoya Oskolkoff. And others of that family:
Matrona and Simeon Oskolkoff, the latter having served 30 years as
church (ital)starosta,(end ital) or lay leader.
</P>
<P>
   Also Kvasnikoffs and Demidoffs. And, among all those, one Wayne
John Woodhead, whose headstone announced simply: ``Gone Fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Ninilchik has moved to higher ground, across the
highway, and has a prosperous look. But it's what remains of the
original village, nestled in its inlet, that stirs the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Late light sparkles on the water under a sky of deepening gold
and racing cloud. Blue with haze on the far side of Cook Inlet rise
the peaks of the Aleutian range.
</P>
<P>
   The distance from where we stand at this moment to the Siberian
mainland is 700 miles _ less than the distance to the nearest of
the other 48 U.S. states.
</P>
<P>
   Outhouses and all, it's one of the world's wonders, Alaska, a
jewel beyond price.
</P>
<P>
   One can easily understand why the untranationalist Russian
screwball, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, would burn so to claim it back.

 NPR FLOPHOUSE DOCUMENTARY: AGGRAVATION, BUT NO TOWELS OR SOAP 
</HEADLINE>
  (js)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember ``Grand Hotel''? Lewis Stone would sit in the plush
lobby, saying: ``Always the same. People come, people go. Nothing
ever happens.'' Well, the Sunshine Hotel is just like that, except
that its guests are life's losers, its beds rent for as little as
$4.50 a night, and the 4-by-6-foot rooms have chicken-wire
ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   But the real-life Sunshine, one of the last of the Bowery
flophouses, does have its own world-weary witness in the lobby.
He's Nathan Smith, the manager for the last 12 years. ``On the one
hand, it's probably as close as you can get to living in hell: 125
dysfunctional guys crammed together in a crummy old hotel,'' he
says. ``On the other hand, it's pretty interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith is the narrator of a radio documentary on the Sunshine to
be heard Friday on the National Public Radio program ``All Things
Considered.'' To assemble this sound portrait of a place you might
not want to look at, David Isay and Stacy Abramson, producer and
associate producer respectively, spent months with the lost souls
who inhabit the Sunshine's shadows.
</P>
<P>
   As they describe their shabby lives and quarters, these men
(women do not live at the hotel) speak sadly, but easily and
good-naturedly, about their fate. None is more eloquent than Smith,
who makes a remarkable tour guide.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you like aggravation, come to the Sunshine,'' he says, in a
voice that comes from the gut. ``But don't ask me for towels and
soap. We don't have those luxuries.''
</P>
<P>
   The place looks much like it did in the 1920s, when the Bowery
was full of such cheap refuges. Now the Sunshine, like its
denizens, is among the grizzled survivors.
</P>
<P>
   One resident, Arthur Morrison, says he came to the neighborhood
in 1960. ``Most of the people I knew on the Bowery are dead now,''
he says. ``I'm lucky to be alive.''
</P>
<P>
   His neighbors are not all so optimistic. ``I can't go no lower
than this,'' one says.
</P>
<P>
   The microphone picks up the sounds of the Sunshine: the ringing
of the single telephone inside Smith's cage of an office, the
belches of one man, the buzzing mechanical voice box of another and
some spontaneous doo-wop harmony down the hall. But mostly it hears
the words of the lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very popular with people being dumped,'' Smith says. The
residents tend to be guys just out of jails, psychiatric wards or
other places where they have just worn out their welcomes. ``And
then there are those of us who end up here because we are
dreamers.''
</P>
<P>
   Some men stay at the hotel for 30 years or more, others pass
through quickly, leaving abruptly, in a police car or ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   ``One tenant leaves, another checks in,'' Smith says, ``but the
hotel never changes.''
</P>
<P>
   He must have seen that movie, too.

QUESTIONS TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN LOOKING FOR A JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Whether you're looking for your first ``real''
job or are trying to recover from the jolt of being laid off, the
job market can be a puzzling and sometimes cruel place. Maybe the
market is the best it has been in years, but nobody could prove it
by you.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't done any serious job hunting in the last 10 or 20
years, consider yourself like someone straight out of high school
or college. The market has changed a lot, and many of the old rules
no longer apply.
</P>
<P>
   As you're doing your job hunting, make sure you know the answers
to these 10 questions:
</P>
<P>
   _ WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest pitfalls for job hunters is being unfocused,
says Karen Culver, a career development counselor with Golden Gate
University in San Francisco. If your resume says you simply want
``challenging work,'' your biggest challenge is liable to be
finding work.
</P>
<P>
   Culver says that if you have a specific objective, list it on
your resume, particularly if you're applying to a medium-sized
company. That's not as crucial in small companies because
departments usually aren't as clearly defined, or at large
companies, where resumes are usually scanned in and then searched
by keywords rather than just the objective.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't know what you want to do, experts suggest making a
list of the skills you have and the types of tasks you enjoy, then
considering which jobs would involve those tasks. To open your eyes
to possibilities, check want ads in newspapers and on Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Color is Your Parachute?'' the classic job hunting book
by Alamo resident Richard Nelson Bolles, has extensive advice on
choosing careers. JIST Works Inc. (www.jist.com) has all sorts of
books on jobs and job hunting.
</P>
<P>
   _ HAVE YOU SENT OUT AT LEAST 100 RESUMES?
</P>
<P>
   It's a trick question. The correct answer is usually no. You're
better off targeting your resume to specific people at specific
companies, then following up to try to land an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sending out thousands of resumes that are not targeted is a
dead end,'' Culver says.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all is networking, talking with people you already know
and using contacts to line up interviews. They often will hear
about job openings before they are advertised.
</P>
<P>
   _ DO YOU KNOW THE COMPANY?
</P>
<P>
   Your research should tell you not only the basics about what the
company does and what kinds of jobs it has available, but what the
corporate culture is, says Ron Visconti, executive director of the
Career Education Center in San Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   _ ARE YOU OPEN-MINDED?
</P>
<P>
   Visconti calls it ``big-name syndrome'': Job hunters often limit
themselves to large, famous companies rather than thinking about
the range of experience they could get at smaller businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The fastest-growing part of the job market is the service
industry, which often has companies that are not widely known, says
Cindy O'Peka, regional human resources manager for American
Protective Services.
</P>
<P>
   _ DO YOU MAKE A GOOD FIRST IMPRESSION?
</P>
<P>
   That first impression usually comes through a cover letter, a
resume and a job application, three ways you can get tossed out of
the applicant pool in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an 8-second scan, can I see who you are, what you want and
why you should have it?'' asks Susan Ireland, who runs Susan
Ireland's Resume Service in San Francisco and Oakland and is the
author of ``The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Perfect Resume.''
</P>
<P>
   People aren't thinking enough about the position they're
applying for when they prepare a resume, she explains. ``They see
it as a historical document, which is a mistake. It should be about
your future, not your past.''
</P>
<P>
   Applicants often include too much rather than having bullet
points that are easy to read, Ireland adds.
</P>
<P>
   _ DO YOU REALLY WANT THE JOB?
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people fall into the habit of waiting for things to
happen,'' Visconti says. ``They wait for a job placement service.
They wait for an ad to pop up in the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Once you make it to the interview, you can also come across as
uninterested through your body language, Culver says. Dress
appropriately for the interview, offer a firm handshake, make good
eye contact and don't slump back in your chair, she says. Ask
questions about the company.
</P>
<P>
   _ CAN YOU TELL A GOOD STORY?
</P>
<P>
   Culver says companies use more behavioral questions these days,
asking applicants for specific examples of how they've worked well
under pressure or shown initiative or displayed teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``Run through the story'' before the interview, she says. ``Make
sure you have the beginning, the middle and the ending. Most of the
time, telling a vivid story is much more memorable than just
reciting what you've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Resolving conflict is another key topic for behavioral
questions. ``We might ask a question like `How did you handle an
irate customer?''' O'Peka says.
</P>
<P>
   _ WHAT'S YOUR BIGGEST WEAKNESS?
</P>
<P>
   O'Peka hates that question, but has been in plenty of interviews
where others have asked it. ``I get people who say, `I'm too much
of a hard worker.' I know they're blowing smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   When you do mention a weakness, though, make sure to explain how
you're improving the situation.
</P>
<P>
   _ SHOULD YOU MENTION SALARY?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sell them first on you,'' Visconti says. ``Don't be a
mercenary.''
</P>
<P>
   When the employer mentions a salary, he says, you should know
whether it is reasonable through the research you have done. For
those who need to do more research, salaries for many jobs are on
the Web at jobsmart.org.
</P>
<P>
   ``Know your industry and know what the market bears,'' Culver
says. ``Answer it with a range.''
</P>
<P>
   _ WOULD YOU HIRE YOU?
</P>
<P>
   Job hunters often forget to make it clear to the interviewer how
they would help a company, Visconti says. ``They forget the other
side. They forget to look at it from the perspective of the
employer.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A once-proud automotive name, Maserati, will be seen once again
in the United States, if the company follows through on its plan to
return to the American market in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Maserati stopped selling cars in the United States in 1993, the
year it fell under the control of Fiat SpA. Last year, another Fiat
subsidiary, Ferrari, assumed management control of Maserati, its
longtime rival on the race track.
</P>
<P>
   An important milepost in Maserati's long, turbulent history will
come at the end of this month, when the Italian automaker's new
coupe makes its debut at the Paris Auto Show. The coupe, whose name
has not been announced, will be the first truly new Maserati model
since Fiat bought the company five years ago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This coupe, along with a convertible version to be shown later,
will be the main weapons in Maserati's assault on the U.S. market.
They will later be joined by a new-generation four-door sedan,
which is scheduled for Europe in 2000. The cars, which will be
priced from $75,000 to $125,000, are likely to be sold by Ferrari
dealers now that the two old rivals are part of the same industrial
group. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The conservatively styled coupe is the work of Giorgio Giugiaro,
one of the world's most respected car designers. It will use a
traditional front-engine, rear-drive layout and be powered by a
twin-turbocharged version of Maserati's V8. With anticipated output
of up to 400 horsepower, the cars will not be for the
faint-hearted. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After decades of steady decline, the automaker is ready for a
fresh start. Four brothers of a family named Maserati founded the
company to tune race engines in the north-central Italian city of
Modena in 1914. Another brother, an artist, got the idea for
Maserati's trident emblem from a popular symbol of Bologna, a major
city nearby. The symbol became famous on the world's race tracks
after Maserati made its first car in 1926 _ the Tipo 26 Targa
Florio. The company decided in 1949 to begin producing road cars,
about the time the Maserati brothers ceded control to the Orsi
family.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, the Orsis sold Maserati to Citroen of France, but the
change failed to provide stability. With oil crisis problems of its
own in the early 1970s, Citroen decided to shut down Maserati. But
it was rescued by an Italian state holding company and an Argentine
entrepreneur with grand ideas, Alejandro de Tomaso. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the succession of owners, no one managed to put Maserati
on a firm commercial footing. The cars were strong on performance,
style and cachet, but short on practicality, quality and
reliability.
</P>
<P>
   Production, which peaked at more than 6,000 in the early 1980s,
fell two-thirds by the start of the '90s. An ambitious plan to make
10,000 coupes a year for Chrysler _ the TC by Maserati based on
Chrysler's plebeian K-cars _ was emblematic of the misjudgments. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maserati's volume was little more than 500 by 1993, when de
Tomaso, then in poor health, agreed to sell his remaining shares to
Fiat, which already owned a sizable stake. Fiat immediately began a
new-model program and reorganized the haphazard production
operations. Output crept up, and an attack was begun on Maserati's
low productivity and dubious quality.
</P>
<P>
   But program delays and continuing losses required more drastic
measures. They came last year, after Ferrari _ Maserati's old race
track adversary _ was put in charge.
</P>
<P>
   The destinies of both companies are now the responsibility of
Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, a confidant of Giovanni Agnelli, the
Fiat patriarch. Di Montezemolo, who was an assistant to Enzo
Ferrari in the mid-1970s, became Ferrari's chairman and president
in 1991. After taking on similar responsibilities at Maserati, one
of his first moves was to suspend output for five months while
modern production equipment was installed. Now, Maserati talks of
edging up production to perhaps 6,000 a year by early in the next
century. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To do so, Ferrari and Maserati must stop fighting over the same
wealthy customers. That means giving the marques complementary
roles. As di Montezemolo sees it, Ferraris are extroverts, the
ultimate in high-ticket, high-technology machines. Maseratis are
less expensive, though definitely not cheap, and are aimed at the
more sober-suited banker who likes an occasional burst of speed.
The visual difference is like the contrast between Versace and
Armani. The image difference is like the contrast between Hollywood
and the Hamptons. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, is the theory. The critical question is whether
fancy-car buyers care about Maserati anymore. That is particularly
true in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   When the cars go on sale in 2001, how many buyers will even
remember Maserati? Historians and racing aficionados know about
Maserati's racing heritage: Wilbur Shaw's Indy 500 victories in
1939 and '40; Juan Manuel Fangio's World Championship in 1957, and
Stirling Moss' fondness at Monte Carlo for the Tipo 61, known as
the Birdcage because of its multitube chassis construction. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those glory days, though, may be just for the graybeards.
Younger buyers with shorter memories recall only unreliable
Maserati grand touring cars and the questionable Chrysler TC.
Replacing that nightmare with the legend will require more than
just good products.  &QL;

 &HT;    GINGRICH REPORTEDLY TO PUSH FOR MORE MONEY FOR
``HISPANIC-SERVING'' COLLEGES
 &HT;    By CHRISTI HARLAN
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Speaker Newt Gingrich told a group of
Hispanic leaders Thursday that he will ask his colleagues to
approve more money for so-called ``Hispanic-serving'' colleges and
to pay for a full census in 2000, according to the group's
president.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's pledge was important because ``this Congress is
following down a path of being anti-Latino,'' said Arturo Vargas,
president of the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda, a coalition
of national Hispanic organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The group's meeting Thursday with Gingrich was its second this
year _ the first was in June _ and Vargas called the meetings ``a
historic development.'' Gingrich expects to meet with the Hispanic
leaders ``on a regular basis,'' said his spokeswoman, Christina
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although they may not agree on how to handle each issue, they
agreed that it's in everyone's best interest to continue the
dialogue,'' Martin said. ``Where there is agreement, the speaker
and the (Hispanic leaders) will work together as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   As Vargas put it: ``We recognize that we have differences, and
we also have areas where we can work together.''
</P>
<P>
   On the census, for instance, Hispanic groups have supported
``sampling,'' a scientific estimate that would allow the Census
Bureau to count households that don't respond to mail or
census-takers. In the 1990 census, Hispanics were undercounted, in
part because Hispanics immigrants who are living illegally in the
United States are reluctant to respond to census-takers.
</P>
<P>
   But House Republicans not only have voted to prohibit sampling,
they filed and won a lawsuit to stop the Census Bureau from using
the estimate. Gingrich on Thursday assured the Hispanic leaders
that he will press for enough money to allow the Census Bureau to
reach every household it can.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a commitment we will hold him to,'' Vargas said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich also offered to urge committee leaders in the House to
increase the pool of money available to the 202 so-called
Hispanic-serving colleges and universities _ those where 25 percent
or more of full-time students are Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``These institutions also serve a lot of other minorities,''
said Roger Campos, vice president of governmental relations for the
Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities. ``They're the
ones who need the most and receive the least.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic-serving institutions competed this year for a total
of $12 million, and that was parcelled out to 37 schools. The House
has voted to make $16 million available to the schools next year,
and the Senate has approved $17 million, Campos said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said he would contact House committee leaders about
increasing the allocation to a minimum of $28 million, the amount
requested by the Clinton administration, according to Campos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very impressed with Speaker Gingrich's understanding of
our issue,'' he said.

 &HT;    RELIGIOUS, CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS PUSH FOR PASSAGE OF AFRICA
TRADE BILL
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (f) Financial
categories.
 &HT;    By NICHOLE MONROE 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Amid a bipartisan group of religious leaders and
U.S. congressmen, Sen. Phil Gramm on Thursday pledged to push
landmark legislation that would, for the first time in nearly 40
years, significantly upgrade trade policy between the United States
and sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, R-Texas, said passage of the African Growth and
Opportunity Act, now awaiting a Senate vote, would be an
opportunity for Americans to buy African products and aid a region
that has been long neglected and beleaguered by poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's statements came as religious leaders from across
the country met in Washington Thursday to show support for the
bill. The measure aims to strengthen and expand the private sector
in sub-Saharan Africa and increase trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe quite simply that Africa matters,'' said Rev. Joan
Campbell, general secretary of the National Council of Churches.
``This holds the potential for enhancing the overall economic
situation. It doesn't matter how imperfect it is. We may not have
the opportunity again if we don't do it now.''
</P>
<P>
   But those who oppose the bill, including South African President
Nelson Mandela, say the legislation has too many strings attached
and imposes unfair conditions on African countries while
benefitting large foreign corporations.
</P>
<P>
   A primary concern is the controversial ``fast track'' trade
legislation attached to the overall Africa trade bill by a
Republican-dominated Senate panel. The so-called fast-track trade
authority, which would allow the president to negotiate trade deals
without congressional approval, has been staunchly opposed by
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Another obstacle to the overall bill, however, is that it would
grant duty-free access to textiles from Africa only if the garments
are assembled and cut from American fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm said the textile provision would ``kill the bill'' because
African countries would be unable to fairly compete if made to buy
U.S. fabric. ``I intend to get that provision out before it
passes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As time grows short in the current congressional session, there
has been increasing urgency to have the bill approved. In a letter
sent this week to a co-author of the trade bill, Rep. Charles B.
Rangel, D-N.Y., President Clinton expressed his desire to have the
bill approved, but made no mention of the fast-track provision.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Philip M. Crane, R-Ill., said although Clinton is not
pushing for fast-track, the authority should still be included.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need fast track in the legislation, otherwise its like
having icing without the cake,'' Crane said.

<P>
   ``Nothing in his life became him like the leaving it,'' says
Malcolm of Cawdor in ``Macbeth.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bill Clinton's case, nothing in his presidency condemns him
like his failure to leave it. He has broken his trust and disgraced
his office, but he clings on.
</P>
<P>
   Saving his skin at all costs, against the odds, has become the
theme of his political career. Each escape is notched up as a
victory.
</P>
<P>
   But every time he wriggles through -- grubbier, slicker,
trailing longer festoons of contrition -- he does more damage to
his country.
</P>
<P>
   In New York this week it was as if nothing had happened.
``Business as usual'' was the phrase. His wife was smiling at him
again. Cabinet members were applauding. The Dow was rallying.
</P>
<P>
   At the party fund-raisers the president attended, not a seat was
empty. Clinton spoke of the huge financial challenges facing the
world, and of America's obligation to lead it ``in a way that is
consistent with our values.''
</P>
<P>
   Words like this are meant to show that he is in charge, and some
will hear them that way. But there is nothing behind them. What can
``consistent with our values'' possibly mean, when the overwhelming
majority of Americans think Clinton's values have little to do with
theirs?
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to understand why Clinton is fighting. He has
everything to lose and, in his view, no good reason to lose it. The
report into his misconduct by the independent counsel, Kenneth
Starr, has played into his hands. Its 445 pages fail to deliver a
knockout blow. There is strong evidence of perjury before a grand
jury, which is a serious crime: but in the public's mind it is just
more lies about sex, and that is deemed a forgivable sort of
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest -- witness-tampering, obstruction of justice, abuse
of power-- the evidence is less clear-cut.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether it is a tale of the tawdry emotional difficulties of
two people, Bill and Monica, caught out in something they knew they
should stop.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has piled on the sexual details, to excess; but the
details of anyone's sex life, presented to an outside audience,
could look similarly comic and dirty. Above all, whatever happened
to Whitewater, Travelgate, Filegate and the rest?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton senses, correctly, that the report has caused a backlash
against Starr. The independent counsel has always been unpopular.
Now he appears both prurient and unfair. The long-term effect of
this extraordinary inquiry may well be that no future Kenneth Starr
is let loose against a sitting president.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, according to the opinion polls, most Americans are
content -- eager would be too strong a word -- that Clinton should
stay. No impeachment, no resignation; perhaps a simple vote of
censure by Congress, a mere slap on the wrist, and swiftly back to
work.
</P>
<P>
   But that won't do. Perjury before a grand jury, as exhaustively
described by Starr, is worthy of impeachment. And even if it is not
deemed impeachable, that does not mean it should be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   Those in authority are rightly held to certain standards. In any
other walk of public life, Clinton's flagrant lying (to say nothing
of the sexual dalliance) would have him out on his ear.
</P>
<P>
   Is the leader of the world's most powerful country to be allowed
a lower standard of behavior just because he sits in the White
House? The reverse should be true; precisely because he sits in the
White House, the perceived exemplar and guardian of his country, he
should be prepared to leave if he cannot behave.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of Starr's report are two inescapable facts.
Clinton held his office cheap, and held lies dear. There is no
reason to think this will change. Since mid-August he has
apologized so many times that, if contrition were taxed, he would
be bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   But if he is so sorry, why the full-throttle legal defense
against Starr's accusations? At the famous prayer breakfast on
Sept. 11, at which he spoke of his sin and his ``broken spirit,''
the cameras caught him peeping round in the middle of his prayers,
as if to check that everyone was watching. This is a consummate
politician who knows exactly what strings, including heartstrings,
he must pull to stay in office.
</P>
<P>
   That skill is the reason Americans think he should stay. That
moral bankruptcy is why he must go.
</P>
<P>
   All Clinton's considerable energies are now turned in only one
direction: his political survival. This means fighting, at full
stretch, all charges already made and still to come. And there are
certainly more to come.
</P>
<P>
   Starr may yet have something to report on the other scandals,
including Whitewater; he is said to have found nothing impeachable,
but plenty that reinforces the pervading aura of sleaze. Meanwhile,
other sexual skeletons may continue to tumble out of closets. All
will be ridiculed, denied, resisted, rebutted, for as long as it
takes.
</P>
<P>
   America and the world at large have already suffered many months
of this. They are crying out for the president's concentrated
attention. People may not care that he is a philanderer, but they
cannot afford his distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's legislative ambitions have long been consigned to the
sidelines. His foreign-policy initiatives -- attempting to revive
the Middle East's hope of peace, fighting newly-resurgent
terrorism, coping with collapsing Russia -- are in desperate need
of new commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who still respect this president, a dwindling band,
no longer have any expectations of him. He has severed the trust
and thrown away the moral suasion that make presidents effective.
He may well stay in office for another two years, but consumed with
his own image and continuously on the defensive. No country can
afford that.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton still has a chance to do the decent thing. He has primed
Al Gore, his vice president, to carry on his New Democrat agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Now, since Clinton is no longer a credible standard-bearer
himself, he should give Gore his chance. The vice president is not
free of legal questions, but his impeccable private life makes him
the man for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats would rally to him, the public would sympathize; he
would be able to lead and govern and, at least for a time, turn the
country to a fresh page.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it will not happen. Clinton, the Comeback Kid, has
seen enough glints of light to persuade him to stay. This is a man
who supposes that even after congressional censure he could bounce
back grinning. Perhaps he could.
</P>
<P>
   But the spectacle has become too painful, too empty and too
wearying to contemplate. Don't bounce. Just go.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Nothing in his life became him like the leaving it,'' says
Malcolm of Cawdor in ``Macbeth.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bill Clinton's case, nothing in his presidency condemns him
like his failure to leave it. He has broken his trust and disgraced
his office, but he clings on.
</P>
<P>
   Saving his skin at all costs, against the odds, has become the
theme of his political career. Each escape is notched up as a
victory.
</P>
<P>
   But every time he wriggles through -- grubbier, slicker,
trailing longer festoons of contrition -- he does more damage to
his country.
</P>
<P>
   In New York this week it was as if nothing had happened.
``Business as usual'' was the phrase. His wife was smiling at him
again. Cabinet members were applauding. The Dow was rallying.
</P>
<P>
   At the party fund-raisers the president attended, not a seat was
empty. Clinton spoke of the huge financial challenges facing the
world, and of America's obligation to lead it ``in a way that is
consistent with our values.''
</P>
<P>
   Words like this are meant to show that he is in charge, and some
will hear them that way. But there is nothing behind them. What can
``consistent with our values'' possibly mean, when the overwhelming
majority of Americans think Clinton's values have little to do with
theirs?
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to understand why Clinton is fighting. He has
everything to lose and, in his view, no good reason to lose it. The
report into his misconduct by the independent counsel, Kenneth
Starr, has played into his hands. Its 445 pages fail to deliver a
knockout blow. There is strong evidence of perjury before a grand
jury, which is a serious crime: but in the public's mind it is just
more lies about sex, and that is deemed a forgivable sort of
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest -- witness-tampering, obstruction of justice, abuse
of power-- the evidence is less clear-cut.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether it is a tale of the tawdry emotional difficulties of
two people, Bill and Monica, caught out in something they knew they
should stop.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has piled on the sexual details, to excess; but the
details of anyone's sex life, presented to an outside audience,
could look similarly comic and dirty. Above all, whatever happened
to Whitewater, Travelgate, Filegate and the rest?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton senses, correctly, that the report has caused a backlash
against Starr. The independent counsel has always been unpopular.
Now he appears both prurient and unfair. The long-term effect of
this extraordinary inquiry may well be that no future Kenneth Starr
is let loose against a sitting president.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, according to the opinion polls, most Americans are
content -- eager would be too strong a word -- that Clinton should
stay. No impeachment, no resignation; perhaps a simple vote of
censure by Congress, a mere slap on the wrist, and swiftly back to
work.
</P>
<P>
   But that won't do. Perjury before a grand jury, as exhaustively
described by Starr, is worthy of impeachment. And even if it is not
deemed impeachable, that does not mean it should be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   Those in authority are rightly held to certain standards. In any
other walk of public life, Clinton's flagrant lying (to say nothing
of the sexual dalliance) would have him out on his ear.
</P>
<P>
   Is the leader of the world's most powerful country to be allowed
a lower standard of behavior just because he sits in the White
House? The reverse should be true; precisely because he sits in the
White House, the perceived exemplar and guardian of his country, he
should be prepared to leave if he cannot behave.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of Starr's report are two inescapable facts.
Clinton held his office cheap, and held lies dear. There is no
reason to think this will change. Since mid-August he has
apologized so many times that, if contrition were taxed, he would
be bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   But if he is so sorry, why the full-throttle legal defense
against Starr's accusations? At the famous prayer breakfast on
Sept. 11, at which he spoke of his sin and his ``broken spirit,''
the cameras caught him peeping round in the middle of his prayers,
as if to check that everyone was watching. This is a consummate
politician who knows exactly what strings, including heartstrings,
he must pull to stay in office.
</P>
<P>
   That skill is the reason Americans think he should stay. That
moral bankruptcy is why he must go.
</P>
<P>
   All Clinton's considerable energies are now turned in only one
direction: his political survival. This means fighting, at full
stretch, all charges already made and still to come. And there are
certainly more to come.
</P>
<P>
   Starr may yet have something to report on the other scandals,
including Whitewater; he is said to have found nothing impeachable,
but plenty that reinforces the pervading aura of sleaze. Meanwhile,
other sexual skeletons may continue to tumble out of closets. All
will be ridiculed, denied, resisted, rebutted, for as long as it
takes.
</P>
<P>
   America and the world at large have already suffered many months
of this. They are crying out for the president's concentrated
attention. People may not care that he is a philanderer, but they
cannot afford his distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's legislative ambitions have long been consigned to the
sidelines. His foreign-policy initiatives -- attempting to revive
the Middle East's hope of peace, fighting newly-resurgent
terrorism, coping with collapsing Russia -- are in desperate need
of new commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who still respect this president, a dwindling band,
no longer have any expectations of him. He has severed the trust
and thrown away the moral suasion that make presidents effective.
He may well stay in office for another two years, but consumed with
his own image and continuously on the defensive. No country can
afford that.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton still has a chance to do the decent thing. He has primed
Al Gore, his vice president, to carry on his New Democrat agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Now, since Clinton is no longer a credible standard-bearer
himself, he should give Gore his chance. The vice president is not
free of legal questions, but his impeccable private life makes him
the man for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats would rally to him, the public would sympathize; he
would be able to lead and govern and, at least for a time, turn the
country to a fresh page.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it will not happen. Clinton, the Comeback Kid, has
seen enough glints of light to persuade him to stay. This is a man
who supposes that even after congressional censure he could bounce
back grinning. Perhaps he could.
</P>
<P>
   But the spectacle has become too painful, too empty and too
wearying to contemplate. Don't bounce. Just go.

lined up 19 people including six children and a baby against a wall
and mowed them down after dragging them from their beds at a cattle
ranch near the U.S. border early Thursday, federal and local
officials said. They said only one man survived the shootings but
he was in critical condition. While police at the scene said a

immediately suspected a drug connection as the area is a major
corridor for smuggling cocaine into the United States. In addition,

 c.1998 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- America is a model of political continuity: its
constitution has been in force for longer than any other written
constitution in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the history of American government is marked by
turning-points, times when the constitution's workings have shifted
in big ways.
</P>
<P>
   The Civil War of 1861-65 strengthened the federal government at
the expense of the states; the New Deal strengthened the presidency
at the expense of the judiciary and Congress; Watergate weakened
the presidency again.
</P>
<P>
   For all its tawdry pathos, the crisis now engulfing Bill Clinton
may mark some kind of watershed. It may turn out to be, as Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan has proclaimed it, ``a crisis in the
regime.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, how will the regime change? At first sight, the answer is
that the power of the presidency will be diminished, and therefore
that the prestige of rival branches of government will rise.
</P>
<P>
   After Watergate, the previous big presidential scandal, Congress
passed a number of measures to limit presidential ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Something similar happened after the impeachment of Andrew
Johnson in 1868. Congress entered a period of successful
self-assertion, even claiming the right to veto the president's
dismissal of members of his own cabinet (which had been the ground
for Johnson's impeachment); and the next eight occupants of the
White House, spanning the period until the inauguration in 1901 of
the feisty Teddy Roosevelt, made little impression on the land.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, a repeat of this pattern seems likely, though for
reasons subtly different from those that mattered in the past. In
the late 19th century, the party barons who dominated Congress also
dominated the smoke-filled rooms in which presidential nominees
were selected, and so the run of weak characters in the White House
was no coincidence. In these days of primary elections, however,
there is no mechanism to ensure their weakness.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the favorites to succeed Clinton are more
competent than inspiring: on the Democratic side, the front-runner
remains the vice-president, Al Gore, though he has been weakened by
a campaign-finance scandal; on the Republican side, the line-up is
led by Governor George Bush of Texas, son and namesake of the
former president.
</P>
<P>
   But these are early days, and some powerful new figure may yet
emerge to join the fray.
</P>
<P>
   After Watergate, the presidency was weakened because Congress
asserted itself. A repeat of this seems more likely than a run of
weak characters in the White House. Impeachment, or even just talk
of it, has a way of making Congress remember its constitutional
weight.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past fortnight or so, Sen. Joe Lieberman, the Democrat
who greatly added to the tide of opinion now running against
Clinton, has reminded the country of the moral force of a speech
delivered from the Senate floor. The House, now charged with
assessing Kenneth Starr's report on Clinton's wrongdoings, may find
that this exercise brings back a lost sense of its importance.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past week, a humbled president has been grovelling to
Congress for forgiveness; and congressmen have savored the gravity
of their responsibility, entrusted to them by the country's
founders, for deciding the president's fate.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Clinton's disgrace may lead to Republican gains in
November's mid-term elections. The party stands to pick up half a
dozen seats in the House, adding a margin of comfort to its present
21-vote majority. It will probably also do well in the Senate,
where it currently holds 55 seats out of 100; it may even gain the
five seats it needs to secure a filibuster-proof majority.
</P>
<P>
   Fortified by these gains, Republican leaders may be able to
spend less time worrying about party feuds that threaten their grip
on Congress, and more time on policy. This, along with the talk of
impeachment, may restore to Congress some of the initiative usually
held by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   THE JOURNALISTS GO TO WORK
</P>
<P>
   As well as the threat of an assertive Congress, the presidency
faces the challenge of an increasingly intrusive press. This is, to
a large extent, the creation of Watergate. Until that scandal,
press assaults on presidents were muted. Top journalists were often
friends of the president and his entourage, and did not want to
jeopardize this access: they knew of John Kennedy's affairs and
Lyndon Johnson's tantrums, but they kept the public in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   During Watergate, when the Washington Post published a series of
scoops discrediting Nixon, the newspaper was widely criticized. But
the scoops proved accurate, and Hollywood made heroes out of the
Post's reporters, Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the status of journalists, and their appetite for
felling presidents, swelled mightily. They were not only prepared
to publish embarrassing facts about public figures; they were
prepared to seek out such facts, including personal ones. In 1987
another Washington Post journalist demanded to know, in the middle
of a press conference, whether Gary Hart had committed adultery;
Hart's presidential candidacy was soon at an end.
</P>
<P>
   With the Lewinsky scandal, ``gotcha journalism'' has gone
electronic. A profusion of cable television stations have served up
relays of pundits who attack the president with all the force of
Bernstein and Woodward, but often with less research. The pressure
to be first on air with the news, or first on the Internet with it,
drives the attack onward. Matt Drudge, who runs an Internet tip
sheet, has, unlike the heroes of Watergate, no ``deep throat''
source inside the White House. He merely retails political gossip.
</P>
<P>
   But, because many of the salacious rumors about Clinton have now
been substantiated, the Drudge style of journalism has acquired
some respectability, much as Watergate made deep-throat journalism
acceptable. As a result of the Lewinsky scandal, the journalists'
assault on future presidents may conceivably be fiercer than any
America has yet seen.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Watergate and to Johnson's impeachment, however,
the biggest threat to the power of the presidency now comes from
the judicial branch. During the Watergate business, Nixon was able
to fire his prosecutor, Archibald Cox, at the cost of making
himself even more unpopular. This time, Clinton's accuser is
protected by the independent-counsel statute, passed in 1978 by
Congress as part of its post-Watergate efforts to constrain the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   SHOOTING STARRS
</P>
<P>
   Since that law was passed, a score of independent prosecutors
have been appointed to investigate presidents and cabinet
officials: seven under Ronald Reagan, four during George Bush's
single term in office, seven so far under Clinton, with the
imminent possibility of two more.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the appointment of all these prosecutors has created a
kind of ratchet effect. Each time one of them asserts his authority
by new legal expedients, he creates a precedent that may be
followed by whoever is appointed next.
</P>
<P>
   As he has delved into the Lewinsky scandal, Starr has done more
than any other independent prosecutor to tighten this ratchet. He
has insisted on the right to interrogate presidential advisers
under oath, considerably narrowing the president's zone of privacy.
In May, Starr won a court case securing the right to question
Sidney Blumenthal, a White House strategist, defeating White House
arguments that Blumenthal should be protected from Starr's
subpoenas because of ``executive privilege'' (meaning, in this
case, the president's right to have confidential conversations with
close aides).
</P>
<P>
   Next, Starr won a case in which he claimed the right to question
the president's legal advisers. The White House retorted that these
should be immune from Starr's subpoena because of ``attorney-client
privilege,'' which protects ordinary lawyers from being made to
testify against their clients; but the courts decided this
privilege did not apply to White House lawyers, who are on the
public payroll.
</P>
<P>
   And then Starr sought and won the right to interrogate the
Secret Service agents who guard the president from assassins.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of this may well outlast Clinton. Even the most
upstanding of chief executives is sometimes tempted by policies
whose legality is murky; he wants to ask advisers whether a given
course of action would survive a court challenge. In future, he may
hesitate, knowing that such consultations may be used against him
by prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   David Strauss, a law professor at the University of Chicago,
goes so far as to suggest that White House aides may be reduced to
writing anonymous memos with no subject or date on the top; and
that ``anybody who takes notes during a meeting ought to have his
head examined.''
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere of legal jeopardy (while often salutary) may also
reduce the efficiency of the White House, leaving it less well
equipped to outmanoeuvre political rivals in Congress and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   THE PAULA JONES EFFECT
</P>
<P>
   On top of these precedents, the Lewinsky scandal has weakened
the presidency by demonstrating its vulnerability to private
lawsuits. The scandal came to light because of a sexual-harassment
suit filed against Clinton by Paula Jones. The judge in this case
eventually dismissed the suit. But the political consequences of
the Jones suit, from the point of view of Clinton's enemies, turned
out to be boundless. It gave Mrs. Jones's legal team power to
compel testimony from other women about their relations with the
president: and one of these women was Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting damage to Clinton has been so spectacular that
future enemies of future presidents will doubtless do their utmost
to file suits against them too.
</P>
<P>
   This is all the more likely because, last year, the Supreme
Court affirmed the legitimacy of such suits. Fearing the political
distractions arising from the Jones suit, the White House argued
that it should be delayed until the president left office. But the
Supreme Court ruled that the Jones case should proceed immediately,
setting a precedent that clears the way for more such suits in
future.
</P>
<P>
   And the effectiveness of civil suits is greatly enhanced by the
existence of the independent counsel. Once a civil suit uncovers
the first signs of presidential wrongdoing, the heavy work of
following through with the investigation can be passed on to the
special prosecutor, armed with awesome powers to compel testimony
from the top man's friends.
</P>
<P>
   It would not be surprising, or even necessarily worrying, if the
presidency did indeed emerge weakened from the Lewinsky scandal.
The power of the office has waxed and waned since its founding.
</P>
<P>
   Wars and economic crises have expanded the appetite for firm
leadership. The Civil War created the circumstances for Lincoln's
strong presidency; the dislocation wrought by mass immigration and
rapid industrialization ushered in Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow
Wilson; the Depression brought Franklin Roosevelt; the turmoil of
Vietnam and civil rights brought Lyndon Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   But the appetite for a strong presidency has never become
permanent. After Lincoln, Congress reasserted itself by impeaching
Andrew Johnson. After Roosevelt and Wilson came Harding and
Coolidge and Hoover, forgettable figures every one.
</P>
<P>
   These cycles have done as much as scandals to affect the power
of the presidency. In the 1970s, it was not just the Watergate
burglary that ushered in a period of new constraints on the White
House. It was a feeling that the presidency had grown too imperial
anyway, and that it was time to rein it in. The independent-counsel
law was a direct response to Nixon's dismissal of his Watergate
prosecutor. But the passage of the War Powers Act, asserting that
Congress must approve a president's military adventures, was a
response to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Equally, if the presidency is now weakened for a time, it will
be for reasons that reach beyond Clinton's sex life. In times of
peace and relative prosperity, Americans often profess indifference
toward presidential leadership. Journalists assail public figures
because they believe the public wants to know their dark secrets;
courts support Starr's penetration of presidential privacy because,
indirectly, they too reflect the national mood.
</P>
<P>
   In a time of crisis, both media and judiciary might behave
differently. During World War II, for example, the courts upheld
Roosevelt's internment of Japanese-Americans, even though this was
later regarded as an egregious violation of civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   It can even be argued that, in time of crisis, the Supreme
Court, sensitive to the danger of weakening the executive, might
have sided with the White House in the Paula Jones case, requiring
that her suit be shelved until the end of Clinton's term.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, despite the court's decision, and despite the media
assault on the presidency, it is not clear that America really is
in a period of indifference to executive power. The Lewinsky
scandal may come to be seen, a few years from now, as a special
case. The extension of post-Watergate checks on the presidency --
new powers for the independent counsel, and journalism's new
electronic reach -- may produce a backlash, and a demand to limit
the activities of prosecutors and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   TIDES DO TURN
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans, if you look at the opinion polls, feel queasy
about the inquisitorial culture that unearthed the Lewinsky
scandal. They do not want their president to be above the law. But
they are conscious that few ordinary citizens would be subjected to
$40 million-worth of hostile scrutiny from an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   They feel dismay at the president's conduct, and at his efforts
to conceal it. But, until now at least, they do not agree with
Starr that these constitute grounds for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next week or so, the mood may swing against the
president, vindicating the labors of his inquisitors. But, if it
does not, the drive to curb future inquisitions may take several
forms.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's Paula Jones verdict could, in theory, be
overturned by act of Congress: the court's contention that the suit
could go ahead without distracting the president from the tasks of
government has proved manifestly false.
</P>
<P>
   Equally, the lower-court rulings requiring White House lawyers
and Secret Service agents to testify before Starr might be
overturned, either in Congress or on appeal to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   But the likeliest kind of anti-inquisitorial backlash concerns
the independent counsel himself.
</P>
<P>
   The law authorizing the appointment of independent counsels
expires next year, and the betting is that it will not be renewed
in its current form. Republicans have long disliked the law,
regarding it as an excessive check on the presidency; thanks to
Starr, Democrats too have come to dislike it.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides complain that independent counsels are appointed too
frequently and that, once appointed, they can expand their
investigations too easily -- as Starr did, ranging from obscure
Arkansas land deals to Oval Office sex.
</P>
<P>
   This has been so widely criticized that future presidential
prosecutors are likely to find their responsibilities more narrowly
delineated. They may be told to investigate a particular
allegation, rather than to embark on a general search for
information embarrassing to their target; their time and budget may
be limited.
</P>
<P>
   By defanging the main judicial challenge to the presidency, this
would make America's executive stronger than it was before the
Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   It may even be possible, to some degree, to defang ``gotcha''
journalism. For all its competitive aggression, the press is
capable of restraint if it thinks the public (or even the White
House) demands it: there has been almost no coverage, for example,
of how the unfortunate Chelsea Clinton is handling her father's
behavior. And almost any journalist is sensitive to the possibility
that too much cynicism may cause him to lose touch with his
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Even if invasive journalism proves enduring -- and, given the
competitive pressure exerted by cable television and the Internet,
it may well do -- its impact on presidential power may wane.
Americans may continue to watch talk shows that air embarrassing
personal facts about their presidents; but they may be decreasingly
moved by them.
</P>
<P>
   From the start of the Lewinsky scandal, journalists have
assailed the president, but their audiences have been reluctant to
pass judgment on him. It may turn out that the post-Watergate drive
to expose the truth about public figures has, after the first brave
hope that this would produce better leaders, simply deepened the
voters' tolerance of imperfection.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, the Lewinsky scandal may indeed mark a watershed in
American politics, but not the one that seems most obvious now.
Rather than weakening the presidency, it may represent a softening
of the standards by which presidents are judged. Rather than
extending Watergate's inquisitorial culture, it may represent the
end of the idealism on which that culture was based.
</P>
<P>
   After Nixon's fall, Americans hoped that a vigilant press and a
determined prosecutor could prevent presidential wrongdoing, and
thereby ensure that the country would be blessed with virtuous
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps no amount of vigilance and prosecutorial energy is
able to cleanse politics, and even Americans may give up hoping
that it can.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- America is a model of political continuity: its
constitution has been in force for longer than any other written
constitution in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the history of American government is marked by
turning-points, times when the constitution's workings have shifted
in big ways.
</P>
<P>
   The Civil War of 1861-65 strengthened the federal government at
the expense of the states; the New Deal strengthened the presidency
at the expense of the judiciary and Congress; Watergate weakened
the presidency again.
</P>
<P>
   For all its tawdry pathos, the crisis now engulfing Bill Clinton
may mark some kind of watershed. It may turn out to be, as Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan has proclaimed it, ``a crisis in the
regime.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, how will the regime change? At first sight, the answer is
that the power of the presidency will be diminished, and therefore
that the prestige of rival branches of government will rise.
</P>
<P>
   After Watergate, the previous big presidential scandal, Congress
passed a number of measures to limit presidential ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Something similar happened after the impeachment of Andrew
Johnson in 1868. Congress entered a period of successful
self-assertion, even claiming the right to veto the president's
dismissal of members of his own cabinet (which had been the ground
for Johnson's impeachment); and the next eight occupants of the
White House, spanning the period until the inauguration in 1901 of
the feisty Teddy Roosevelt, made little impression on the land.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, a repeat of this pattern seems likely, though for
reasons subtly different from those that mattered in the past. In
the late 19th century, the party barons who dominated Congress also
dominated the smoke-filled rooms in which presidential nominees
were selected, and so the run of weak characters in the White House
was no coincidence. In these days of primary elections, however,
there is no mechanism to ensure their weakness.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the favorites to succeed Clinton are more
competent than inspiring: on the Democratic side, the front-runner
remains the vice-president, Al Gore, though he has been weakened by
a campaign-finance scandal; on the Republican side, the line-up is
led by Governor George Bush of Texas, son and namesake of the
former president.
</P>
<P>
   But these are early days, and some powerful new figure may yet
emerge to join the fray.
</P>
<P>
   After Watergate, the presidency was weakened because Congress
asserted itself. A repeat of this seems more likely than a run of
weak characters in the White House. Impeachment, or even just talk
of it, has a way of making Congress remember its constitutional
weight.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past fortnight or so, Sen. Joe Lieberman, the Democrat
who greatly added to the tide of opinion now running against
Clinton, has reminded the country of the moral force of a speech
delivered from the Senate floor. The House, now charged with
assessing Kenneth Starr's report on Clinton's wrongdoings, may find
that this exercise brings back a lost sense of its importance.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past week, a humbled president has been grovelling to
Congress for forgiveness; and congressmen have savored the gravity
of their responsibility, entrusted to them by the country's
founders, for deciding the president's fate.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Clinton's disgrace may lead to Republican gains in
November's mid-term elections. The party stands to pick up half a
dozen seats in the House, adding a margin of comfort to its present
21-vote majority. It will probably also do well in the Senate,
where it currently holds 55 seats out of 100; it may even gain the
five seats it needs to secure a filibuster-proof majority.
</P>
<P>
   Fortified by these gains, Republican leaders may be able to
spend less time worrying about party feuds that threaten their grip
on Congress, and more time on policy. This, along with the talk of
impeachment, may restore to Congress some of the initiative usually
held by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   THE JOURNALISTS GO TO WORK
</P>
<P>
   As well as the threat of an assertive Congress, the presidency
faces the challenge of an increasingly intrusive press. This is, to
a large extent, the creation of Watergate. Until that scandal,
press assaults on presidents were muted. Top journalists were often
friends of the president and his entourage, and did not want to
jeopardize this access: they knew of John Kennedy's affairs and
Lyndon Johnson's tantrums, but they kept the public in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   During Watergate, when the Washington Post published a series of
scoops discrediting Nixon, the newspaper was widely criticized. But
the scoops proved accurate, and Hollywood made heroes out of the
Post's reporters, Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the status of journalists, and their appetite for
felling presidents, swelled mightily. They were not only prepared
to publish embarrassing facts about public figures; they were
prepared to seek out such facts, including personal ones. In 1987
another Washington Post journalist demanded to know, in the middle
of a press conference, whether Gary Hart had committed adultery;
Hart's presidential candidacy was soon at an end.
</P>
<P>
   With the Lewinsky scandal, ``gotcha journalism'' has gone
electronic. A profusion of cable television stations have served up
relays of pundits who attack the president with all the force of
Bernstein and Woodward, but often with less research. The pressure
to be first on air with the news, or first on the Internet with it,
drives the attack onward. Matt Drudge, who runs an Internet tip
sheet, has, unlike the heroes of Watergate, no ``deep throat''
source inside the White House. He merely retails political gossip.
</P>
<P>
   But, because many of the salacious rumors about Clinton have now
been substantiated, the Drudge style of journalism has acquired
some respectability, much as Watergate made deep-throat journalism
acceptable. As a result of the Lewinsky scandal, the journalists'
assault on future presidents may conceivably be fiercer than any
America has yet seen.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Watergate and to Johnson's impeachment, however,
the biggest threat to the power of the presidency now comes from
the judicial branch. During the Watergate business, Nixon was able
to fire his prosecutor, Archibald Cox, at the cost of making
himself even more unpopular. This time, Clinton's accuser is
protected by the independent-counsel statute, passed in 1978 by
Congress as part of its post-Watergate efforts to constrain the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   SHOOTING STARRS
</P>
<P>
   Since that law was passed, a score of independent prosecutors
have been appointed to investigate presidents and cabinet
officials: seven under Ronald Reagan, four during George Bush's
single term in office, seven so far under Clinton, with the
imminent possibility of two more.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the appointment of all these prosecutors has created a
kind of ratchet effect. Each time one of them asserts his authority
by new legal expedients, he creates a precedent that may be
followed by whoever is appointed next.
</P>
<P>
   As he has delved into the Lewinsky scandal, Starr has done more
than any other independent prosecutor to tighten this ratchet. He
has insisted on the right to interrogate presidential advisers
under oath, considerably narrowing the president's zone of privacy.
In May, Starr won a court case securing the right to question
Sidney Blumenthal, a White House strategist, defeating White House
arguments that Blumenthal should be protected from Starr's
subpoenas because of ``executive privilege'' (meaning, in this
case, the president's right to have confidential conversations with
close aides).
</P>
<P>
   Next, Starr won a case in which he claimed the right to question
the president's legal advisers. The White House retorted that these
should be immune from Starr's subpoena because of ``attorney-client
privilege,'' which protects ordinary lawyers from being made to
testify against their clients; but the courts decided this
privilege did not apply to White House lawyers, who are on the
public payroll.
</P>
<P>
   And then Starr sought and won the right to interrogate the
Secret Service agents who guard the president from assassins.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of this may well outlast Clinton. Even the most
upstanding of chief executives is sometimes tempted by policies
whose legality is murky; he wants to ask advisers whether a given
course of action would survive a court challenge. In future, he may
hesitate, knowing that such consultations may be used against him
by prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   David Strauss, a law professor at the University of Chicago,
goes so far as to suggest that White House aides may be reduced to
writing anonymous memos with no subject or date on the top; and
that ``anybody who takes notes during a meeting ought to have his
head examined.''
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere of legal jeopardy (while often salutary) may also
reduce the efficiency of the White House, leaving it less well
equipped to outmanoeuvre political rivals in Congress and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   THE PAULA JONES EFFECT
</P>
<P>
   On top of these precedents, the Lewinsky scandal has weakened
the presidency by demonstrating its vulnerability to private
lawsuits. The scandal came to light because of a sexual-harassment
suit filed against Clinton by Paula Jones. The judge in this case
eventually dismissed the suit. But the political consequences of
the Jones suit, from the point of view of Clinton's enemies, turned
out to be boundless. It gave Mrs. Jones's legal team power to
compel testimony from other women about their relations with the
president: and one of these women was Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting damage to Clinton has been so spectacular that
future enemies of future presidents will doubtless do their utmost
to file suits against them too.
</P>
<P>
   This is all the more likely because, last year, the Supreme
Court affirmed the legitimacy of such suits. Fearing the political
distractions arising from the Jones suit, the White House argued
that it should be delayed until the president left office. But the
Supreme Court ruled that the Jones case should proceed immediately,
setting a precedent that clears the way for more such suits in
future.
</P>
<P>
   And the effectiveness of civil suits is greatly enhanced by the
existence of the independent counsel. Once a civil suit uncovers
the first signs of presidential wrongdoing, the heavy work of
following through with the investigation can be passed on to the
special prosecutor, armed with awesome powers to compel testimony
from the top man's friends.
</P>
<P>
   It would not be surprising, or even necessarily worrying, if the
presidency did indeed emerge weakened from the Lewinsky scandal.
The power of the office has waxed and waned since its founding.
</P>
<P>
   Wars and economic crises have expanded the appetite for firm
leadership. The Civil War created the circumstances for Lincoln's

rapid industrialization ushered in Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow

 &HT;    North Georgia farmer overcame blindness to become a literacy
legend
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINERAL BLUFF, Ga. _Twice blind and hurtling toward 70, Wendell
Cross figured it was a good time to learn to read. So he did. That
was back in the late 1980s, after he and his wife, Eula Mae, had
raised 11 children on a bountiful farm and an often iffy income.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Cross is something of a celebrity in adult-literacy
circles, his story an inspiration to those who cannot read. Too,
his story is one of redemption _ Cross admits he ``raised hell''
before finding God. And it is a story about will and grit, mixed in
with a serious sense of humor _ all of which served Cross well in
his long, painful, hopeful journey toward light and learning.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the mountains of North Georgia, his name comes up often
when people talk of overcoming adversity. ``You know about Wendell
Cross?'' a man in nearby McCaysville asked, as we finished talking
about another story. ``You ought to meet him.''
</P>
<P>
   To meet him is to meet a man who can tell a story with the best
_ in a speech pattern whose melodic mountain rhythms have been only
slightly diluted by his relatively new venture into academia and
speechmaking: Fewer ``a'' prefixes adorn words such as hunting and
plowing than before, for example. Acutely aware of the changes,
Cross loves to joke about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to get mad!'' he thunders, pacing back and forth in the
living room, where his wife looks on, intently amused; she knows
what's coming. ``But now, I get fruss-trated,'' he says, drawing
out the word. ``Before I learned to read, I used to say 'fessional;
now I say professional. Used to be 'simmon. Now it's persimmon.''
</P>
<P>
   What a long, hard trip it's been.
</P>
<P>
   Cross, 75, was born in Cherokee County(N.C.), grew up in Polk
County(Tenn.), and moved to Fannin County at 15. Like a lot of
country folks in big families, he didn't get a lot of schooling;
farm work was considered more important. Moreover, Cross
acknowledges, he ``was lazy'' when it came to school. He attended
up to third grade but never learned how to read.
</P>
<P>
   He's matter-of-fact reciting these facts, but you can feel the
hurt when he tells how he lost his sight for the first time back in
the early 1930s, along with a piece of his left thumb and index
finger _ the ones holding the dynamite cap.
</P>
<P>
   He and one of his six brothers (he had seven sisters) were
playing with the cap at home, after finding it along a road where a
construction crew had been working. Cross, then 11, recalls:
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what the thing was. I was in the house a-pickin'
it with a bobby pin. When it hit the stove, it sparked. My mom
said, `Get that stinking thing out of here.' I went out of the
house and stepped off the porch. Then I struck fire to that thing.
They come running out, and I said, `Mommy, I can't see.'
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `Lord, have mercy, son, you're blowed all to
pieces.'''
</P>
<P>
   For almost a decade, he lived in darkness. Doctors in Knoxville
and Chattanooga could fix his hand, ``but they said I'd never
see.'' Cross differed, dreaming of one day regaining his sight. In
his late teens, he set out to raise enough money for an operation.
Cutting wood for 10 cents an hour, it took him two years to raise
$25. Two brothers gave him $25 apiece, as did a church, the Red
Cross and the Kiwanis Club.
</P>
<P>
   At age 20, Cross says, he got his operation at Georgia Baptist
Hospital in Atlanta, where doctors ``cut the burnt off'' his left
eye. Before the operation, ``I could see a shadow, but I couldn't
tell whether you were a man or woman or a poodle dog.'' His right
eye was ``ruint'' by the dynamite, then further damaged in 1963 _
he was working on a car when pliers holding a spring flew into his
eye. It was replaced with an artificial one.
</P>
<P>
   His better left eye went bad again in 1965 when he suffered a
detached retina _ resulting from frequent falls that had begun
after he was struck by lightning years earlier. Cast back into
blindness, he soon had surgery, at a different hospital, telling
doctors, ``The good Lord ain't told me yet that I'm going to be
blind.'' And again, he could see, with the aid of powerful glasses,
which he wears today (he usually wears a hat, too, often a black
cowboy model, even indoors, to avoid glare).
</P>
<P>
   After he and Eula Mae married in 1947, Wendell worked in a
string of short-lived jobs, such as janitor and wood hauler. He
grew food to feed the family. (He and Eula Mae still grow
everything from corn to cows to honeybees on four rolling acres,
canning fresh vegetables and collecting eggs by the dozens.) They
raised 11 children, got on Social Security and, in the 1980s, he
worked at the family filling station and store in Mineral Bluff.
Through it all, he simmered with a desire to read and anger that he
could not.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little kid would bring in a note to tell what he wanted, and
I couldn't read it,'' he says. ``I'd call Eula Mae (she has a
fifth-grade education) and spell it over to her and she'd tell me
what it was.'' He couldn't order food in restaurants. Couldn't read
signs in stores. Books, including the Bible, were impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Eula Mae remembers well what life was like before Wendell
learned to read. ``He wouldn't even go in the store because he
didn't know what to get,'' she said quietly. ``Wouldn't go to
restaurants.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was more. ``She wouldn't tell it, so I'll tell it for
her,'' Wendell thundered. ``She wouldn't go nowhere with me 'cause
I raised hell all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to read so bad I couldn't stand it. One day (in the
late 1980s) I got up and I went up on the mountain and I prayed,
`Oh, Lord, send me a teacher. I want to learn to read so people
won't laugh at me and think I'm crazy.'''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, he got help from several people, including
Oscar Poole, the barbecue baron of East Ellijay, whose
establishment is known for its ``Pig Hill of Fame,'' now sprouting
3,000 plywood porkers stuck in the ground with customers' names
painted on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little voice said, `Go by the Cross' station,''' Poole
recalled the other day. So he did, and the two men began talking.
Poole told Cross, ``I am the teacher.'' Poole, who has taught
school in Mineral Bluff, soon had Cross practicing his ABCs,
singing them to the tune of ``America, the Beautiful,'' and
learning sounds of letters. When paper wasn't available, lessons
were written in the sand.
</P>
<P>
   Relishing the telling, Cross recalls, softly: ``He said, `I'll
teach you the phonics: B _ baby. C _ car.' One day, he said,
`Wendell, today I'm going to teach you the vowels.' I said,
`Vowels? That's what's in cars.' I didn't know what he was talking
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of Cross' inspirational story got around Fannin County, and
he began making speeches. After his presentation at a church,
Barbara Smith, then the county's vocational education director,
encouraged Cross to join an adult literacy program.
</P>
<P>
   That's where he met Jill Key, who became his teacher and remains
his friend and helper, handling logistics for his speaking
engagements around the state. Key, executive director of the Fannin
Literacy Action Group, said Cross ``has the spark'' necessary to
learn. By contrast, she said, ``a lot of older people say, `I've
made it this far. . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Such people have been known to use ``a barter system, in which
someone will say, `Read this for me, and I'll fix your tire,'''
said Daphne Greenberg, associate director of Georgia State
University's Center for the Study of Adult Literacy.
</P>
<P>
   Not satisfied with bartering or settling, Cross always worked to
go higher, further.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of an hours-long visit, he pointed out a tiny
room in the same outbuilding as his gristmill, where he would study
reading on his own, often late into the night. It still contains a
big stuffed chair, a desk scattered with audiotapes. A telephone
with huge numbers. And ghosts of illiteracy. ``I don't use it
anymore,'' Cross said of the study room, ``because I'm not afraid
no more.''
</P>
<P>
   No, he's proud these days, showing off a stack of literacy
awards _ medals, proclamations; he's the ``permanent ambassador for
literacy'' for the Fannin literacy group. Letters have come from
Barbara Bush and Gov. Zell Miller. And Cross has a veritable
gallery of photographs with first lady Shirley Miller, impassioned
literacy advocate, as well as shots with a Miss America, actor
Danny Glover and the Atlanta Falcons cheerleaders.
</P>
<P>
   What does it all mean?
</P>
<P>
   Independence. Cross can read his own Bible, his own letters, his
own signs. No big deal for readers, such a huge one for nonreaders.
</P>
<P>
   Making the point, he again jumps to his feet and strides back
and forth, preaching in a big voice, as if for one of his
audiences: ``You guys don't appreciate reading like I do because
you've read all your lives. It's just handy. Buddy, go through all
these years when you can't order your meal, don't know whether the
sign says `get out' or `get in' or `go over yonder.'''
</P>
<P>
   Wendell Cross has gone through and come out on the other side,
gaining the best of several worlds. Sight. Extraordinary hearing,
developed when he was blind (he still automatically turns his ears
toward a person before his eyes). ``And I can read! Amen! Ain't
that great!
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to go around, saying, `Here, Eula Mae, read
this.' I just stop down there (at the roadside mailbox) and read it
and bring it up here and throw it on the shelf. Just like therest
of them do. I don't have to ask nobody what's in there. Ain't that
great!''

 &HT;    COLUMN: A guide to English for those who care about the language
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 20: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The critic John Simon once wrote of the time he was editor for
W.H. Auden, Lionel Trilling and Jacques Barzun, an apprenticeship
that must have been akin to a young lawyer's clerking for a U.S.
Supreme Court justice. Simon, not yet the marauding tiger he would
later become, had the modest job of getting out a book club's
monthly newsmagazine. Auden, Trilling and Barzun were contributors
to the magazine, and it was Simon's job to correct their occasional
lapses in grammar and style _ a duty one imagines him shouldering
with the resoluteness of a Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   He told the story with much good humor, and what it had to say
about Barzun was revealing of a man certain in his judgment. By
comparison, Auden treated his fugitive pieces less seriously than
his poetry and cheerily left the straightening out of a miscast
sentence to his editor, ``whom he treated with a charming mixture
of gratitude and indifference.'' Not so Trilling or Barzun, at the
time eminences on the faculty of Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   Barzun was both a distinguished historian and an acknowledged
authority on English usage _ and, in the latter capacity, a ready
knuckle-rapper. ``He required very little editing,'' Simon wrote,
``and accepted less.'' Indeed, it was under Barzun's direction that
the classic work of Wilson Follett, ``Modern American Usage,'' was
finished after its author's death. On this side of the Atlantic,
the book that Follett conceived but did not live to complete stands
beside the original edition of W.H. Fowler's ``Dictionary of Modern
English Usage'' as an indispensable guide not just for writers but
for anyone who cares about the language.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler (as it's called), first published in 1926, is the better
known and was once as familiar in newsrooms as green eyeshades and
glue pots. Things change, not always for the better. Yet, as witty
and magisterially assertive as Fowler was, the tone and emphasis
were more British than American. Follett modeled his book on
Fowler, but addressed himself to the language as it's written and
spoken in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of distinctions
</P>
<P>
   My own Follett, 32 years after its publication, still gives good
service, like a car that never fails to start. But a tuneup and
sometimes an overhaul can make a good car better, and Erik Wensberg
has achieved this with the first revised edition of ``Modern
English Usage: A Guide''(Hill and Wang, $25). Like Follett himself
and like Barzun _ who recommended him for the assignment _ Wensberg
is not wishy-washy. He prescribes without apology. He knows that
language changes, and with it the conventions of usage and niceties
of style. But he is wise enough to know that change for the sake of
change is chaos _ or worse.
</P>
<P>
   Degradation and abuse of the language are routinely
rationalized. Change, the ignorant advise us, is life. But change,
as Wensberg writes, ``means death too, and in our own bodies we
take steps to arrest or reverse certain changes by medicine,
inoculation, surgery and other strong measures. We choose what we
want to preserve and what we want to slough off.''
</P>
<P>
   In the evolution of a language, change often means the waiver of
distinctions that have aided clarity and sharpened precision. Thus,
many assume ``disinterested'' to mean ``uninterested'' rather than
``without self-interest.'' The hound, Wensberg writes by way of
example, might not be in a mood to hunt. But to call it
``disinterested'' is to liken a dog's indifference ``to the work of
a scrupulous presiding judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Here as in myriad other instances (enormity/immensity;
acknowledge/admit; farther/further; anxious/eager; assure/ensure),
distinctions exist for good reason, not mere whim. ``Almost
always,'' Wensberg writes, ``the move toward a distinction, the
positive work of a language, is a gain. The negative change, away
from distinct ideas, is generally the result of heedlessness or
ignorance, and hence a loss.''
</P>
<P>
   The seduction of science
</P>
<P>
   It should be no surprise that many of the changes since the
first edition of ``Modern English Usage'' are pseudo-technical.
Nothing impresses us more than science, and no one is more
susceptible to its linguistic influence than the fawning
nonscientist. Physicists, when they speak of a ``critical mass,''
mean something quite exact. The rest of us mean something vague
and, if anything, contrary to the idea behind the term. But it
sounds impressive, even if we don't know what we're talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise journalese, a category that Wensberg _ a former editor
at The New York Times Book Review _ has revised extensively. The
tone of journalese, he writes, ``is the tone of contrived
excitement.'' When the subject we're writing about is of no
particular consequence, we call forth the adjectives and
superlatives. ``The return of a sense of proportion,'' Wensberg
writes, ``will perhaps be signaled when every good book, play, or
film need not be riveting, brilliant or scathing.''
</P>
<P>
   In language, purity is one thing and purism quite another. The
colloquial need not yield to the stiffly formal, but neither should
it embrace the slangy. Wensberg, like his predecessors, knows that
English accommodates old and new equally. What matters _ if we put
any stock in clear thinking _ is that sound and sense are in
balance.

 &HT;    A wild child who aims to please
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Finally. The Janet Jackson fans fell in love with in
1986 reappeared Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   We've been wondering where you were. For the past year all we've
been reading about and seeing on Oprah is this Janet that was
deeply depressed, piercing everything - and frankly - beginning to
distance herself in the same fashion big brother Mike has. Then you
put out this The Velvet Rope'' record - obviously a reflection of
your troubled times _ and sales dropped some eight million less
than the previous one.
</P>
<P>
   Guess we all were getting worried.
</P>
<P>
   Then look, up on the Lakewood Amphitheatre stage, it was the
Janet that could bring some 14,000 people to their feet with a
single stare after her second song If''. It was a confident,
certain Janet who roared through her dance-oriented hits Control,''
Pleasure Principle'' and What Have You Done For Me Lately'' with a
flurry that never revealed she was having back trouble up until her
red velvet curtain came up at 9:50 p.m. And yet it was also the
Janet some got to know as Penny'' on Good Times'', giggling when
her sweet, small voice was about to hit one of the bigger notes at
the end of her Oscar-nominated single Again.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has always liked to appear vulnerable. But the key word
in the previous sentence is appear. The moment she stepped in front
of her eight-member band (including Atlanta drummer John Roberts)
and alongside her eight dancers, the tabasco red-haired Jackson in
current publicity photos was once again the black-haired Janet in
black that announced her Control'' on her 1986 album of the same
name.
</P>
<P>
   An album later she was the conscientious Janet on Rhythm Nation:
1814'', the one who made sure to conclude the two-hour show with
the uplifting Together Again,'' derived from her need to address
friends who have died of AIDS. Next it was janet.'', cursing and
unabashedly delving into her sexuality. Clearly it was that Janet
who summoned a young man from the audience to do a strip tease to
her tune about bondage, Rope Burn.'' Even the 32-year-old Janet who
decided to let us behind the rather production-heavy Velvet Rope''
proved more interesting when tunes like You'' and the theatrical
What About'' were set against her Broadway-like staging and always
engaging choreography.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the incarnation, most importantly, last night she was
the Janet we could recognize and appreciate again.
</P>
<P>
   Surely a great model for opening act Usher Raymond, the
19-year-old Atlantan whose My Way'' has actually sold 2 million
more than Jackson's current album. On his third tour since the
release of that album Raymond's show hasn't varied much from his
last Atlanta appearance with Mary J. Blige. It's a fine melding of
his three big hits - the title track, Nice and Slow'' and You Make
Me Wanna'' _with work from his obvious influence
entertainment-wise, Bobby Brown. Five costume changes in 50 minutes
might make you wonder whether the considerable vocalist questioned
hs ability to hold the audience's attention. But really all the
sinewy Raymond had to do was rip off his shirt for the many,
audible women. Attention held.

 &HT;    This `Midnight's' a bad trip; just say no
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Know what's mortifying?'' asks the junkie protagonist of
``Permanent Midnight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Smack is like the leisure suit of the '90s.''
</P>
<P>
   Close but, Monica jokes aside, no cigar.
</P>
<P>
   What's mortifying is a movie like ``Permanent Midnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the true-life adventures of Jerry Stahl, a successful
Hollywood writer who chronicled his struggle to kick the heroin
habit in a recent book, the picture is the ultimate give-us-a-break
Hollywood ego trip, right down to the potential money to be made
from its I-have-sinned confessional tone.
</P>
<P>
   When we first meet Stahl, gamely played by Ben Stiller, he's
serving fast-food burgers as a condition of his rehab program. But
Jerry is sooooo charismatic in his little McBurger outfit that he's
immediately picked up by a gorgeous blonde (Maria Bello) who drives
through the takeout window and orders Jerry ... to go.
</P>
<P>
   The two repair to a nearby hotel where, when they're not having
passionate sex, Jerry tells her his story. It turns out that she's
a reformed junkie, too, and there's nothing she'd like better than
to hear every little detail of his personal saga. And if that makes
sense to you, maybe this is your kind of movie.
</P>
<P>
   See, Jerry moved to Hollywood to write great movies and ``to get
away from drugs.'' Instead, he quickly gets a gig on a sitcom about
an alien puppet (Stahl actually wrote for ``ALF'') and starts doing
heroin. When he's not shooting up, he's being told by everyone in
sight what a genius he is.
</P>
<P>
   A big-time agent (Janeane Garofalo) begs him to sign with her.
His airhead producer (Fred Willard) worships his every word. A
slightly over-the-hill star (Cheryl Ladd) must have him on her
series. Even his luscious green-card wife (Elizabeth Hurley)
forgets that theirs is supposed to be a marriage of convenience and
falls madly in love with him.
</P>
<P>
   Gee, if it weren't for this nasty little drug thing, he'd be
king of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry ultimately comes clean. The movie never does. It remains a
self-serving vanity production that only pretends to explore the
lower depths, Hollywood-style. Ultimately, it's a self-protective,
preening bore that uses its needle-ridden scenes as shock-tactic
distractions and its pulled-from-the pages-of-Premiere dialogue as
a way to flatter audiences into feeling like insiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Permanent Midnight''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Stiller. Directed by David Veloz. Rated R for sex
and explicit drug use. At metro theaters. 1 hour, 27 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Needs to go to movie rehab.

 &HT;    This `Odd Couple' of cops clicks
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It never hurts to loosen up a bit.
</P>
<P>
   That, unlikely as it seems, is the message behind ``Rush Hour,''
an enjoyable new whack-'em-up, crack-'em-up adventure movie about a
mismatched pair of cops.
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely because neither star _ kick-boxing,
karate-chopping Jackie Chan nor motor-mouthed stand-up comic Chris
Tucker _ could ever be accused of holding back. ``The fastest hands
in the East vs. the biggest mouth in the West'' goes the film's
promotional one-liner, and for once, it seems, there's truth in
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Unlikely, too, because one doesn't exactly go into a movie like
``Rush Hour'' expecting to learn anything _ other than the
importance of covering little pitchers' ears and expensive
breakables whenever Tucker and Chan are around.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's something instructive about ``Rush Hour,'' in
which the good guys win largely by becoming more, um, flexible in
their respective approaches to crime fighting. Each struggles to
pick up some of the other's tricks. What's funnier, watching Chan
trying to be hip or Tucker nearly throwing his out in a fight
scene? The result is an entertaining ride for anyone not expecting
any mental heavy lifting.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it's hard to take too seriously this saga of a tough yet
modest Hong Kong police detective inspector, Lee (Chan), fetched
from afar when the Chinese consul's 11-year-old daughter is
kidnapped in Los Angeles. The consul thinks Lee is just the man to
help the FBI bring his little girl back alive; the rock-jawed G-men
are just as convinced he's the last person they want around.
</P>
<P>
   Make that the second-to-last person. The FBI agents don't know
rogue L.A. police Detective James Carter (Tucker) at first, but
they quickly come to understand why his captain has been so quick
to lend him out and let him play keep-away-from-the-investigation
with Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Carter is the sort of cop whose smart mouth gets him into
trouble even when his own peculiar brand of crime solving doesn't:
``Every once in a while, we have to let the general public know we
can still blow (stuff) up,'' he gloats to his captain after his
successful undercover arrest of a bomb merchant destroys a city
block.
</P>
<P>
   Much like the fried chicken wings and boiled eel that each tries
to tempt the other to sample, Carter and Lee don't go together at
first. But eventually, you just know they'll join forces to try to
find the girl and prove those doubting FBI-ers wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does ``Rush Hour'' show off each man's particular area
of acting prowess _ Chan flips off a speeding double-decker bus as
effortlessly as Tucker drops punch lines about working for the
much-maligned LAPD _ it also knows when enough is enough.
</P>
<P>
   So loosen up, enjoy the ride and, whatever you do, don't take
off before the airplane in the final scene. Those may not truly be
the fastest hands in the East or the biggest mouth in the West on
the screen, but the outtakes definitely make for some of the best
closing credits around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rush Hour''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker. Directed by Brett Ratner.
Rated PG-13 for violence and language. 1 hour, 37 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: As fast and kicky as a Chan move _ and a lot less
painful.

 &HT;    Streep only true thing in tearjerker movie
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``One True Thing'' strikes too many false notes to be the
three-hankie weeper it wants to be. Based on Anna Quindlen's book,
it's notable for another pitch-perfect characterization by Meryl
Streep. Unfortunately, it's not Streep's movie.
</P>
<P>
   The drama centers on Renee Zellweger, playing career journalist
Ellen Gulden, whose drive has earned her the adjectives ``cold and
insensitive'' from colleagues. Her boss at New York magazine sums
it up: ``I know what you want: a new computer and Diane Sawyer's
job.''
</P>
<P>
   She's the opposite of her mother, Kate (Streep), a lifelong
homemaker whose sunny-side-up attitude Ellen sees as pre-feminist,
blinkered denial. If someone breaks a dish, Kate saves the
fragments for her mosaic table. She's a member of the Minnies, a
group of neighbor women who, in Ellen's disgusted estimation, run
around town doing ``all that do-good stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The two are brought into close quarters in Ellen's old
small-town home when Kate is diagnosed with cancer. Once there, the
movie begins its slightly synthetic campaign to make the young
woman appreciate her mother's life choices. Example: We have to
watch Ellen volunteer to cook for her mother, then burn the meal.
And the movie piles on secondhand Hallmark spectacles, such as a
colorful country fair and a Christmas jubilee that taps a choir
singing ``Silent Night'' for cheap emotional effect.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that ``One True Thing'' tries to take on too many
things, including the issue of euthanasia, Ellen's uneasy
relationship with her self-important professor dad (William Hurt),
and her boyfriend problems. (All the men in the movie are jerks, or
at best incidental, such as Tom Everett Scott as Ellen's brother.)
</P>
<P>
   When the movie keeps its focus on Kate and Ellen, it works.
That's mainly due to Streep, who layer by layer peels away Kate's
chipper Martha Stewart veneer to get to the woman's depth and
humanity. In the centerpiece confrontation between the two, Kate
tells her daughter, ``It's so much easier to be happy, my love ...
instead of always yearning for what you're missing.'' The line has
patness but also the undeniable profundity of ``there's no place
like home.'' (Not coincidentally, we first meet Kate while she's
wearing a Dorothy costume from ``The Wizard of Oz.'')
</P>
<P>
   Unintentionally, Streep's nuanced performance underscores the
film's general emotional shallowness. Karen Croner's screenplay
offers a mixture of the canned sass and softness you find in a
glossy women's magazine. Not that there's anything wrong with that,
but the movie needs to go deeper to earn our tears.
</P>
<P>
   Director Carl Franklin (``One False Move'' and ``Devil in a Blue
Dress'') delivers a good-looking mainstream movie without much
personality. Hurt, in an unsympathetic role, drifts through
aloofly. And while Zellweger is a good actress, she's overmatched
by Streep; she can't bring the kind of complexity that's needed to
flesh out her role's career-girl cliches.
</P>
<P>
   ``One True Thing''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Meryl Streep, Renee Zellweger and William Hurt.
Directed by Carl Franklin. Rated R for profanity. 2 hours, 7
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Doesn't ring as true as it should.

 &HT;    In full SWING
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 20: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The temptation is to dismiss the trend toward dressing like
characters from ``Guys and Dolls'' and dancing to the music known
as swing as a delusional phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   When Gen X'ers by the thousands suddenly start combing the
thrift stores and vintage shops for skinny ties, spectator shoes,
bouffant dresses and bobby socks, it says something about their
inability to deal with present-day realities ... a need to retreat
mentally to simpler times, right?
</P>
<P>
   Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   According to Leslie Hancock, she and the others who have begun
dressing like swingers do so out of a growing sense of contentment
and optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you feel sophisticated and sexy,'' Hancock, 24, said
while waiting with a capacity crowd dressed in '50s-style fashion
for the recent Big Bad Voodoo Daddy show in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dressing like this just makes you feel good about yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``For so long, the same people you see here tonight were
dressing to show the angst they felt. But, as you see, those days
are over.''
</P>
<P>
   Dirk Shumaker, the Big Bad Voodoo Daddy bassist, said he
relishes being a role model for the group's fans, even though it
requires ``a lot of footwork'' to keep his wardrobe of zoot suits
and fedoras freshly stocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like this look in the sense that it's making people aware of
a very classy era in American history,'' Shumaker said.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the multitudes who are learning to dress like
swingers, ``class'' is back in session.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Two who hold the past in awe sending an SOS
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you or any of your relatives took pictures at the ``Gone With
the Wind'' premiere in December 1939, Herb Bridges, the foremost
collector of GWTW memorabilia, would like to hear from you.
</P>
<P>
   Herb, who has been collecting all kinds of Margaret Mitchell and
``Gone With the Wind'' artifacts for years, is putting together a
book about the premiere, to be published by Mercer University Press
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am seeking photographs concerning the `GWTW' premiere and
have located many at the Atlanta History Center, the Georgia
Archives and Georgia State University, plus those in my own `GWTW'
collection,'' he wrote. ``But I would like to obtain candid
snapshots made by individuals during the many `GWTW' activities.
Such snapshots may be hidden away in old photograph albums and
scrapbooks. ... Possibly these families might share the photographs
for this book project.''
</P>
<P>
   So here is Herb's request and my hope that you may help him. He
is curator for the ``GWTW'' exhibit in the Newnan-Coweta Historical
Society's collection. The address is P.O. Box 192, Sharpsburg, GA
30277.
</P>
<P>
   People tell me there are untold riches in memorabilia among
``GWTW'' fans, and I think it would be nifty if a lot of heretofore
unseen snapshots should turn up. I am sorry I cannot help Mr.
Bridges, although I have admired his zeal in collecting for many
years. I never had a picture of Margaret Mitchell, but I did have a
couple of notes from her. Alas, I lost track of them years ago. I
have worked in four buildings since I came to the Atlanta
Constitution, and three or four offices each. In the transition, I
have mislaid or lost many things I value.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Mitchell, as you've probably read, had a pleasant habit of
dropping you a note if you wrote something she liked. She had given
up autographing books after the first million sold, but she did
something better. She scribbled a personal note, suitable for
pasting on the flyleaf.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't get one of those, but when I wrote about old-time
Atlantans who had become street people, it interested her. She
would drop by the office on one of her trips to town and talk about
the old families of some of my eccentric friends. She knew the
Confederate background of the ancestors of my friend Lucy Gartrell
and her sister, Ina Mae Smith, and she rejoiced that they were
still spirited, independent women. I had a couple of notes from her
on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   If I could find those notes, I would contribute them to Mr.
Bridges and the Newnan-Coweta group. I would also send along the
invitation to Peggy's funeral. Since seating space at Patterson's
was fairly limited _ at least for a funeral that would draw mammoth
crowds of celebrity seekers _ John Marsh, Peggy's husband, and
Stephens Mitchell, her brother, decreed that attendance at the
funeral would be by invitation only. As I recall, the invitation
was a small pink card. Anyhow, although Harold Martin and I covered
the funeral, we did not stow away our invitations for safe-keeping.
</P>
<P>
   So much for ``GWTW.'' There's another request here for reader
help on an entirely different matter. Gloria S. Brown has a
``cakewalk'' doll, handed down in the family and believed to be
more than 150 years old and would like to know if any of you have
ever heard of such a thing. If so, write her at P.O. Box 11331,
Atlanta, 30310. We aim to serve.

 &HT;    Disney's special touch is everywhere on the company's maiden
voyage into the cruise business
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 20: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD THE DISNEY MAGIC
</P>
<P>
   Studio Sea is rockin'. It's 10:45 p.m. in the family disco and
the same kids who were falling asleep in their spaghetti and
meatballs two hours earlier are bouncing to a fractious pop song:
``I get knocked down, but I get up again ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Then the mood changes. Slow dance time. As Celine Dion croons
``Every night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you. ...'' little
girls sweet-talk their daddies onto the dance floor. Cheek to belt
buckle, they close their eyes and fantasize they're dancing with
Leo DiCaprio. I nurse my nightcap, a frothy nonalcoholic drink
called the Gangster, described as ``Al Cappuccino in a vanilla ice
cream and chocolate chip thriller.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a moment to remember _ one of many as Disney Cruise
Lines' Magic put out to sea July 30 on its four-night maiden voyage
with a capacity 2,400 passengers aboard, marking the entertainment
giant's big splash into the cruise business. The Magic _ which
represents a reported $350 million investment _ will be joined by a
twin ship, Wonder, in March. In this venture, Disney goes
head-to-head with such established lines as Royal Caribbean,
Carnival and Premier Cruises, whose fleet includes the Big Red
Boat.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's floating kingdom is mostly magic, filled with surprises
big and small for the young _ and young at heart.
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Crawley of Tyler, Texas, treasures a moment when she and
husband Les returned to their stateroom to find her teddy bear
sitting on the turned-down bed sporting one of Les's ties. (Another
time, the bear is wearing sunglasses and lounging on a deck chair
on the veranda. A room hostess with a keen sense of playfulness is
the prime suspect.)
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the personal touch,'' says Stacy, 29. ``That is the
Disney magic.''
</P>
<P>
   There are not-so-subtle Disney touches as well _ such as a
restaurant that morphs from stark black and white to a riot of
color. That would be the whimsical Animator's Palate. Sketches from
Disney's animated features come alive in color on the walls, and
the giant paintbrushes that serve as columns in the room glow in
green, red and blues. Dessert is a grand finale featuring the
waiters (whose black and white vests reverse to a brightly colored
pattern) marching into the room with ``paint'' kits _ squeeze
bottles of flavored sauces to drizzle artistically on chocolate
mousse shaped like Mickey's head. Just plain goofy.
</P>
<P>
   A WHOLE NEW WORLD
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to Mickey and Co. to rewrite the rules when it comes to
cruising.
</P>
<P>
   There's no glib-talking, back-slapping cruise director working
the crowds to make sure Everybody's Having a Great Time. There's no
casino and no Vegas-style sequins-and-feathers floor shows. No
captain's dinner calling for black-tie and evening wear. No flaming
baked Alaska paraded through the dining room by smiling waiters. No
dapper gents hired to dance with unattached dames at sea. And,
sorry, gramps, no midnight buffet _ and not a single ice sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   What there is more than makes up for these traditional cruise
perks.
</P>
<P>
   The terrific children's program fills 15,000 square feet _
almost an entire deck. Children 3-8 are assigned to Oceaneer's Club
and those 9-12 are in Oceaneer's Lab. Both programs blend science
with fun and games. My 10-year-old daughter, Caroline, made a batch
of green slime called Flubber and played computer games the first
night. The programs are open from 9 a.m. until 1 a.m., and the
counselors will take the kids to lunch and dinner, so parents can
drop off the little darlings in the morning, get a pager and say,
``See ya later.'' Believe me, the kids don't mind being left. In
fact, you may have to drag 'em out.
</P>
<P>
   For older kids, a hip coffeehouse called Common Grounds is a
hangout off-limits to anyone younger than 13 or older than 17. And
there's a computerized arcade called Quarter Masters, where you
play till your prepaid card runs out. Then, there's Beat Street, a
mini-Pleasure Island filled with adults-only joints like Rockin'
Bar D, Sessions jazz/piano bar and Offbeat (with improv comedy and
karaoke). Sports fans (like my husband) have the ESPN Skybox
perched in the forward funnel for drinks, stadium-style snacks and
the Big Game (John caught the Atlanta Braves one afternoon). Bars
are scattered about the ship _ Outlook, Signal's and Promenade
Lounge (where I saw a guy playing piano with white gloves like
Mickey's one evening).
</P>
<P>
   There are excellent Broadway-style shows nightly, including
``Disney Dreams,'' a young girl's adventure with Peter Pan and
favorite Disney characters; ``Hercules the Muse-ical,'' a cheeky
sendup of the Disney animated feature with ad-libs relating to
shipboard foibles; ``Island Dreams,'' a prelude to the day at
Castaway Cay aimed at children; and, my favorite, ``Voyage of the
Ghost Ship,'' a swashbuckling shipboard melodrama with acrobatic
dancing and romantic ballads.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the cruise offerings are weighted toward families,
adults sans kids have special activities exclusively for them. They
can take part in bingo games, wine tastings, movies and
line-dancing lessons, pamper themselves with spa services (if
they're lucky enough to get an appointment), dine at the upscale
Palo by reservation (but available seatings are filled as fast as
spa appointments) and swim in the adults-only pool (a
cannonball-free zone).
</P>
<P>
   There's so much to do that anyone would be hard-pressed to fit
in even a sampling of all the activities during a four-night
cruise. Awaiting guests in their spacious staterooms (nearly half
of which have balconies) are Personal Navigators that include
dining room assignments and evening show times as well as a
detailed day-by-day list of what's happening when. I was back home
before I realized ``Hope Floats,'' a movie I'd been wanting to see,
was screened several times in the Buena Vista Theater. (I admit I
did see that Goofy was leading family fitness exercises at 8 a.m.
on the Wide World of Sports Deck; that, I chose to ignore.)
</P>
<P>
   TROUBLE IN WONDERLAND
</P>
<P>
   So what's not to like? Plenty, according to some mutiny-minded
Mickey maniacs who made reservations two years in advance to be a
part of Disney history and were sorely disappointed in everything
from service and food to the number of character sightings.
Although the inaugural sailing was fraught with start-up snafus, my
family shared few of the gripes registered by some vacationers.
</P>
<P>
   But even the detractors had to admit there's potential for tons
of fun _ 83,000 to be exact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in time it will be great,'' says Diana Walker of
Zionsville, Ind., who was not happy that she had to spend the first
three hours on board standing in line to sort out problems with her
family's dining assignments. ``The ship is beautiful. Our stateroom
is great. The shows have been great. But the service isn't ready
and, on a Disney voyage, I don't want to hunt Mickey down.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Crawleys, who generally gave high marks to the Magic,
wished there were more organized activities for adults, but they
enjoyed a wine tasting and even took part in some family
activities, including the Nautical Mystery Tour.
</P>
<P>
   While I'm at it, I had really been looking forward to treating
myself to a pedicure or perhaps a massage in the Vista Spa &AMP; Salon.
But I was standing in line (a time-honored Disney tradition if
there ever was one) to sign up for shore excursions when I heard
the PA announcement that all spa services were booked through the
cruise. And the ship hadn't even left port! (I did manage to get a
mini-facial when some appointments opened up.)
</P>
<P>
   Later that evening on Deck 10, the top deck, as the ship was
slowly pulling out of Port Canaveral, Fla., to much fanfare both
onboard and on shore, I met Kate Bryan of Worthington, Ohio, who
had been looking forward to this moment for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are going just fine,'' she says. ``If you're going to
be the first ones, you can't expect perfection.'' Her traveling
companion, John Bartenstein, also of Worthington and a collector of
Disneyana for more than 25 years, was on hand for the opening of
Toyko Disneyland in 1983 and EuroDisney (now Paris Disneyland) in
1992. He wasn't about to miss the Disney Magic maiden voyage, even
though it was twice postponed. ``I said, `It doesn't matter when it
sails, I want to be on it,''' says Bartenstein.
</P>
<P>
   So here we all were, full of anticipation, ready to embark on
our adventure in the blue Caribbean aboard the classy blue-black
and white 964-foot ocean liner with gold trim and twin red
smokestacks with white silhouettes of Mickey's head. Well-wishers
lining the harbor waved and we waved back, cheering and downing
champagne served in plastic cups. The ship's horn blasted out the
notes to ``When You Wish Upon a Star.'' As Goofy would say, ``Aw,
gorsh.''
</P>
<P>
   HISTORY IN THE MAKING
</P>
<P>
   Disney has come a long way since 1928 when Mickey Mouse took the
helm of a ship in ``Steamboat Willie,'' the first cartoon with
sound. Seventy years later, Mickey's back at the helm, and we are
happy to be a part of another magical Disney first.
</P>
<P>
   Call me an overgrown kid, but I loved sleeping under a poster
with the music and opening line to ``A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart
Makes.'' I loved making a game out of finding ``hidden Mickeys''
(look closely at the grillwork flanking the elevators in the
colorful three-story atrium). Also special: Ordering escargot at
the elegant French restaurant named Lumiere's after the debonair
candlestick in ``Beauty and the Beast'' and the ``Oh, gross, mom''
look on my daughter's face as I chewed on the garlicky morsels;
queuing up for ice cream at Scoops every afternoon at 3:30; sitting
on my veranda at night watching the ship slide through the inky sea
as a waxing moon illuminated the night.
</P>
<P>
   Although there were complaints about the quality _ and quantity
_ of the food (``I've actually been hungry on this cruise,''
groused Mike Tonsmeyer of Cincinnati), we found it generally to be
satisfactory. Granted, some dishes worked better than others (my
husband always liked what I picked best), portions weren't huge
and, except for a creme brulee at Lumiere's, desserts were
forgettable.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner is a game of musical chairs as guests rotate among
elegant Lumiere's, artsy Animator's Palate and calypso-happy Parrot
Cay _ and your servers go with you from place to place. We liked
having the jovial Anja from Germany and wry Alexander from Brazil
around every night. And the kids seem quite pleased with the
children's menus, which are the same in each restaurant. (Guests
also are assigned to restaurants for breakfast and lunch, but you
can opt for Topsider's buffet or snack shacks such as Pinocchio's
for pizza or Pluto's for burgers and hot dogs. None of these
fast-food spots rises above typical theme park fare.)
</P>
<P>
   WHEN IN NASSAU . . .
</P>
<P>
   The day in Nassau offered a chance to explore the colonial
capital city of the Bahamas with its famous Straw Market, duty-free
shops and restaurants. Several shore excursions were offered
through Guest Services, including a visit to the Crystal Palace
casino. We decided to go for the Crystal Cay Marine Park trip ($23
adult, $16.50 children) and snorkeling on the Caribbean Queen ($35
adult, $25 children).
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, we walked into town and were immediately
approached by women eager to braid our hair. We bit, and at $2 per
braid, Caroline was soon posing for photos under the palms with 16
plaits anchored with colorful beads. (And I'm looking a tad foolish
with my 10.) Feeling adventurous, we paid an islander _ a friend of
the hair-braider _ $25 to take us on a whirlwind tour of the island
in his rattletrap jalopy before we had to return for dinner. (And
we thought we had to go to Disney World for Mr. Toad's Wild Ride!)
</P>
<P>
   Safely back at the ship, a Junkanoo party is brewing, mon. We're
feeling giddy. Just the right mood for an island-style dinner with
silly drinks like Bahama Mamas in 2-foot-tall souvenir glasses.
</P>
<P>
   CASTING CARES AWAY
</P>
<P>
   If our shipmates were not sufficiently mellow by the last day, a
few hours on Castaway Cay, Disney's private island in the Abacos,
would surely do the trick. The boat docked before sunrise and
guests were allowed to debark by 8:30 a.m. Trams with recorded
fanciful histories of the island (made up out of whole cloth by
Disney Imagineers) take guests from the ship to the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Until 3:30 p.m., we could bake on the beach, rent snorkeling
gear to explore the developing manmade reef (complete with a
``shipwreck'' as only Disney could do it), bicycle along tropical
trails and chow down at Cookie's Bar-B-Q (where the picnic spread
includes hamburgers, hot dogs, ribs, baked beans, corn on the cob,
salads, cake, fruit and punch). A Caribbean band plays Jimmy
Buffett and Bob Marley.
</P>
<P>
   Kids can scale a three-story water-play fort and participate in
a ``dig'' at Monstro Point, where the skeletal remains of a 35-foot
``whale'' lies on the sand. Teens and adults also have their own
designated areas away from the family crowds. In keeping with the
island's laid-back theme, the Postmistress is May B. Tamara. And
the island speciality drink, the Conched Out, is aptly named.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving these 1,000 sandy acres of paradise, we find Goofy and
Pluto cavorting outside the ship, mugging with kids.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight we have reservations for dinner at Palo, the trendy
adults-only restaurant that offers a 270-degree ocean view and
California-contemporary cuisine (think Napa Valley meets Tuscany).
Afterward, we hit the clubs one more time while Caroline parties at
Oceaneer's Lab.
</P>
<P>
   When we awake Monday morning, we were already back at Port
Canaveral. After breakfast, I run into Les and Stacy Crawley,
sunburned from a day on Castaway Cay but grinning like a couple of
kids at a carnival. Wearing new Disney Cruise Line shirts, they are
loaded down with commemorative posters and other collectibles from
the maiden voyage to take back to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Their verdict: ``It was special,'' Les says. ``I'd come back.
Definitely.''
</P>
<P>
   Yep, me, too.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   The fares: Airfare is included in the package rate for a
seven-night vacation, which includes three or four nights at Disney
World, bus transfers to Port Canaveral with return to the airport
in Orlando and a three- or four-night cruise. Brochure rates for
seven nights start at about $1,300 per person based on double
occupany; children 3-17 sharing a cabin are $999 each. Cruise-only
rates start at $799 adults for a three-night cruise. Also, packages
without air are available. The price covers all meals and snacks,
including room service, but alcoholic beverages and soft drinks are
extra. You'll also be encouraged to tip your cabin host or hostess
and dining room staff. Call 407-566-7000.

 &HT;    Singer left behind a smoldering family feud
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   He had fame, money and a mess of kinfolks. So it's no surprise
that Hank Williams left behind one blowout of a family feud after
his death.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the cast of characters:
</P>
<P>
   Hank Williams died without a will, so his estate _ including
lucrative publishing rights _ reportedly went to two people: his
then-3-year-old son, Hank Williams Jr., and Williams' wife at the
time of his death, Billie Jean Jones. Jones, a 17-year-old divorcee
who had a taste for country music stars, had been married to
Williams only three months when he died. They were wed in what many
consider a garish public ceremony at the Municipal Auditorium in
Shreveport, La., where fans plopped down $2 to see them take vows.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his possessions _ report cards, family photos, etc. _
were left with his mother, Lillie Skipper Williams at her
boardinghouse in Montgomery. When she died in 1955, they were
passed to Williams' older sister, Irene Williams. In 1995, country
star Marty Stuart stumbled into Irene, who was living broke and
alone in a tiny duplex in Dallas. She invited him ``out to the
house,'' where she proceeded to open boxes of Williams'
possessions. Stuart purchased the items, which are now on display
at Nashville's Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most significant people in Williams' life _ and after
his death _ was his first wife, Audrey Sheppard Williams, mother of
Hank Jr. Hank and Audrey married in December 1944 and had a
notoriously stormy relationship, even divorcing briefly in 1948.
According to biographer Colin Escott, when Williams was asked to
join the Grand Ole Opry later that year, ambitious Audrey had the
divorce annulled. In May 1952 she threw in the towel for good,
divorcing Williams just seven months before his death and four
months before he married Billie Jean.
</P>
<P>
   But Audrey wasn't out of the game entirely. In her divorce
settlement, she got rights to half of Williams' publishing catalog.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1954, Audrey bought Billie Jean's rights and interests in
Williams for $25,000. When Audrey died in 1975, the publishing
interests are believed to have gone to Hank Jr., the sole heir.
</P>
<P>
   But then came Jett.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was pretty busy that last year of his life. Not only
did he split from Audrey and marry Billie Jean, he had a fling in
the spring of 1952 with a Nashville secretary named Bobbie Jett.
She became pregnant and was stashed away at Williams' mother's home
to await the birth. He signed papers admitting paternity and made
arrangements for his mother to raise the child and pay Bobbie's
fare to California after the baby's birth. When Williams pulled out
of Montgomery for his final ride on New Year's Eve, witnesses say a
very pregnant Bobbie saw him off. She gave birth to a baby girl on
Jan. 6, 1953, five days after Williams' death.
</P>
<P>
   While Bobbie stepped out of the picture, never to be seen again
(she died in 1974), the little girl called Cathy Yvonne (after the
girl in ``Jambalaya'') lived with Williams' mother Lillie in
Montgomery for two years. When Lillie died in 1956, the story goes
that Williams' sister Irene felt it would be best for her to be
adopted so that no one knew where she came from. So Cathy was
raised by a couple in Mobile and was never aware of her famous
family tree.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Cathy Yvonne received a mysterious check from the
Williams' estate for $3,000. Turns out that Williams' relatives
hadn't covered the trail completely: Papers instructed that his
illegitimate daughter receive money upon her 21st birthday. After
years of tracing her past and many ugly court fights with her
half-brother Hank Jr., Cathy Yvonne, in 1993, was finally awarded a
piece of the Williams' publishing and royalty empire. She changed
her name to Jett Williams and began pursuing a singing career.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a new generation. Hank Williams III, the son of Hank
Jr., has decided to pursue a country music career. But he's mad,
too. Raised by his mother (who was divorced from Hank Jr. when Hank
III was 2), he reportedly doesn't speak to his father. At a recent
outdoor concert, he was billed on the same stage as his aunt Jett,
whom he had never met. But rather than mend fences, he laid down
the challenge that he was going to ``blow her off the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be Billie Jean who gets the last laugh. Connived by
Audrey out of any claim to the Williams' estate, she got wind that
the publishing rights to Williams' songs were coming up for renewal
in the early 1970s. She sued for a share and won. So now, what's
left of Williams, is legally shared by three people who share
little history and no love _ Hank Jr., Jett and Billie Jean.

 &HT;    Maestro is creating his own buzz in nation's capital
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON obert Shaw's place in the world of choral music is as
lofty as the Lincoln Memorial _ and, at 82, his face seems just as
timeless and wind-swept. His marble-veined hair brings to mind the
poetic comportment of Carl Sandburg, his self-deprecating humor the
aura of Will Rogers. Over the last few days, as the dignity of the
republic vanished into cyberspace, the image of this grand old man
conducting the National Symphony Orchestra's Beethoven Festival has
been a balm for the soul of this weary capital.
</P>
<P>
   A preacher's son who began his career with no formal training,
worked with mercurial conductor Arturo Toscanini while still in his
20s, conducted the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra from 1967 to 1988 and
won 15 Grammys, Shaw remains a beloved figure far beyond his
Georgia home. Not only are his Kennedy Center performances selling
out, but during the past two weeks of rehearsals, he's been mobbed
like a rock star by choristers trying to snap his picture and get
his autograph.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have that many real musical legends left,'' says
Washington Post classical music critic Tim Page. ``When you think
about it, (Leonard) Bernstein's gone, Aaron Copland's gone. There
aren't that many people with that kind of history around.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's schedule is full through 2002, and he averages working
about two weeks a month. On Oct. 29, 30 and 31, he'll conduct the
Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Chorus in Dvorak's ``Stabat Mater,''
which is to be recorded on the Telarc label. In February, he'll
record the first English translation of Brahms' Requiem, with the
Mormon Tabernacle Choir. And for his Carnegie Hall workshops in New
York each January, he is planning an ambitious series of
commissions by composers such as Stephen Paulus, Michael Corigliano
and Dominic Argento.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would take us to 2008,'' he chuckles during an interview
at the Watergate Hotel. It is the end of a triumphant week in which
he has led some 270 musicians in a heart-rending version of
Beethoven's monolithic ``Missa Solemnis.'' Before this day is over,
he will begin rehearsing a new 175-voice choir for performances of
Beethoven's Choral Fantasy and Symphony No. 9, which close the
festival this weekend. Though a celebratory dinner kept him out
until 2 a.m. the night before, he is buoyant, happy and in the mood
for conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a navy button-down and a pair of cream-colored slacks,
he plops down onto a loveseat and recalls a life that spans the
globe, the 20th century and most of its major personalities. Except
for Kennedy _ who was assassinated before one of Shaw's State
Department tours would have earned him a White House reception _
he's known every president since Franklin D. Roosevelt. He
conducted for Margaret Truman's only record (``Her mysteries aren't
real great, but they are almost worth reading,'' he says of the
author of ``Murder at the Kennedy Center'' and ``Murder at the
Watergate''). He brought the first integrated choir to Constitution
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   As a kid, he sold Ladies' Home Journal and the Saturday Evening
Post for a penny. After high school, he spent nights wrapping bread
for $6.12 a week. Playing football at Pomona College in California,
he got his nose smashed by baseball's Jackie Robinson, who was then
playing football for UCLA. And during the Carter presidency, he
slept in Lincoln's bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were expecting our son Thomas, who is now a senior at Yale,
and I sat down wrote him a letter to be opened on his 21st
birthday, never thinking I'd live to see it,'' says Shaw,
describing the hand-written copy of the Gettysburg Address that
inspired him. ``That's proved to be true, and also I've had a
chance now to read that letter, and it's not nearly as beautiful as
I thought it was.'' At this point, he has broken into such laughter
that he can barely finish the thought. ``I was so moved by where I
was that I thought I was writing deathless prose, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He speaks affectionately of his late wife, Caroline, who died of
cancer in 1995. Alluding to his own mortality, he tells about an
incident at the concert the night before. A musician was
celebrating his 32nd birthday, and another one pipes up and says:
``You're just 50 years younger than Robert Shaw.'' It's an age
difference that time cannot change, Shaw says, and ``I hope it will
be 50 years for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   When Shaw speaks, it's like watching an old steam locomotive
start to crank up. His voice sputters, and slowly the machinery of
his mind begins to crawl, inching forward, releasing steam,
lurching, perhaps accidentally backing up a bit. Sometimes, he
comes to an abrupt halt before a sentence is finished, then spouts
a one-liner for comic effect. Losing himself in endless
digressions, he is nothing if not opinionated. He voices a disdain
for television, the ``mongrelization'' of the fine arts and the
decline of the great patrons. After every rage or mind-twisting
comment, he snorts: ``It's scary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no way of knowing what kind of people formed Bach's
congregation,'' he says, ``but it had to be a pretty healthy cross
mix of society, from the poor to the rich _ and the fact that those
people found both aesthetic beauty and food for their souls
represents a very high level of human intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   He puffs: ``Even gospel music has become commercialized to its
trashiest, its lowest common denominator. It isn't a really
first-class society. It isn't what I think the founding fathers
wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Gesturing to a television, he says: ``The kind of swill that
comes out of this tube over here _ from this morning on, from
California to Florida _ is just hash, if not having already passed
through somebody's digestive tract.''
</P>
<P>
   Quoting a speech he once heard when he was on the National
Council for the Arts, he says: ``Do you realize that when the great
cities of the world were built, 90 percent of the economically and
intellectually gifted gave 90 percent of their time to community
service? It's scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking toward Atlanta, he says he would like to be involved in
the creation of new work _ either with the ASO or some other
organization. ``We used to do more commissioning than I have any
responsibility for now,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   As for collaborating with another group to stage a new score by
a top composer, he says: ``That sort of a piece would be
extraordinary, and important, and in a certain sense what the arts
alliance started out to be. ... Given just a little bit of economic
support, you might be able to pull it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he thinks of Symphony Hall, he says, ``It's not in
the top 10 or 15 percent, but it's quite decent.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he adds: ``I was keenly disappointed, as a lot of others
were, when they got together some $21 to $23 million dollars to
recondition their lobby. That lobby was a beautiful space. ... It
was so vastly superior to our concert hall that I wished we could
give our concerts out there.''
</P>
<P>
   THE COMPOSITION OF ROBERT SHAW
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's antidote for the vagaries of the modern age has always
been the chorus. It is an emblem of the church, the community and
the equality of man.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chorus is egalitarian, the same way the Constitution is.
All men and women are created equal. Not absolutely equal in gifts
of talent or in gifts of mental acuity or agility but equal in
terms of enrichment of the human mind, and the realization that
together you can make something more beautiful than any one of you
could do standing up by yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Around dusk on this recent Sunday, he is driven to St. Alban's
Episcopal Church to begin rehearsing with the Choral Arts Society
of Washington for the festival finale this weekend. His assistant,
Nola Frink, accompanies him everywhere, handling the details so he
can focus on the music. ``I get the water ready so he can walk on
it,'' she jokes, unpacking the suitcase that contains his music,
baton and metronome.
</P>
<P>
   Choir director Norman Scribner warms up the ensemble with a
bunch of rapid-fire exercises, exhorting the group to sing from the
gut. The choir seems to be singing as loud as it can.
</P>
<P>
   Then Shaw gets up. He tells them to do the opposite. ``Shhhhh!
Shhhhh! Rest the voice!'' Then, it's his own chorus of one-liners:
</P>
<P>
   ``The right note at the wrong time is the wrong note!''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to hit the vowels a little sooner and the saliva a
little quicker!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Beethoven was a pianist, and not only that, he was a deaf
pianist!''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're singing the word zuchini!''
</P>
<P>
   During the break, chorister Marie Hyder appears with a record
that she made with Shaw at the Lincoln Center International Choral
Festival in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's nothing short of a national treasure,'' says the
47-year-old IBM employee. ``I guarantee if he looks at something
he's done 100 times, he'll find something new that he hadn't
thought of before. That kind of creative genuis always does. That's
what makes working for him such a treat. It's never the same
performance twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Page: ``He's the single most significant figure in the
history of American choral conducting. The technique he devised and
his passionate evangelism really put the discipline on the map.''
</P>
<P>
   At the rehearsal, Shaw carries on: ``You are riding on a bus
going to a voice lesson, and you don't want the person next to you
to know you are singing. Sing that loud!''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thinks he's revered more around the world than he is
home, Shaw says yes. But he doesn't hold it against anybody. ``If
you live in the southeastern United States and you grew up there a
generation ago, you were limited,'' he explains. ``You didn't hear
a symphony orchestra until you had graduated from college. ... The
great art of the South was literary.''
</P>
<P>
   So who are his favorite Southern authors?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know the Southern writers. They weren't around when I
was going to college.''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Tailwind veterans sue CNN
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eleven Vietnam veterans connected to Operation Tailwind filed
suit Thursday in federal court in California against CNN and Time
magazine, seeking unspecified damages for their retracted stories
on Tailwind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report and companion article in Time ... were the
quintessence of journalism at its worst,'' the suit charged.
</P>
<P>
   It is the third lawsuit filed against CNN since its Operation
Tailwind report aired June 7, and the first by a group of veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm actually fairly oblivious to that,'' CNN/US President
Richard Kaplan said Thursday about the latest lawsuit. ``I'm sure
our lawyers are taking care of it. We've done everything we can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN originally charged in the first edition of its newsmagazine
``NewsStand'' that U.S. military forces used sarin nerve gas to
kill U.S. defectors in Laos in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   After protests from veterans and an in-house investigation, CNN
retracted the story, apologized to veterans and fired producers
April Oliver and Jack Smith, although CNN has never said the story
was wrong. Oliver also wrote a story for Time magazine, which was
retracted, as part of Time Warner's attempt to generate synergy
between CNN and its magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs include the two pilots who dropped the gas, which
they maintain was tear gas rather than nerve gas; different pilots
who took the Tailwind participants to and from the Laos site; and
soldiers who were pictured or interviewed in the CNN story. They
are suing for libel, slander, invasion of privacy and intentional
infliction of emotional distress.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver, Smith and correspondent Peter Arnett are named in the
suit but are not listed as defendants; Oliver and Smith continue to
maintain the report was accurate.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed Thursday in California's Northern District by
attorneys Joseph Cotchett, Bruce L. Simon and Gwendolyn R. Giblin.
</P>
<P>
   Former Green Beret Sgt. Keith Plancich of Key West, Fla., whose
photos appeared in the report, filed suit in August for $100
million, and Maj. Gen. John Singlaub, who was quoted in the report,
filed suit Monday in Washington for $1 million.

 &HT;    CNN giving the youth of America a chance to report
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CNN will launch a new program called its Student Bureau,
training high school and college students to report, and possibly
even air reports on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   The new idea, launched with Turner Learning, CNN parent company
Time Warner and several cable companies, will use CNN employees as
mentors, and provide video equipment to some schools and students.
Initially, the students' reports will air on ``CNN Newsroom,'' the
commercial-free 30-minute report that is provided free to schools.
They may also air on local cable operators' educational access
channels. Eventually, some reports might end up on CNN after they
are fact-checked, CNN Newsgroup chairman Tom Johnson said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, there's a lot of enligtened self-interest in
this,'' Johnson said. ``Hopefully, these high school and college
students will be helping us to develop more programming that will
be useful to them in the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner officials declined to put a price tag on the program. It
will start with 30 pilot schools, and expand up to about 200
schools by January.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of Education Richard Riley, at a press conference
at Time Warner headquarters in New York that was linked to the CNN
Center in Atlanta, called the Student Bureau program ``a clear
example of how a conscientous business can recongize education''
and ``enable students to get real-life learning experience.''
</P>

   SEEN AND HEARD
</P>
<P>
   Times on T.V.
</P>
<P>
   t's a photo you don't see every day. There's Jerry Seinfeld _
tucked almost unneatly into bed and clad in an uncharacteristic
undershirt, cigarette dangling from his raised right hand. He's
smirking. And his bedmate is a TV with one rabbit ear bent, a
separate ciggie dangling from the tube's remote control.
</P>
<P>
   The photo is the cover of this Sunday's New York Times magazine,
which is devoted to television (Monday is the official start of the
1998-99 TV season). The headline: ``Now What?'' The articles
include Frank Rich's take on ``What the tube is for'' (it is,
perhaps, he writes, ``our one steady, loyal, reliable companion'')
and Bill Carter's reporting on how when NBC shelled out $13 million
per episode for ``ER,'' the network ``almost bought the farm.''
</P>
<P>
   Interspersed are some heady insights on TV from heady
individuals who name their favorite shows. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   -- Robert Pinsky, U.S. poet laureate, on ``The Simpsons'':
``Repeatedly, the show mocks and embraces its own genre. It even
mocks disruption itself.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Richard Ford, novelist, on ``Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'':
``Who doesn't long for a daily sampling of idyllic life, a little
good will, a little neighborhood of make-believe. Hey! Adult life?
I get plenty, thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   -- David Sedaris, author of ``Naked,'' on ``Cops'': ``It feels
wrong to watch 'Cops,' and that, in part, is why I love it so. It's
easy to look down on the car thieves and petty arsonists, but just
when I begin to feel superior, I think back on the fellow arrested
for breaking and entering. With his thinning hair and wandering
eye, he was my twin in both his appearance and his passion for
cheap canned beer.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Stanley Crouch, New York writer, on HBO's ``Oz'': ``To my
delight, it had a fully integrated cast, with a range of characters
who 'looked like America' and were conceived with impressively
realistic ethnic nuances, from the administrators all the way down
to the very lowest criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Ellen Gilchrist, author of ``Flights of Angels,'' on ``ER'':
``After I have kept myself awake, let us say, on a freezing cold
winter night in my glass-and-stone house. After I have wrapped
myself in blankets and am wearing my microfiber running suit for
pajamas. Half the time it's an episode I've already seen five
times. I don't care. I love 'ER.'''
</P>
<P>
   -- Daniel Menaker, author of ``The Treatment,'' on The Weather
Channel: ``The descriptions of Current Conditions always sound to
me like a poetry of American names. My Top 10 at the moment: Tulare
County, San Ysidro, Rapid City, Nogales, Onondaga, Lake
Pontchartrain, Mechanicsville, Flint, Helena and East Orange.''

<P>
   _Bob Longino, c. 1998 Cox News Service

<P>
   Simpsons on Sunday not spectacular
</P>
<P>
   Even great shows have their nights off, and the season premiere
of ``The Simpsons'' (8 p.m. Sunday on Fox (6339)) is definitely an
off episode.

   Once again, for the umpteenth time, Homer has one of his
mid-life, I'm-a-failure crises. This time out, he becomes obsessed
with Thomas Edison, determined to outdo him as an inventor. Along
the way he invents some cool stuff, such as hamburger earmuffs and
the makeup gun (``Try to keep your nostrils closed,'' he warns
Marge as he aims the blunderbuss at her face), but the show doesn't
have the zing that most ``Simpsons'' do.
</P>
<P>
   Look for a Heckle and Jeckle cameo, then look forward to seeing
if they've come up with anything funnier following ``The Simpsons''
on ``That '70s Show.''

LEGAL EXPERTS ARGUE AGAINST RELEASING GRAND JURY MATERIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the House Judiciary Committee makes plans to
release President Clinton's videotaped grand jury testimony, some
legal experts complained Thursday that the traditional rules
governing grand jury secrecy are being trampled by partisan
politics.
</P>
<P>
   John Q. Barrett, a former associate independent counsel during
the Iran-Contra investigation, said the House should keep the grand
jury material secret until the any impeachment hearings begin.
</P>
<P>
   In such a case, the Judiciary Committee could release those
parts of the grand jury material that were relevant to the
proceedings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would help to keep the Congress from looking so partisan
and to protect innocent people,'' said Barrett, currently an
associate law professor at St. John's University.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that the House Judiciary Committee investigating
President Richard M. Nixon in 1974 held closed-door hearings and
that the voluminous findings of Watergate special prosecutor Leon
Jaworski have yet to be unsealed. The committee deliberated and
voted in public after the closed hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Under normal procedures required by federal court rules designed
to rigorously protect grand jury information from public
disclosure, the Clinton videotape and other evidence collected by
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and the grand jury over seven
months would be kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   However, in July, Starr obtained a court order from the D.C.
Circuit Court of Appeals allowing him to turn over his grand jury
evidence to Congress. Since grand jury secrecy rules don't not
apply to Congress, the decision of whether to release any or all of
the documents was left to the members of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, they voted 363-63 in favor of releasing the Starr
report. That vote also gave the House Judiciary Committee until
Sept. 28 to decide how much of the supplemental material _ which
includes Clinton's 4-hour, 12-minute videotaped grand jury
testimony _ to make public.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders have argued that both House members and the public
have the right to examine all of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a democracy, and this kind of proceeding must be
carried out in public,'' Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., said.
``Let the facts speak for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say the information released should give a fair and
balanced picture of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not release evidence that is incriminating to the
president and hold back evidence that is exculpatory,'' said Rep.
Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., a member of the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Julie O'Sullivan, a former federal prosecutor, said that by
releasing only portions of the grand jury evidence, the House was
attempting to paint a one-sided picture of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most outrageous thing I've ever seen out of
Congress,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the House Judiciary Committee should only release the
grand jury material in a proceeding that would give lawyers for
Clinton a chance to present their side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no fan of what the president did, but this goes beyond any
one person,'' O'Sullivan said. ``Congress is setting a precedent on
impeaching the president that is incredibly unfair and against the
very basics of our legal system.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (STORY COULD END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,
prosecutors, grand jurors and investigative staff are prohibited
from releasing grand jury material _ although witnesses and their
attorneys may freely reveal the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   David Cole, a law professor at Georgetown University, said the
rule was designed to stop ``out-of-control'' prosecutors who might
try to use grand juries to dig up information _ often times
unsubstantiated _ on people and then release it to the public. He
added that the rule also is designed to encourage witnesses to
testify truthfully, safe in the knowledge that what they say won't
be made public, unless they are later called as witnesses at a
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a quid pro quo,'' Cole said. ``The law forces citizens to
testify before a grand jury on the condition that our testimony
never sees the light of day if the case doesn't go to trial.''

ART NOTES: HERMITAGE, SOTHEBY'S, ANDRE EMMERICH, GUGGENHEIM

   Some Help For Hermitage
</P>
<P>
   The State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia, is so
beloved in the United States that a group called the American
Friends of the Hermitage is presenting the museum's director, Dr.
Mikhail Piotrovsky, with a $100,000 gift when he comes to New York
next week for the opening of ``Master Drawings from the Hermitage
and Pushkin Museums,'' at the Morgan Library.
</P>
<P>
   The gift will go toward the formation of a new decorative arts
department at the Hermitage, the first new department to be
established there since 1852. In it the Hermitage plans to display
its extraordinary collection of furniture, porcelains, costumes and
other decorative artifacts, which have been languishing in storage
for lack of exhibition space.
</P>
<P>
   But just how far can $100,000 go?
</P>
<P>
   ``We need millions,'' said Piotrovsky in a telephone interview.
``This is part of a larger project which we are calling `The Great
Hermitage.'''
</P>
<P>
   If the project proceeds as planned, the museum will expand
significantly, moving its precious collection of Impressionist and
post-Impressionist paintings, along with its sculpture, costumes,
arms and armor, jewelry and decorative arts collections, into what
is called the General Staff Building, a sprawling neo-classical
structure directly opposite the Winter Palace in Palace Square,
where the Hermitage is located. Piotrovsky said the project should
cost more than $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government owns the building and has agreed to give
it to the museum. And so the Hermitage is accepting proposals from
developers, becoming involved in feasibility studies and looking
for private support. A Russian bank that has survived the recent
financial crisis has promised to help, Piotrovsky said. He added
that he is planning to hold an architectural competition for the
renovation of the building.
</P>
<P>
   The director also envisions transforming the entire square,
including the General Staff Building, into an arts complex with
interactive displays, theater, cafes and shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to make this the center of cultural life here,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Piotrovsky admits that the museum's original building is
antiquated and not up to the highest standards in areas like
climate control. But he is determined to think beyond the immediate
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we just try to cover the holes, we will never move
forward,'' he said, adding that the museum also hopes to make
improvements in the Winter Palace. ``So far we have donations for a
new roof and improved lighting. But we have big visions. We are
working in all directions.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum plans to hold some temporary exhibitions in the new
building some time next year.
</P>
<P>
   Two for Sotheby's
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's has been on a roll recently.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week the auction house secured about $100 million
worth of Impressionist and modern art owned by the Reader's Digest
Association. The collection, which includes major paintings and
sculptures by Monet, Cezanne, Matisse, van Gogh, Modigliani and
Giacometti, and was amassed by the company's founders, Lila Acheson
Wallace and her husband DeWitt Wallace, will be sold Nov. 16.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the auction house has been chosen to sell modern
art from the collection of Mr. and Mrs. Morton Neumann. Mr.
Neumann, who died in 1985, was a Chicago industrialist who, with
his wife, Rose, began buying art in the late 1940s. Over the years,
they amassed works by Picasso, Miro, Dubuffet, Klee, Giacometti and
other artists.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980 the National Gallery of Art in Washington devoted an
entire exhibition to the Neumann collection, in the hopes of being
given some of the art. But when Mrs. Neumann died earlier this
year, the works went to the Neumann family, who chose to sell 27
pieces, estimated to bring in between $16 million and $23 million.
</P>
<P>
   The sale will be held as part of Sotheby' contemporary art sale
on Nov. 17.
</P>
<P>
   By far the star of the collection is a cubist Picasso, ``Nude''
(1909), which depicts the artist's mistress Fernande Olivier
wrapped in a cloth, and is expected to sell for $10 million to $15
million. It had been on loan to the National Gallery in Washington
for the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Emmerich Is to Close
</P>
<P>
   When ``Kenneth Noland Circles'' closes at the Andre Emmerich
Gallery on Oct. 17, so will the 45-year-old gallery, at 41 E. 57th
Street in New York. Two years ago, Sotheby's bought the gallery and
made its staff Sotheby's employees, saying at the time that the
gallery would remain open under Emmerich's direction.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, when Sotheby's bought 50 percent of Deitch
Projects, the Soho gallery started by Jeffrey Deitch, Deitch was
put in charge of Sotheby's 20th-century art program, which included
overseeing the Andre Emmerich Gallery. (Emmerich was made a senior
adviser.) And now Sotheby's is closing the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an effort to consolidate our business operations we are
moving everything to Deitch Projects on Grand Street,'' said
Matthew Weigman, a spokesman for Sotheby's. ``Meanwhile we are
looking at possible spaces to hold exhibitions downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   Change at Guggenheim
</P>
<P>
   Peter B. Lewis, president and chief executive officer of
Progressive Corp., the Cleveland-based auto insurance company, has
been named chairman of the board of the Solomon R. Guggenheim
Foundation, which administers five Guggenheim museum sites
worldwide. Lewis, a foundation trustee since 1993, succeeds Peter
Lawson-Johnston, who will become the foundation's honorary
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   In April Lewis gave the Guggenheim a cash pledge of $50 million,
one of the largest cash gifts ever made to any visual arts
institution and the largest the Guggenheim, founded in 1937, has
ever received.
</P>
<P>
   ``This strengthens our leadership a lot and gives us a powerful
triumvirate,'' said Thomas Krens, the Guggenheim's director,
referring to Lewis, Lawson-Johnston and Ronald Perelman, the
foundation's president since 1995.

NFL MATCHUPS: WEEK 3

(jt)

<P>
   &UR; GAME OF THE WEEK: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Steelers (2-0) at Miami (2-0) Key Stats: Steelers have won last
five against AFC East; Dolphins lead series 8-7.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Intriguing matchup because it pairs two of the best
coaches _ and staffs _ in football. The consumption of coffee has
shot up in both cities all this week as coaches stay up all night
trying to figure out how to stop two superstar quarterbacks in Dan
Marino and Kordell Stewart. That is key, but the edge in this game
goes to the Dolphins because they're at home and they have the
better running game. Karim Abdul-Jabbar has 183 yards rushing on 41
carries.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins, 21-17
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUNDAY 1 P.M.GAMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Lions (0-2) at Vikings (2-0) Key Stats: Detroit Coach Bobby Ross
is 3-0 against Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: That knocking sound you hear are the knees of
Detroit's rookie quarterback, Charlie Batch, who will get the start
over the beleaguered veteran, Scott Mitchell. Last week Mitchell
threw two killer interceptions that basically lost the game for the
Lions. Afterward, teammates ripped into Mitchell and that forced
Ross to make the change. But a rookie against a great Vikings pass
rush? This could be ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Vikings, 30-14
</P>
<P>
   Packers (2-0) at Cincinnati (1-1) Key Stats: Packers' first road
game this season; Bengals quarterback Neil O'Donnell has a rating
of 101.5.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: If the Packers are going to have a letdown, this will
be the week. Green Bay can't play much better than it has the first
two games: the Packers are the only NFC team not to throw an
interception, Favre is throwing the ball as well as he ever has and
Reggie White last week came back from the dead to have three sacks.
This game will be scary for the Pack, though, because O'Donnell
plays well in situations when there is little pressure on him. It
will be close but Favre will be the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Packers, 21-17
</P>
<P>
   Colts (0-2) at Jets (0-2) Key Stats: Bill Parcells is 53-25
all-time in the regular season at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Parcells used to complain that O'Donnell didn't have
enough fire, but one thing O'Donnell did not do was constantly get
hurt. Glenn Foley is listed as questionable with a rib injury which
means his delicate body is rearing its ugly head again. Meanwhile,
the key to this game will be the Jets' defense, which will confuse
Peyton Manning so much he will think he's going against Florida. No
way Parcells loses to a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   Jets, 27-6
</P>
<P>
   Rams (0-2) at Bills (0-2) Key Stats: Rams quarterback Tony Banks
has 581 passing yards. Thurman Thomas and Andre Reed have 498
points each and could become the first Bills non-kickers to reach
500 career points.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: After his players nearly mutinied last week because
practices have been brutal and long, Coach Dick Vermeil relented,
saying practice would now end between 30 and 45 minutes earlier
than normal. How this entire scenario will affect the team, no one
knows. But Rams players will probably play hard because they want
to prove that easier practices make for fresher legs in games. The
Rams get an easy victory. Next week: Vermeil has the team make
running shoes for three cents an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Rams, 17-0
</P>
<P>
   Chargers (2-0) at Chiefs (1-1) Key Stats: Derrick Thomas has 6
sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: When will the magic ride end for the Chargers'
first-year quarterback, Ryan Leaf? He is playing like Joe Montana,
not some rookie. But this will be Leaf's first dose of NFL reality.
Derrick Thomas and friends will batter Leaf like he has never been
hit before. Thomas is upset about being shut down by the Jaguars
last week so look for him to get at least two sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs, 35-17
</P>
<P>
   Oilers (1-1) at Patriots (1-1) Key Stats: New England linebacker
Chris Slade has 30.5 of his 39.5 sacks at Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The Oilers just aren't talented enough to beat the
Patriots at home, where they have won 13 of the last 17 games.
Quarterback Drew Bledsoe is having a solid season, going 35 of 61
for 507 yards. He looks comfortable and his throws are sharp and
accurate. More importantly, running back Robert Edwards gives the
team a consistent running game.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots, 30-10
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUNDAY 4 P.M. GAMES: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ravens (1-1) at Jaguars (2-0) Key Stats: Ravens Coach Ted
Marchibroda is 0-4 against Jaguars Coach Tom Coughlin.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Baltimore is for real this season. But just how good
the Ravens will be depends on what happens in Jacksonville this
week. If the Ravens can win, they'll look like a playoff team; a
loss doesn't mean they will not make postseason play but they need
to beat Jacksonville to get a jump start. These games have always
been close _ all four meetings have been decided by three points or
less. Because Baltimore quarterback Eric Zeier is good in the
fourth quarter, the Ravens will get the upset of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens, 24-21
</P>
<P>
   Bears (0-2) at Buccaneers (0-2) Key Stats: Bears averaging 131
yards rushing a game.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Tampa Bay has had the most ridiculous schedule of any
NFL team in years. Including preseason games, they have had seven
straight contests on the road. They finally come home to their new
home, the 65,000-seat Raymond James Stadium. So far, they have been
the most disappointing team in the league. They start their rebound
with a hard working but bad luck Bears team. Chicago will play hard
all year but because of poor drafting they lack talent and depth.
Unless Tampa Bay completely falls apart, they will win big.
</P>
<P>
   Buccaneers, 19-3
</P>
<P>
   Broncos (2-0) at Raiders (1-1) Key Stats: Bill Romanowski leads
the team with 2 sacks; Tim Brown has 13 catches; Terrell Davis has
266 yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The fact former Raiders coach Mike Shanahan and owner
Al Davis hate each other will have little bearing on this game
except that if Shanahan loses it he will be very, very upset. Watch
closely the health of John Elway, Denver's superstar quarterback,
who is playing with a sore hamstring. Those injuries often take up
to a month to fully heal and it could act up at any point during
the game. If he stays healthy, Denver wins a close one.
</P>
<P>
   Broncos, 24-17
</P>
<P>
   Redskins (0-2) at Seahawks (2-0) Key Stats: Warren Moon, 124.2
rating, first in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The Redskins are in disarray and the Seahawks are
playing like the team many thought they would be last year. They
seek their first 3-0 start since 1986. Running back Ricky Watters
has 105 yards rushing, wide receiver Joey Galloway has 13 touchdown
catches in past 11 games and Seattle's defense has 7 takeaways,
tops in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks, 35-10
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY NIGHT GAME:
</P>
<P>
   Eagles (0-2) at Cardinals (0-2) Key Stats: Eagles have no
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Ugly. Whichever quarterback makes the fewest mistakes
will win. That will probably be Jake Plummer for Arizona. He has
thrown nine touchdowns and just four interceptions in his last
three games at Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals, 14-13
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MONDAY NIGHT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys (1-1) at Giants (1-1) Key Stats: Mike Strahan, Chad
Bratzke, 4 sacks each.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: When Troy Aikman went down last week with a broken
collarbone, the Cowboys' season went with him. Talk all you want
about how Jason Garrett is a solid backup, but he has no chance
against a Giants defense that loves to play the Cowboys and will be
pumped on Monday night. The Giants have won seven straight
divisional games at home.
</P>
<P>
   Giants, 21-14

   &UR; BILL'S WORLD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Old Farmer's Almanac,'' just out, predicts a bitterly cold
winter in the Midwest. We'll keep our copy handy in case we need it
for kindling.
</P>
<P>
   It's estimated that about 70.2 million Americans now have
Internet access. Maybe it's time to starting calling this the home
of the brave dot com.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the House committee that would conduct an
impeachment inquiry is Henry Hyde. Just for balance, maybe Mr.
Clinton should hire a lawyer named Seek.
</P>
<P>
   Despite promises of a nonpartisan approach to impeachment,
things already are divided. In fact, it's starting to sound like
imscreachment.
</P>
<P>
   We now know that Monica Lewinsky told 11 different people about
her affair with Mr. Clinton before it became public. This wasn't
kiss and tell. This was kiss and spam.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton has asked some clergymen to help him fight
temptation. Maybe they'll suggest the religious benefits of
blindfolds.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Starr's investigation of the Lewinsky matter cost at least
$4.4 million, it's reported. Heck, that's no more than a dollar for
each time we've seen that video of Monica in a crowd hugging Bill.
</P>
<P>
   Aunt Ilse from Oelwein says the kind of people anxious to see
the video tape of Mr. Clinton's grand jury testimony probably also
own copies of O.J. Simpson's book, ``I Want to Tell You.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those considering a primary challenge to Al Gore is Bill
Bradley. He may rescue the Democrats in the Knick of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``One quarter of the world,'' says Mr. Clinton, ``is having
negative economic growth.'' Or, put another way, positive economic
shrinkage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to reinforce the safety net for farmers and
ranchers,'' Mr. Clinton says. And, he no doubt hopes, for
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   New polls show Americans want Mr. Clinton to stay in office but
be censured. How about this punishment? Release a transcript of
everything Hillary has said to him in the last month.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Campolo, a minister Mr. Clinton has asked for spiritual
help, has written a book called ``Is Jesus a Republican or a
Democrat?'' Good question for the president, who often seems
neither, but a Sindependent.
</P>
<P>
   Because scandal has hurt the president, is Alan Greenspan now
the most powerful person in America? We'd vote for Mark McGwire _
unless Greenspan, too, starts taking androstenedione.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel especially bad for the farmers,'' says Mr. Clinton,
``because it's been such a good time for the rest of the country.''
Like criminal lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't do something to help our farmers,'' Mr. Clinton
says, ``eventually all other Americans will feel it as well.'' For
instance, we all may have to listen to more sad country songs.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. House passed a resolution the other day praising Sammy
Sosa and Mark McGwire. Thank goodness for bold national leadership
on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   With her Senate primary loss in New York, Geraldine Ferraro's
political career is over. It took a long time. After all, it went
on the Fritz back in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   To give you an idea how amazing our office coed softball team's
9-0 record is, imagine Sammy Sosa or Mark McGwire hitting 70 home
runs _ this week.
</P>
<P>
   New figures show economic growth continues to slow. Aunt Ilse
from Oelwein says she wishes she could say the same of parts of
her.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DAVID-LETTERMAN ``LATE SHOW'' TOP TEN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Alternatives to Impeachment'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   10. Must take 63 swings to the head from Mark McGwire
</P>
<P>
   9. All of Clinton's interns must now be former ``Golden Girls.''

   8. Arrange for him to be president of France where they're into

</P>

CHAVEZ KEEPS THE FAITH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ It is like it used to be for Julio Cesar Chavez. He
believes when no one else does.
</P>
<P>
   When Chavez first came out of the mountains around Culiacan,
Mexico, in 1980, few people knew who he was and fewer cared. He was
just the latest foot soldier in a long line of poor young Mexican
boys who would try to make their way in the world with their fists.
</P>
<P>
   But this boy would prove different. This boy whose professional
prizefighting career began at 16 would go from being Chavez to
becoming CHAVEZ! He would eventually win 101 fights and six world
titles in three weight classes and much more than that along the
way, because he would also win the hearts of Mexican fight fans
everywhere, rising to a position where he is today considered by
many the finest fighting machine Mexico ever produced.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all machines grow old. All machines wear out. All machines
ultimately come to a halt, and there are many who believe Chavez is
the latest in that long line, too: a nearly 36-year-old former
champion preparing for his final execution Friday night at the
sold-out Thomas and Mack Center.
</P>
<P>
   They believe Chavez is on the wrong end of a main event with
World Boxing Council welterweight champion Oscar De La Hoya, the
young Chicano superstar who two years ago stopped him in less than
four rounds, leaving him with a blood-smeared face and broken nose.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez had not looked good for nearly two years leading up to
that night, having already sustained his first loss to Frankie
Randall two years earlier, and things did not improve noticeably
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Although he went on to win four of his next five matches after
the devastation by De La Hoya, Chavez barely managed a draw with
another former Mexican world champion, Miguel Angel Gonzalez, in
the fifth when they battled for the vacant WBC 140-pound
championship in March. None of those fights has led anyone to
believe that this one will end differently than the way De La Hoya
has predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows this is his last major event,'' De La Hoya said this
week. ``After this, it's over. There's no reason to respect him
outside the ring and there won't be any respect for him inside that
ring this time, either.''
</P>
<P>
   These are bold words spoken about a man De La Hoya once
idolized. Growing up in East Los Angeles, De La Hoya used to have a
poster of Chavez over his bed. Now there is no poster because, De
La Hoya would argue, there is no Chavez. There is only a shadow
left, a squat, 140-pound likeness that cannot do in the ring what
he once did.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez well knows that is what people think. He well knows he is
an 8-1 underdog at Vegas betting parlors because few believe he
still has the fire to train or the ability to slice up an opponent
the way he did as skillfully as a chef at Benihana's for so many
years.
</P>
<P>
   What they see instead is an old fighter who goes off to
Breckenridge, Colo., to train in secrecy for two months but
reportedly spends more time eating Haagen-Dazs ice cream bars than
doing roadwork.
</P>
<P>
   They see a fighter whose face has been cleared of all scar
tissue by plastic surgeons. But twice he had to be examined by a
surgeon before the Nevada State Athletic Commission would even
allow him to fight De La Hoya again because his face has sprung so
many leaks that he had worn makeup to hide the freshest cut before
their first fight.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Chavez appears in a hotel room at Caesars Palace to
conduct an interview for a Mexican television station, it is as if
royalty has arrived. A buzz passes down the hall as he moves,
surrounded by a sea of bodyguards, sycophants, sons, and
hangers-on, and it continues even after he enters the room, greeted
by the television crew.
</P>
<P>
   There are kisses on the cheek for everyone, small talk and
jokes, and then he begins his interview and the real change in
Chavez's life becomes obvious.
</P>
<P>
   He is asked not about De La Hoya but rather about his tax
problems and his personal problems and his state of mind. He is
asked why he has performed so poorly in recent fights and why
anyone should believe he can win again. They are not questions fit
for royalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have my motivation,'' Chavez says of the fights since
the De La Hoya loss, fights in which he was cut several times and
looked uninspired in all of them. ``I had a lot of lawsuits and
people lying about me. But little by little, my problems have gone
and I'm strong again, mentally and physically.''
</P>
<P>
   His interviewer, a woman who seems charmed but unconvinced,
presses on, asking if recent problems such as his divorce and
seemingly endless tax struggle with a government that had him
arrested at the airport in Mexico City in June when he returned
from a fight have eased.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez smiles, but his eyes glower. He nods and says, ``Yes,
they have been made right. The one who screwed me up was my
accountants. Fortunately, that problem has been cleared up. That's
why I went to Colorado to train. Too many people were spreading
lies about me.''
</P>
<P>
   He claims that among those lies were newspaper reports of his
connections to what Chavez called the Mexican ``underground'' that
is battling the present regime and, in some cases, has been
portrayed as a gang of drug lords. He says he sued those newspapers
and won, but if he did, it seems news to the newscaster questioning
him.
</P>
<P>
   These questions and rumors have come as a shock to Chavez. It
was never like this when he was CHAVEZ! In those days, he partied
no harder than he does today and lived no differently. But back
then, he was the unbeatable champion, not a fading one, so all
things were different. Back then, he was CHAVEZ!
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not accustomed to all these rumors,'' Chavez says.
``They're trying to destroy my career. They talk too much. They
proved nothing against me.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon he is asked about being a 10-1 underdog, which he was when
betting on the fight opened, and he snaps, ``Two to one! It is 2-1
right now. That is the best you can get. But have them bet on Oscar
De La Hoya if they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``He isn't going in with a Chavez who is already cut. This is a
different Chavez. I'm very strong. I did much sparring for this
fight. I lifted weights and added some strength. No excuses for me
this time. I'm going to win the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's conviction is obvious, but it is impossible not to
wonder if this is all just a game he is playing on himself. When he
arrived in Colorado with an entourage of 14 that included his
mother, his girlfriend, and two of his sons, he seemed like a man
trying to recapture the past for one last moment. There was an air
that this might be the last dance, so everyone close to him wanted
a piece of it.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a camp like De La Hoya's, who locks himself away in
his private cabin and training facility in Big Bear, Calif., before
each fight. While the young champion was there to focus on an old
fighter he says he has grown to hate, Chavez seemed to be in
Colorado in search of something no fighter can get back. He was
searching for the past.
</P>
<P>
   But where once it was the Golden Age for Julio Cesar Chavez, now
it is the Rust Age. He has grown old in a young man's sport, fat in
a svelte man's game, wealthy in a poor man's discipline. You don't
find many fighters in Beverly Hills and you don't find many
36-year-olds able to hold off their 25-year-old pursuers for long.
Not in a boxing ring, at least.
</P>
<P>
   But while the old lion may no longer have teeth, he still has
his pride, so he still can roar. That may do nothing for him here
when it is the crowd's turn to roar and the old lion's
responsibility to fight off the younger one, but it is all he has
today. So he roars loud and long, sounding as if he believes he is
still king of the jungle regardless of what the world may say and
write.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will break him up with punches,'' he says, punctuating his
words with a short hook to his inquisitor's ribs. ``I will use all
my experience but also all my youthfulness. This time his face will
not be clean when the fight ends. This time he will be scared like
a dog. This time he will see the warrior Chavez.''
</P>
<P>
   He spits out the words in rapid-fire succession, then smiles. It
is the smile of an assassin, the kind Pancho Villa used to wear
when he would ride out of the Mexican mountains to ambush
government soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   That is Julio Cesar Chavez's plan. He intends to ambush a young
champion who has no idea who the real Chavez is. His problem is
that he may no longer know who the real Chavez is, either, because
the CHAVEZ! of his memory is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Julio Cesar Chavez is the lion in winter, fighting to retain a
hold on what he no longer can control. Just three weeks ago, an
even older lion, Roberto Duran, tried the same thing in this same
town of broken dreams and was destroyed in four rounds by World
Boxing Association middleweight champion William Joppy, a fighter
of no particular skill.
</P>
<P>
   Joppy won that night because the real Roberto Duran existed only
in the old lion's mind. Now Julio Cesar Chavez will go into the
ring in the same circumstance. When he comes out, he will not be
CHAVEZ! anymore.

POLL SHOWS STRONG PREFERENCE FOR RIGHT TO SUE HMOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seven out of 10 voters favor an expanded right to sue health
maintenance organizations, according to a new poll from the Harvard
University School of Public Health that suggests evidence of
growing consumer outrage towards HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, sponsored by the Kaiser Family Foundation, shows
increasing public support for one of the most hotly debated
provisions of a comprehensive HMO package sponsored by Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) to boost patient protections.
</P>
<P>
   The HMO industry, which is protected by a 1974 federal law that
greatly narrows the rights of most patients to sue their managed
care plans, has argued that if the bill were adopted it would
unleash a torrent of litigation and jack up insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Those arguments, however, are falling on deaf ears, said Robert
Blendon, chief author of the survey, which in August polled 1,200
adults nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are hearing the message, but they're not buying it,''
Blendon said.
</P>
<P>
   It is a dramatic turnaround for an amendment that once was so
controversial lawmakers had contemplated sacrificing it to push
through other HMO reforms. Last year, only 56 percent of
Republicans and 70 percent of Democrats supported an expanded right
to sue. That figure grew to 74 percent and 75 percent,
respectively, this year.
</P>
<P>
   Strong support of the provision is indicative of swelling public
ire over virtually all aspects of managed care. Those who felt HMOs
were doing a bad job grew to 42 percent this year versus 25 percent
in 1997. About one-third felt ``very worried'' that their health
plan was more interested in saving money than in providing them
with the best treatment if they were sick. Only 18 percent felt
that way a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Twice as many respondents _ about 37 percent _ said they based
their opinions on their own experiences than those who said they
relied on media coverage _ 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The managed care industry pointed out that the survey showed a
substantial drop in support if the changes result in increased
premiums. Public support for comprehensive legislation dropped to
40 percent from 78 percent when people are told it would raise
premiums by $200 a year for an average family.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are nervous about the government becoming too
involved,'' said John Murray, spokesman for the American
Association of Health Plans, an industry group in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also showed diminishing public patience with
politicians over the issue. Most people _ 66 percent of those
polled _ say politicians have been using the issue to gain
political advantage in an election year, while only 25 percent
believe politicians are making a serious attempt to protect
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, efforts to pass a comprehensive HMO reform
bill failed this year, despite unanimous votes in the House and
Senate for reform. Lawmakers, who did not vote on the issue until
the last weeks of the session, say they simply ran out of time.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton Thursday tried to respond to public concerns
by issuing a range of protections for about 15 million low-income
patients in Medicaid HMOs. The new rules include, among other
things, allowing patients with chronic or severe illnesses to go
directly to specialist physicians; giving patients expanded ability
to appeal insurance coverage denials; and, requiring HMOs to
provide more information on benefits and costs of using the plans.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, full debate on Sen. Kennedy's proposal was sidelined
Wednesday by senate Republicans. With just three weeks remaining in
the Senate session and Washington embroiled in the debate over
Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinski, some feel national HMO
reform is becoming less likely this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lewinski issue is drowning out everything else,'' said
Blendon. ``But our poll shows that this issue has legs for the next
session. It's going to be hard for politicians to come back to
voters two years from now and say they have done nothing.''

<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ This is a hard city to squeeze into a sentence.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a Navy and Marine Corps base ever since 1846.
Capitalizing on one of the Pacific Coast's best harbors, rivaled
only by San Francisco's and Seattle's, the armed services have made
the San Diego area the largest military complex in the world, home
to 165,000 sailors and marines.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Cruise and the other jet-jocks in ``Top Gun'' flew out of
Miramar Naval Air Station.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tourist town, with a neo-Victorian Gaslamp District,
beloved of convention-goers and families on vacation, and an
equally tourist-saturated Old Town, full of adobe buildings, old
and new.
</P>
<P>
   Its innovative, world-class zoo and the remarkable 1,800-acre
Wild Animal Park, about 30 miles to the northeast, draw enormous
throngs every day of the year. So does Sea World, a marine park
whose painfully hokey style never seems to faze fans of Shamu, the
whale.
</P>
<P>
   It is a university town. The University of California at San
Diego, only 38 years old, has built a global reputation in such
diverse fields as bioengineering, genetics, oceanography and the
neurosciences, spinning off dozens of highly profitable technology
businesses in the process.
</P>
<P>
   UCSD has five Nobel laureates on its faculty, and six others
have taught there in the past. Nobel Drive passes close to the
campus. The university has been designated as one of two national
supercomputer centers, linking 37 other institutions in 18 states.
</P>
<P>
   It is a sports town _ swimming, surfing and tennis; hang gliding
above the cliffs at La Jolla; golf at championship courses like
Torrey Pines and La Costa, with gear made by companies like
Callaway, Taylor Made, Cobra, Titleist and Lynx, all based just up
the coast at Carlsbad, and sailing out of America's Cup Harbor,
made famous by the local skipper Dennis Conner.
</P>
<P>
   What makes all this possible is the benign climate, and people
who live here talk constantly about its blessings. ``The weather is
the main thing that shapes this place,'' said James L. Bowers, a
philanthropic consultant who moved here from New York. ``In three
decades as a San Diegan, I've never worn a coat, summer or
winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Another transplanted Easterner, Professor Samuel Popkin of UCSD,
added this: ``That five minutes of sun you get every day walking to
your car in winter adds up. Mothers in San Diego look as healthy as
daughters in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, people looked on San Diego as vanilla pudding,
urban white bread, more Midwest than the Midwest. Former Mayor Pete
Wilson, now the Governor of California, a trim, buttoned-down
onetime marine who grew up in Illinois, exemplified that placid
period in San Diego history. ``America's finest city,'' he
christened it, with all the flair of a cost accountant.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego newspapers, owned by the Copley family, boosted
the city and backed conservative politicians and values. One of
their editors was Herbert G. Klein, a strategist and sometime
spokesman for Richard M. Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   If San Diego was bland, La Jolla, the gilded enclave north of
downtown, was blander still. The mystery writer Raymond Chandler,
who spent the last 13 years of his life here, once described it as
``a town of arthritic billionaires and barren old women.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he longed to stand naked at high noon on the main drag,
Girard Avenue, and shout four-letter words, but he never did it
(and La Jolla, if truth be told, has infinitely more to offer than
Chandler ever recognized). A City Growing Up
</P>
<P>
   Before World War II, San Diego had a population of only 150,000.
During the war, a single factory, that of Consolidated Vultee
Aircraft, employed 48,000 workers, and the bases were swollen with
troops on their way to the Pacific Theater of Operations.
</P>
<P>
   Those who flocked here then and after the war were mostly white,
escaping dead-end jobs, cold winters and moribund older cities and
towns. They joined retired naval officers, who congregated on
Coronado, an almost-island connected to the mainland by a sand spit
and, since 1969, by the Coronado Bridge, which vaults across the
bay on colossal stilts shaped like inverted Vs.
</P>
<P>
   But the city is yeastier now. A funny thing happened to it on
its way to a population of 1.2 million (2.7 million in San Diego
County): Asian and Hispanic migrants arrived in quantity. Along
with eggheads attracted by the new high-tech ventures, they have
helped to give the region a more cosmopolitan atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   As of last January, 23 percent of the city's population was
Hispanic and 13 percent was Asian-American. The figures are
increasing.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, San Diego became something of a magnet,
like Los Angeles and San Francisco before it, for wackos and
weirdos. Like every place, it always had its nonconformists; Ted
Williams, that most iconoclastic of baseball players, grew up here
and played for Herbert Hoover High School.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, the country got a glimpse of an altogether more
sensational side of life in greater San Diego. First there was the
mass suicide of the Heaven's Gate cult in Rancho Santa Fe,
previously known as a refined resort and residential community, and
then there was the nationwide manhunt for Andrew P. Cunanan, who
lived in the bohemian Hillcrest neighborhood before murdering the
fashion designer Gianni Versace in Miami Beach and taking his own
life.
</P>
<P>
   For better and for worse, San Diego has taken its place among
the nation's biggest cities. It currently ranks seventh in
population. It played host to the 1996 Republican National
Convention and the 1998 Super Bowl. New high-rise hotels grace the
skyline, and a superb system of freeways links homes, shops,
offices and especially beaches _ 70-plus miles of beautiful sand.
</P>
<P>
   But this is still a young city, still somehow tentative, still
in the process of becoming. There are those who profoundly regret
its rapid growth, as there were when it was much smaller; John
Gunther called them ``the geraniums,'' and their foes, the
advocates of growth, ``the smokestacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Pushing the case for a new ball park and a new library, both
downtown, Neil Morgan of The San Diego Union-Tribune wrote in a
recent column that there was enough talent, ambition and big money
in San Diego these days to build both, and a lot more, at the same
time. The moment has arrived, he said, for people here ``to decide
finally who we'd really like to be when we grow up.''

 SAN DIEGO: grow up.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If anything epitomizes San Diego, it is Balboa Park, a verdant
1,200-acre enclave only a few blocks from downtown. Locals love it
as much as visitors, and why not? It houses not only the zoo but
also a handful of first-rate museums; one of the city's best
theaters, the Old Globe, a replica of the similarly named house in
Shakespeare's London, and a magnificent outdoor organ (donated by
the Spreckels family, one of the city's wealthiest, which made its
first millions in sugar).
</P>
<P>
   All that plus miles of flower beds and trails, unctuated by
lovely fountains and century-old shade trees.
</P>
<P>
   The park dates from 1915, when San Diego held a yearlong world
fair, the Panama-California Exposition, to mark the opening of the
Panama Canal. Bertram D. Goodhue, an Easterner, was chosen as the
architect. Although he built the Nebraska Capitol in a vaguely Art
Deco style and the chapel at West Point along neo-Gothic lines, he
chose something entirely different for San Diego _ a hybrid of
Spanish Renaissance and Mexican colonial styles, heavily encrusted
with stonework as ornate as silverplate (and known as
``plateresque'').
</P>
<P>
   For decades thereafter, what Goodhue created for a handful of
monumental buildings in Balboa Park reigned as the Spanish Colonial
Revival style, adapted for tens of thousands of houses and other
buildings across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo, which draws 3.3 million visitors a year, is San Diego's
premier attraction. Almost entirely supported by private funds, it
has pioneered the use of landscaped habitats, with moats replacing
cages, and in 1975 began a program to reproduce endangered species
like the giant panda.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many, this zoo, which houses more than 800 kinds of
animals, pays as much attention to flora as fauna, maintaining a
collection of 6,500 botanical species.
</P>
<P>
   Our favorite sight on a recent visit: the Polar Bear Plunge,
with one of the gigantic carnivores frolicking on and beneath a
white plastic ``ice floe'' in the 14-foot-deep moat.
</P>
<P>
   Among the dozen or so museums are buildings devoted to space,
railroads, sports, photography and folk art (the latter temporarily
graced by seven of Niki de Saint Phalle's oversized Seussian
creatures, whose mirrored and enameled surfaces glisten appealingly
in the sun).
</P>
<P>
   Two museums concentrate primarily on paintings and sculpture.
The San Diego Museum of Art has a collection strong in Spanish,
Italian and American works (notice the three exquisite little
depictions of peaches by Raphaelle Peale and one of Morgan
Russell's rare Synchronist studies). John Singleton Copley's great
masterpiece, ``Mrs. Thomas Gage,'' a portrait of an aristocratic
Englishwoman with liquid brown eyes, hangs at the smaller Timken
Museum of Art nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Serious music has had a hard time here. The opera company,
though not of national stature, operates in the black and attracts
good audiences. But dance is a bit of a stranger, and the San Diego
Symphony, which went bust a while ago, has just been re-formed with
a new board and conductor, Jung-Ho Pak, who also leads orchestras
(not the main ones) in San Francisco and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of the performing arts scene may be chamber music,
particularly the La Jolla Summerfest, which takes place each
August. It is put on by the same organization that presents
big-league concerts in La Jolla and San Diego each year, featuring
the likes of Joshua Bell and Mariss Jansons. David Finckel, the
cellist of the Emerson Quartet, and his wife, the pianist Wu Han,
have just been named as the joint directors of the appealingly
intimate festival.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the sea, not high culture, that brings people to San
Diego, and there is no better way to savor the city than to wander
south along the coast from Del Mar (where Bing Crosby used to own a
piece of the race track) to Point Loma, the most southwesterly
point in the continental United States.
</P>
<P>
   You could start at Torrey Pines State Reserve, an unspoiled
seaside tract of rugged ravines and sandstone cliffs, which glow
red in the setting sun and lurk menacingly in the frequent fogs.
Most of the world's remaining Torrey pines, fewer than 5,000 of
them, are concentrated here _ beautiful, often wind-contorted trees
whose needles are borne in clusters of five.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Browning Scripps, the philanthropic sister of the
publisher E.W. Scripps, bought and saved the trees for posterity.
Her dollars also shaped La Jolla, endowing the Scripps Institution
of Oceanography, whose new Birch Aquarium opened in 1992, the
Scripps Clinic and the Scripps Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Scripps was the principal patron of the trailblazing
architect Irving J. Gill. His pared-down buildings, on which
cornices and window moldings and pediments are all discarded in
favor of unembellished surfaces and simple yet memorably elegant
arches, dominate a whole section of La Jolla.
</P>
<P>
   Three buildings _ the Bishop's School, the pristine La Jolla
Women's Club (1912-14) and Miss Scripps' own house, masterfully
converted by Robert Venturi for the Museum of Contemporary Art _
all lie within easy walking distance of one another.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown, the early Marston House, near Balboa Park, and the
handsome First Church of Christ Scientist, at the corner of Second
Avenue and Laurel Street, where restoration is almost complete, can
be visited.
</P>
<P>
   Gill's work is astonishingly similar to that of Adolph Loos in
Vienna at the same period, although the two appear to have known
little if anything of each other. His buildings are not widely
known today; yet Henry-Russell Hitchcock, the architectural
historian, says that ``his best houses extend very notably the
range of achievement of the first generation of modern
architects.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum that Venturi made from Miss Scripps' house is a tour
de force of adaptive restoration, and its collection includes a
fine assembly of present-day art, including works by Californians
like Ed Ruscha, John Baldessari and Bruce Nauman.
</P>
<P>
   La Jolla offers other seaside delights as well, including the La
Jolla Playhouse, founded by Gregory Peck and some of his Hollywood
pals. One of San Diego's main stages, along with the Old Globe and
the San Diego Repertory Theater downtown, it produces a fair number
of plays that end up on or off Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the campus of the Salk Institute, the research
center founded by Dr. Jonas Salk, the conqueror of polio. Designed
by Louis I. Kahn, it is composed of two mirror-image six-story
buildings, built of teak, glass and unfinished concrete, facing
each other across a travertine plaza that is bisected by a narrow
waterway.
</P>
<P>
   The undulating facades of the buildings set up a powerful
rhythm, seeming to recede into infinity, like some renaissance
study of perspective, and the waterway seems to empty into the
Pacific beyond.
</P>
<P>
   To pass instantly from high culture to pop culture, all you need
do is head a few miles south, to the point where Garnet Avenue
reaches the sea. There stand two local institutions, the Crystal
Pier Hotel, a motel built on a pier over the ocean, and Kono's
Cafe, with a perpetual queue of customers lined up outside.

GROUP WARNS ABOUT CAMPUS CREDIT CARD OFFERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Instead of giving out free T-shirts, chocolates, or mugs to lure
new customers, banks peddling credit cards on campuses ought to be
handing out brochures about responsible debt, officials from a
consumer advocacy group said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group said its
national study of 1,260 undergraduates at 15 campuses found that
students who acquire credit cards from on-campus marketers are more
likely to carry larger balances and acquire more cards than those
who get them through other means.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students, especially those who fill out credit card
applications at campus tables in return for trinkets and candy, run
the risk of falling into the campus credit card trap,'' said
Deirdre Cummings, consumer program director for MassPIRG, at a
press conference at the University of Massachusetts at Boston
campus.
</P>
<P>
   Calling for curbs on the use of gifts as enticements, Cummings
said banks zealously market to young adults in hopes of winning
lifetime loyalty through this first-time credit card. Yet college
students, many without jobs, often can't handle the debt.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, ``The Campus Credit Card Trap,''
students responsible for their own cards who obtained them through
an application made on campus had an average unpaid balance of
$1,039. This compares to $854 for those who obtained their cards by
applying another way.
</P>
<P>
   Those who applied on-campus also had an average of 2.6 cards,
compared with 2.1 cards for those who applied outside of school.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings said other studies that have painted a brighter picture
of students' ability to handle debt, such as one recently by the
Institute for Higher Education Policy, fail to distinguish between
students who rely on parents to pay the bills and those who are
responsible for their own cards.
</P>
<P>
   At UMass-Boston, a marketer for Associates National Bank of
Delaware stood inside a student building with free T-shirts,
calling cards, and a thesaurus for anyone who filled out the VISA
application. The card comes with a variable annual percentage rate,
which this month would be about 17.99.
</P>
<P>
   At the bank's headquarters in Irving, Texas, spokesman Joe
Stroop said the bank recruits students hoping they will become
long-term customers when their earning power grows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not because we make a ton of money on students, because
we don't,'' he said. ``It's an investment in the future of the
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   MassPIRG called on colleges to consider a ban on on-campus card
marketers, and to provide more education about debt. It also called
into question some banks' practice of paying colleges a fee based
on the number of applications completed, giving the schools an
incentive to encourage sign-ups.
</P>
<P>
   College policies vary. Northeastern University bars credit card
marketers from academic buildings and student centers, while Boston
University allows them at some student buildings in return for a
fixed fee, said school officials. UMass-Boston dean of students
Stephanie Janey said it is considering revisions to rules that
currently allow on-campus credit card marketers under a variety of
financial arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   At many colleges, marketers skirt rules by setting up shop on
public sidewalks near the school.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Mara, 20, a UMass Boston student, said credit card marketers
are seductive. Wearing a Citibank T-shirt he was given this week
for applying for his third card, he acknowledged he already has two
cards with a total unpaid balance of $3,800. ``These giveaways of
T-shirts and gifts do influence students,'' he said.

 SAN DIEGO: up outside.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the boardwalk that runs along the sand (a concrete walk,
actually, but why quibble?) there passes in review, each and every
morning, a Pacific Beach world that cries out for a 20th-century
Brueghel to immortalize it.
</P>
<P>
   There are joggers and skateboarders, bicyclists and riders of a
vehicle known as a California Chariot, a kind of stand-up tricycle;
there are bums smoking nasty little butts and mothers pushing or
pulling three-wheeled prams and hundreds of Rollerblade skaters,
some gliding along as if they had been born on the things, others
wobbling as if they had been born to fall down.
</P>
<P>
   In just a few moments one fine August morning, my wife, Betsey,
and I saw an aging hippie with a ponytail and a Colonel Sanders
beard, and numberless ancient women who had clearly spent a
lifetime ignoring American Cancer Society warnings about too much
sun, and a blond guy in a straw hat, who looked like a model for
the J. Crew catalog, working on a marine watercolor, and,
inevitably I guess, a burly man with a green macaw perched on his
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   You need a real California drink here: buy yourself a smoothie.
If you don't know the genuine, quite irresistible article, stop
first on Fay Avenue in La Jolla at a place named the Juice Kaboose
(I kid you not), where young Sean Tutt will explain the basic
principles for you, as he did for me. Then he'll run a mixture of
orange juice (squeezed before your eyes), fresh mango slices, ice
and nonfat frozen yogurt through the blender. If ever the whole is
truly greater than the sum of its parts, this is the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Finally to Point Loma, where both San Diego and modern
California got their starts. On Sept. 28, 1542, the explorer Juan
Rodriguez Cabrillo sailed past this rocky promontory and into the
bay. Standing today near the old lighthouse, looking down at jets
taking off from the airport, skyscrapers clustered downtown and
tens of thousands of sailboat masts rising from marinas, I found it
hard to imagine the virginal landscape that greeted him.
</P>
<P>
   To get any real sense of the isolation of the Spaniards, you
have to head back inland, eight miles up the San Diego River. There
in 1774 Father Junipero Serra built the Mission of San Diego de
Alcala, the first of a chain of 21 missions along the coast. This
is a neighborhood of freeways and subdivisions now, with the
baseball and football stadium close by.
</P>
<P>
   But as you visit the little cell where Serra lived, and stand in
the garden beneath the lovely white facade of the mission's bell
tower, you may be able to conjure up a picture, if only barely, of
how limitless this new continent must have looked to him and how
distant Madrid must have seemed. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is information about visiting the San Diego area: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Where to Stay
</P>
<P>
   HOTEL DEL CORONADO, 1500 Orange Avenue, (619) 435-6611. Few
hotels offer as much history with a night's rest as this turreted
landmark, built in 1888 of white clapboard and red shingles. Wallis
Simpson and the Prince of Wales are said to have met at the Del;
Marilyn Monroe &AMP; Co. cavorted there in ``Some Like It Hot.'' It
boasts 692 rooms (316 air-conditioned), a beach and two pools.
Rooms range from $190 to $550 a night.
</P>
<P>
   HYATT REGENCY LA JOLLA, 3777 La Jolla Village Drive, (619)
552-1234. Designed by the post-modernist Michael Graves, part of a
mesa-top complex that also includes Cafe Japengo (see below), this
is one of the better Hyatts, with cherrywood furniture in the
rooms, a sleek lobby and a good pool. Convenient location just off
a main freeway; beware noisy Thursday night booze-ups. Rooms start
at $214 for a one-night stay and $159 a night for longer stays.
</P>
<P>
   LOEWS CORONADO BAY, 4000 Coronado Bay Road, (619) 424-4000.
Cross the Coronado Bridge, turn left down the spit of land known as
the Silver Strand and there, in a 15-acre enclave, lies this modern
resort, with swimming, water skiing, an 80-slip marina, 440 rooms
and a good restaurant. Many rooms look across the bay toward the
city, and the ocean is just a short walk. Rooms start at $235 a
night on weekends; $165 to $215 weekdays.
</P>
<P>
   LA VALENCIA, 1132 Prospect Street, La Jolla, (619) 454-0771. A
taste of yesteryear, a cluster of pink buildings on a bluff
overlooking the Pacific. A friend of mine remembers seeing Gregory
Peck and his wife climbing out of a convertible and sweeping into
the lobby, which seems perfect for this classic establishment,
built in 1926. Some rooms are small, so specify a larger one. Rooms
range from $205 to $450.
</P>
<P>
   WESTGATE HOTEL, 1055 Second Avenue, (619) 238-1818. This is San
Diego's premier downtown hotel, a courtly, traditional
establishment with crystal chandeliers and Oriental rugs, housed in
a 1970s tower. Spectacular views over the bay from the upper
floors; guest rooms distinguished by absolute quiet and ample
proportions. The service is swift and friendly. A winner. Rooms
range from $174 to $224. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Where to Eat
</P>
<P>
   CAFE JAPENGO, 8960 University Center Lane, La Jolla, (619)
450-3355. It's hip, noisy, young, and I love it anyway. Terrific
sushi, served on heavy round platters, makes an ideal starter for a
Pacific Rim feast. Afterward, go for the curry fried calamari with
lime vinaigrette, the potstickers with coriander-mint pesto, the
warm duck salad and the crispy whole striped bass.
</P>
<P>
   CIEN ANOS, Jose Maria Velazco 1407, Tijuana, (011) 5266-343-039.
No Tex-, no Cal-, just Mex. No mariachis, either _ just
sophisticated, authentic Mexican cooking, in an immaculate,
side-street casita just south of the border: octopus stewed with
chilies and herbs, crepes stuffed with the hauntingly flavored corn
fungus called huitlacoche and shrimp in tangy tamarind sauce.
</P>
<P>
   LAUREL, 505 Laurel Street, (619) 239-2222. This is the sibling
of the Wine Sellar and Brasserie, a top-rated spot with a stunning
wine list (13 pinot noirs from Williams Selyem). It's less formal,
and the wine list is a bit shorter, but it's more central, and the
gifted Douglas Organ oversees the food here, too. Typical dishes:
semolina and white corn gnocchi with wild mushroom ragout, veal
cheeks and turnips in red wine, Moroccan-spiced chicken breast.
</P>
<P>
   POINT LOMA SEAFOODS, 2805 Emerson Street, (619) 223-1109. San
Diego is not a great town for formal dining, but its casual spots
are dandy _ like this lively waterfront market whose showcases hold
a vast variety of fresh and smoked fish. They make the definitive
tuna sandwich from sourdough bread and freshly caught albacore they
bake themselves. Also fine shellfish salads.
</P>
<P>
   RUBIO'S BAJA GRILL, 901 Fourth Avenue, (619) 231-7731 (and other
locations). Ralph Rubio, a local lad, brought the recipe for fish
tacos back from a surfing vacation in Baja California and made a
fortune selling them to hungry San Diegans. Pollock, lightly fried
in beer batter, shredded cabbage, yogurt sauce and salsa, wrapped
in a tortilla: try one, and you'll be hooked.
</P>
<P>
   SUSHI OTA, 4529 Mission Bay Drive, (619) 270-5670. Jeffrey
Steingarten of Vogue doesn't like it, but everyone else does.
Tucked into the corner of a banal strip mall, this Spartan shop
produces the standards (tuna belly, sea urchin, yellowtail) from
prime ingredients, and Yukito Ota likes to whip up unusual,
delectable hand rolls or combinations for those who ask.
</P>
<P>
   TAPENADE, 7600 Fay Street, La Jolla, (619) 551-7500. This is
that rare and elusive bird, a real French bistro with real French
food. It's new (June 1998), and service is shaky. But there's
nothing problematic about the food, whether traditional (an
ethereal, world-class puff-pastry tomato tart with basil oil,
serious steak frites) or innovative (tuna carpaccio with ginger).

COHEN SAYS US DEFENSE READINESS STRESSED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The defense secretary, William S. Cohen, cautioned
Thursday that US military readiness is ``fraying at the edges'' and
could ``turn into a tear'' without additional money for the
Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, speaking at a breakfast meeting of the Boston-area
Chamber of Commerce, said the armed forces have long grappled with
the problem of attracting and retaining capable and well-educated
recruits to operate increasingly sophisticated equipment and
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   And, joking that the business-people in his audience were
hurting the military's efforts, he said the nation's robust economy
makes it even more difficult to lure ``the best and the brightest''
into uniform because their job prospects are so good in the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
   The personnel issue is growing into a tough, persistent one for
the Pentagon. Cohen said, for instance, that the Navy will fall
short of its recruitment goals this year. And he said various
branches of the military already are taking money out of
procurement and putting it into readiness _ that is, taking steps
to upgrade compensation, medical benefits, educational
opportunities, and make other quality-of-life improvements designed
to keep troops happy and prepared for action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing some fraying at the edges,'' Cohen said Thursday,
adding that he did not think any alarm bells needed to sound yet.
``The danger is that the fraying will spread and turn into a
tear.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's comments represented a brief public airing of an
argument he and the Joint Chiefs of Staff have been making
privately to President Clinton: that the time has come to halt the
13-year decline in Pentagon budgets. News reports said military
leaders told Clinton this week that, unless some major programs or
overseas deployments are cut, their $250 billion budget may need an
extra $15 billion annually for several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to maintain that role,'' Cohen said of this
country's status as the world's sole superpower, ``are we willing
to pay the price for it?''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's avowed desire to stop pulling money from weapons
programs was welcome news for Dennis J. Picard, chairman and chief
executive officer of Raytheon Co., the nation's third-largest
defense contractor, based in Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to hear that,'' Picard said. ``I think he'll work
hard to get a bigger budget this year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What they've been doing is taking money out of procurement
budgets, and that's what killed us,'' Picard said, referring to the
massive defense cutbacks that forced Ray-theon and other companies
to lay off thousands of workers in the early 1990s.

LIFE IS ONE LONG JUBILEE: FAVORITE GERSHWIN RECORDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Was George Gershwin America's greatest composer? In the arts,
such questions are futile and ultimately unimportant. What can be
said, perhaps, is that Gershwin was the most  &UR; American &LR;  composer,
in the democracy and eclecticism of his idiom, and in the brash
energy and earthy imagination that boiled from his musical melting
pot of pop, blues, jazz and classics.
</P>
<P>
   He has been gone so long, dead at 38 in 1937, that it is hard to
believe he would only now be turning 100. Next Friday is the big
day, although many revelers have jumped the gun, as New York's
Carnegie Hall is to do on Wednesday, opening its season with a
Gershwin concert by the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, conducted
by Michael Tilson Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, it seems, is eager to celebrate, and few, so far, are
inclined to complain. But is there a danger? Gershwin did not
produce Mozartean or Schubertian reams of music in the time
allotted him, and most of what he wrote will be heard repeatedly in
the coming months. Can there be too much of this good thing?
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily. The saving grace would seem to be the
tremendous variety of approaches that this music not only
withstands but also invites. To show the remarkable range, music
critics of The New York Times _ pop, jazz and classical _ have
compiled a list of their favorite recordings of Gershwiniana. Their
choices and comments are on page 4.
</P>
<P>
   As always with such lists, the term ``favorite'' should not be
taken to mean ``best.'' (See ``greatest,'' above.) But these are
all excellent recordings of fine and lively music. Who could ask
for anything more?
</P>
<P>
   _ By JAMES R. OESTREICH
</P>
<P>
   Here are some favorite George Gershwin recordings of the
classical music and pop and jazz critics of The Times. Compact
disks range in price from $10 to $17 for a single disk; $25 to $35
for a two-disk set; $48 for a three-disk package and $68 for a
four-disk collection.
</P>
<P>
   BERNARD HOLLAND:
</P>
<P>
   Naming one's favorite Gershwin performances is a bewildering
task. It's a little more straightforward with his written-out
classical pieces, especially the composer's surviving performances
of them, but the compact disks I have been listening to suggest
that the ``definitive Gershwin interpretation'' has changed from
day to day.
</P>
<P>
   Gershwin's songs, on the other hand, are both permanent artifact
and the vernacular's plaything. They hover between private property
and public domain, for each song has its own essence yet
collaborates with the singer or player.
</P>
<P>
   One comes best across a Gershwin song by riffling through
singers' albums by the hundreds: ``Someone to Watch Over Me'' in
Linda Ronstadt's cool, pure big-band version with Nelson Riddle
(``What's New'' for Asylum), so different from Jimmy Scott's
anguished, wavering tenor (on ``All the Way'' for AAD). Andre
Previn makes ``Isn't It a Pity?'' into brilliantly imaginative
pianism (``We Got Rhythm,'' Deutsche Grammophon). But to appreciate
Ira Gershwin's wonderful lyrics, skip to the singer Shirley Horn
(``Here's to Life,'' Verve).
</P>
<P>
   There is no better way to feel the tensions between Gershwin's
concert and popular music than to compare Helen Jepson's operatic
diction in ``Summertime'' from 1933 (``George Gershwin Plays
Gershwin'' on Magic Talent) with Leontyne Price's utter naturalness
many years later (Selections from ``Porgy and Bess'' on RCA Victor.
And there is no better way to hear Gershwin's posthumous symbiosis
with the jazz styles of the 1940s and '50s than to go through
Previn's daring, subtle and deeply felt piano versions for Deutsche
Grammophon.
</P>
<P>
   Vestiges of Gershwin's own performing styles pop up everywhere.
The Columbia Jazz Band and Michael Tilson Thomas accompany an old
piano roll of the composer's in the original version of ``Rhapsody
in Blue'' (``Classic Gershwin'' on Sony Music ). His playing,
frenetic and flighty here, is more measured in the 1927 radio
transcription with Paul Whiteman's concert orchestra (again on
Magic Talent). Archeology tells us that Gershwin played faster than
we tend to do, but I wonder if that is any reason for us to change.
</P>
<P>
   Stumped as to which recordings to single out, I went to the
record store and took a little pot luck. I am persuaded by Leonard
Bernstein's leisurely tempos in ``An American in Paris'' with the
New York Philharmonic (``The Bernstein Century'' for Sony) though
his similar approach in ``Rhapsody in Blue'' with the same players
seemed patient to a fault.
</P>
<P>
   My most dismal purchase was Oscar Levant's collection of piano
pieces recorded in the 1940s with various orchestras and conductors
(CBS). The playing is pushed, jagged and panting for breath, though
the inclusion of the wonderful ``I Got Rhythm'' Variations
compensates a bit.
</P>
<P>
   On the ``Classic Gershwin'' release, avoid Cleo Laine's phony
histrionics in ``Embraceable You'' and Jean-Pierre Rampal's silly
flute transcription of ``Liza.''
</P>
<P>
   JON PARELES:
</P>
<P>
   George Gershwin was a category scrambler: the composer who made
orchestras find blue notes, who spurred jazz composers to try
extended forms, who built an opera on African-American voices and
styles, and whose songs for Broadway and Hollywood musicals easily
escaped their original formats to become jazz standards.
</P>
<P>
   But his music hit a wall when rock arrived. It was identified
with the Tin Pan Alley style that rock set out to overthrow, and
with an adult sophistication that made rockers uncomfortable.
Maturing rock singers, like Linda Ronstadt and Sting, have turned
to standards in general and Gershwin in particular,
self-consciously imitating previous generations. But one Gershwin
song has been wholeheartedly taken up by rhythm-and-blues and rock:
``Summertime,'' the lullaby from ``Porgy and Bess.''
</P>
<P>
   It may not be Gershwin's best song _ no one has to make that
impossible choice _ but it turned out to be his most adaptable.
``Summertime'' suited rock's purposes with its relatively basic
harmony and for the way that, although it's not a 12-bar blues,
it's steeped in blues feeling. The song's built-in irony, the way
its optimistic lyrics are made wishful and uncertain by its minor
key, gives interpreters a pretext to play it sassy or sultry,
languid or filled with longing.
</P>
<P>
   Billie Holiday's version (on Columbia's ``Quintessential Billie
Holiday, Volume 2'') is a New Orleans-flavored stomp that has her
swaggering and growling. On Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong's
version of ``Porgy and Bess'' (Verve), she has a warm come-hither
tone while even his scat-singing seems tender and fatherly. John
Coltrane's version, on ``My Favorite Things'' (Rhino/Atlantic),
bends the song to his obsession, new at the time, with modal
scales, probing the harmonies with a breakneck solo that unites
be-bop, blues and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rockers have carried the song to new extremes. Janis Joplin's
version with Big Brother and the Holding Company on ``Cheap
Thrills'' (Columbia) breaks through the band's shaky,
semi-classical arrangement with a voice of pure tragedy, unable to
believe any of the reassurance in the lyrics. Billy Stewart's
rhythm-and-blues hit version (on Chess) from 1966 has a nutty
exuberance, with stretched-out rolled S's and gospel leaps. Al
Green, on ``Green Is Blues'' (Hi), turns the song into a slow
seduction, squeezing out the notes for a long, steamy summer night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Summertime'' shows up twice on the new ``Red Hot and
Rhapsody'' (Antilles), a benefit album (for AIDS research) of
Gershwin interpretations by rock, hip-hop and jazz musicians.
Morcheeba, a trip-hop group, and the flutist Hubert Laws approach
the song in breathy slow motion, coyly making a switch: now mama's
rich and daddy's good-looking.
</P>
<P>
   And the soul singer Bobby Womack, collaborating with the backup
band from the Roots, rasps through ``Summertime'' as chattering
down-home funk. Both versions are a little gimmicky, but they're
signs that ``Summertime'' could last for many seasons more.
</P>
<P>
   PAUL GRIFFITHS:
</P>
<P>
   My favorite Gershwin record is no longer available. It was an
album of numbers by George and Ira Gershwin recorded in the early
1970s by a third member of the family, their sister, Frances. She
brought a refreshing simplicity to their songs. With just a piano
to accompany her, she made most other singers sound vulgar. She had
style, and she had grace. But there we go.
</P>
<P>
   Of what remains in the catalog, the Glyndebourne Festival
Opera's ``Porgy and Bess,'' recorded by EMI in 1989, is
outstanding. The recording was made after a run of performances in
the theater, and the sound is still hot with stage excitement. In
the title roles, Willard White and Cynthia Hamon are proud and
wonderful, and there are no weak members in the supporting cast.
Simon Rattle conducts the London Philharmonic with a rare balance
of aptitudes. He seems to love every detail in the score, which he
delivers as brilliantly as if it were by Ravel, but he can also
swing and swoon.
</P>
<P>
   Gershwin's other ``classical'' compositions are forgettable. I
would give ``An American in Paris,'' the Piano Concerto in F and
all the other orchestral pieces for just the three minutes of ``I
Got Rhythm'' _ especially as sung by Judy Garland in 1943 with
bewitching humor and confidence in her voice. Her recording is a
highlight of ``George Gershwin: 'S Wonderful: The Great Decca
Songbook,'' a fascinating and diverse collection of tracks from the
quarter-century after Gershwin's death, re-released on MCA for the
centenary of his birth.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the items here are cheerfully hideous (the Andrews
Sisters' ``Nice Work if You Can Get It'') and some have a sort of
camp appeal (``Embraceable You'' with Helen O'Connell and the Jimmy
Dorsey Orchestra), but some are marvelous: the Garland
contribution, Louis Armstrong's ``Love Walked In,'' Connee
Boswell's ``Soon,'' Peggy Lee's ``Somebody Loves Me,'' Jeri
Southern's ``Someone to Watch Over Me.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a similar mix of the ugly, the bad and the good on
``George Gershwin: The Ultimate Collection,'' a London compilation
of older recordings, most from the 1950s. Some of the same artists
are represented _ Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday, whose ``They
Can't Take That Away From Me'' is cut with experience _ but there
are no direct overlaps.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from Holiday, other singers who excel here are Blossom
Dearie (``Someone to Watch Over Me'' in her faux-naif style), Nina
Simone (``I Loves You, Porgy'' done with a fabulous command of
microtonal slides), Anita O'Day (a smoky, joyous ``Who Cares?'')
and Dinah Washington (``I've Got a Crush on You''). This is a
two-disk album, but you can throw away the second, which features
orchestral pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The composer himself should also be heard. ``Gershwin Plays
Gershwin: The Piano Rolls,'' an Elektra Nonesuch release, offers
several of his piano rolls, realized by Artis Wodehouse on a Yamaha
Disklavier. Some early and unfamiliar songs are included, along
with ``Rhapsody in Blue,'' all proving that Gershwin's musicianship
was unaffected and dapper, not unlike his sister's.
</P>
<P>
   STEPHEN HOLDEN:
</P>
<P>
   Among the eight classic songbook albums Ella Fitzgerald recorded
for Verve in the 1950s and '60s, ``Ella Fitzgerald Sings the George
and Ira Gershwin Songbook,'' released in 1959, towers above the
rest, not only for its length (nearly three hours) but for its
perfect match of singer, songwriters and arranger (Nelson Riddle).
</P>
<P>
   The slightly impersonal quality of Ira Gershwin's lyrics matches
the singing style of a jazz-pop classicist who never overtly
personalized lyrics. Ms. Fitzgerald's readings of 53 Gershwin songs
are models of musical clarity, balance and emotional restraint; the
breathtaking beauty, warmth and naturalness of her singing infuses
the songs with a radiant optimism and sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   Riddle's arrangements fall into two types: elegantly
orchestrated ballads with a light swing pulse, and mid-tempo
big-band swing, sometimes embellished with strings. The readings of
``But Not for Me,'' ``The Man I Love,'' ``Love Walked In,''
``Embraceable You,'' ``They All Laughed,'' ``A Foggy Day'' and
``They Can't Take That Away From Me,'' among many others, are close
to definitive, with the meltingly wistful ``Embraceable You'' the
collection's exquisite peak.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as impressive is Sarah Vaughan's ``Gershwin Live!'' (Sony
Music ), recorded in 1982 with Michael Tilson Thomas conducting the
Los Angeles Philharmonic. The most operatic of jazz singers,
Vaughan curls her dark luscious contralto with its husky baritone
edges around songs from ``Porgy and Bess'' and gives the ``The Man
I Love'' a genre-bending treatment that begins with semi-operatic
wordless vocals and builds into a powerhouse scat solo. In her
playfully sexy, growling version of ``Do It Again,'' she lives up
to her nickname, ``Sassy.'' Marty Paich provided the semi-classical
arrangements.

COHEN SAYS US DEFENSE READINESS STRESSED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The defense secretary, William S. Cohen, cautioned
Thursday that US military readiness is ``fraying at the edges'' and
could ``turn into a tear'' without additional money for the
Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, speaking at a breakfast meeting of the Boston-area
Chamber of Commerce, said the armed forces have long grappled with
the problem of attracting and retaining capable and well-educated
recruits to operate increasingly sophisticated equipment and
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   And, joking that the business-people in his audience were
hurting the military's efforts, he said the nation's robust economy
makes it even more difficult to lure ``the best and the brightest''
into uniform because their job prospects are so good in the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
   The personnel issue is growing into a tough, persistent one for
the Pentagon. Cohen said, for instance, that the Navy will fall
short of its recruitment goals this year. And he said various
branches of the military already are taking money out of
procurement and putting it into readiness _ that is, taking steps
to upgrade compensation, medical benefits, educational
opportunities, and make other quality-of-life improvements designed
to keep troops happy and prepared for action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing some fraying at the edges,'' Cohen said Thursday,
adding that he did not think any alarm bells needed to sound yet.
``The danger is that the fraying will spread and turn into a
tear.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's comments represented a brief public airing of an
argument he and the Joint Chiefs of Staff have been making
privately to President Clinton: that the time has come to halt the
13-year decline in Pentagon budgets. News reports said military
leaders told Clinton this week that, unless some major programs or
overseas deployments are cut, their $250 billion budget may need an
extra $15 billion annually for several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to maintain that role,'' Cohen said of this
country's status as the world's sole superpower, ``are we willing
to pay the price for it?''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's avowed desire to stop pulling money from weapons
programs was welcome news for Dennis J. Picard, chairman and chief
executive officer of Raytheon Co., the nation's third-largest
defense contractor, based in Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to hear that,'' Picard said. ``I think he'll work
hard to get a bigger budget this year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What they've been doing is taking money out of procurement
budgets, and that's what killed us,'' Picard said, referring to the
massive defense cutbacks that forced Ray-theon and other companies
to lay off thousands of workers in the early 1990s.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Maureen McGovern's tasty album ``Naughty Baby: Maureen McGovern
Sings Gershwin'' (Sony Music ) was recorded before an audience in a
studio in 1988 with a first-rate jazz-pop quintet. Many familiar
standards are given careful but expressive readings that range in
style from straight pop (``How Long Has This Been Going On?'') to
jazzy coloratura (``Little Jazz Bird'') to the semi-operatic
(``Summertime''). The album's title song, a flirtatious gem, is a
little-known number from the obscure Gershwin show ``Primrose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris Connor Sings the George Gershwin Almanac of Song''
(Rhino) is a far-ranging two-disk survey that includes 36 songs
recorded in the late 1950s and early '60s with six different,
mostly excellent small jazz groups. Ms. Connor's dreamy,
lost-in-a-fog style may not seem the ideal instrument to interpret
Gershwin's largely sunny music. But her cocktail languor has always
had a strong swinging undertow.
</P>
<P>
   The best anthology of Gershwin standards presented in their
original theatrical settings is ``George and Ira Gershwin:
Standards and Gems'' (Nonesuch/Roxbury), a just-released collection
of songs, many extracted from Nonesuch albums of five Gershwin
musicals (``Girl Crazy,'' ``Strike Up the Band,'' ``Lady, Be
Good!,'' ``Pardon My English'' and ``Oh, Kay!'') reconstructed with
their original orchestrations. In keeping with the period, the
tempos are faster and the spirit of the music perkier than on later
collections. The performances by Audra McDonald (``How Long Has
This Been Going On?''), Dawn Upshaw (``Someone to Watch Over Me'')
and Judy Blazer (``But Not for Me''), among others, are as
impeccable as they are effervescent.
</P>
<P>
   ALLAN KOZINN:
</P>
<P>
   Because Gershwin lived into the age of radio and recording, and
because he was an eloquent pianist, listeners curious to hear his
thoughts on his own music are in luck. ``Gershwin Performs
Gershwin'' (Musicmasters) includes two installments of NBC's 1934
``Music by Gershwin'' radio show and a 1932 appearance on Rudy
Vallee's ``Fleischmann Hour.''
</P>
<P>
   In these extraordinary period pieces _ even the commercials and
melodramatic opening announcements are preserved _ Gershwin offers
anecdotes about his songs, jokes with Vallee, plays several works
on the piano (including the ``Fascinating Rhythm'' and ``Liza''
Variations) and oversees orchestral performances of others.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the disk are revelatory rehearsal recordings of his
``Second Rhapsody'' (1931) and selections from ``Porgy and Bess''
(1935), with Gershwin conducting from the keyboard and, in the case
of ``Porgy,'' directing singers from the original cast. Both were
works in progress, and they were altered in small but noticeable
ways between these recordings and the final versions.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, there is surface noise from the original
transcription disks on these recordings, but one can also hear
Gershwin perform, more or less, in thoroughly modern digital sound.
Using his 1920s-vintage piano rolls and a computerized reproducing
piano that allows for greater subtlety than old-fashioned player
pianos, Artis Wodehouse has prepared several ``Gershwin Plays
Gershwin'' disks.
</P>
<P>
   The most compelling is the first volume (Nonesuch), which
includes solo piano arrangements of ``Rhapsody in Blue,'' ``An
American in Paris'' and an appealing selection of songs.
</P>
<P>
   There are several ``Porgy and Bess'' recordings to choose from,
but none is more compellingly sung and beautifully played than the
first complete version, released by Columbia in 1951 and just
reissued as part of Sony Classical's superb Heritage series. The
chemistry between Lawrence Winters' Porgy and Camilla Williams'
Bess is electrifying, and the other singers _ Inez Matthews as
Serena, June McMechen as Clara, Warren Coleman as a blustery Crown
and Avon Long as a wonderfully oily Sportin' Life _ offer vivid
characterizations that make Catfish Row come alive.
</P>
<P>
   The young American conductor and pianist Andrew Litton has
recorded several Gershwin disks and has a good sense of what makes
the orchestral works swing. On ``Dayful of Song'' (Delos), he leads
the Dallas Symphony Orchestra in several favorites _ ``Rhapsody in
Blue,'' ``An American in Paris,'' ``Cuban Overture'' and the
``Promenade'' _ as well as the graceful ``Lullaby,'' an early,
rarely heard piece. But the main attraction is the title track, a
12-minute suite of unknown but stylistically unmistakable songs
found among Gershwin's manuscripts in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Singers of every stripe have long been partial to Gershwin, yet
choosing a single song collection is surprisingly easy: ``Ella
Fitzgerald Sings the George and Ira Gershwin Songbook'' (Verve) is
incomparable.
</P>
<P>
   Recorded in 1959, this survey of Gershwin's best theater songs
has everything. Fitzgerald's voice is exquisitely silken and at its
most flexible, and her phrasing infallibly illuminates the
singularity of spirit captured in George's music and Ira's lyrics.
Nelson Riddle's lush arrangements support it all brilliantly.
Verve's packaging is worthy of its contents; in addition to the
original five-LP set, this version includes a disk's worth of
outtakes and variants, as well as copious notes and complete
discographical information.
</P>
<P>
   JAMES R. OESTREICH:
</P>
<P>
   As so often, first impressions are crucial. For a listener
immersed in jazz and just discovering classical music in young
adulthood, Gershwin came along at exactly the right time, in
Leonard Bernstein's late-'50s Columbia recording of ``Rhapsody in
Blue'' and ``An American in Paris'' with the New York Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   Although many slicker, hipper versions of both pieces have since
appeared, these performances, now in Sony Classical's ``Bernstein
Century'' series, still seem quintessentially right in the cocky
swagger imparted by pianist (also Bernstein), conductor and
orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Porgy and Bess'' arrived by a less orthodox route, in the
exquisite jazz stylings of Oscar Peterson and his trio, from 1959
(Verve). Without need of voice or words, these players sing most
eloquently, starting with the great bassist Ray Brown in a supple
account of ``I Got Plenty o' Nuttin'.'' The 40 minutes of music
hardly filled an LP, let alone a CD, yet they offer a rich
experience of the opera in all its variety, with ``Strawberry
Woman'' and ``Here Come de Honey Man'' as inspired punctuation, and
surely no one could feel cheated after hearing such a magnificent
outpouring of spirit.

<P>
   Those two building blocks left many gaps, which have since been
largely filled in, never more fascinatingly than in a release of
the Gershwin memorial concert of September 1937 at the Hollywood
Bowl, as broadcast on CBS Radio (North American Classics; two CDs).
</P>
<P>
   The music here ranges from ``Swanee,'' in Al Jolson's inimitable
rendition, vividly recalled from a musically oblivious childhood,
with no awareness that it was Gershwin, to the Second Prelude, with
Otto Klemperer conducting the Los Angeles Philharmonic in his own
orchestral arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Here, too, is the Concerto in F, played by Oscar Levant and
conducted by Charles Previn, a cousin of the latter-day Gershwinite
Andre Previn; ``They Can't Take That Away From Me,'' tenuously but,
oh, so stylishly sung by Fred Astaire, and ``Rhapsody in Blue,''
played and conducted by Jose Iturbi. Hardly less compelling from
this historical distance are the spoken tributes by George Jessel,
Oscar Hammerstein 2d and others.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the quaint material to which William Bolcom and Joan
Morris have turned their hands and voice, Gershwin has not
invariably made for the best chemistry. Still, their CD of Gershwin
piano music and songs (Nonesuch) offers small charms aplenty along
with essential Bolcom and Morris classics: ``Someone to Watch Over
Me,'' ``The Man I Love'' and ``Love Is Here to Stay.''
</P>
<P>
   But here is a gap: Revisiting all these splendid recordings, I
realized with a start that I didn't have my favorite Gershwin
rendition on record, though it still plays on the grooves of the
brain, remembered from nights at the late, lamented Carnegie
Tavern. Undoubtedly, Ellis Larkins' `` 'S Wonderful'' exists on CD,
though a quick canvass of New York stores failed to turn it up.
</P>
<P>
   Larkins can be heard, more or less, with Ella Fitzgerald on
``Pure Ella'' (Decca), with its nine tracks of Gershwin. The purer
Larkins experience is available on ``Ellis Larkins at Maybeck''
(Concord Jazz), but with only one track of Gershwin, ``Oh, Lady, Be
Good!'' Back to the search.
</P>
<P>
   BEN RATLIFF:
</P>
<P>
   I'm avoiding some of the most obvious jazz versions of Gershwin,
not only because they've been so thoroughly analyzed and celebrated
(from Gunther Schuller's diagrammatic reading, in his book ``The
Swing Era,'' of Lester Young's ``Oh, Lady Be Good!'' solo to the
deep knowledge of the millions who own Ella Fitzgerald's Gershwin
songbook or the Miles Davis-Gil Evans treatment of ``Porgy and
Bess''), but also because I can barely hear them anymore, so cooled
and hardened are their meanings.
</P>
<P>
   All these recordings, however, seem to resist rigidification.
</P>
<P>
   Joao Gilberto's `` 'S Wonderful,'' from ``Amoroso'' (Warner
Brothers/WEA, 1977), is not jazz. But in a completely introverted
reading of an exultant lyric, surrounded by a string orchestra and
a samba rhythm that only exaggerates his impenetrable solitude, in
English that sounds as if he learned the words phonetically,
Gilberto made the most alarmingly romantic moment I can think of in
popular music.
</P>
<P>
   Also noteworthy is the recording by Ella Fitzgerald and Louis
Armstrong of ``They Can't Take That Away From Me,'' from ``Ella and
Louis'' (Verve/Polygram, 1956). The vast difference between their
voices, deep and froggy versus high and clear, as the lyrics
ping-pong back and forth, make the album, and everything else they
did together, weirdly fascinating. As a mismatched but somehow
just-right duo, they're almost too real, and they keep breaking
through the screen of show business glibness. Here, in particular,
they own the song; it remains touching on the thousandth listen,
and it's pop that's completely at ease with itself.
</P>
<P>
   Thelonious Monk's ``Nice Work If You Can Get It,'' from ``Genius
of Modern Music, Volume 1'' (Blue Note/Capitol, 1947), opens with
an aggressive, gapped snare-drum volley from Art Blakey; this
brilliant three-minute flash is a neat compromise from Monk, a
pianist who didn't bother much with other people's music. On the
theme, he respects the rhythmic shape of the original; on the solo
choruses, he hangs as loose as he ever did.
</P>
<P>
   Billie Holiday's ``I Loves You, Porgy'' (Decca, 1948, from
``Lady's Decca Years,'' Volume 2) is an intimate, chorusless
version of the song that boils down to one line, ``Don't let him
handle me with his hot hands.'' Try to listen to the shapely honk
of Holiday's voice singing those words without feeling fascination
and revulsion about those hands.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the title track from Sonny Rollins' 1962 album
``The Bridge'' (RCA). Of all the jazz tunes that borrowed the chord
changes from ``I Got Rhythm'' _ Rollins himself wrote ``Oleo,''
probably the most diabolical _ this one may be the most
unduplicable. With two-bar insertions that chop up the rhythm, and
both Rollins and the guitarist Jim Hall playing at a frenetic pace,
it's a weird exercise that hangs together.
</P>
<P>
   ANTHONY TOMMASINI:
</P>
<P>
   ``Porgy and Bess,'' though a subtle and sophisticated opera, has
always been claimed by nonoperatic singers. And rightly so, for its
music is imbued with the vernacular speech and soulful vitality of
the great American musical theater tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the recording that moves me the most is the classic 1963
account of highlights with a fine cast topped by Leontyne Price and
William Warfield (RCA Victor). The acclaimed 1953 revival of
``Porgy and Bess'' conducted by Alexander Smallens, who had
presided over its 1935 premiere, brought the young Ms. Price to
international attention, and her singing here is thrilling, earthy
and deeply moving.
</P>
<P>
   True, her less than clear diction does not do wonders for Ira
Gershwin's lyrics. But, ravished by her impassioned voice, you
won't care. Warfield is a compelling Porgy. And John W. Bubbles,
the vaudeville veteran who created the role of Sportin' Life,
repeats it here memorably.

GROUP WARNS ABOUT CAMPUS CREDIT CARD OFFERS

<P>
   Instead of giving out free T-shirts, chocolates, or mugs to lure
new customers, banks peddling credit cards on campuses ought to be
handing out brochures about responsible debt, officials from a
consumer advocacy group said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group said its
national study of 1,260 undergraduates at 15 campuses found that
students who acquire credit cards from on-campus marketers are more
likely to carry larger balances and acquire more cards than those
who get them through other means.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students, especially those who fill out credit card
applications at campus tables in return for trinkets and candy, run
the risk of falling into the campus credit card trap,'' said
Deirdre Cummings, consumer program director for MassPIRG, at a
press conference at the University of Massachusetts at Boston
campus.
</P>
<P>
   Calling for curbs on the use of gifts as enticements, Cummings
said banks zealously market to young adults in hopes of winning
lifetime loyalty through this first-time credit card. Yet college
students, many without jobs, often can't handle the debt.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, ``The Campus Credit Card Trap,''
students responsible for their own cards who obtained them through
an application made on campus had an average unpaid balance of
$1,039. This compares to $854 for those who obtained their cards by
applying another way.
</P>
<P>
   Those who applied on-campus also had an average of 2.6 cards,
compared with 2.1 cards for those who applied outside of school.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings said other studies that have painted a brighter picture
of students' ability to handle debt, such as one recently by the
Institute for Higher Education Policy, fail to distinguish between
students who rely on parents to pay the bills and those who are
responsible for their own cards.
</P>
<P>
   At UMass-Boston, a marketer for Associates National Bank of
Delaware stood inside a student building with free T-shirts,
calling cards, and a thesaurus for anyone who filled out the VISA
application. The card comes with a variable annual percentage rate,
which this month would be about 17.99.
</P>
<P>
   At the bank's headquarters in Irving, Texas, spokesman Joe
Stroop said the bank recruits students hoping they will become
long-term customers when their earning power grows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not because we make a ton of money on students, because
we don't,'' he said. ``It's an investment in the future of the
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   MassPIRG called on colleges to consider a ban on on-campus card
marketers, and to provide more education about debt. It also called
into question some banks' practice of paying colleges a fee based
on the number of applications completed, giving the schools an
incentive to encourage sign-ups.
</P>
<P>
   College policies vary. Northeastern University bars credit card
marketers from academic buildings and student centers, while Boston
University allows them at some student buildings in return for a
fixed fee, said school officials. UMass-Boston dean of students
Stephanie Janey said it is considering revisions to rules that
currently allow on-campus credit card marketers under a variety of
financial arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   At many colleges, marketers skirt rules by setting up shop on
public sidewalks near the school.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Mara, 20, a UMass Boston student, said credit card marketers
are seductive. Wearing a Citibank T-shirt he was given this week
for applying for his third card, he acknowledged he already has two
cards with a total unpaid balance of $3,800. ``These giveaways of
T-shirts and gifts do influence students,'' he said.

<P>
   On the other hand, I can't do without the selections from the
opera recorded in 1958 by Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong, with
orchestrations by Russell Garcia, who conducts (``The Complete Ella
Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong on Verve,'' three disks). Fitzgerald
may not be sufficiently operatic for some, but she is a sublime
vocalist and incomparable artist. And Armstrong, with his sandpaper
voice, very nearly outsings her, at least in terms of inflection,
swing and feeling.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 Pearl Records released an invaluable two-disk set,
``George Gershwin Plays George Gershwin,'' which fortunately is
still available. Most noteworthy are two versions of the composer
as soloist in the ``Rhapsody in Blue'' with the Paul Whiteman
concert orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   The second version, from 1927, recorded electronically, offers
better acoustics than the first, from 1924. But the earlier version
better captures Gershwin's restless, vibrant and wonderfully
capricious playing.
</P>
<P>
   The collection also offers the composer in some fabulous solo
performances, and excerpts from ``Porgy'' with the great opera
singers Lawrence Tibbett and Helen Jepson. These pieces were
conducted by Smallens under Gershwin's supervision, and recorded in
1936 in the aftermath of the premiere. But my favorite tracks are
several songs with Fred and Adele Astaire from the 1920s. The
consensus on Fred Astaire as a singer holds that his urbane style
makes up for his limited voice. But the way the man bends a phrase,
puts a spin on words and colors his tone is great singing in my
book.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I recommend the conductor Michael Tilson Thomas' perky
and loving CBS recordings of the 1930s musicals ``Let 'Em Eat
Cake'' and ``Of Thee I Sing'' on two disks. The casts are
wonderful, with Maureen McGovern, Larry Kert, Jack Gilford and
other Broadway veterans. And the Orchestra of St. Luke's plays like
some zippy yet elegant pit band. ``Of Thee I Sing'' miraculously
manages to be at one joyous and cynical: a show about a
presidential candidate and his handlers who stir the public with a
campaign theme of love, something that ``everyone is interested
in'' but ``doesn't matter a damn.'' It eerily anticipates ``I feel
your pain.''

   Another Claim Upon `Rent'
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With last week's news that the estate of ``Rent''
author Jonathan Larson had reached an out-of-court settlement with
dramaturge Lynn Thomson over her claims of partial authorship of
the Broadway musical, the squabble that dogged the show seemed to
be over. But a forthcoming book may reopen the issue.
</P>
<P>
   In her book, ``Stagestruck: Theater, AIDS and the Marketing of
Gay America,'' Sarah Schulman, a novelist and playwright, contends
that ``Rent,'' based on Puccini's opera ``La Boheme,'' also
contains characters and scenes plagiarized from her 1990 novel,
``People in Trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the similarities she cites are a love triangle among a man
and two women, and an interracial gay couple in which one man dies
of AIDS. Ms. Schulman also says Larson lifted a pivotal moment in
the end of the musical's first act when a performance artist's song
precipitates a riot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically `Rent' had two plots: the straight half was from
Puccini, and the gay half was from me,'' Ms. Schulman writes.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Harris, a lawyer for the Larson family, said that Larson,
who died in 1996, had read Ms. Schulman's book and that there were
some ``minor similarities.'' But rejecting any suggestion of
plagiarism, he said the parallels were coincidental. ``She didn't
invent AIDS or gay people or triangular relationships or
protests,'' Harris said. ``She's just trying to sell her book.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schulman said in an interview that she considered legal
action several times but was afraid of professional repercussions.
She added that she was not publicizing her suspicions about
``Rent'' to make money but to show ``how AIDS is being represented
in the culture of America.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is to be published in October by Duke University Press.
</P>
<P>
   A Guare Trilogy
</P>
<P>
   Publicity agents and producers guard details of a theater
company's season like nuclear arms codes. But leave it to John
Guare to drop a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, when the Signature Theater Company, which devotes
each season to a single writer, officially welcomed Guare, this
year's playwright, he casually announced that his season would end
with three full-length plays known as the ``Lydie Breeze'' series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess John kind of made the announcement for us,'' said
James Houghton, the Signature's artistic director. He said the
troupe would stage the three plays _ including ``The Book of
Judith,'' just completed _ in repertory, starting March 18,
contingent on approval by Actors' Equity of a repertory contract.
</P>
<P>
   The plays tell the story of a young woman, Lydie Breeze, and a
group of idealistic friends, from the Civil War to the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim is crazy, wanting to do three plays,'' an excited Guare
said. ``But I love him for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Center Man Now
</P>
<P>
   Ask Robert Sella how he's feeling lately, and this is what he
says: ``I'm thrilled.'' A pause. ``Or is it terrified?'' He can be
forgiven for being a little confused. After all, in the course of
less than a week, Sella has gone from playing the sensitive
narrator in ``Side Man'' to portraying the raunchy M.C. in
``Cabaret.'' Gone are the high-tops; here come the combat boots.
Goodbye, black hair; hello, blond.
</P>
<P>
   It has not been a bump-free transition; his debut was delayed
for two days after several rehearsals had to be rescheduled. Then
there were the psychic adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really hit home the other day in rehearsal, when I finished
a song and was standing upstage left,'' he said. ``The
choreographer was like, `You're supposed to be dead center.' I
thought, `Wow.' I'd never think to stand dead center in `Side
Man.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sella, 36, said the thought of replacing Alan Cumming, who won a
Tony in the role and is taking a two-month leave, was daunting.
</P>
<P>
   But when he saw the understudy, Vance Avery, play the role on
Tuesday, he was reassured. ``They lapped him up like cream,'' Sella
said. ``They didn't want their money back.''
</P>
<P>
   By the Book
</P>
<P>
   As the season develops, it seems the nation's stages are going
to be filled by writers whose work is most commonly found on
bookshelves.
</P>
<P>
   The first is U.S. Poet Laureate Robert Pinsky, who has adapted
his acclaimed translation of Dante's ``Inferno'' for a two-week run
at the 92nd Street Y beginning Sept. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Next up is Reynolds Price, winner of the 1986 National Book
Critics Circle Award for his novel ``Kate Vaiden.'' In October, the
Mint Theater will present the New York premiere of his trilogy,

   In February, ``The Cider House Rules,'' Peter Parnell's
adaptation of John Irving's epic 1985 novel, will begin
performances at the Atlantic Theater Company. The six-hour piece,
currently at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, was conceived and
directed by Tom Hulce and Jane Jones. At the Atlantic, the play
will most likely be performed over two nights, said Neil Pepe, the
company's artistic director. ``Or maybe three,'' he said with a
laugh.

<P>
   In Cambridge, Mass., Don DeLillo's second play, ``Valparaiso,''
will open in January at American Repertory Theater. The work is
described as the story of a man who arrives in a strange land, only
to be besieged by requests for interviews. (DeLillo declined a
request for comment.)

   In April, the theater will stage ``Charlie in the House of
Rue,'' by the novelist Robert Coover.
</P>

   ``In Europe it used to be you couldn't be considered a
philosopher until you'd written a play,'' said Robert Brustein,
artistic director of American Repertory. ``Maybe Americans are just
catching up.''

   A Hot Ticket
</P>
<P>
   LaMama Annex, on East Fourth Street in the East Village, was
unveiled on Tuesday after a yearlong, $3 million renovation. The
opening came off in typical off-off-Broadway style: the paint was
still wet, the programs were still being folded, and the air
conditioning broke down a few hours before the start of the
premiere show, ``Kwaidan.'' But the audience didn't seem to mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gentlemen are invited to take off their jackets if they
please,'' said LaMama's founder, Ellen Stewart, sweating. ``Ladies,
too.''

 &HT;    PUBLIC COMMENTS INVITED ON PLAN TO LIMIT ANIMAL WASTE RUNOFF
 &HT;    With WASTE-BOX
 &HT;    By Eunice Moscoso
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Farmers, ranchers and environmental activists will
have a chance to scrutinize and comment on a plan to set new
guidelines for dealing with the controversial issue of animal waste
from hog, cattle, dairy and poultry operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a customer-driven strategy,'' said Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman. ``Comments from the public are essential to
shaping it.''
</P>
<P>
   Glickman and Environmental Protection Agency administrator Carol
Browner announced this week a new plan that would require the
nation's largest livestock operators to develop detailed plans to
store animal waste.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy includes a three-month period of public input,
which begins immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The long-anticipated joint plan between the EPA and the
Agriculture Department is a response to growing concern that the
nation's 1.4 billion tons of animal waste have become an
environmental hazard. Manure from livestock and poultry operations
has been blamed for pollution of streams and lakes, fish kills,
oxygen depletion in fisheries and dangerous bacteria outbreaks such
as the deadly toxin pfiesteria.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 of the largest
livestock operations would be required to have plans that detail
how manure will be collected and stored, as well as how waste might
be applied to fields as fertilizers. Owners would have to keep
records and test soil regularly to ensure no excess buildup of
nutrients that might pollute nearby waterways.
</P>
<P>
   Under current federal laws, large livestock farms are prohibited
from discharging waste directly into rivers and streams, but the
rules do not require steps to keep waste from being washed off
farmland by rain.
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy also includes encouraging tens of thousands of
smaller farms and animal feeding operations to voluntarily adopt
similar plans by providing information as well as technical and
limited financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to have all feeding operations on board by 2008.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmental groups say they expected a much stronger plan
from EPA and are disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that voluntary compliance is just a joke,'' said
Michelle Nowlin of the Southern Environmental Law Center. ``This is
not an industry that responds well to coaxing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Nowlin said the administration's strategy has ``the
right elements'' and ``is a good first start,'' she said it
outlines a 10-year implementation period for a problem that needs
immediate action. ``That's just a disastrously long time frame.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the livestock and poultry industries
generally expressed support for the new guidelines although they
would prefer no more federal regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Lobb, with the National Broiler Council, said he was
pleased to see the strategy contained some funding sources, such as
federal and state aid and loan programs, to help owners comply with
new regulations. In addition, he said he was pleased to see a
``unified view'' between EPA and the Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tension between the two agencies has been at the heart of the
effort to further regulate animal waste. Many farmers feel the
USDA's role has been solving and correcting problems on farms while
EPA's role has been enforcing environmental regulations against
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had been going off in different directions,'' Lobb said.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers and livestock operators are also relieved that the
administration's attempt to deal with the animal waste issue is far
less severe than other efforts on Capitol Hill. Congress is
considering a bill, introduced by Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, that
would mandate tens of thousands of smaller farms to comply with new
federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   EPA's Browner said the administration's plan is ``the most
aggressive strategy ever proposed to address this problem and
protect our nation's rivers.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or
noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York
City. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE AVENGERS,'' starring Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes.
Directed by Jeremiah Chechik (PG, 100 minutes). Sometimes major
movie studios should be afraid to screen expensive fiascoes for the
press, but they go ahead anyway. ``The Avengers'' is Warner
Brothers' would-be blockbuster that actually had its light hidden
beneath a bushel until opening day, and no wonder. With
pseudo-suave repartee that would make Austin Powers blush and with
so many shades of ``Howard the Duck'' that one scene depicts
man-size pastel teddy bears sitting around a conference table, it's
a film to gall fans of the old television series and perplex anyone
else. I can't remember another Friday morning show where I heard
actual cries of ``Ugh!'' on the way out the door (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``BLADE,'' starring Wesley Snipes and Stephen Dorff. Directed by
Stephen Norrington (R, 120 minutes). Vampires are plotting to take
over the world, and the only person who can save the planet is a
vampiric half-human superhero named Blade. So much fake blood
drips, gushes, explodes and congeals in this hyperkinetic
science-fiction horror film adapted from a popular comic book that
there's barely a scene that isn't drenched in red. Snipes' Blade is
a low-rent Arnold Schwarzenegger imitation dressed in a ludicrous
mixture of black leather and what look like car seat belts. There's
lots of morphing and Hong Kong action movie-style acrobatics. Dorff
is the bratty leader of the young vampire rebels. The visuals are
garish, the acting wretched (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``DANCE WITH ME,'' starring Vanessa L. Williams, Chayanne and
Kris Kristofferson (PG, 126 minutes). A likable mess of a movie,
``Dance With Me'' wants to be the ``Saturday Night Fever'' of salsa
dancing, and in the smoldering-eyed young Puerto Rican star
Chayanne it has found a charismatic Latino answer to John Travolta.
But the story of an ambitious young Cuban who works in a Houston
dance studio run by a man who may or may not be his biological
father ( Kristofferson) meanders so much that the movie never
gathers dramatic momentum, and the dance sequences are hopelessly
choppy and poorly framed. Even a percolating Latin American score
and a winning performance by Ms. Williams as the object of
Chayanne's affection can't hold the pieces together (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``54,'' starring Ryan Phillippe, Salma Hayek, Neve Campbell and
Mike Myers. Directed by Mark Christopher (R, 89 minutes). Mark
Christopher's botched-up history of Studio 54, the notorious
late-'70s disco and celebrity hangout, should have been a depraved
Manhattan answer to ``Saturday Night Fever.'' Instead, it is a
juiceless mishmash that can't decide whether it's a nightclub
history, a comedy ( Myers' crude ``Saturday Night Live''-style
caricature of Steve Rubell) or a contemporary variation on the
fable of the prodigal son. Phillippe, playing a 19-year-old Jersey
City nobody who ascends from busboy to star bartender at the club,
does throw off an occasional spark. But the movie is so afraid to
confront the character's self-promoting bisexuality that he never
really comes alive (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``FIRELIGHT,'' starring Sophie Marceau and Stephen Dillane.
Written and directed by William Nicholson (R, 103 minutes). Stella
Dallas meets Jane Eyre in this high-toned Victorian-era
bodice-ripper about a beautiful Swiss governess (Ms. Marceau) who
is hired by a married English aristocrat to bear a child when his
wife is unable to conceive. Years later, she tracks him down and
becomes the governess to his spoiled young daughter, who doesn't
know that her teacher is also her biological mother. Using flash
cards, she tricks the intransigent little brat into learning to
read, among other good deeds. Ms. Marceau and Dillane strike
sparks, and the movie's canny mixture of sex and suds makes for
slick, low-grade ``Masterpiece Theater''-style entertainment
(Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``THE GOVERNESS,'' starring Minnie Driver and Tom Wilkinson.
Directed by Sandra Goldbacher (R, 114 minutes). It is the early
1840s, and Rosina (Ms. Driver), a headstrong young Sephardic Jewish
woman living in London, poses as a Gentile to get a job as a
governess for the Cavendish family on a remote Scottish island.
Falling in love with the skittish, devoutly Christian head of the
household (Tom Wilkinson), a gentleman inventor with whom she has a
stormy affair, she becomes his collaborator in the invention of
photography. The ravishingly handsome film works on several levels:
as a proto-feminist fable, a meditation on still photography and
its relation to real life, and a portrait of lovers whose religious
difference becomes an unbridgeable emotional gap. Ms. Driver holds
the picture with a solid performance that falls short of great
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``HOW STELLA GOT HER GROOVE BACK,'' starring Angela Bassett,
Taye Diggs and Whoopi Goldberg. Directed by Kevin Rodney Sullivan
(R, 99 minutes). This silly soft-core fantasy in which 40-year-old
Stella (Ms. Bassett) meets and falls in love with 20-year-old
Winston ( Diggs) while on vacation in Jamaica is part Caribbean
travel brochure (fly to Jamaica and meet the hunk of your dreams)
and part diluted Chippendales-in-the-Caribbean strip show floated
on a bathtub full of suds with some light comedy thrown in. Ms.
Bassett brings real fire to the role of a beautiful
divorced-with-one-son San Francisco stockbroker whose resistance to
romance is broken down in the tropics. But Diggs' nearly perfect
boyfriend is a vapid romance-novel fabrication. Ms. Goldberg
shamelessly stirs up the suds as Stella's raunchy best friend, who
is secretly dying of liver cancer (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``A MERRY WAR,'' starring Richard Grant and Helena Bonham
Carter. Directed by Robert Bierman (not rated, 101 minutes).
Skillfully adapted from George Orwell's satirical 1936 novel,
``Keep the Aspidistra Flying,'' the witty period piece, set in
1930s London, follows the descent into poverty of Gordon Comstock
(Grant), a successful London ad man who quits his copywriting job
to be a full-time poet. The subjects skewered include young artists
with delusions of grandeur and snobbish aristocrats with socialist
pretensions. Ms. Bonham Carter is Gordon's sweetheart who patiently
waits out a narcissistic seizure that Grant portrays with an
engaging comic buoyancy (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``NEXT STOP WONDERLAND,'' starring Hope Davis and Alan Gelfant.
Directed by Brad Anderson (R, 111 minutes). Will Erin (Ms. Davis),
an attractive, introspective night-shift nurse, and Alan (
Gelfant), a plumber and aspiring marine biologist who was obviously
meant for her, collide on the streets of Boston and live happily
ever after? The setup of this romantic comedy about dating in the
'90s may seem cliched, but the witty, beautifully acted and edited
film refreshes the genre with the acuteness of Anderson's
observations about people and middle-class urban life in general.
Ms. Davis creates a wonderfully complex portrait of an idealistic
introvert coping with loneliness, disappointment and pressures from
all sides, including (in the movie's funniest scenes) some ardently
self-centered suitors who answer a personal ad. A rich Brazilian
bossa-nova score gives the movie exactly the mood of bittersweet
longing (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``ROUNDERS,'' starring Matt Damon, Edward Norton, John Malkovich
and John Turturro. Directed by John Dahl (R, 120 minutes). Though
this tale of poker fever finally adds up to less than meets the
eye, what does meet the eye (and ear) is mischievously
entertaining. Inspired by Martin Scorsese's brand of irresistible
lowlife and aided by a splendid rogues' gallery of a cast, the
director of ``The Last Seduction'' takes his audience into a poker
demimonde of abundant color. As the actors make the most of
rascally roles ( Malkovich has a field day with a Russian accent),
the story leads to settings as varied as the Elks Hall in
Binghamton and a Russian Turkish bath. Dahl may not have new
thoughts on the gambler's life, but he makes this guided tour worth
the trip (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``SAVING PRIVATE RYAN,'' starring Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Tom
Sizemore, Jeremy Davies and Edward Burns. Directed by Steven
Spielberg (R, 168 minutes). Spielberg's soberly magnificent new
film is the finest war movie of our time. Turning back the clock to
restore passion and meaning to the genre, he works in a spirit of
urgent communication to look at war as if it had not been looked at
before. Tour-de-force battle scenes are frank without
sensationalism, and the same great storyteller who made you believe
there was an extraterrestrial hiding in the closet has made this an
irresistibly vibrant, gripping tale. Hanks continues to astonish
with admirable modesty, and the rest of the casting is comparably
inspired. As he did with ``Schindler's List,'' Spielberg has made a
landmark film of devastating power (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``SNAKE EYES,'' starring Nicolas Cage and Gary Sinise. Directed
by Brian De Palma (R, 99 minutes). An assassination, a fixed
heavyweight boxing bout and a perfectly timed hurricane named
Jezebel collide apocalyptically one night in Atlantic City, where
hellfire rains over a hotel and casino appropriately called the
Millennium. Here is where Rick Santoro ( Cage), the sleazy police
detective in charge of security, discovers that his best friend (
Sinise) could also be his nemesis and he has to make hard moral
choices. This entertaining pop fable, which recalls the director's
``Blow Out,'' isn't believable for a second, but it has a pulpy
energy that keeps on chugging (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY,'' starring Cameron Diaz, Ben
Stiller and Matt Dillon. Directed by Peter and Bobby Farrelly (R,
119 minutes). Sometimes Western civilization declines in
deliriously funny style. Hence this proudly obnoxious comedy is a
hoot in every sense, deserving a smidgen of disapproval and a whole
lot of helpless laughter. Set in motion by a prom, a crush and a
cruel, cruel zipper, this paean to low humor works ridiculously
well because it never stoops to being mean-spirited or (despite all
appearances) authentically inane. The principal cast is bright and
appealing, with Ms. Diaz at her most beautiful and blithe. Do note
that this film strives hard for something to offend everyone, and
that a tolerance for zit jokes is unfortunately required (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``WITHOUT LIMITS,'' starring Billy Crudup and Donald Sutherland.
Directed by Robert Towne (PG-13, 118 minutes). In telling the story
of the mercurial track star Steve Prefontaine, a screenwriter known
for enriching screenplays with unruly, unpredictable life creates a
surprisingly resonant portrait. Thanks to Crudup's charismatic
performance as a runner with the attitudes of a rock star, this can
be watched as one more sports film, complete with exciting race
sequences. But it's not truly about winning, losing or even playing
the game; instead, Towne considers the philosophical distance
between the brash Prefontaine and his formidable coach, Bill
Bowerman (expertly played by Sutherland). The film's wisdom lies in
its thoughtful way of balancing these two (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS,'' starring Jason Patric, Ben
Stiller, Aaron Eckhardt, Catherine Keener, Amy Brenneman and
Nastassja Kinski. Written and directed by Neil LaBute (R, 100
minutes). Three men obsessed with one another's sexual performance
are at the core of this second film from the director of ``In the
Company of Men.'' The new movie is so blunt at times, and so
unrelievedly talky and dark at others, that it cries out for the
velvet glove of ``Manhattan,'' a much more seductive film about
sexual opportunism and urbane cruelty. Yet even when LaBute's
material feels mannered or unremittingly sour, it sustains a
psychic ferocity that commands attention. The intricate web of
lies, failures and brutal revelations here is strong stuff, and
it's the work of an original filmmaker who takes no prisoners
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``CHINESE CINEMA 1933-1949.'' Cinematic rarities are in the
spotlight at the Walter Reade Theater, where the Film Society of
Lincoln Center is presenting a series devoted to Chinese films of
the 1930s and '40s. Although the country was engulfed in war during
much of that period, its filmmakers continued to create, but
domestic and international upheaval kept most of their work from
release abroad. This weekend, the series is highlighted by two
works by the naturalistic director Sun Yu. Saturday and Sunday
bring screenings of ``Volcano in the Blood'' (1932), about the lust
for revenge of a young man whose fiancee, a beautiful peasant, is
carried off to be the concubine of a local tyrant. Friday and
Saturday bring screenings of the director's ``Lights of 10,000
Homes'' (1949), about familial warfare in late '40s Shanghai. The
series continues through Sept. 25 at the Walter Reade, at Lincoln
Center. Tickets: $8.50; $5 for Film Society members and children
under 12; $4.50 for the elderly at weekday matinees. Information:
(212) 875-5600 (Lawrence Van Gelder).

<P>
   Having just built one new factory and expanded another, Chrysler
Corp. is cutting back on capital investment. AT&AMP;T has also shaved
its capital spending, but for a different reason: It purchased an
existing phone network, rather than spending the money to build a
new one. And Motorola Inc., its sales hurt by the Asian crisis, is
postponing investments in new factories and machinery, even going
so far as to halt construction of a massive $3 billion
semiconductor plant in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Capital spending, a pillar of the nation's strong economic
growth over the last three years, is beginning to fade. First
falling exports, then falling stock prices and now a slowdown in
capital spending are chipping away at the vigorous economy,
watering down growth in the second half of the year. Despite these
hits, the economy appears to be strong enough to stay out of
recession for now, thanks to robust consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is not falling apart,'' said David Wyss, chief
economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI, a data gathering and consulting
operation. ``What you are seeing is some evidence of a weakening in
capital spending, partly in response to Asia and partly because, in
most industries, we have already added as many new facilities as we
are likely to need for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Capital spending is the investment that companies and
individuals make in the machinery, equipment and buildings to
operate their businesses and make them more efficient. The
cumulative result is a more vigorous and productive economy. In the
1990s, robust capital spending has been a huge contributor to the
economy's overall growth, accounting for 25 percent of the total
expansion in output in this decade _ substantially more than in
either the 1970s or the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   While the fall-off in sales to Asia has played a significant
role in discouraging capital spending, a bigger obstacle _ one only
partly a result of the Asian downturn _ appears to be overcapacity.
In interviews with officials at 15 corporations, many said that
after having made huge investments in recent years to increase
production, they are pausing while sales catch up.
</P>
<P>
   Even without an outsized crisis like the one emanating from
Asia, corporate America normally goes through cycles of robust
capital spending followed by pullbacks. And more than seven years
into an economic expansion, this appears to be a time for pullback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we see that more demand is likely to occur, we are not
going to go into another cycle of capacity expansion,'' said Wynn
Van Bussman, the chief economist at Chrysler, which recently
completed a new engine factory in Detroit and expanded a
transmission factory. ``We don't expect sales in North America to
be higher in the next year or two than they already are this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Chrysler, Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. worries about overcapacity.
Even after closing 11 factories in the United States in recent
months, the company still has the capacity to manufacture more
jeans than it can sell in this country. So it is shifting money out
of its capital spending budget and into marketing. ``In the United
States in the next year, we will come close to doubling our
advertising and promotion budget,'' Clarence Grebey, a Levi Strauss
spokesman, said, ``and part of that is coming from capital
expenditure.''
</P>
<P>
   Capital spending at Motorola, the communications giant, has been
curtailed because of a worldwide downturn in semiconductor sales
and falling prices for these computer chips. The downturn is partly
a result of recessions in Asia and partly a result of overcapacity
domestically.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the balance of those reasons, Motorola's $4.5 billion
capital spending budget for this year, much of it earmarked for the
United States, has been slashed to $2.9 billion. Nearly half the
cutback involves semiconductor operations. Motorola announced on
Wednesday that while construction continues at a plant in Chandler,
Ariz., ground-breaking for another near Richmond, Va., scheduled
for next month, has been postponed _ ``until the market for
semiconductors justifies new construction,'' Scott Stevens, a
Motorola spokesman, said Thursday. ``Do I have any idea when that
will be? No. This is an unprecedented downturn, the worst in
semiconductor history.''
</P>
<P>
   The incipient pullback in capital spending is developing
rapidly. After having shot up at an annual rate of 16 percent from
January through June, the growth rate for capital outlays will
probably shrivel to 5 percent or 6 percent in the second half, some
forecasters say. That would subtract at least one-quarter of a
percentage point from the growth rate for the economy as a whole.
Even without the hit from capital spending, economic growth is
likely to be under 2 percent, as it was in the second quarter.
During that quarter, falling exports and excessive stockpiles of
unsold goods led to an overall slowdown and forced a variety of
cutbacks in production.
</P>
<P>
   Shrinking profits are also playing a role in corporate America's
decision to go easy on capital spending. And falling prices have
had their impact, particularly in such industries as steel, copper,
oil and agriculture. The Case Corp., for example, announced last
week that it was curtailing production of tractors and combines,
which are capital expenditures for farmers. The Phelps Dodge Co.
has responded to falling copper prices by cutting capital outlays
to less than $180 million in the second half from $280 million in
last year's first half.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ``The supply of copper and the demand for it are in pretty good
balance,'' Thomas Foster, a Phelps Dodge vice president, said.
``But we have seen lower copper prices for some time, and they
appear to be related to the perception that the Asian crisis will
precipitate a world slowdown. So we have not initiated new projects
at any of our plants.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, acquisitions have become a substitute for capital
spending. AT&AMP;T took this route. Rather than invest huge sums in
local lines to connect business customers to AT&AMP;T's long-distance
network, the company in July acquired Teleport Communications
Group, which already owns local networks in major cities. The
acquisition was a factor in AT&AMP;T's decision to hold capital
spending to $7 billion this year, roughly the same as last year _
after four years of rapidly rising investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without this purchase, we might have invested more to create
infrastructure,'' said Eileen Connolly, an AT&AMP;T spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Detailed economic data for the third quarter will not be
available until next month, but various statistics are signaling
the turn in capital spending. For example, spending on commercial
construction, particularly factories but also office buildings, has
begun to fall, the Commerce Department reports. Orders for
nondefense capital goods, which are most of the equipment and
machinery purchased by American companies, leveled off in the first
half, after having risen sharply in 1996 and 1997. And corporate
America is operating its productive facilities within the United
States at a relatively moderate 81.7 percent of full capacity,
which is slightly below the long-term average.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Purchasing Management, in a monthly
survey of American manufacturers, found that capital spending
projects currently in progress will take only 119 days on average
to complete _ down from 130 days last summer. The 119 days is the
lowest level in the nearly 11 years that the association has
compiled this statistic, suggesting that companies are
commissioning fewer new projects.
</P>
<P>
   The association also surveys companies in the service sector.
Although this survey lacks a specific question about capital
spending, answers to questions that are included give the strong
impression that service-sector companies are also cutting back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Capital spending at service companies is certainly not
increasing; at best it is flat,'' said Ralph Kaufman, a University
of Houston management professor who runs the service-sector survey.
</P>
<P>
   There are bright spots.
</P>
<P>
   Although Asian recessions have cut into Caterpillar Inc.'s sales
of earth movers and construction equipment, the company says it is
increasing capital spending anyway. ``We are moving into new
products,'' said Douglas R. Oberhelman, Caterpillar's chief
financial officer, ``including electric power generation from
diesel engines and the manufacture of very small combines and
tractors, which is a good business at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer spending, far and away the largest single outlay in the
American economy, is still quite strong, and that helps to sustain
capital investment, which in the second quarter reached $958
billion, adjusted for inflation, or roughly one-fifth of consumer
spending. Low interest rates have helped by encouraging store
purchases on credit and home building.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to brisk retail sales, Gap Inc. has set aside $700
million for capital spending this year, up from $450 million last
year _ earmarking most of the money for new Old Navy and Gap
stores. Federated Department Stores Inc. is similarly engaged in
store investment: $750 million a year over three years, but mainly
to remodel existing stores, not to expand the total number. Hotel
and theater construction is still robust, and so is investment in
fast-food restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy's International Inc., trying to catch up to the McDonald's
Corp. and Burger King, a unit of Grand Metropolitan PLC, says it
will add 675 new restaurants next year, mostly in the United
States, up from 550 openings this year. ``Ever since we opened our
first restaurant 30 years ago, experts have told us that the
hamburger restaurant market is oversaturated,'' Jack Lynch, a
Wendy's spokesman, said. ``Despite that warning, we now operate
4,600 restaurants in the United States and 600 more abroad. An
economic slowdown won't change our plans; we do fine in a
recession.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, these are exceptions. The Eastman Chemical Co. is more
the rule.
</P>
<P>
   When the Asian crisis struck, Eastman, which produces
ingredients for the manufacture of plastics, paint and other
coatings, was in the midst of an investment surge aimed at
expansion. The spending is winding down now, more quickly than
anticipated because of events in Asia, said Earnest J. Davenport
Jr., the chairman at Eastman. That is partly because foreign
chemical companies are shipping products to the United States they
can no longer sell in Asia, and that cuts into Eastman's sales
volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have delayed some planned projects in this country,'' Mr.
Davenport said, ``and we may delay others.''

BAYER AG TO BUY PARTS OF CHIRON AND CROMPTON &AMP; KNOWLES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Mass.)   (bl)  
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Bayer AG, the German drug and chemical giant that has
been shedding assets to focus on life sciences, will buy the
American diagnostics business of Chiron Corp. and a 50 percent
stake in the farm seed subsidiary of Crompton &AMP; Knowles Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In an announcement Thursday, Bayer also said it would raise
fresh financial resources for reorganization by selling to the
public up to 75 percent of Agfa-Gevaert, its imaging unit. Analysts
said the sale, which was expected and is scheduled for some time in
next year's second quarter, could bring as much as $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Bayer, Germany's No. 2 chemical company after Hoechst AG, is
shedding chemical businesses to focus on more profitable
activities, including health care and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreements announced Thursday, Bayer will pay $1.1
billion in cash for Chiron Diagnostics, which had sales of $587
million in 1997. Rolf Classon, head of Bayer's diagnostics unit,
said the deal would give Bayer ``a global customer base, know-how
and additional research capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   To improve its position in the expanding agricultural seed
business, Bayer also announced it would take a 50 percent stake in
a joint venture with Gustafson Inc., in a cash transaction whose
value was not disclosed. Gustafson, based in Plano, Texas, is a
unit of Uniroyal Chemical Co., a subsidiary of Compton &AMP; Knowles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bayer is clearly driving its life sciences business at the
expense of chemicals,'' said Tony Cox, an analyst with Dresdner
Kleinwort Benson in London.
</P>
<P>
   Bayer needs the drive. Last month, the company reported that its
second-quarter profits fell an unexpected 13.9 percent, to $486
million, mainly because of reorganization charges and weaker sales
in embattled Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's steps reflect efforts by Bayer to reposition itself
in two increasingly competitive businesses, agriculture and
diagnostics, following in the footsteps of big European rivals like
Novartis and Roche Holding of Switzerland and Rhone-Poulenc of
France.
</P>
<P>
   These giants have been scrambling to consolidate the industry by
buying up smaller companies. Earlier this year, for instance,
Roche, the world's No. 1 maker of diagnostic kits, acquired
Boehringer-Mannheim of Germany, a maker of diagnostic products, in
a deal worth $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Investors seemed pleased with Bayer's moves. Though the
Frankfurt DAX index slumped by nearly 5 percent, Bayer's share
price stood its ground at 65 marks, or $38.50. Shares of Chiron
rose 56.25 cents, to $17.4375, in Nasdaq trading. Crompton &AMP;
Knowles fell 81.25 cents, to $16.625, on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the potential for growth in the deal with
Gustafson was in the growing market for treating new genetically
engineered seed varieties to protect them against insects.
</P>
<P>
   Bayer, whose crop protection unit generated revenues last year
of $2.3 billion, boasts products like Imidacloprid, the No.
1-selling pesticide worldwide, which is used not only as an
insecticide spray but also to treat seeds before they go into the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   The joint venture, which will be built on Gustafson's existing
operations, will enable Bayer to market products in the United
States, Mexico and Canada, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the acquisition of Chiron, which is based in
Walpole, Mass., would help give Bayer the critical mass it needs
for its diagnostics business by bolstering sales of its diagnostics
products worldwide to about $2 billion next year. Michael Stone, an
analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in London, said that would
give Bayer about 10 percent of the $19-billion-a-year market for
diagnostic equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Bayer and Chiron fit well, he said. While Chiron is strong in
immunal testing and systems to detect hepatitis C and the human
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, Bayer excels in tests of urine for
conditions like diabetes. Geographically, Chiron focuses on the
United States, Britain and Japan, while Bayer is strongest in
Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   By divesting itself of Agfa, Bayer evidently hopes to give the
unit the mobility it needs to reinvest its profits and raise cash.
</P>
<P>
   Manfred Schneider, Bayer's chief executive, said Agfa would
obtain ``entrepreneurial independence and new financing options.''
In return, he said, Bayer will get ``greater room to maneuver, and
more resources to strengthen core businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Agfa is a market leader in commercial imaging and businesses
like graphic arts and medical imaging, which are becoming
increasingly competitive thanks to the development of digital and
chemical-free ways of printing images.

BOSNIAN SERBS, UNHAPPY IN SERB REPUBLIC, FEAR RETURN TO BOSNIA  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE O'CONNOR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VOJKOVICI, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ Not knowing what else to do, the
elderly Bosnian Serb widow just sat down on a rock beside a green
stagnant pool, in the middle of a field less than a mile from the
home that once was hers.
</P>
<P>
   Radojka Jovo, 71, frantically reviewed the red folder of
documents she had carried, along with a loaf of bread and about $4,
on the five-hour bus ride across the Bosnian Serb Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am desperate,'' she said. ``I hope these papers are enough
proof the home is mine. They say there is no money to pay my
pension. All I have is my home, over there.'' Her feet planted in
the part of Bosnia where the Serbian authorities now govern, her
hand pointed across the boundary to Muslim territory.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jovo, a refugee, made the trip home Thursday, but did not
try to reclaim her home. It was fear that stopped her.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what if I go there and the Muslims kill me?'' she said,
voicing the unfounded fear expressed by many Bosnian Serbs. ``So I
am here because there is no where else.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jovo, her hands trembling as she held up her eyeglasses to
look, once again, at the documents, seemed to be in the same
position as many of her fellow Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Deeply afraid of what could happen if they made serious efforts
to rejoin Bosnia, the country torn apart principally by their
leaders, the Bosnian Serbs are stuck with the Bosnian Serb
Republic, a desperately poor semi-autonomous statelet that Western
diplomats say has been run by incompetent and crooked officials.
</P>
<P>
   Voters have just elected a president who represents some of the
most extreme nationalist and corrupt forces at play here, according
to Western officials, who had supported a more moderate incumbent
by starting many aid projects and promising many more.
</P>
<P>
   The election results, still unofficial, stunned Western
diplomats, some of whom say the results show a profound failure of
their strategy to pull Bosnian Serbs away from their most
nationalistic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Jovo, who says she cannot survive in the Bosnian Serb
Republic but is too afraid to go to the other half of the country,
may have an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Serbs only have each other _ no one else cares,'' she said.
``And for Serbs, the Serb Republic is the only thing that will
protect us. It is more important that our leaders are strong than
that they are honest or good.''
</P>
<P>
   Though many Bosnians _ Serbs, Muslims, and Croats _ had begun to
move sharply away from the distrust and hate of the 1992-95 war,
the national elections last weekend seemed to revive the old,
deeply held fears among many of Bosnia's Serbs. And the most
nationalistic politicians played right to those fears.
</P>
<P>
   Nikola Poplasen, the man who seems to have defeated the West's
candidate, Biljana Plavsic, told voters that he would insure that
the Bosnian Serb Republic stayed strong and independent of both
Muslim influence and Western manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Radoslav Skrba, in his front yard where he keeps a
cow, chickens and pigs in order to eat, said the prospect of
continued poverty was not enough to make Serbs bow to the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West doesn't like us so much, not the Serb people,''
Skrba, 45, said. ``They support the Muslims, and they wouldn't care
at all what happened to us except they think this is a good place
for their companies to put up factories.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How is it that all these Western armies now have bases here?''
Skrba asked, referring to the bases of the NATO-led peace force
that helped stop the war. ``Could it be that it was their strategy
all along?''
</P>
<P>
   ``During the Communist time we were warned that the West wanted
to come here and now here they are,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Skrba, and his neighbors, thought that Western support of
President Plavsic failed because her indebtedness to the West for
its financial help was obvious and raised suspicions, but the
benefits were not evident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it got better for the people around Banja Luka,'' Slavko
Gavric said, referring to the city Mrs. Plavsic made her capital.
``But we didn't see any improvement here.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Muslims and Croats in Bosnia were pleased when Mrs.
Plavsic's government, which took office last year, was much more
cooperative in efforts to reduce the divisions between the Serbian
part of the country and the other half, known as the Muslim-Croat
Federation.
</P>
<P>
   When Muslims and Croats could drive through the Serbian part
with little fear of police harassment, or visit their former
neighbors in towns from which they had been expelled, they felt
their old country coming back a bit. It made them feel less afraid
of the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   But nationalist politicians told the Serbs that the small breaks
in the barrier around the Serbian Republic were signs of weakness
and steps toward Muslim domination.
</P>
<P>
   It worried even moderates in this village, like Gavric. ``I
don't hate Muslims, not the people,'' he said. ``I would have to
say for most of my life they were my people because we lived
together. But their government is radical and extreme, and I am a
Serb. That's enough for me to be in danger if they have power over
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Serbs think that if Mrs. Plavsic had been re-elected, the
West would have forced her to allow several hundred thousand Muslim
and Croat refugees to return to their homes. That would have meant
a crisis for Serbs who are now living in the refugees' homes and
who are afraid to return to their own homes in the other half of
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Western diplomats calculated that most Bosnian Serbs
would reject their hard-core leaders and take the gamble that
moderation and cooperation with the West would be the best
guarantee for their future.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the two cafes here, Zoran Askraba, 30, a professional
musician, was making that same point to Dragan Stankovic, a
government worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have gotten money and had a hope,'' Askraba said
angrily. ``I can't accept the fact that my country has to be run by
criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Stankovic replied: ``Look, I don't care. The SDS created the
Serb Republic.'' He referring to the original hard-line Bosnian
Serb party, now considered to the power behind the likely new
president, Poplasen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average man believes we can't take a chance on living with
the Muslims because we would be too unprotected,'' he continued.
``The SDS will protect the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Askraba retorted: ``You are a Serb, and they are not protecting
you. You haven't been paid for five months.''

RUSSIA'S NEW GOVERNMENT TO PRINT RUBLES TO PAY DEBTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's new Communist-influenced government indicated
Thursday that it plans to satisfy old debts and bail out old
friends by printing billions of new rubles, a decision that drew a
swift and strong reaction from President Boris Yeltsin's capitalist
allies.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy head of the central bank said Thursday that the bank
intends to bail out many of the nation's bankrupt financial
institutions by buying back their multibillion-ruble portfolios of
government bonds and Treasury bills. The government temporarily
froze $40 billion worth of notes when the fiscal crisis erupted
last month because it lacked the money to pay investors who hold
them.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by Reuters how the near-broke government would find the
money to pay off the banks, the deputy, Andrei Kozlov, replied:
``Emissions, of course, emissions.'' ``Emissions'' is a euphemism
for printing money.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later in Washington, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers told a House subcommittee that Russia was heading toward a
return of the four-digit inflation rates that savaged consumers and
almost toppled Yeltsin's government in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's new leaders cannot repeal ``basic economic laws,'' he
said. ``They must resist pressures to spend and lend which will
doom the economy to another bout of high, perhaps hyperinflation.
Just as important, they need to take on the failings of the
financial system and finally put in place the core institutions and
policies of a private market economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most pointedly, Summers spoke out against what he said
was pervasive corruption that was hobbling not just the economic
system, but the evolution of democracy. It is up to Russia, he
said, to show that its fiscal policies will affect the lives of
ordinary people, and ``not just enrich offshore bank accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's actions, against the backdrop of continued jockeying
between Communists and capitalists in the new government, suggested
that actions favored by Summers and other free-market economists
are increasingly a longshot.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Summers also said it was unlikely that the $4.3 billion second
tranche of an International Monetary Fund bailout package for
Russia would be paid as planned.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the dire warnings of Summers and Russian
reformers, however, a team of West European ministers in Moscow on
Thursday said that the West should wait before passing judgment on
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's economic intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the impression that the Russian government has
absolutely no intention to engage the reverse gear in any shape or
form,'' said Germany's Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, at a news
conference with Austrian and British officials.
</P>
<P>
   Kinkel said Primakov fears, ``not entirely without grounds,''
that failure to deal with social spending could lead to a political
explosion here.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel also advised
caution. ``Give them a chance,'' he said. ``I have the impression
there is a readiness on their side to act.''
</P>
<P>
   The central bank's proposed bailout would offer a special deal
to bankers, including the so-called oligarchs who frequently built
vast financial empires around banks that have since fallen on hard
times.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, banks would move to the front of a long line of
domestic and foreign investors who bought government bonds only to
see their prices collapse when the crisis struck.
</P>
<P>
   Western experts generally argue that the major beneficiaries of
such a bailout would be financiers, not the economy, since almost
none of Russia's banks have built the extensive networks of
checking, savings and consumer lending services that are a building
block of western trade. Instead, most have plowed their money into
buying industries or speculative investments.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank's statement was not the only suggestion
Thursday that Russia's government is about to embark on a serious
spending program. Yeltsin told his defense advisers to prepare to
pay soldiers and other military workers half of the 16 billion
rubles in back wages that they are owed. At today's exchange rates,
that totals about $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the reformers whose hopes for free-market capitalism
here collapsed with the August fiscal crisis were acid in their
criticism of the new government Thursday. Boris Nemtsov, a deputy
prime minister until recently, greeted the apparent turn in fiscal
policy with sarcasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``To print a lot of money, that's the first message,'' he said.
``To print money, that's the second message, and to print money,
that's the third message,'' he told Reuters Television.
</P>
<P>
   And in Moscow, the head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in
Russia said American companies already have lost a half billion
dollars during this crisis _ and are heading for the exits because
they do not like the look of the new financial scene. The same
tensions over the fiscal policy of the new communist-capitalist
government hobbled efforts Thursday to fill out the last positions
in Yeltsin's new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin said he may miss the legal deadline of Friday for
finishing selection of his new cabinet because he needs more time
to choose a finance minister. Acting Finance Minister Mikhail
Zadornov was a leader among the free-market advocates in the last
cabinet whose push for full-fledged capitalism broke down with this
autumn's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Few believe that Primakov will keep Zadornov in the government,
and there were fresh indications Thursday that Primakov's men may
nudge other reformers out as well.
</P>
<P>
   The new deputy prime minister, Alexander Shokhin, repeated his
statement of Tuesday that Boris Fyodorov, another key reformer who
was a deputy prime minister and head of the state tax service, had
quit. Fyodorov, who developed a reputation for pugnacity as tax
collector, was quiet after Tuesday's announcement. But Thursday he
dispatched an aide to effectively dare Primakov to fire him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have strong nerves and will not resign,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If he does go, it will be viewed by many as an indication that
the new government is moving further from western-style economic
policies that encourage competition and fiscal restraint and toward
communist tenets such as state control of industry and greater
spending on welfare, even at the cost of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The flip side of those concerns, however, is that failure to
spend money on such pressing demands as back wages for soldiers
will only increase the already mounting prospects for a social or
political upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   One of the major reasons Russians have diminishing confidence in
their government is that it has failed to provide basic services
such as pensions, welfare and wages to state employees. At least
some of those payments have gone by the wayside because Yeltsin's
last two governments, committed to keeping inflation low, have
refused to print money to pay for services the government could not
otherwise afford.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party is organizing what it promises will be a
peaceful mass protest against the Yeltsin government for Oct. 7.
But its leaders have said they cannot keep a lid on popular anger
if the government does not begin to respond to citizens' demands.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Yeltsin ordered his interior ministry to make
preparations to keep public order during the protest and to prevent
certain types of actions, such as blockades of railways, that could
disrupt the economy.

<P>
   LUSAKA, Zambia _ It was only two weeks after their mother died
from AIDS that their aunt took them to the bus station. She said
she did not want to take care of them anymore. She told them to go
to Lusaka, find a police station and ask for an orphanage.
</P>
<P>
   The children, Calvin Katoya and Jackson Kabaso, who would like
to be soccer stars someday, did as they were told, riding the bus
an hour from the small town of Kabwe, then asking strangers where
to go. But the police could not help them. As the days went by, the
boys, 12 and 15, slept in the rusting, abandoned cars nearby. They
had no money or food.
</P>
<P>
   Edith and Khuzini Banda lived with their aunt for about year
after their mother died in 1994. But then the aunt said her home
was too crowded. She sent the girls _ then only 13 and 14 _ to live
alone in their mother's house. The girls make do by renting out
half the two-room house for $15 a month, and begging from the
neighbors when food runs out.
</P>
<P>
   The two keep their cinder-block room tidy, decorated with
magazine layouts of models and Hollywood stars. They hope the
headmaster will be lenient about their school fees, which are eight
months over due.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, said Edith Banda, she is jealous of those who still
have parents. ``It would be nice to have someone who cares about
us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS epidemic has been raging in Zambia for nearly two
decades, and as the deaths pile up, so do the orphaned children. It
is much the same in many other parts of Africa. In rural areas of
East Africa, four of every 10 children who have lost one parent by
age 15 have lost that parent to AIDS, according to U.N. figures. In
1997 alone, the disease orphaned 1.7 million children, more than 90
percent of them in Africa south of the Sahara.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Zambia, a landlocked county in southern Africa that
has never embraced birth control, that has the highest proportion
of orphaned children in the world, according to the United Nations.
Here, an estimated 23 percent of all children under 15 are missing
one or both parents, many of them dead from AIDS, and the numbers
are expected to keep rising.
</P>
<P>
   For now, most of the children have been absorbed into extended
families. Almost 75 percent of all households are taking care of at
least one orphan. But in this country, where half of all households
are living in extreme poverty, the strain of caring for extra
children is beginning to take its toll. Many children are being
squeezed out. In 1991 Lusaka had 35,000 children living on the
street. Today there are more than 90,000.
</P>
<P>
   Zambian officials believe the number of adults infected with
HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, will not decline before 2010,
which means that the orphan population will not peak until 2020.
Recent U.N.reports estimate that there are now nearly half a
million orphaned by the disease in Zambia. That number is expected
at least to double in the coming decade, further straining the
country's meager resources.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that already the orphans are suffering. When there
is not enough to eat, orphans often get less than the other
children in the household. They are also often the last to get
shoes and the last to go to school. In the rural areas, girls are
being married off at 12 or 13, far younger than the usual age of
18. The reason: the family no longer has to feed the girl and, in
keeping with local custom, can claim a bride price.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the children say the orphans are more likely to be
forced to work long hours, to suffer from beatings and to
experience sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start talking about the rising number of orphans, you
are quickly talking about a rise in all these related issues _
child labor, child abuse and sexual abuse,'' said Stephan Dahlgren,
a project officer with Unicef based in Zambia. ``The more
vulnerable children you have, the more the problems escalate.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the huge number of people infected with HIV in Zambia,
there is little planning for death. Most people are never tested
for AIDS and would not admit to it even if they did find out they
are infected. Only among the educated elite is this beginning to
change.
</P>
<P>
   Zambian health authorities believe that the prevalence of HIV
here will peak this year because recent surveys report significant
behavioral changes. But even that seems like bitter news: The
infection rate in urban areas is expected to plateau at 28 percent.
In rural areas, experts calculate, it will be 22 percent, giving
Zambia one of the world's highest infection rates.
</P>
<P>
   As is the case elsewhere in Africa, the vast majority of
infected Zambians are between 15 and 40, meaning that they are
dying when they should be in their most productive years. This,
combined with wide-scale layoffs as the government tries to retool
a socialist economy by selling off state-owned businesses, has made
it all the more difficult for families to absorb the growing number
of orphans. Children, orphaned or not, have hard lives in Zambia.
Nearly half are stunted from a lack of food, about 20 percent
severely so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows about AIDS,'' Dahlgren said. ``If you go into
a small village and ask a chief about AIDS, he knows all about it.
But when it comes down to `What is this disease that so and so died
from?' then it's tuberculosis or malaria.''
</P>
<P>
   Many orphans are losing both their parents and all their
inheritance at the same time. Relatives quickly swoop in and grab
property, be it cooking pots or farm land, and the children have
little to say about it. In theory, they could appeal to the courts,
but few Zambians have the wherewithal and the money to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Florence and Veronica Phiri once lived comfortably with their
parents in the modest house they owned. Their father was an
electrician. But in 1994 both parents died within months of each
other. The girls were 8 and 6.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, their father's family took over the house and sent
the girls to live with an aunt in a rural village. There, the girls
said, they were beaten and had to work long hours fetching water
and collecting wood.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, their mother's relatives intervened and brought
the girls back to Lusaka to live with their maternal grandmother,
who sells vegetables in the market. Florence and Veronica and four
cousins who are also orphans spend most days playing in the dusty
streets in front of their grandmother's dilapidated house.
</P>
<P>
   Florence and Veronica have nothing that ever belonged to their
parents and do not expect they ever will. At her grandmother's,
Florence said, some days there is no food.
</P>
<P>
   But she is still glad to be there. ``It is much better than
before,'' she said, shyly adjusting her ragged clothes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This year a community group donated money for her school fees, a
school uniform and shoes. But Veronica will have to wait; there was
not enough money for her.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in this city, as the sun sets, casting shadows over
the modern government-sponsored high rises, entire families settle
in for the night on the sidewalks. Scattered among them are the
ragged street children, many of whom make money as prostitutes and
look for any means to get high.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at the Fountain of Hope, a nonprofit organization that
works with the street children, say the children have even found a
way of getting a powerful high from fermented human feces, a
substance known as jekem.
</P>
<P>
   In the daylight, many idle the hours away kicking a soccer ball
around outside the Fountain of Hope headquarters. The organization
is trying to offer them a special four-year education program that
will ready them for school exams. But the street children here are
like street children everywhere _ hardened and focused on immediate
survival.
</P>
<P>
   The stories the children tell of fear, rejection and loneliness
are numbingly similar. Simon Phiri, who is 14 but looks about 10,
can not even remember when his parents died. Slumped in a chair, he
peels the dirt from his palms as he talks sullenly about his short
life. For a while, he said, he stayed with his mother's best
friend. But after a while, he left.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were always insulting me,'' he said. ``They always ate
when I went out and never saved me anything. `'
</P>
<P>
   He said he has spent many nights sleeping in the aisles of the
local market place. But now he sleeps on the floor of a friend's
older brother's house. He must get his own food, though, and he has
no money for soap. He earns money doing odd jobs in the market, he
said. The counselors said that he has a sexually transmitted
disease. Nearly half the boys do.
</P>
<P>
   Simon has not been to school in at least four years, though he
hopes to be an accountant when he grows up. ``I would like to work
in an office,'' he said, suddenly brightening.
</P>
<P>
   Finding homes for the street children is not really a
possibility, say center employees. There are only a handful of very
small orphanages in Zambia, including the Kabwata Orphanage, where
Calvin and Jackson ended up after three days without food.
Eventually the police contacted Lorraine Miyanda, who runs the
place, and she bent the rules to admit the boys. Usually the
orphanage will not take children over the age of 10.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Miyanda said she has little hope that anyone will ever
take the boys into a new home. In many African countries there is
little tradition of taking in children who are not blood relatives
and formal adoption is extremely rare. Child advocates say that
this may be a particular problem in the future because of the way
AIDS tends to devastate whole families, particularly in villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The extended family in Africa is far better than in the West
about taking in relatives.,'' said Mark Louden, a South African who
is writing a book on AIDS orphans. ``There is no formality about
taking care of cousins. They slip right into saying `Mom.' In
Africa you have 30 Moms. The problem is that AIDS doesn't usually
take just one woman in a family; it tends to take all the wives of
the brothers because the brothers tend to behave similarly.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, dozens of fledgling organizations have
sprung up in Zambia to try to help the children. But there is
virtually no government money available and many of the
organizations are staffed only by volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that the government in unsympathetic,'' said Louis
Mwewa, the coordinator of Children in Need, an umbrella
organization that tried to represent the groups. ``But we are a
poor country and they do not have money.''
</P>
<P>
   In Matero, one of Lusaka's poorer neighborhoods, where small
houses with tin roofs stretch for miles, overwhelmed grandmothers
and households that are a collection of siblings living on their
own are easy to find. In one house, Brenda Tembo, 52, cares for 14
of her grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, no one in her household had eaten yet:
there was no food in the house. Mrs. Tembo was waiting for someone
to buy tomatoes from her vegetable stand before buying corn meal,
which would feed more of them for less. Five children in the
household should be in school, but there is no money for tuition.
</P>
<P>
   There is barely enough room for all the children to lie down on
the floor at night. The homemade plywood table and the three
rickety chairs must be put outside when it is bedtime. ``I am not
alone like this.'' she said, pointing across the dirt road at
another house. ``Right over there, it is the same.''
</P>
<P>
   While the grandmothers struggle with the burden of feeding and
clothing the children, some child advocates are more worried about
those who are growing up in the households run by siblings, where
chaos sometimes reigns.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Like the Banda girls, the Zulu siblings survive on the rent they
receive from their parents' house in a neighborhood called Kuanda
Square. The seven children live in the back in a tumbledown
two-room structure. But recently the oldest boy got married and set
up his own household, leaving less money for the rest of the
children, who range in age from 19 to 11. The 19-year-old is known
in the neighborhood as a drinker who regularly beats the younger
ones.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit, there was no food in the dank-smelling house.
Shoes and dirty clothes were strewn about. With the 19-year-old
sitting silently nearby, no one complained of any difficulties. All
but the youngest appeared to have found some way of making money,
from working as a maid to selling sugar cane in the market. But
each keeps that money for himself or herself, the children said.
The 11-year-old appears to survive on the generosity of the others,
but it was clear they expected her to do most of the housework.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the laundry is difficult,'' the girl admitted,
twisting the hem of her skirt nervously.
</P>
<P>
   By 1991 the needs of the orphans in the Matero neighborhood had
become so apparent that some local women banded together to try to
help. They have registered 2,047 orphans in the neighborhood and
assigned someone to look in on each household and help solve
problems that crop up. To raise money for school fees, they make
doormats, bake bread, sew and batik fabrics. Six days a week, they
also give about 60 of the children a free meal, with the help of
the local Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year the group, called Kwasha Mukwena, has promised
to pay the school fees for 279 children _ fees that range from less
than $10 for the younger children to about $30 for the oldest. But
they have only raised the money to pay fees for 132.
</P>
<P>
   As the lunch hour drew near recently, orphans began arriving in
the carefully swept church yard. In the back, over an open fire,
the women had made a vegetable and peanut stew to be eaten with a
corn porridge. The children, in tattered clothing, were painfully
obedient. Some, as young as five, carefully carried full plates to
the room where even the toddlers ate without spilling a drop.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen children also carried plastic boxes _ a signal to the
workers that they were having a particularly hard time. Before
eating, these children put half their food in their boxes. Either
they knew they would get no supper and were saving for later, or
they had been told to bring food home for other children in the
household or face punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that people are so cruel,'' said Patricia Ngoma, who
volunteers with the program. ``But they have nothing themselves.''

   CLINTON-CONGRESS-SLEAZE (Washington) _ The Democratic and
Republican leaders of the partisan committees that help finance
campaigns for the House of Representatives promised today to
withhold money from any candidates who attack the private lives of
their opponents in the November election races. Rep. Martin Frost
of Texas, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee, and Rep. John Linder of Georgia, the chairman of the
National Republican Congressional Committee, made the commitment on
the House floor this morning and directed their staffs to write a

   CLINTON-CONGRESS-ASSESS (Washington) _ It is not just the
Clinton presidency that hangs in the balance in these fevered
Washington days. Before the eyes of the nation, Congress itself is
on trial. Even in normal times Congress can seem a maddening
institution, but the task now before it is extraordinary. Could the
founders have ever have pondered what a national inquest might turn
into in this new age of round the clock cable talk shows and the
Internet? Could they have foreseen that the House and Senate would
be exmaining the most private, intimate actions of a public man?
These are the uncomfortable circumstances that Congress now has to
deal with in an atmosphere made more poisonous and hysterical by
the suddent realization that the private life of anyone in the
House and Senate rapidly seems to have become fair game in the
press. A news analysis by Alison Mitchell.

   CLINTON-RELEASE (Undated) _ While most Americans approve of the
way Congress is performing its job overall, the public disagrees
with the recent decision to release all of the independent
counsel's report, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News
poll. The sexual details in Starr's report are seen by most of the
public as ``inappropriate,'' information designed to embarrass
President Clinton. There is even less support for the possible
release of Clinton's videotaped grand jury testimony. Seventy
percent of all Americans polled Tuesday night by CBS News disagreed
with the release of the grand jury testimony. By Marjorie Connelly.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-GINGRICH (Washington) _ House Speaker Newt Gingrich has
tried all week to portray himself as the impartial observer waiting
for his lawyers on the Judiciary Committee to sort out the facts
and set the policy on how to deal with President Clinton's
transgressions, while he deals with the people's business. But
behind the scenes, according to other Republican lawmakers, not a
step is taken or a decision made without the approval of Gingrich,

   CLINTON-CONGRESS (Washington) _ Abandoning any pretense of
bipartisanship, the House Judiciary Committee wrestled with a plan
to make public the videotape of President Clinton's grand jury
testimony and reams of documents delivered by the independent
counsel. By Lizette Alvarez.

   CLINTON-DAY _ The president's day: Clinton is helping raise
$200,000 for a congressional candidate in Ohio; later, a Boston
dinner is expected to bring the party $1 million. By R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   With CLINTON-BOSTON, below.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-CONGRESS-SLEAZE (Washington) _ The Democratic and
Republican leaders of the partisan committees that help finance
campaigns for the House of Representatives promised today to
withhold money from any candidates who attack the private lives of
their opponents in the November election races. Rep. Martin Frost
of Texas, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee, and Rep. John Linder of Georgia, the chairman of the
National Republican Congressional Committee, made the commitment on
the House floor this morning and directed their staffs to write a
letter to candidates that they would then sign. By John H. Cushman
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Moving by  &UR; 8 p.m. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-CONGRESS-ASSESS (Washington) _ It is not just the
Clinton presidency that hangs in the balance in these fevered
Washington days. Before the eyes of the nation, Congress itself is
on trial. Even in normal times Congress can seem a maddening
institution, but the task now before it is extraordinary. Could the
founders have ever have pondered what a national inquest might turn
into in this new age of round the clock cable talk shows and the
Internet? Could they have foreseen that the House and Senate would
be exmaining the most private, intimate actions of a public man?
These are the uncomfortable circumstances that Congress now has to
deal with in an atmosphere made more poisonous and hysterical by
the suddent realization that the private life of anyone in the
House and Senate rapidly seems to have become fair game in the
press. A news analysis by Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-EDITORIALS (Undated) _ Dozens of American newspapers
have called for Clinton's resignation even though most people still
say he should remain in office. We look behind the editorials to
the internal debates and responses to editorials. By Felicity
Barringer.
</P>
<P>
   Moving by  &UR; 8:30 pm. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-BOSTON (Boston) _ Clinton arrives in Boston and finds
more criticism. By Michael Janofsky. (300 words)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-RELEASE (Undated) _ While most Americans approve of the
way Congress is performing its job overall, the public disagrees
with the recent decision to release all of the independent
counsel's report, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News
poll. The sexual details in Starr's report are seen by most of the
public as ``inappropriate,'' information designed to embarrass
President Clinton. There is even less support for the possible
release of Clinton's videotaped grand jury testimony. Seventy
percent of all Americans polled Tuesday night by CBS News disagreed
with the release of the grand jury testimony. By Marjorie Connelly.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-GINGRICH (Washington) _ House Speaker Newt Gingrich has
tried all week to portray himself as the impartial observer waiting
for his lawyers on the Judiciary Committee to sort out the facts
and set the policy on how to deal with President Clinton's
transgressions, while he deals with the people's business. But
behind the scenes, according to other Republican lawmakers, not a
step is taken or a decision made without the approval of Gingrich,
possibly the most partisan and certainly the most dominant speaker
in the last generation. By David E. Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   Moving by  &UR; 9 p.m. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-MINISTER (Undated) _ Clinton chooses his own pastor in
Washington to be the third of his spiritual counselors. By Laurie
Goodstein. (300 words)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-CONGRESS-TV (Undated) _ What networks and news channels
are planning for three hours of Clinton testimony.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   TEXT ADVISORY
</P>
<P>
   At this hour, neither the timing nor the form of the release of
Clinton's grand jury testimony are certain. However, the New York
Times News Service will not move the full text.
</P>
<P>
   When it does become available, The Associated Press will make
the full text of the testimony through a password-required ftp site
and as an Adobe PDF file through AP Send. This is the same
procedure used by The AP for the full text of the Starr report last
week. See their advisories for additional information.

   The AP has also decided not to release the full text over normal

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The leaders of the Democratic and Republican
committees that help finance campaigns for the House of
Representatives promised Thursday to withhold money from any
candidates who attack the private lives of their opponents in the
November election races.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Frost of Texas, the chairman of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, and Rep. John Linder of Georgia,
the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee,
made the commitment on the House floor Thursday morning and
directed their staffs to write a letter to candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The two chairmen said they wanted to discourage a spiral into
character assassination and mudslinging at a time when the
political scene is dominated by discussion of President Clinton's
involvement with a White House intern, and when the sexual lives of
politicians seem to be coming under ever wider scrutiny in the news
media.
</P>
<P>
   What promoted their initiative was widespread outrage over the
disclosure on Wednesday that Rep. Henry Hyde, the chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee, had an affair in the 1960s with a
married woman. That disclosure arose not in Hyde's re-election
campaign, but in an article in an online magazine that was quickly
echoed by other news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third time in recent days that a Republican member of
the House, confronted by the press, had confirmed a past adulterous
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't happen very often,'' Frost said of campaigns using
smear tactics, ``but it is certainly possible that it would happen
this year, because of everything that has happened. If they engage
in it, they engage in it at their own risk. There are a lot of
things those of us in politics can't control, but this is one thing
John Linder and I can control.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Senate's Republican and Democratic campaigns
said they did not know whether similar policies would be
considered.
</P>
<P>
   The House campaign committees solicit donations of thousands of
dollars from other political action committees and from individual
donors, then funnel the money into the campaigns of Congressional
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum donation each committee is allowed to make to a
single campaign is $70,000; the typical House race costs much more
than that, and some cost millions of dollars. The congressional
committees also spend tens of millions of dollars in advertisements
advocating issues rather than candidates, and on other political
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, the two committees spent more than $100 million
during the 1995 and 1996 election cycle, according to Federal
Election Committee records, with the Republicans spending more than
twice as much as the Democrats. Linder said today that his
committee expected to contribute $7 million to 100 Republican
candidates in the coming election. Frost said his committee would
support 50 to 100 Democratic candidates, but not always to the
legal limit.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of using their campaign chests to restrain personal
attacks was first suggested by Frost in an appearance this morning
before the National Association of Manufacturers. Linder, who was
also at the meeting, immediately agreed, and on the way back to the
House they decided to write a common policy, they said.

declared that with the world in its greatest economic turmoil in a
half-century, ``the industrial world's chief priority today,
plainly, is to spur growth.'' The markets soared, figuring that a

economies meant that coordinated action was on the way. By
Wednesday afternoon, that hope was dashed. First Germany, then the

endeavor to coordinate interest rate cuts.'' Was this a case of
miscommunication? Or is there a far deeper problem? By David E.

US STOCKS JOIN THE RIDE; DOW DROPS 216 POINTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ US stocks followed those of Europe, Asia and Latin
America in tumbling Thursday after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan poured cold water on the idea of a coordinated interest
rate cut to spur growth. The Dow Jones industrial average snapped a
four-day rally by losing 216 points.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hardest hit were shares of banks and financial service
companies, many of which have fallen by as much as half from their
mid-July highs, and consumer product companies like Proctor &AMP;
Gamble Co. whose overseas sales are expected to suffer because of
the current global turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market has bounced around within a comparatively
narrow range for almost three weeks as investors have tried to
fathom what the overseas financial crisis, President Clinton's
political troubles and stalling corporate profits mean for
investments. While some analysts said the pattern sets the stage
for a comeback, others warned of continued jumps and plunges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see these problems going away very quickly. You can
see how fragile the market is,'' said Michael W. Clark, US equities
trading chief for Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's tumble began in Asia where renewed worries about
Japanese banks sent Tokyo's Nikkei 225 Index down 2.4 percent to a
12 1/2-year low, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index down 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble spread quickly to Europe where most major indexes
were off about four percent, at least in part on news that French
Alcatel SA, the world's fourth largest telephone equipment maker,
would not hit profit targets. Alacatel shares plunged 38 percent,
shaving more than $11 billion from the company's market's value.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the Dow dropped 216.01 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at
7873.77, ending a four-day, 474-point rise. Every company in the
30-stock index saw its shares fall. Other market indexes traced a
similar pattern; the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index dropped 26.62
point, or 2.6 percent, to 1018.86, and the Nasdaq Composite Index
skidded 43.67 points, or 2.6 percent, to 1646.24.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among local companies hurt by the slide was Gillette Co.
whose shares had already tumbled 11 percent Wednesday on news that
overseas sales were being damaged by economic trouble in Russia,
Asia and Latin America. The company's stock fell 3 7/16, or another
8.5 percent, Thursday to close at 36 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Thursday's trouble stemmed from Greenspan's comments in
congressional testimony Wednesday that the US was not leading the
so-called G-7 industrial nations in a coordinated interest rate cut
to combat global slowdown. Investors had assumed that such a cut
was in the works and were surprised by US central banker's remarks,
according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that no issues have been resolved in the
global economic or political crisis,'' said Tony Dwyer, chief
markets strategist for Ladenburg Thalmann &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   For the US, there was some good economic news; the trade deficit
widened less than expected in July and consumer prices barely
budged in August. Analysts said that both were signs that outside
of the manufacturing sector, which has been hurt by tumbling
overseas sales, the economy is holding up well in its eighth year
of expansion.
</P>
<P>
   But US economic stability is apparently not enough to help other
countries. The International Monetary Fund reportedly sliced its
prediction for world growth this year from its May forecast of 3.1
percent to a weak two percent.
</P>
<P>
   And domestic stability may not be enough to help some US
workers. Travelers Group Inc and Citicorp, which are preparing to
merge, said they will cut as many as 8,000 employees, or five
percent of the combined firms's workforce by year &UR;  &LR; end. A spokesman
for the companies said many of the cuts would be in headquarters
and emerging markets staff, which means they are likely to fall
heavily on New York.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At a news conference on education legislation
Thursday morning, the first question put to House Speaker Newt
Gingrich involved the White House scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich snapped at the questioner. ``We in the Congress are
actually focusing on substance,'' he asserted. ``Yesterday, I spent
less than 45 minutes total on the topic that interests you most.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the pose the speaker has tried to assume all week: the
impartial observer waiting for his lawyers on the Judiciary
Committee to sort out the facts and set the policy on how to deal
with President Clinton's transgressions, while he deals with the
people's business.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the scenes, according to other Republican lawmakers,
not a step is taken or a decision made without the approval of
Gingrich, possibly the most partisan and certainly the most
dominant speaker in the last generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, the speaker is the speaker,'' said the chairman of an
important committee who insisted on anonymity. ``He calls all the
shots. If tapes are going to be released, it's his decision. If
hearings are going to be held, he will decide. He consults with us.
He listens to us. But he makes the calls.''
</P>
<P>
   At a closed meeting of House Republicans on Wednesday, Rep.
Nancy Johnson of Connecticut expressed concern about the release of
sexually explicit portions of the videotape of the president's
grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich _ angry, according to some who were there, or merely
firm, according to others _ rose to his feet and declared that the
House had already voted to make the material public and that
Republicans were not going to back down in the face of complaints
from the White House and Democrats in Congress. Gingrich called the
president a ``misogynist,'' a person who hates women.
</P>
<P>
   At the same meeting, Rep. Gerald Solomon of New York, the
chairman of the Rules Committee, reiterated a point Gingrich had
made in a speech last week and reminded his colleagues that the
rules of the House did not permit language in floor debates that
ridiculed or otherwise abused the president.
</P>
<P>
   There was a smattering of boos, clearly in jest, from the back
of the room, according to people who were there. Gingrich, they
said, declared sternly that decorum in the House was not a laughing
matter and that he would not allow the rules to be abridged.
</P>
<P>
   When Gingrich walked out of the meeting and into a gaggle of
reporters and cameras, he made a conspicuous show of talking about
other issues _ trade and the economy _ and even praised Clinton's
efforts to renew world economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   When reporters persisted in asking questions about impeachment
and videotaped testimony, Rep. John Boehner of Ohio pushed the
speaker from the microphone so that staff members could usher him
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very important to us that Newt lie low,'' said a
Republican congressman from the Southeast. This congressman
explained that Gingrich often came across to the public as strident
and even mean and that if he allowed himself to stand at the
forefront of the Clinton inquiry, the president and his allies
would benefit by making him a lightning rod for their criticism of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich is under conflicting pressures. The firebrands among
House Republicans want to go after Clinton with all the artillery
in the House's arsenal. But Gingrich's political advisers are
telling him, according to a former staff assistant, that if he has
any ambition to become president himself, this is his opportunity
to dispel his reputation as a hothead and adopt the mien of a
statesman.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican congressman suggested half seriously that the
most advantageous step Gingrich could take would be to save
Clinton's presidency. ``It might not be best for the country,'' the
congressman said, ``but they would have a cripple as president
going into the next election, and Newt would go down as a profile
in courage.''
</P>
<P>
   With all that in mind, Gingrich tended carefully this week to
the ceremonial and legislative aspects of his job.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke at a conference on missile defense, received a Hispanic
Heritage Leadership Award and another award from the Community
Antidrug Coalition, met with chief executives of some of America's
largest companies, attended news conferences on education,
agriculture policy and prayer in schools, appeared on the steps of
the Capitol with representatives of Habitat for Humanity and taped
an interview for a cable television documentary on the 100 people
who have the most influence on American society.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Gingrich stayed on message, but occasionally
he let slip oblique mentions of the subject that must be on his
mind, too.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, speaking extemporaneously at a news conference
Wednesday about a proposed constitutional amendment allowing prayer
in public schools, he declared, ``In this city today, we have the
specter of a scandal large enough that it should be driving all of
us to prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday morning, to mark the 211th anniversary of the
signing of the Constitution, he gave a one-minute speech on the
House floor during the period set aside for members to address any
subject of their choice. He said that the framers of the
Constitution had been determined to show ``once and for all that
the age of kings was over, that all men and women are under the law
_ none is above it, and none is below it.''

 &HT;    CLINTON SAYS WASHINGTON IS ``TOO OBSESSED WITH ITSELF'' TO DEAL
WITH NATION'S BUSINESS
 &HT;    EDS: Story will be updated, and the byline moved to Boston,
after Clinton's evening appearance there.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Bracing for another potentially embarrassing
chapter in the saga of scandal that threatens his office, President
Clinton journeyed Thursday to the American heartland where he
derided the political culture of Washington as ''too obsessed with
itself'' to address the nation's business.
</P>
<P>
   ''Washington always thinks everything's about Washington,''
Clinton told an elite group of supporters who donated $10,000 per
couple to the Democratic Party to have lunch with the president in
the home of a prominent Cincinnati attorney. ''It's not about
Washington, it's about America.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used the fund-raiser, which generated more than $200,000
for a pair of Democrats running for the U.S. House of
Representatives, to chastise Republicans and challenge his own
party to focus on issues, not scandal, in November elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not about me,'' Clinton said of the coming election.
''It is about the people of this country, it is about their
children, their future and our common efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as the president urged supporters here to look beyond his
personal troubles to the policy issues affecting the nation's
future, House Republicans were preparing to release a videotape of
Clinton's Aug. 17 grand jury testimony about his affair with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   With the House Judiciary Committee debating the issue, Clinton's
personal attorney, David Kendall, released a statement in
Washington criticizing independent counsel Kenneth Starr for
refusing to destroy the videotape and accusing Starr of
deliberately trying to ''embarrass the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall said that he asked Starr before Clinton testified to
destroy the videotape after it was viewed by any grand jurors who
might have missed the president's actual testimony, which was
beamed live, via closed circuit television, from the White House
Map Room, where Clinton testified, to the grand jury room at the
U.S. Courthouse several blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   ''I asked the OIC (office of independent counsel) to agree to
discard the videotape after showing it to any grand jurors who
missed the testimony,'' Kendall said in a written statement. ''The
OIC refused to do so,'' Kendall added, even though a full
stenographic transcript of the testimony also was available.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only purpose of preserving this videotape after any absent
grand jurors viewed it was to ensure its public release and
embarrass the president,'' Kendall wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The money Clinton raised in Cincinnati was intended to support
the House candidacies of Cincinnati Mayor Roxanne Qualls and former
Kentucky Attorney General Chris Gorman.
</P>
<P>
   Baring a bit of political tooth after weeks of absorbing
personal criticism from prominent figures in both parties, Clinton
lashed out at the Republican-led Congress that is reviewing
possible impeachment proceedings, accusing the Republicans of
waging ''a strategy of not doing anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Clinton, ''They've killed tobacco legislation and campaign
finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   He then blasted a Republican plan to give back to taxpayers much
of an anticipated federal budget surplus through an $80-billion tax
cut, a proposal he earlier in the day in Washington pledged to
veto.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd just kind of like to watch the ink turn from red to black
and see it dry,'' Clinton explained to backers in Cincinnati,
''before we start shoveling it out the door again.''
</P>
<P>
   Any available surplus money should be set aside, Clinton said,
until Congress and the White House can agree on a plan to shore up
the Social Security system, which is on track to go broke sometime
in the third decade of the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he favored targeted tax cuts to help lower-income
Americans pay for child care and education, and to help encourage
environmental protection.

   Clinton drew praise from the luncheon's sponsor, attorney Stan
Chesley, who said Americans should ''thank our lucky stars,'' to
have Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ''This president is here to stay,'' Chesley told about 40
wealthy Democrats. ''He's not going anywhere, and he's not going to
be goaded into resigning.''
</P>
<P>
   Near Chesley's home, however, several dozen protesters gathered
to demand that Clinton step down.
</P>
<P>
   ''Put America first and resign now,'' read the headline above a
blistering editorial in Thursday's Cincinnati Enquirer, one of 87
newspapers across the country whose editorial boards have called
upon the president to step aside.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your authority is crippled beyond repair,'' the Enquirer
intoned. ''Each day you remain makes it harder to remove the stains
you will leave on our White House.''
</P>
<P>
   As House Republicans prepared to release videotape of Clinton's
grand jury testimony, the White House rebuked the House Judiciary
Committee for considering the tape's fate behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they're going to have a debate about what the public has a
right to see, they ought to have a debate so the public can see
it,'' presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters flying
with Clinton aboard Air Force One en route to Cincinnati from
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles sent a letter Thursday
to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., flatly
denying suggestions that the White House had urged on-line magazine
Salon to pursue a story that broke Wednesday disclosing that Hyde
had an affair three decades ago with a married woman. Hyde
acknowledged the affair, which took place over four years in the
1960s, after the Salon story appeared on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''The White House has zero tolerance for staff who are found to
be prying or encouraging others to pry into the personal lives of
members (of Congress) or any other government official,'' Bowles
wrote. ''Let me reassure you: any staff who are found to be
engaging in such conduct will be fired immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowles took the additional step of saying journalists were free
to break confidentiality vows given to any White House source who
passed along rumors or information about stories meant to be
personally damaging to members of Congress or other public
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Bowles invited any journalist who might have received such
information in a confidential conversation with a White House
staffer to step forward and identify the staffer, writing, ''I am
committed to taking appropriate action based on any reliable
information.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If there is someone in our building who has so completely lost
their mind that they think this is helpful, they should be fired,''
Lockhart said. ''Everyone in our building says they're not the
source'' of the Hyde revelations.

CALIFORNIA SENATOR SAYS CLINTON BETRAYED HER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time since reading the special
prosecutor's report on President Clinton's affair with a onetime
intern, Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Thursday she felt ``a personal
sense of betrayal'' and said she rebuffed an offer to talk to the
president about it.
</P>
<P>
   But Feinstein, D-Calif., said talk about whether Clinton should
resign ``is way premature'' and said the congressional
investigation into alleged impeachable offenses should be allowed
to play out.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare interview in her office, Feinstein was at times at a
loss for words when trying to describe the ``sadness and
disappointment'' she felt after reading the report of Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr, a task she said took four hours.
</P>
<P>
   She also said revelations that House Judiciary Committee
Chairman Henry Hyde had had an affair with a married woman in the
1960s ``is different'' from Clinton's situation and ``only
increases animosity'' from Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an intern,'' Feinstein said, referring to Clinton's
affair with Monica Lewinsky. ``This was something while he was
president. That's its pertinence. The fact that it was in the White
House, in the Oval Office.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, R-Ill., has acknowledged the affair occurred. It took
place in the 1960s, before Hyde ran for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said she turned down an offer from one of Clinton's
aides to talk with the president about the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I didn't want to talk to the president,'' Feinstein
said. ``I was angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Feinstein said, she hasn't talked to the president
but has consulted on other matters with members of his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be candid, it's still hard to believe,'' said Feinstein,
who is the senior senator from California, a state Clinton has
assiduously courted throughout his presidency. ``This is the kind
of thing that is difficult on a personal level for me.''
</P>
<P>
   However, she added, ``I can separate my personal dismay and
disappointment from what I have to do as a senator.'
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's admission that he lied about the Lewinsky affair, and
the sordid details surrounding it, have drawn a growing number of
Democrats in Congress to criticize the president's conduct. But
most have stopped short of saying Clinton should be forced from
office because of an extramarital relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein was ambivalent about the impending release of a
videotape of the president's Aug. 17 testimony before the federal
grand jury investigating his conduct. After the testimony, Clinton
went on national television and admitted having an extramarital
relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's something that adds light to the situation and is
pertinent to the situation, it might be a wise thing to do,''
Feinstein said. ``But if it's something to inflame the situation, I
don't think that's what it should be about.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said she the House Judiciary Committee must be
bipartisan as it proceeds with its own assessment of whether
Clinton committed impeachable offenses. The Starr report accused
the president of perjury, abuse of power and obstruction of justice
in trying to conceal the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we can have a relatively short process,'' Feinstein
said. ``I hope it does not drag on for a year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein recalled how she was sitting only a few feet away from
Clinton in the White House in January when he waved his index
finger at the television cameras and denied to the nation that he
had ever had ``sexual relations'' with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said ``the body language'' and the ``directness of the
statement'' convinced her he was telling the truth and she believed
that for seven months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believed it and I believed it totally,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when Clinton dispatched members of his Cabinet to
convince others he was telling the truth, she was even more
certain.
</P>
<P>
   But then she was shattered.
</P>
<P>
   ``On August 17, when I heard the statement, my world came
crashing down,'' Feinstein said. ``I feel a personal sense of
betrayal. I felt a gut-level deep sense of betrayal.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Feinstein told reporters her faith in the
president's credibility was badly ``shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said her office had received about 12,000 phone calls
from constituents since Friday, when the Starr report was made
public, as well as 1,500 electronic mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are in tears, some are irate and some are
extraordinarily supportive of the president,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has a long, long tail on it. It's not just the president.
It's the future of the American presidency too.''
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton is to survive the scandal, ``he will need to show he
will continue to be a strong president,'' Feinstein said. ``That's
where the jury's out.''

CHIRON SELLS MASSACHUSETTS UNIT TO BAYER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM   AND RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chiron Corp. Thursday said it has agreed to sell its medical
diagnostic business in Walpole, Mass. to Bayer A.G., a German
chemical and pharmaceutical company, for $1.1 billion in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Chiron Diagnostics, which employs 1,200 in Massachusetts and
2,200 in Ohio, California, and Great Britain, records $560 million
in annual sales of its blood screening tests for the hepatitis C
and human immunodeficiency viruses.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition, expected to be completed by early next year,
will transform Bayer into the world's fourth-largest purveyor of
medical diagnostic kits. It also gives Chiron, based in Emeryville,
Calif., a major cash infusion, an estimated $800 million after it
pays income taxes on the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The deal boosts Bayer's ability to compete in the $19 billion
global market for medical testing kits. Bayer, whose $1.1-billion
diagnostic business is based in Tarrytown, N.Y., collects $500
million from sales of its self-test, glucose monitoring kits for
diabetics. The remainder of its diagnostic sales come from Bayer's
central laboratory business, which has some overlaps with Chiron
Diagnostics. There are no immediate plans for layoffs, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``The diagnostic business is consolidating pretty rapidly, as
each of the major players has made key acquisitions, creating
somewhat of a feeding frenzy,'' said Richard Barker, president of
Chiron Diagnostics, who will remain with the business under Bayer.
``So we knew we needed a critical mass if we wanted to be a major
player.''
</P>
<P>
   For Chiron, the sale represents a 100 percent return on
investment. Chiron paid just $350 million in 1995 for the company,
which was owned by Ciba-Geigy Corp., a Swiss pharmaceutical
company. After investing over $100 million of its own product lines
into the business, it doubled its money in the cash deal with
Bayer.
</P>
<P>
   Chiron had spent the better part of a year searching for an
equity partner for its diagnostic division, which contributes about
half of the company's annual sales. But Chiron executives
ultimately decided to sell the operation to focus exclusively on
its drug and vaccine business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear they wanted to refocus and become more of a
specialty drug company,'' said Tom Brakel, analyst with Mehta
Partners in New York, who had estimated Chiron would get just $560
million for its diagnostic business. Brakel said Chiron has been
streamlining its business in an aggressive effort to propel its
stock to the $40 range. With Chiron shares closing at 17 7/16, up
9/16, Thursday, Brakel acknowledged the company has a ways to go.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Sheffery, analyst with Orbimed Advisors in New York,
said his level of enthusiasm for the deal will depend on what
Chiron will do with its newfound money. ``I am enthusiastic about
the deal, but am taking a wait-and-see attitude to see what they do
with the cash before I become super-enthusiastic about Chiron as an
investment idea.''

CLINTON'S OHIO VISIT IS NORMAL--ON THE SURFACE

<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ On the surface, it was a perfectly normal
presidential visit, with all the symbols of power on display.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton landed at lunchtime at the Greater Cincinnati
Airport, across the Ohio River in Kentucky, in his imposing
blue-and-white jet, Air Force One, with the big presidential seal
on its side. A pair of Air Force enlisted men snapped to attention
as a ramp rolled into place. A long black limousine with flags
flying from its fenders stood ready, along with a queue of local
politicians and officials, some of them carrying umbrellas in a
light rain.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a dark gray double-breasted suit, Clinton chatted with
each person in the group, smiling warmly if less broadly than
usual. As usual, he was late _25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But it was, in fact, a most abnormal visit. Back in Washington,
the House Judiciary Committee was meeting to decide whether to
release the videotape of the president giving testimony about
Monica Lewinsky to a grand jury. Rep. Steve Chabot of Cincinnati, a
Republican, sits on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   After a long debate within her campaign organization about
whether being seen with Clinton Thursday would help her or hurt
her, Mayor Roxanne Qualls of Cincinnati, Chabot's Democratic
opponent this fall, turned up at the airport. Clinton asked her to
ride into the city with him, and she did.
</P>
<P>
   But she had told a reporter pointedly earlier this week, ``I am
not a close personal friend of the president in any sense of the
phrase.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democratic politicians in the region who might have found
a way to be there, had the president not been in such deep
political trouble, stayed away Thursday, for whatever reason. Gov.
Paul Patton of Kentucky sent the lieutenant governor, Steven Henry.
Neither Mary Boyle, the former county commissioner from Cleveland
who is running for the Senate in Ohio this fall, nor Rep. Ted
Strickland, a centrist Democrat whose district runs eastward across
southern Ohio from the Cincinnati exurbs, found their way to the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   In the best of circumstances, this would be a tough year for
Ohio Democrats. Gov. George Voinovich, a popular Republican, is
strongly favored over Ms. Boyle in the Senate race, and the Ohio
secretary of state, Bob Taft, the possessor of a magic Republican
name, is running well ahead in the contest for Voinovich's job. But
Democratic candidates are getting jumpier by the day.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton wondered why, he could have scanned the front page of
Thursday's Cincinnati Enquirer. There were photographs of six area
residents, together with comments they sent in response to the
paper's invitation. Two were more or less supportive of the
president, but the rest were highly critical. Two called on him to
resign and another, Jennifer Weber of Oxford, Ohio, wrote: ``How
can you stand for a moral and ethical country and help people live
the American dream when you are the epitome of America's
problems?''
</P>
<P>
   The paper received 1,464 messages and printed three full pages
of them. It said three of four people who sent faxes and letters
wanted Clinton to go; those who sent e-mail messages, mostly
younger, were more forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial last Sunday, the paper itself was harsh.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Bill Clinton has lied his way out of the most
powerful office in the world,'' The Enquirer declared. ``To endure
such a dishonest man as our national leader is more shame and
humiliation than our nation can tolerate. He needs our prayers. But
he cannot remain in the White House. If he lacks the basic decency,
honor and sense of duty to resign, he should be impeached.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite national, regional and local polls showing that a
majority of respondents want neither a resignation nor an
impeachment, those calling the Washington offices of Ohio lawmakers
obviously feel otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   A ``large volume of calls'' to Sen. John Glenn, a Democrat who
said this week that it would be ``reckless and injudicious'' for
him to join ``the rush to judgment'' in the Lewinsky matter, have
run 2-1 in favor of resignation or impeachment. Chabot's office
said the tally there was 425-15 against Clinton since Kenneth Starr
issued his report a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the president lacks vocal supporters in this state. The
Ohio Democratic chairman, David Leland, said, ``The vast majority
of Ohio Democrats want to see this president continue in office,
because they know a political lynching when they see one.''
</P>
<P>
   Even conclusive proof that Clinton lied to the grand jury in the
Lewinsky case ``wouldn't change anyone's minds here,'' Leland said
in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton got an equally fervent vote of confidence Thursday
afternoon from Stanley Chesley, the host of a fund-raising luncheon
at his house in the city's northern suburbs. Chesley praised the
president for ``monumental'' courage in the face of repeated
attacks and added: ``We need you. I need you.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the nation's leading trial lawyers, who has made a
fortune from contingency fees in cases like the Bhopal chemical
disaster and the Dow Corning implants failure, Chesley has raised
millions of dollars for Democratic candidates in recent years.
Thursday's goal was $500,000 for the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee. Considerably more than that was raised last
March at a similar event for the Democratic National Committee at
Chesley's house.
</P>
<P>
   The president contrasted his stands on Social Security, the
world economy, public education and health care with those of the
Republicans on Capitol Hill. He urged his listeners to ``look your
friends dead in the eye'' and tell them: ``It's not about
Washington. It's about America and these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington, he said, is obsessed with scandal and with itself.
</P>
<P>
   On the way to the luncheon, Clinton passed a small group of
supporters and a larger group of opponents calling for him to
resign.
</P>
<P>
   But he talked to no ordinary voters. Qualls invited him to visit
one of the Cincinnati neighborhoods that have applied for a federal
``empowerment zone'' grant. But the mayor said White House
officials had rejected the idea on the ground that a visit to one
applicant would be unfair to others.

   LINDA-SMITH-CRITICIZE (Washington, D.C.) Washington Rep. Linda
Smith, fresh off her decisive victory in the GOP primary for U.S.
Senate, yesterday criticized Patty Murray's record on education,
defense, trade, ethanol subsidies, veteran's health care, and
sexual misconduct by public officials. In particular, Smith alleged
that Murray is so compromised in her support for free trade that
she has ignored the needs of several important Washington state
agricultural groups that are being hurt in international trade
disputes. The criticisms are contradicted not only by historical
documents but also by leaders of the apple and wheat industries
interviewed yesterday.

   MIDWEST, Wyo. _ The 55-year-old president had intimate
encounters with a 24-year-old campaign volunteer in a cloak closet
off the Oval Office in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But the scandal that really smeared the memory of President
Warren Harding bubbled 75 years ago from Teapot Dome, a vast pool
of oil below treeless sagebrush flats just south of here.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the 1920s, Teapot Dome _ a classic tale of oil
tycoons, $100 bills and a jailed Cabinet member _ was the talk of
the nation. But, today in this dusty town of 495 people, the last
oil camp site left from the roaring '20s, some residents fret that
they are also losing their toehold on history. The Starr Report
could dethrone the Teapot Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scandal today isn't nothing compared to Teapot Dome,''
Pauline Schultz insisted, at her local history museum. ``It was
President Harding, Cabinet Secretaries, there were many, many
dignitaries involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Schultz deflected conversation about Harding's long string
of mistresses. She said she was unaware of new scholarship that
places Nan Britton, the former campaign volunteer, in the White
House for secret liaisons with Harding.
</P>
<P>
   On one museum wall, the 83-year-old museum curator has posted a
jazz-age photograph of herself posing coyly, draped only in the
pelt of a mountain lion. Despite this whiff of spice, she dismissed
sex scandals as second rate. Showing visitors around today, she
lectured insistently: ``The Teapot Dome scandal was the largest in
the United States. This new one would be second.''
</P>
<P>
   At the town offices next door, Melvin Dimick, a plumber who
doubles as mayor, defended Teapot's primacy, saying: ``It's right
up there at the top. That was one big financial scandal. This new
one's a little different.''
</P>
<P>
   But, even before Monica Lewinsky came along, time had not been
kind to the Teapot Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Wyoming's famous winds battered the signature landmark, a beige
sandstone formation named Teapot Rock by passing cowboys. In 1930,
a windstorm blew off the handle. In 1962 another storm blew off the
spout. Today, it is merely a garden variety butte.
</P>
<P>
   At the oil field, officially called Naval Petroleum Reserve No.
3, guard shacks stand abandoned. Next year, Lt. Doug Tunison, the
last Navy officer to be stationed here, is to leave. His departure
will end a tradition, started in 1915, of having a Navy officer
supervise the old fields.
</P>
<P>
   Today, although the reserve's valley floor is dotted with 450
working wells, the average production of each well has dribbled to
a little over a barrel a day.
</P>
<P>
   The decline of the Teapot Dome field is part of a wider oil
implosion in Wyoming, a state heavily dependent on energy royalties
to pave highways and pay for schools. Suffering from the same $12 a
barrel oil prices that have helped destabilize Russia and
Venezuela, Wyoming expects to see its government oil royalties drop
this year $40 million. Without higher oil prices to pay for new
investments, production in Wyoming, the nation's fourth largest
oil-producing state, is expected to drop by 40 percent by 2006. In
Casper, 35 miles south of here, two out of the city's three oil
refineries have closed in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Today, surveying this arid landscape where there are more capped
wells than active ones, it is hard to imagine the days when the
nation's attention burned on this 15-square-mile patch of rocks, a
barren place with such names as Dead Horse Road and Dead Dog Draw.
But in the early 1920s, this oil-soaked corner of central Wyoming
was America's Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   In 1923, Midwest had 15,000 inhabitants, many working nearby at
the Salt Creek Field, which produced 740 million barrels that year
for Casper's seven refineries. Mrs. Schultz, the daughter of a
driller, said the field here used the leading oil technology,
becoming the first in the world to use welded pipelines, and the
first to use electric motors to pump oil. A brochure for French
investors sang praises of ``le Wyoming.''
</P>
<P>
   But, about 10 miles south of Salt Creek lay Teapot Dome, an
untapped reserve on federal land that was off limits to private
companies. In 1915, with World War I raging in Europe, President
Woodrow Wilson reserved this field and others in the West to create
a secure supply for oil-burning Navy ships. Oil experts of the day
had warned that the world oil supplies were nearing exhaustion.

</P>
<P>
   In April 1921, only days after Harding's inauguration, Harry
Sinclair, owner of Sinclair Oil Co., privately negotiated a lease
on the Teapot Dome with the new Interior Secretary, Albert Fall.
Immediately, rival oil companies complained about the absence of
competitive bidding. By the time Harding died on Aug. 2, 1923,
apparently of a heart attack, the whistle was blowing on Teapot.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate inquiry discovered that after negotiating the Sinclair
contract, Fall had taken possession of Liberty Bonds that once
belonged to the oil magnate and that he had bought a large ranch in
New Mexico, making payment with a stack of $100 bills. In all,
Senate investigators said, Fall received $400,000 from two oil
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Convicted of bribery, Fall spent one year in jail, becoming the
first Cabinet member to go to prison. Sinclair spent six months in
jail for refusing to testify before the Senate inquiry. In 1927,
Harding's place in history was definitively tarnished when the
Supreme Court annulled the Sinclair contract, and Miss Britton
published a memoir, stating that Harding fathered her daughter in
1919 and that they kept up a sexual relationship while he was
president.
</P>
<P>
   After the high court's ruling, the Navy closed the field (though
an officer remained), and it was not reopened until the oil crisis
of the mid-1970s. Oil from the reserve never went to a Navy ship
but was sold by the government on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The paradox of Harding is that he died as one of the most
beloved and popular presidents, yet within a few short years, his
legacy as president and his personal reputation became permanently
damaged,'' said Carl Sferrazza Anthony, author of ``Florence
Harding: The First Lady, the Jazz Age and the Death of America's
Most Scandalous President'' (William Morrow, 1998). ``For the
general public, the revelation of a mistress and an illegitimate
child was easier to grasp than the Teapot Dome.''
</P>
<P>
   But, here the consequence of Teapot Dome was as easy to grasp.
``The scandal was so great, they had to wipe Teapot Dome off the
map,'' Mrs. Schultz said of the Navy's decision to shut the oil
field. ``We just had antelope and deer out there until 1975.''
</P>
<P>
   Without the oil field, the town of Teapot Dome vanished, leaving
only a few foundations visible today. Following a rootless pattern
of human habitation that has marked much of Wyoming in the 20th
century, residents of Teapot simply moved their houses down the
road, heading to the next boom town.
</P>
<P>
   After producing 20 million barrels since 1976, the field now has
only half a million barrels of easily recoverable oil. A Department
of Energy team works capping old wells and cleaning up
environmental damage. The department is converting the field,
equipped with 120 miles of dirt roads and about 1,000 miles of
underground pipes, into a research center on oil pipelines, working
with private companies.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government, in fact, wants to sell Teapot Dome. But,
unlike the frenzied 1920s when there was so much oil that one
drilling dispute had to be settled by a detachment of Marines, the
reserves have dwindled to the point that government officials fear
that if they open Teapot Dome to competitive bidding, they may not
get a bidder.

COMMENTARY: THE THREE QUESTIONS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By A.M. ROSENTHAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has forced the members of
Congress to face three questions, whether or not the American
people will like the answers: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two of them have already been answered. Like most Americans I
have been struggling with my own answer to the third question, or
was fleeing it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first question: Is Clinton fit to remain president? There
may be reasons that Congress considers important enough to allow
him to serve out his term _ but fit, no. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A man who risks the presidency of the United States, its moral
and political worth in American life, the confidence of the people
in it, its very ability to function under his direction, all to
satisfy himself sexually for the moment, is not stable enough
within himself to be entrusted with America. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we would all lie to save ourselves from deep sexual
embarrassment and trouble. But if we did so under oath and then
lied again and again about it, we would know we would have to do
more to escape jail than tell the judge we were real sorry.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, if this were his first lie ... But it isn't. He has lied
so often that it has become another sign of a broken rudder. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He lied during the presidential campaign _ the draft notice
matter. Then he went on to lie to the American people about their
own national interests _ how he would fight for human rights
against the Communist Chinese dictatorship, how Saddam Hussein was
complying with U.N. inspections at the very time Iraq was preparing
to end inspection, whether high-tech missile sales to Beijing could
compromise U.S. security.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Jackson said in 1992: ``I can maybe work with him but I
know now who he is, what he is. There is nothing this man won't do.
He is immune to shame. Move past all the nice posturing and get
really down in there in him, you find absolutely nothing ...
nothing but an appetite.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., was a bit gentler: ``Clinton's an
unusually good liar, unusually good.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both quotes come from William Bennett's solidly valuable new
book, ``The Death of Outrage _ Bill Clinton and the Assault on
American Ideals'' (The Free Press). Read it, particularly if you
are sure you won't agree.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Second question: Has Clinton's risk-taking already so deeply
damaged the presidency that it cannot be repaired while he is in
office? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This week I heard him give a speech at the Council on Foreign
Relations in New York about the world's economic crisis and how
``it is time for us to rise to our responsibility.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I thought: YOU call on us to rise to OUR responsibility? Other
members told me they had the same thought. One just snickered and
made a dirty joke out of the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The military cashiers or imprisons members who commit adultery,
particularly with subordinates. How in decency will William Clinton
take the salute from the men and women he commands while he whines
not to be punished for the same offense, repeated and repeated?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Americans still want him in office. That does not
change the truth that he has made the presidency a bottle of
cynical poison for many of us and a dirty joke for the country.
Damage enough. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Third: How do we repair the damage as best we can? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A motion of congressional censure would endorse Clinton's
definition of responsibility. Take the chance whatever the risk. If
caught, plead for compassion. If handed an act of censure, bite
your lip in sorrow. Then when you pass the troops in parade keep a
straight face. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The final choice, impeachment by the House of Representatives
and a removal trial by the Senate _ that's frightening to most of
us.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For about two years, a new president would be in office while
Russia fell apart, Saddam incited war and terrorists scouted
America. How strong would he be? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We do not know if Al Gore would be any better in office than
Clinton. But then we never do know about a vice president who
becomes president, do we? Maybe he will stop echoing Clinton's
apologies and evasions. Maybe he will be Truman! &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But we would know that under the Constitution we removed an
unfit man who risked and soiled the presidency while shaming
himself personally . And we will have given Bill Clinton what he
needs most _ the choice in private life to keep rocking in waves of
his own making or recover the stability he has so long lost.

EX-FBI AGENT COULD FACE CRIMINAL CHARGES, PROSECUTOR SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Defending the government's decision not to grant
immunity to former FBI agent John Connolly, a federal prosecutor
Thursday said Connolly might face serious criminal charges that
outweighed defense lawyers' desire to get Connolly on the witness
stand.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Assistant US Attorney James D. Herbert  &UR;  &LR; reminded Judge Mark
L. Wolf &UR;  &LR; that a federal prosecutor from Connecticut _ Deputy US
Attorney John Durham  &UR;  &LR; _ is leading a criminal investigation into
Connolly's dealings with informants.
</P>
<P>
   While the probe is in its early stages, Herbert said Connolly
``hypothetically'' could face charges of conspiracy to obstruct
justice, racketeering or harboring a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly, a retired FBI agent who cultivated Winter Hill
gangsters James ``Whitey'' Bulger and Stephen Flemmi as top-level
informants, has repeatedly denied doing anything illegal and has
charged he is being used as a scapegoat in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly has been at the center of much of the testimony during
lengthy &UR;  &LR; hearings in federal court but he has refused to testify,
citing his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, as the hearings wind down, lawyers for Flemmi and
his co-defendants want Wolf to order the government to immunize
Connolly, claiming his testimony could help Flemmi's case and clear
up discrepancies between Flemmi's version of events and that of
Connolly's former supervisor, John Morris.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``There are a variety of important issues that Connolly can
address,'' argued defense attorney Martin G. Weinberg, who
represents Winter Hill gangster John Martorano. ``The hole (in the
evidence) is Connolly.''
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi has claimed Morris granted him and Bulger immunity for
all crimes except murder in exchange for information on the Mafia.
Morris, testifying under a grant of immunity, has denied the claim.
</P>
<P>
   All but one of the alleged crimes in which Connolly has been
implicated _ such as tipping off Bulger and Flemmi to
investigations or being the conduit for $2,000 that Morris received
in payoffs _ occurred too long ago to be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   And the one alleged crime that occurred within the statute of
limitations _ the possibilty that Connolly tipped Bulger and Flemmi
to their January 1995 indictment _ is undercut by Flemmi's
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi has said the tip came came from Morris, who has denied
the charge.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  But Herbert said ``the notion that any tip came from John
Morris and not John Connolly is silly.'' Morris, he noted, was
working in the bureau's San Diego office at the time Bulger and
Flemmi were indicted, while Connolly, though retired, was still in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert suggested that Flemmi was trying to protect his longtime
handler by attributing the tipoff to Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the January 1995 tip, Herbert suggested that a phone
call Connolly allegedly made to former agent Dennis Condon in April
1997 could support a charge of conspiracy to obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
   During the call, Connolly allegedly advanced the notion that it
was a drunken Morris and not him who gave Bulger and Flemmi
permission to commit crimes.

`TRUE THING' IS MISSING SOMETHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - You expect the tears to start flowing at any minute in
``One True Thing.'' The emotional ingredients are there: dying
mother, sinning father, a daughter trying to do the right thing no
matter how tough it is. But the drama about how families come
together _ or don't _ during times of crisis stays surprisingly
dry.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is also curiously unengaging, unless you've been
through similar struggles and can project more into the story than
the director projects onto the screen.
</P>
<P>
   For a film dealing with the obligations of love, ``One True
Thing'' is missing something at the heart, perhaps because the
talents of the two older co-stars overshadow the lesser powers of
the star, who cannot hold onto the movie's core.
</P>
<P>
   If Meryl Streep and William Hurt had produced a daughter, I
remain unconvinced that she would turn out to be Renee Zellweger.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Jerry Maguire,'' Zellweger was a good match for Tom Cruise,
but she seems out of her depth in this more demanding drama.
</P>
<P>
   Zellweger stars as Ellen Gulden, am ambitious magazine writer
who is forced to sacrifice her career plans when she learns that
her mother Kate (Streep) is dying of cancer and her father George
(Hurt) expects Ellen to move back home and take over the nursing.
</P>
<P>
   George is a pompous college professor who has always depended on
his wife. Kate is the Martha Stewart of faculty wives, if less than
perfect as a mother.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen has spent her life trying not to become her mother,
although neither Zellweger nor director Carl Franklin ever makes
clear exactly why the daughter resents her mother so strongly.
</P>
<P>
   As Ellen struggles with her matrilineal anger, she must also
deal with revelations of her father's weaknesses over the long
months of Kate's decline.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Ellen finally comes to terms and tears with her
family issues, the movie has lost its emotional momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Zellweger plays Ellen as too sullen and unchanging to gather up
our sympathies. Her resentments of her mother seem petty, adding to
the urge to want the movie to be more about Kate and less about
Ellen.
</P>
<P>
   It's quite easy to imagine how much more power a young Streep
would have brought to the role of the conflicted daughter. Even an
older Streep has the power and grace to dominate every scene she's
in, as she takes us through the physical deterioration of a bright,
vibrant woman withering away from the inside.
</P>
<P>
   Streep's performance makes the movie worth seeing. That's true
of nearly every movie she has made over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Hurt (``Michael'') plays the remote father somewhere between
befuddlement and pain. His struggles play stronger than his
daughter's even though he has less to work with.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a woman director would have been better able to bring
more focus to the daughter's anger toward her mother.
</P>
<P>
   But Franklin (``Devil in a Blue Dress'') does manage to keep the
long movie from growing stagnant. He quickens the scenes and moves
the story, based on the Anna Quindlen novel, through time and
place.

SQUABBLING SEEN IN PRIMAKOV GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MOSCOW _ When President Boris Yeltsin relented to pressure from
parliament and appointed three aging bureaucrats to tackle Russia's
economic crisis, Moscow liberals and Western leaders warned of a
return to the Soviet past.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the Cabinet taking shape under Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov looks less and less like a government that will take the
country anywhere at all.
</P>
<P>
   As the ruble plunged and worried allies and foreign creditors
waited for clues to Russia's anti-crisis plans, the Primakov
government appeared divided over how to solve the country's
considerable economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Primakov government is starting to resemble all the previous
ones under Yeltsin _ divisive groups paralyzed by internal
squabbles, unable to implement any of their decisions, unlikely to
last long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parallel power structures are being set up'' in the new
government, wrote the influential business daily Kommersant. The
Moscow Times called the Cabinet ``a strange-bedfellows blend of
reform Communists and moderate market reformers.''
</P>
<P>
   The broad coalition of Communists and liberals in parliament
that installed Primakov has already broken up; Communist leader
Gennady Zyuganov has already begun distancing himself from the
government. A leading liberal legislator, economist Grigory
Yavlinsky, has refused a senior Cabinet post, saying he did not
want to join a ``debate club.''
</P>
<P>
   And Yeltsin told the nation he would spend another week shopping
for a new finance minister, a key post in a Cabinet that has not
decided whether it plans to pull the country back from the brink of
economic collapse by printing money or doing things to convince the
West to give Russia some.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been paralyzed ever since Aug. 17, when the default
on $40 billion in debts touched off the ruble's nosedive, caused
the country's banking system to shut down and dashed foreign
confidence in Russia's markets.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the ruble, which lost some 30 percent of its value on
the streets of Moscow on Wednesday, was weaker again, trading for
15.80 per dollar compared with an official 12.45 on Wednesday. It
was worth 6.5 a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   With labor leaders planning a mass demonstration Oct. 7 that
organizers Thursday said could get out of control if workers, owed
billions of rubles in back wages, do not get paid, Primakov has
made paying off late wages his first priority.
</P>
<P>
   To fund this, Primakov's Communist first deputy Yury Maslyukov,
60, and the newly appointed Central Bank chairman, Viktor
Gerashchenko, 60, have advocated abandonning the austerity programs
backed by the International Monetary Fund, which over six years
brought inflation down but left millions of Russians without cash.
</P>
<P>
   But First Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Shokhin, appointed
Wednesday, Thursday criticized calls to print rubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any talk about (monetary) emission provokes inflation,'' said
Shokhin. Shokhin also picked a fight with the government's acting
chief tax inspector, Boris Fyodorov, saying someone else would get
the job. In a statement, Fyodorov refused to quit.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russia's Central Bank appeared to be pursuing a plan
to print more money. An official said banks could free up their
funds by exchanging their near-worthless government securities for
cash. This plan, according to the bank's deputy chairman, Andrei
Kozlov, would be funded by the new rubles.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was likely to fuel the suspicions of foreign investors
that the Russian government would bail out insolvent Russian banks
while Western creditors would be stiffed.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to these concerns, Shokhin said the government would
try to work out a new deal on the bad loans with foreign banks to
revive confidence in Russia. Shokhin also expressed hope that the
IMF would kick in with the next $4.3 billion installment of a $22.6
billion package that was agreed on in July, but postponed after
Russia defaulted on its debt payments.
</P>
<P>
   Russian and Western business leaders say Russia will need
outside help avoid defaulting on its foreign debt payments. The
trouble is convincing the West to give that help.
</P>
<P>
   The American Chamber of Commerce in Russia said U.S. companies
were cutting back jobs after losing $469 million in Russia during
the latest government crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all...believed in the reform process,'' chamber president
Scott Blacklin said. ``And now it turns out we were wrong.''

   BOSTON _ Even here in one of the most Democratic states in the
country and one of the most liberal cities, President Clinton has
been unable to escape withering criticism for his sexual affair
with a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   As the House Judiciary Committee in Washington debated the
release of his taped grand jury testimony, Clinton arrived Thursday
afternoon for a fund-raising dinner Thursday night in the wake of
harsh comments by a leading Massachusetts Democrat who refused to
attend the dinner, which was expected to raise more than $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview that appeared Thursday in The Boston Herald,
Thomas Finneran, the speaker of the Massachusetts House and a
Democrat, referred to the Watergate scandal of 24 years ago and
said President Clinton ``almost makes Nixon look like a moral
giant, the way it is going.''
</P>
<P>
   Stopping short of calling for Clinton's resignation, Finneran
said of the scandal: ``It's not just a stain on Bill Clinton's
presidency. It's a stain on the office of the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Finneran could not be reached Thursday for further comment. His
chief of staff, William Kennedy, said the speaker left Wednesday
night for a weeklong business trip to Portugal. Kennedy said that
he did not hear the interview in which the remarks were made but
that their sentiment accurately reflected Finneran's views.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran's comments are among the strongest delivered by any
Democrat since Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel,
sent his report to Congress last week, accusing Clinton of perjury,
obstruction of justice and other violations. While the accusations
have left many Democrats ambivalent _ supportive of Clinton's
policies but chagrined over his personal behavior _ few have spoken
out so sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Harshbarger, who won the Democratic primary for governor
on Tuesday, also criticized Clinton in the article, calling his
behavior ``a terrible lapse in judgment.'' But Harshbarger tempered
his remarks with praise of administration policies and said he
planned to attend Thursday night's dinner.

 &HT;    AirTran forecasts quarterly loss
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- AirTran Airlines says unchecked predatory pricing
this summer by Atlanta rival Delta Air Lines has ``destroyed'' its
chance for a profitable third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The low-fare carrier also blamed the Department of
Transportation, which it said ``completely abandoned'' efforts to
rein in predatory pricing by major airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prior to the DOT's total capitulation, AirTran was on plan for
a solidly profitable year,'' AirTran said in a statement Thursday.
``Beginning in June, predatory pricing by our major competitor has
now cast serious doubt on whether the airline will be profitable
for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``So dramatic was this action by our major competitor that it
has destroyed our opportunity for a profitable third quarter,''
said the airline, which will post the quarterly results next month.
</P>
<P>
   Delta and the DOT, in separate responses, rejected AirTran's
assertions as unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the free enterprise system works, and it's not for
the weak or meek of heart,'' said Delta spokeswoman Laura Gillig.
``If you give customers what they demand, they'll respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the culprit, red ink for the summer would be a
step backward for AirTran. In the spring quarter the airline,
formerly ValuJet, logged its first profit in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Executive D. Joseph Corr said then he expected the profits
to continue as new marketing programs attracted passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Most airlines will post strong summer profits, thanks to high
demand, steady capacity and low fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   PaineWebber analyst Samuel Buttrick said AirTran's inability to
sustain profits is foreboding: ``If you're not making money in the
current environment, it's not exactly clear to me when you're going
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Orlando-based AirTran's major flight hub is in Atlanta, where it
competes head to head with Delta, which typically offers some seats
at matching prices.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran executives have periodically complained Delta's
practices qualify as predatory pricing. The term has a hazy legal
definition but generally means swamping routes with matching fares
to soak up low-fare demand. AirTran said Delta this summer
escalated its activities, though it cited no specific cases.
</P>
<P>
   The DOT, acting on complaints by several small airlines, last
spring issued proposed rules to better define predatory pricing and
punish violators.
</P>
<P>
   Delta and other major airlines attacked the rules as
``re-regulation.'' At their request, the DOT twice extended the
comment period, now set to end Sept. 25. AirTran fears the
guidelines are being effectively tabled.
</P>
<P>
   Corr, in AirTran's statement, said the agency's message is
``resoundingly clear: It is now open season on carriers providing
affordable fares, and the DOT will dismiss any complaints of
anti-competitive practices ... as `whining.'''
</P>
<P>
   A DOT spokesman said, ``When our guidelines are final we will
take vigorous action when warranted'' to stop unfair practices.

 &HT;    French authorities block Coke's plan
 &HT;    By Mickey H. Gramig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- French antitrust authorities have blocked Coca-Cola
Co.'s $883 million purchase of Orangina from Pernod Ricard SA, a
decision rival Pepsico hailed as ``a victory for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pepsico, which first cried foul about the deal in December
when Atlanta-based Coca-Cola announced its plans to buy the fizzy
French citrus drink, may face a second round.
</P>
<P>
   The Conseil de la Concurrence, France's antitrust authority,
``has indicated that there's an open door for further
consideration,'' said Coca-Cola spokesman Rob Baskin. ``We're going
to continue to evaluate our options.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico had argued Coca-Cola's purchase of Orangina would lead
to its ``immediate eviction'' in France because Orangina bottles
and distributes its beverages for sales at cafes, hotels and
restaurants throughout the country. These ``on-premise
consumption'' sales make up about 50 percent of Pepsico's French
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Before Thursday's ruling, the odds for approval appeared to be
in Coca-Cola's favor. The French government reviews about 45
competition cases a year and had blocked only three acquisitions
outright since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of the earnings impact, it's irrelevant, but
psychologically, it's a blow to Coke,'' said Caroline Levy, a
beverage analyst with Schroder Wertheim. ``I can't remember the
last time that they lost a deal that they wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Chief Executive M. Douglas Ivester told analysts and
investors in June that the company planned to expand Orangina's
distribution. ``In the hands of the Coke system, Orangina could be
turned into a successful niche product,'' Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, it's the No. 2 soft drink in France, second only to
Coke, and it's extremely strong in the United Kingdom, Orangina's
second-largest market.
</P>
<P>
   Orangina loyalists in the United States, where the drink barely
registers a blip on the sales charts, hoped the acquisition would
mean easier access to the beverage. It's made with 12 percent
orange juice and 2 percent pulp. The brand sells 53 million cases a
year worldwide, including an estimated 1.5 million in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust authorities said the acquisition would give Coke an
unfair competitive advantage in France, where data from industry
tracker Beverage Digest show Coca-Cola has a 49.6 percent share of
the overall carbonated soft drink market, compared with Pepsico's 9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   For drinks consumed outside the home in France, the Orangina
purchase would give Coca-Cola a 99 percent market share for
carbonated orange drinks, a 98.7 percent share for cola drinks and
a 98.5 percent share for lemon-lime drinks.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, as it now stands, will probably ``further
embitter'' Coca-Cola and Pepsico against each other, said John
Sicher, publisher of Beverage Digest. ``The nature of the
competition and the level of adversarial feelings between these two
companies will now be ratcheted up a few notches.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides their battles in the marketplace, Pepsico and Coca-Cola
have ongoing court fights over Pepsico's claim its rival has stolen
employees and bottlers in India, and that Coca-Cola is using unfair
trade practices to dominate the U.S. fountain soft drink market.

 &HT;    Headlines halt markets' rallies
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The buying rally that gave Wall Street a four-day, 6
percent-plus gain early this week fell apart on the eve of today's
quarterly ``triple witching'' session.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts blamed a series of events for the Thursday turnaround,
starting with sharp losses in foreign markets after Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan's congressional testimony that U.S. and
other central banks are not planning coordinated interest rate
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese officials subsequently appeared to yield to opponents
of an important government-sponsored bank reform plan, sending
Japan's Nikkei stock index to a 12-year low.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton increased the likelihood of a
congressional impeachment by saying Wednesday he will remain in
office.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee, meanwhile, was reported to be on
the verge of releasing the president's videotaped testimony to
Kenneth Starr's grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Investors responded to all this on Thursday with a broad
sell-off that depressed all major stock averages.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark Dow Jones industrial average dropped back below
8,000 again, losing 235 points in early trading before late program
buying trimmed the loss to 216.01 points.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect today's session to be volatile if nothing else
because of ``triple witching,'' the quarterly expiration of stock
options, index options and index futures.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's events undid the brief buying rally initiated last
Friday when Starr's report was released, showing no new surprises
about the president.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 6.2 percent in that
four-day rally, the S&AMP;P-500 stock average by 6.7 percent, the
technology-weighted Nasdaq composite by 6.6 percent and even the
beleaguered Russell 2000 small-stock index by 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Now, analysts at Standard &AMP; Poor's say in their latest market
forecast that stocks are likely to trade within a wide price range
for months to come, with stock averages ending the year only
``modestly above the current level.''
</P>
<P>
   John J. White, research director for Interstate/Johnson Lane,
agreed ``what we're seeing are elements of a trading range,'' Dow
Jones News Service reported.
</P>
<P>
   He said major stock indexes will not be able to break out of the
range, either up or down, ``until there's some reason to feel
better or worse.''
</P>
<P>
   In this environment, investors paid little attention on Thursday
to two favorable government economic reports: that the
international trade deficit widened by a less-than-expected 2.1
percent in July to $13.9 billion, and that the Consumer Price Index
rose only 0.2 percent, just slightly above analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Bank and consumer stocks got hammered in Thursday's trading.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the next round of third-quarter earnings reports
that are released next month will have a lot to do with where the
market goes.

<P>
   ATLANTA -- The bride won't be the only one wearing white next
spring, thanks to a flashy new line of men's formal wear by
Athens-based tuxedo maker Men's Apparel Group.
</P>
<P>
   Men's Apparel Group, which manufactures tuxedos under the labels
After Six, Oscar de la Renta and Raffinati, unveiled its new styles
Thursday at the Marriott Marquis downtown, where formal wear
manufacturers and buyers gathered for their annual convention and
trade show. The prime buying opportunity of the year, this year's
expo is the biggest in the group's 25-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Rainbow Collection is a new wrinkle in the
traditional black tuxedo market, a $1 billion industry that stays
alive by dressing up the two big fashion events in a man's social
life _ prom night and wedding day. Men's Apparel Group jazzed up
its tux line with a patented zip-in collar that allows the wearer
to mix and match lapel colors with vests, ties and bridesmaid's
dresses in a variety of colors ranging from pink to avocado green.
</P>
<P>
   Renting vs. buying
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bold statement. White is becoming more important, but
I'd have to say we're cautiously excited about it,'' said Dan
Santucci, president of the International Formalwear Association and
vice president of Sacino's Formalwear, a 23-store chain based in
St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers and specialty stores are also eyeing the growing
retail segment of the industry. Men who rent tuxedos more than
three times a year are starting to realize that buying a tux makes
more sense, said Jack Springer, IFA's executive director. ``If
you're over 30, you should buy a tux,'' Springer said. ``You can
wear it over and over and it never goes out of fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Men's Apparel Group, which sells its tuxedos for $300 to $1,500,
has just expanded its retail business to include accessories and
designer cologne.
</P>
<P>
   Norcross-based Marbella International was launched six years ago
with a strict commitment to the retail end, said Chief Executive
Karl Chiu. Marbella, which makes its own Gianni line in two
overseas factories, sells basic black tuxedos for $300 to $350,
predominantly in Gingiss Formalwear.
</P>
<P>
   While disastrous for some apparel manufacturers, the corporate
casual look that is in vogue has been good for the formal wear
industry, said Bennett of Men's Apparel Group. ``Today there are
more formal weddings than ever before,'' he said. ``When you're
casual all week, you want to dress up,'' said Bennett, who added
that the company also has started making black and navy suits for
rental because men don't own as many suits now.
</P>
<P>
   Demographic trends suggest a steady business for the industry
over the next five years. The pool of high schoolers is on a steady
increase, creating demand first for prom and graduate wear and
weddings that likely follow. The number of weddings has stayed
fairly steady over the past five years, peaking in 1997 at 2.4
million.

 &HT;    Florida deal with tobacco companies get sweeter
 &HT;    By Shirish Date
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE _ Florida will more than double its take from
cigarette makers over the next five years, courtesy of Minnesota's
recent settlement with the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of $1.46 billion between this fiscal year and 2002-03,
Florida will get $3.21 billion _ a 120 percent increase, Gov.
Lawton Chiles announced Friday. Overall, the state will receive
$12.75 billion instead of 11 billion over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have pounded another nail into tobacco's coffin,'' Chiles
boasted.
</P>
<P>
   Other provisions in Minnesota's agreement that would apply to
Florida include a prohibition of payments from tobacco companies to
film producers for the appearance of their cigarettes in movies as
well as a ban on promotional gear like backpacks and T-shirts
bearing tobacco logos. Florida's own settlement last year banned
tobacco billboards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big tobacco will no longer be using our kids as walking
billboards,'' Chiles said.
</P>
<P>
   The additional money and restrictions come to Florida because of
a ``most favored nation'' clause in last August's settlement, which
guarantees that Florida will benefit from all such provisions in
the industry's subsequent agreements with other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``An already outstanding deal for Floridians just got better,''
said Attorney General Bob Butterworth, who appeared with Chiles at
a Capitol news conference announcing the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Butterworth also detailed an arbitration agreement that he hopes
will end an attorneys' fees squabble that has marred the
multi-billion dollar victory. Eight of the 11 private trial lawyers
who represented the state have signed on to a deal that would pay
them for their work as early as December.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers who agree to the arrangement would share in a $100
million advance in coming days and weeks, to count toward whatever
the industry and trial-team chosen arbitration panel chooses to
award, Butterworth said.
</P>
<P>
   Chiles' victory over tobacco has been sullied by the insistence
by some of the lawyers the state hired to honor their contract that
promised them 25 percent of whatever the state got.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer's settlement agreement called for the industry to
pay all attorneys fees; the dissident lawyers point out that their
contract was with the state, not the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got no contract with tobacco,'' said West Palm Beach's Bob
Montgomery. ``They are my enemies. I tried to put them out of
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery, as well as Pensacola's Bob Kerrigan and Fort
Lauderdale's Sheldon Schlesinger, are the three lawyers still
holding out for the full 25 percent. The state Supreme Court is
scheduled to hear arguments on Nov. 5 whether a quarter of all
tobacco industry payments should continue to be set aside in an
escrow account for attorneys fees.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the state can expect $123 million in January, $465
million in January 2000, January 2001 and January 2002 and $233
million in January 2003, in addition to the already scheduled
payments from the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have the extra money, sure,'' said Rep Jim King,
R-Jacksonville, who as budget chairman will have an extra $93
million next year and $348 million the year after, even after 25
percent is set aside. ``That's very nice.''

 &HT;    Techno-savvy audiences take in two days of sessions for women
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- This is definitely not your brother's technology
conference. The Women in Technology regional conference under way
at the Cobb Galleria Centre through today aims to give its
attendees more than just the latest facts about hyperlink
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in the early '90s to address the needs of women working
in technology fields, the organization's goal is to help women and
girls pursue careers in technology. An estimated 400 to 500 women
from as far away as Massachusetts and California and as nearby as
Clayton County will attend the two-day seminar. Topics such as
emerging technologies and electronic commerce and issues concerning
women of color and how young girls can profit by technology will be
addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to provide a certain amount of diversity in the
speakers and topics we address,'' said Cathryn Gawne, chief
operating officer of WITI International. She said attendees at
previous WITI events had requested more basic workplace speakers
and sessions to compliment the high-tech component of the show.
Gwane also said WITI's approach attempts to give women business
skills as well as technical skills.
</P>
<P>
   The WITI approach was highlighted by morning keynote speaker
Debra Benton, president and founder of Benton Management Resources
Inc. Her company specializes in teaching presentation skills and
overall effectiveness in the workplace. ``Make sure the message you
send is the message you intend,'' she told the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Benton's motivational speech on workplace tips was followed by
breakout sessions. Attendees sat elbow-to-elbow at the emerging
technologies seminar. Because this was WITI's first pass through
Atlanta, speakers were unsure how techno-savvy the audience would
be, which led to some uneven presentations. However, the highly
technical questions about download time, embedded encryption
technologies and Netscape's open standards proved Atlanta's women
in technology are as plugged in as their peers in New York, San
Francisco or anywhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Bridging the ``digital divide'' was the topic of Mayor Bill
Campbell's lunchtime keynote. ``Besides the Civil Rights struggle,
nothing (else besides technology) has the ability to (do more to)
unite and divide society,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell also spoke about his own 9-year-old daughter and her
future in the world of work and technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want all doors to be open to her,'' he said as he praised
the audience for its technology savvy, adding more young women
should be encouraged to pursue science and technology careers and
WITI was an excellent place to help foster girls' enthusiasm for
high-tech.

 By LISA W. FODERARO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Howard Sanders had garnered the trappings of American
success: a degree from Harvard Business School, a position with a
high-powered Manhattan investment firm and an apartment on Central
Park West.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanders, who is black, felt so strongly about one day owning
a home in Harlem, where he had grown up, that it became a condition
of his marriage proposal. Today, he and his wife, Karen, live in a
five-bedroom brownstone with a Japanese garden on West 147th
Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to live next to a white family,'' Sanders, 32,
said. ``I effectively have integrated. I've gone to predominantly
white schools. I work in a white firm, and I can live anywhere I
want. It really is psychologically soothing for me to be in
Harlem.''
</P>
<P>
   What started in the early 1990s as a trickle of young
African-American lawyers, doctors, professors and bankers moving
back to Harlem and other historically black neighborhoods seems now
to have reached the flood stage.
</P>
<P>
   Black professionals are snatching up 5,000-square-foot
brownstones off avenues named for black leaders. And their
financial commitments extend beyond new boilers and restoring
woodwork; they are also looking to bring the amenities they had
found in Soho and the Upper West Side to neighborhoods that, while
on the upswing, are still marked by abandonment and a dearth of
shops and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Falling crime rates, relatively low housing prices, striking
residential architecture and signs of economic renewal are all
factors in the influx of affluent young black people to
historically black neighborhoods. But certain intangibles _
Harlem's storied place in the black consciousness, a new
generation's changing sensibility about integration, simple
idealism _ have played a role as well, scholars and new arrivals
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an economic incentive because you can basically get
housing for 30 to 40 percent of what you'd pay 25 blocks away,''
said Darren Walker, who gave up a doorman building in midtown
Manhattan and a career in the bond department of a Swiss bank to
move to Harlem and become a vice president of the nonprofit
Abyssinian Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I have always had a fascination with the Harlem of legend
and folklore,'' he said. ``Reading the writers of the Harlem
Renaissance created a lot of mythologies in our heads. I just feel
this visceral kind of connection that I don't know how to
describe.''
</P>
<P>
   Real estate brokers say there has also been a parallel increase
over the last five years in buyers without those connections _
white families and a small number of Asian-Americans _ who are
simply attracted by the amount of space and bygone splendor their
money can buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got houses up there with Honduran mahogany and 24-karat
gold leaf molding in the dining rooms,'' said Willie Kathryn Suggs,
a broker who estimates that buyers who are not black now account
for about 30 percent of her clients for row houses and
condominiums. ``To be able to have that kind of house in the city
is attractive to all kinds of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Other brokers say that the percentage of new buyers who are not
black is probably lower, between 10 and 15 percent, but that the
number is increasing more rapidly than the number of black buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Suggs cited as one example a white couple _ the husband is a
lawyer and the wife is a business consultant _ who closed last
month on a row house in the Hamilton Heights neighborhood, and who
told her they were interested in attracting theater companies to
the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers say they have seen the effects of Harlem's pull. Housing
prices in West Harlem have risen 20 percent in five years,
according to R. Kenyatta Punter, a broker with the Harlem-based
Myers, Smith &AMP; Granady realty agency. Hard to market in the early
1990s, brownstones are now selling briskly, at prices ranging from
$80,000 for an abandoned shell to $450,000 for a house in perfect
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the homes predate the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s,
which is when many black people moving to New York chose to live in
Harlem, in part because it had a surplus of rental apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the 1930s and accelerating through the '40s and
'50s, large numbers of black professionals left Harlem, although a
small middle-class presence remained through the decades, said
Winston James, an assistant professor of history at Columbia
University who specializes in the Harlem Renaissance. Their
departure followed the decay of apartment buildings during the
Depression and new opportunities for integration in places like
Brooklyn and Queens.
</P>
<P>
   James said the recent return of well-to-do blacks began in the
early 1990s and now seems ``to be expanding tremendously.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense of idealism among a large number of black
professional young people,'' he said. ``There is a terrible
frustration about the condition of black people in the society
despite the progress of many members of the professional class. I
suppose one of the ways people attempt to make some kind of
contribution is by their physical presence.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That is certainly true of Dr. Michael Jones. A 29-year-old ear,
nose and throat resident at Mount Sinai Medical Center, Jones said
he decided to move to Harlem after receiving both his undergraduate
and medical degrees from Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important for me to be in Harlem because I needed a
sense of purpose,'' he said. ``Being in Chelsea or Tribeca or the
Upper East Side, I wouldn't feel that my presence could make a
difference. Children on my block say, `Hey, Doc.' They see me
working hard. And because they can see it and touch it, they may
feel it's something they can attain.''
</P>
<P>
   His home, on West 147th Street between Convent and St. Nicholas
Avenues, is a handsome 6,000-square-foot brownstone in the leafy
section known both as Sugar Hill and Hamilton Heights.

 &HT;    French authorities block Coke's plan
 &HT;    By Mickey H. Gramig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- French antitrust authorities have blocked Coca-Cola
Co.'s $883 million purchase of Orangina from Pernod Ricard SA, a
decision rival Pepsico hailed as ``a victory for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pepsico, which first cried foul about the deal in December
when Atlanta-based Coca-Cola announced its plans to buy the fizzy
French citrus drink, may face a second round.
</P>
<P>
   The Conseil de la Concurrence, France's antitrust authority,
``has indicated that there's an open door for further
consideration,'' said Coca-Cola spokesman Rob Baskin. ``We're going
to continue to evaluate our options.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico had argued Coca-Cola's purchase of Orangina would lead
to its ``immediate eviction'' in France because Orangina bottles
and distributes its beverages for sales at cafes, hotels and
restaurants throughout the country. These ``on-premise
consumption'' sales make up about 50 percent of Pepsico's French
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Before Thursday's ruling, the odds for approval appeared to be
in Coca-Cola's favor. The French government reviews about 45
competition cases a year and had blocked only three acquisitions
outright since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of the earnings impact, it's irrelevant, but
psychologically, it's a blow to Coke,'' said Caroline Levy, a
beverage analyst with Schroder Wertheim. ``I can't remember the
last time that they lost a deal that they wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Chief Executive M. Douglas Ivester told analysts and
investors in June that the company planned to expand Orangina's
distribution. ``In the hands of the Coke system, Orangina could be
turned into a successful niche product,'' Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, it's the No. 2 soft drink in France, second only to
Coke, and it's extremely strong in the United Kingdom, Orangina's
second-largest market.
</P>
<P>
   Orangina loyalists in the United States, where the drink barely
registers a blip on the sales charts, hoped the acquisition would
mean easier access to the beverage. It's made with 12 percent
orange juice and 2 percent pulp. The brand sells 53 million cases a
year worldwide, including an estimated 1.5 million in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust authorities said the acquisition would give Coke an
unfair competitive advantage in France, where data from industry
tracker Beverage Digest show Coca-Cola has a 49.6 percent share of
the overall carbonated soft drink market, compared with Pepsico's 9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   For drinks consumed outside the home in France, the Orangina
purchase would give Coca-Cola a 99 percent market share for
carbonated orange drinks, a 98.7 percent share for cola drinks and
a 98.5 percent share for lemon-lime drinks.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, as it now stands, will probably ``further
embitter'' Coca-Cola and Pepsico against each other, said John
Sicher, publisher of Beverage Digest. ``The nature of the
competition and the level of adversarial feelings between these two
companies will now be ratcheted up a few notches.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides their battles in the marketplace, Pepsico and Coca-Cola
have ongoing court fights over Pepsico's claim its rival has stolen
employees and bottlers in India, and that Coca-Cola is using unfair
trade practices to dominate the U.S. fountain soft drink market.

 NEW YORK: Hamilton Heights.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With Jones' BMW parked out front and his carefully tended pink
and white impatiens in back, the house has become a beacon for
young people tempted to give Harlem a try. ``I started having
networking parties and became a funnel for a lot of young black
professionals who wanted to find brownstones here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One drawback is the lack of stores and services. Although ground
was recently broken for Harlem USA, an ambitious retail and
entertainment complex on 125th Street that is to include the area's
first Gap and Disney stores, commercial development farther north
has been spotty.
</P>
<P>
   ``When friends come to visit or when I'm tired and want to grab
a quick cup of gourmet coffee, I absolutely wish those amenities
were here,'' Jones said. ``But it's my dream to make them happen.
It's up to us to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Having already carved out a busy sideline in real estate
development by buying, renovating and selling old brownstones and
boardinghouses, mostly in Hamilton Heights, Jones is now determined
to fill the void of stylish restaurants with his latest venture,
the Sugar Hill Cafe. The plan calls for a combination coffeehouse,
restaurant and jazz club on three floors of a brownstone at 458 W.
145th St.
</P>
<P>
   Jones bought the building in June for $300,000 with two partners
who are also Harlem residents: Dineo Khabele, a fellow in
gynecology-oncology at Montefiore Medical Center, and her husband,
James Hunter, an engineer. The three plan to spend $450,000 to
renovate the tattered turn-of-the-century building, where the
original oak floors and elaborately carved mantelpieces are still
intact. They are now seeking financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the most affluent neighborhood in Harlem,'' Jones
said, ``without any quality dining establishments within walking
distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Other black professionals are considering buying franchises to
open businesses like florists and copy centers. The franchise
chains are expanding into Harlem and four other city neighborhoods
through a new program sponsored by the Local Initiatives Support
Corp., a nonprofit group in Manhattan, and Bankers Trust Co.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsors are recruiting entrepreneurs to team up with local
community development groups to buy the franchises, benefiting from
below-market financing and looser equity requirements. The first
such franchise, a Sterling Optical store, opened in Harlem on Sept.
2 on the corner of 125th Street and Lenox Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   While no hard numbers exist to document the movement of black
professionals to Harlem, the higher real estate prices speak
volumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last five years, it has really gained momentum,'' said
Sherman Edmiston, a Harlem real estate agent whose wife, Essie
Green Edmiston, owns an art gallery there. ``We are getting more of
the younger people coming here with the idea that they want to be
part of the rebuilding of Harlem. They've got fresh ideas and a
considerable amount of money.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the Edmistons were pioneers in deciding 10 years
ago to move their home and art gallery from Park Slope in Brooklyn
to Harlem. Like many parts of the city, Harlem was then still in
the violent throes of the crack epidemic, and art meccas like SoHo
or 57th Street would have seemed a more likely choice for their
gallery, which sells the art of such black masters as Jacob
Lawrence and Romare Bearden.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we felt that our concentration is really on developing the
collections of black collectors, and there's a poetry to our being
in Harlem as opposed to being downtown,'' said Edmiston, who also
works in the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   The couple might have also considered Bedford-Stuyvesant, a
historically black community in Brooklyn that has plenty of scruffy
bodegas and garish beauty parlors but is known for its beautiful
brownstones. It, too, is drawing black professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis A. Watkins, district manager of Community Board 3, which
covers Bedford-Stuyvesant, attributes the trend to rising housing
prices in more gentrified Brooklyn neighborhoods like Park Slope
and Brooklyn Heights. ``You can buy the same town house in Bed-Stuy
for $250,000 that would sell for a half-million dollars in Park
Slope,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But for Monique Greenwood, the executive editor of Essence
magazine, and her husband, Glenn Pogue, a broadcast engineer for
WNBC-TV, money was not the only motivator. ``We could easily go to
the suburbs,'' she said, ``but we're about rebuilding our
communities and living in them.''
</P>
<P>
   One concern the couple had was the public schools. Ms. Greenwood
said that while she wanted her 6-year-old daughter, Glynn, to
attend a public school, ``I wasn't convinced that I wanted my child
to suffer because of my political beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   After checking out several private schools in Brooklyn, as well
as the public elementary schools, the couple decided that Glynn
could receive as good an education in the gifted program in their
neighborhood school as in private school. But they knew it would
mean more involvement on their part.
</P>
<P>
   During the last school year, the couple met weekly with other
parents, teachers and administrators as part of the school-based
management team to discuss issues, from the curriculum to grant
money. In the spring, they sat on the selection committee
responsible for hiring the new principal.
</P>
<P>
   Like Dr. Jones in Harlem, Ms. Greenwood also missed the
smorgasbord of services in wealthier New York neighborhoods. So
she, too, took matters into her own hands. Three years ago, she and
her husband opened Akwaaba Mansion, a lavish bed-and-breakfast in
the 18-room house that is also their home. (Akwaaba means welcome
in Akan, a language spoken in Ghana.)
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, they opened Akwaaba Cafe, a restaurant with
burgundy banquettes and light fixtures of copper wire, parchment
paper and colored glass beads. ``I realized I had to be involved in
economic development,'' Ms. Greenwood said, ``because the amenities
I would want in a neighborhood just weren't there.''
</P>
<P>
   While the commercial life of Harlem may never be as abundant or
luxurious as points south in Manhattan, that's fine with Sanders,
the investment banker. (It's easy enough, he said, to drive five
minutes south for Sunday brunch on Amsterdam Avenue.) Harlem, he
says, feeds his soul in a way that other Manhattan neighborhoods
never could.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be quite honest, there are cultural differences, and when
you live in your own community, there's not that pressure to
assimilate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm basking in my own culture when I go to the Schomberg
Center,'' he said, referring to the New York Public Library's
Schomberg Center for Research in Black Culture. ``If I lived in the
West Village I couldn't do that. I'd have to seek out activities
that brought me into contact with black professionals.''

TAPES, IF RELEASED, TO GO ON THE INTERNET

<P>
   If the House Judiciary Committee releases the videotape of
President Clinton's Aug. 17 grand jury testimony, many people will
see it for the first time on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   CNN Interactive and other Internet news services drew millions
of computer users to their Web sites last weekend, in search of
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's report on Clinton's affair with
former intern Monica S. Lewinsky. Now CNN and another news site,
MSNBC, hope to repeat the feat by broadcasting the Clinton video on
cable television and the Internet at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will stream it live as it goes on air,'' said CNN
Interactive spokesman Kerrin Roberts. ``Then our team will be
turning it into on-demand video segments.'' These snippets of
testimony will be left up on the Web site, so that visitors can
replay them at will.
</P>
<P>
   CNN will work with other Internet companies to host the video.
Broadcast.com Inc. of Dallas will use its servers to pump the video
signal onto the high-speed backbone circuits of the Internet. Henry
Heflich, the company's chief technology officer, said that his
company's computers will be able to handle tens of thousands of
viewers, and can add additional capacity as needed. Real Networks
Inc. of Seattle will also carry an Internet feed of the Clinton
video.
</P>
<P>
   To see the video, computer owners will need a computer connected
to the Internet, with a modem that can receive at least 28,800 bits
of data per second. That's the speed of most home computer modems.
Also needed: software for viewing Internet videos. The two standard
viewers, the Real Player and the Microsoft Windows Media Player,
can both be downloaded for free, and are pre-installed on many
computers.
</P>
<P>
   As with the Starr report, it's expected that the Internet has
ample capacity to handle the video. Once again, problems will arise
only if large numbers of people log on to watch the video and there
isn't enough server capacity to handle it. If that happens, viewers
will be able to watch the video on cable TV.
</P>
<P>
   No time has been set for showing the video. The House Judiciary
Committee is expected to release it in some form, but adjourned
Thursday evening without reaching a decision.

TREASURIES RALLY AS INVESTORS FLEE STOCK MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury bond prices rallied Thursday as investors
sold stocks and sought the safety of U.S. government securities.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year bond rose 22/32, to 104 29/32. The bond's yield,
which moves in the opposite direction from the price, dropped to
5.18 percent, from 5.22 percent Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three months, the 30-year bond's yield has fallen
more than half a percentage point, or 50 basis points, as global
stock markets tumble, Russia's economy falters and investors grow
more concerned that the financial crisis might spread to Brazil.
They are now at their lowest level in 30 years. (A basis point is
1/100 of a percentage point.)
</P>
<P>
   Bonds were bolstered by a government report showing that
consumer prices were little changed during August and a regional
Federal Reserve survey indicating that manufacturing activity is
beginning to slow.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management,
said, ``The rally in the bond market continues, spurred by
increasing evidence of an economic slackening, a continued
auspicious inflation outlook, a flight-to-quality resulting from
declining stock prices, and the growing market perception that a
near-term Fed easing move is clearly on the horizon.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Tuesday's testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan to the House Banking Committee did not add much to
previous comments about the vulnerability of the nation to the
global crisis, nor shed any light on whether the policy-making
group will change interest rates when it meets Sept. 29. Fine
predicted that at that meeting the Federal Open Market Committee
will adopt a bias toward easing from a neutral stance. Whenever the
federal funds rate, which has remained at 5.50 percent since March
1997, is lowered, Fine said it will in all likelihood be a
25-basis-point cut, as the Fed tends to move slowly.
</P>
<P>
   In the junk bond market, Calenergy Co., an electricity
generation and distribution company, sold $1.4 billion of senior
notes in four parts, breaking a month-long drought of new sales in
the junk bond market.

 &HT;    MEXICAN POLICE PURSUE DRUG LINK TO BRUTAL SLAYINGS OF 19 IN BAJA
REGION
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexican police are investigating whether notorious
drug traffickers ordered gunmen to pull three families from their
beds in Baja California state Thursday, line them up against a wall
and kill 19 of them in a hail of gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   The cold-blooded killings, which included seven children and a
baby in its mother's arms, shocked Mexico with its brutality.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lines of inquiry into the crime, according to Mexican
press reports, is whether the killings were ordered by the Arellano
Felix brothers, a Tijuana-based drug cartel, wanted in Mexico and
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Arellano Felix is on the FBI's ``Most Wanted List'' and
United States officials are offering up to $2 million for help in
his capture.
</P>
<P>
   The victims in the grisly pre-dawn shootings in Baja California
lived in the community of El Sauzel, which is near the Pacific
Coast city of Ensenada and about 60 miles south of the
Mexico-California border.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to describe something like this,'' said Mexican
Televisa television reporter Jaime Nieto, who observed spent
casings of AK-47 assault weapons scattered about pajama-clad bodies
and a blood-stained patio.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all the years I've been in this business I've never seen
anything like this,'' Nieto said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican government news agency Notimex reported that Baja
California Attorney General Marco Antonio de la Fuente indicated
that the killings may be linked to a dispute over drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Notimex reported that de la Fuente said one of the victims --
Fermin Castro, who is hospitalized in critical condition -- may
have been a marijuana grower for the Arellano Felix brothers.
</P>
<P>
   However, during a press conference in Baja California after the
killings de la Fuente refused to comment on Castro and said drug
trafficking was only one line of investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Baja California Gov. Hector Teran Teran was more blunt in a
statement released to the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state and county are in a state of consternation over the
killings of 19 people,'' he said. ``Based on the characteristics of
the action, it appears to be related to narcotics trafficking.''
</P>
<P>
   Teran Teran added that the crime's link to trafficking was
strong because Castro appeared to have a connection to the Arellano
Felix family.
</P>
<P>
   Castro, 35, was identified as a rodeo promoter in the Ensenada
area. Police said in addition to a narcotics connection, they will
also investigate whether Castro may have been a target of vengeance
because of a death that occurred at a rodeo he sponsored about a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Castro has gunshot wounds to the head and may not
survive.
</P>
<P>
   Television images of the death scene showed children's toys
scattered about yards and horses and cows grazing placidly, while
police and Red Cross workers scurried about.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the dead children included a two-year-old boy, a
four-year-old boy, and an eight-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   A girl of 12 was identified as one of four who survived the
killings.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that a 15-year-old girl may have
survived by rolling under a bed; she is now in protective custody.
</P>
<P>
   Overturned chairs and broken glass in the yard where the
killings took place indicated that the victims may have struggled
with their killers.
</P>
<P>
   The three families lived on a ranch called El Rodeo, outfitted
with several large homes built in a Southwestern style. The ranch
reflected a rural but affluent lifestyle, not uncommon in the
seaside resort area along Baja California's Pacific Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The border city of Tijuana, which is to the north, is one of the
heaviest sites of cocaine and other drug smuggling into the United
States. The influence of drug dealers has spread south into the
Ensenada area, which is generally a quiet tourist area.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican authorities suspect that the Arellano Felix brothers,
considered extremely violent, may have been involved in the recent
slaying of Rafael Munez Talavera, a rival drug dealer in Ciudad
Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is not just the Clinton presidency that hangs in
the balance in these fevered Washington days. Before the eyes of
the nation, Congress itself is on trial.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans still tell pollsters that they yearn for the
sordid story of President Clinton's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky to go away. Yet in an all-day meeting Thursday, a sharply
partisan House Judiciary Committee battled inconclusively over the
release of thousands more pages of documents from Whitewater
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr as well as the release of the
videotape of Clinton's testimony before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's quarrelsome session served as a prologue to the most
extraordinary of congressional duties _ impeachment. In the
Federalist papers, Alexander Hamilton called impeachment ``a method
of national inquest in the conduct of public men,'' and the
founders wrestled with who should have the awesome power to sit in
judgment on impeachments. They rejected the judiciary as too small
and possibly too subject to corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Yet could Hamilton have ever have pondered what a ``national
inquest'' might turn into in this new age of round-the-clock cable
talk shows and the Internet? Could he have forseen that the House
and Senate would be examining the most private, intimate actions of
a public man?
</P>
<P>
   These are the uncomfortable circumstances that Congress now has
to deal with, in an atmosphere made even more poisonous and
hysterical by the fact that the personal life of anyone in the
House and Senate these past few days seems to have become fair game
in the press.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, Judiciary Committee officials said they were
studying the 1974 Watergate inquiry as a model. It proved that the
nation could survive the disruption of impeachment proceedings,
even though Richard Nixon resigned before he could be voted out of
office. And it created national folk heroes like Sam Ervin, who ran
the Senate Watergate Committee, and Barbara Jordan, the freshman
congresswoman whose eloquence captivated the nation when she said
``today I am an inquisitor and hyperbole would not be fictional and
would not overstate the solemness that I feel right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Watergate is a flawed model, in part because Watergate
itself changed Congress, journalism and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress of 1974 was one in which the leaders of opposition
parties could play golf together. It was not the highly partisan
Congress of Thursday where each side nurses grudges and looks for
payback for scandals stretching from Watergate to Iran-Contra, for
the forced resignation of Speaker Jim Wright, under an ethical
cloud, or the reprimand of Speaker Newt Gingrich on ethics charges.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was the Watergate inquiry taking place in an environment
where the presumption was that everything would somehow leak to the
press. The report of the Watergate special prosecutor Leon Jaworski
remains under seal to this day in the National Archives. But
Thursday some lawmakers say they have rushed to make everything
Starr assembled about Clinton public because they saw how much of
the Whitewater independent counsel's investigation found its way
into the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had shown they could keep from leaking stuff from the
grand jury I might have had a different position,'' said Rep.
Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, who favors the fullest release of the
materials before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In this charged atmosphere, two sharply different approaches
have already emerged as the House moves ahead with a process that
is at once quasi-judicial and at once political.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are playing for the court of public opinion,
acting like the entire nation is the grand jury. ``Impeachment is
intended to be a public process,'' said Rep. Christopher Cox,
R-Calif. ``It should not be more secret than a court proceeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are viewing the House itself as the grand jury and
fighting to protect the rights of the president until and unless
impeachment _ the equivalent of indictment _ takes place. ``The
normal procedure is that unless there's a damn good reason, you
don't release grand jury material,'' said Rep. Jerrold Nadler,
D-N.Y., who serves on the House Judiciary Committee, as he worried
about the precedent being set by the House.
</P>
<P>
   Politics too underlies the position of both parties, with a
national election just seven weeks away and Republicans and
Democrats alike aware that an impeachment inquiry could affect the
balance of power for a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton's job approval ratings in polls still remains
confoundingly high, Republicans believe that a constant drumbeat of
revelations about the president's behavior with Ms. Lewinsky in the
Oval Office and attempts to cover the affair up will bring his
ratings down as the midterm election approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats know that to avoid a total rout, they have to turn the
spotlight away from the president and stop the scandal from
subsuming their attempts to talk about issues.
</P>
<P>
   A difficulty for all involved is that while Starr has raised
serious constitutional questions about perjury and obstruction of
justice, this coverup is all about sex, not about a burglary
against a political party or using the CIA to hinder an
investigation by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Inglis, R-S.C., a member of the Judiciary Committee,
says this distinction should not matter. ``It's all with the
coverup,'' he said. ``Same as with Richard Nixon.''
</P>
<P>
   But to decide such fundamental questions as whether Clinton did
commit perjury in his grand jury deposition, lawmakers may very
well have to ponder the president's attitudes toward sex and
re-examine in graphic detail what transpired between him and Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Picking his words carefully, Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., a
member of the Judiciary Committee, said, ``There are very sensitive
matters involved in this episode that no one wants to discuss in
public. It's very awkward. And I think we have to show dignity in
the way we conduct these proceeding.''
</P>
<P>
   But who can even imagine public hearings on these matters? Who
would ask the questions? Who would want to question Ms. Lewinsky?
Could anyone emerge as a hero? And what kind of dignity and privacy
would any member of Congress retain if this inquiry establishes the
rule that any politician's sex life is fair game?
</P>
<P>
   No wonder that the only area of agreement between House
Republicans and Democrats Thursday was the announcement by the two
re-election committee chairmen that thay would not finance
candidates this fall who make purely personal attacks on their
opponents.

<P>
   While most Americans approve of the way Congress is doing its
job over all, they disagree with the decision of last week to
release all of the independent counsel's main report, according to
the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually it was pretty annoying that they released it,'' said
Colette Tanner, a 22-year-old office manager from Seguin, Tex.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tanner, a respondent who was re-interviewed after the poll
had been completed, commends the work of Congress in general, but
on this she thinks the lawmakers went too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report has a lot of graphic details I didn't care to
hear,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The sexual details in the report of the independent counsel,
Kenneth Starr, are seen by most of the public as ``inappropriate''
information intended to embarrass President Clinton. The national
telephone poll was conducted with 1,813 adults from Saturday
through Monday, after the report had been posted on the Internet
and printed in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-nine percent of the respondents said they disagreed with
Congress' releasing the report in full. There is even less support
for the release of videotape of Clinton's grand jury testimony: 70
percent of all Americans polled on Tuesday night by CBS News said
they would disagree with that step.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Congress does release the tapes, I will probably have a
little less respect for them,'' said Alison Lehman, 29, who also
disapproved of the scope of Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to know about the alleged lies, but not about the
intimate details,'' said Mrs. Lehman, a day-care worker from
Rockledge, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Democrats and independents, most Republicans support
Congress' decision to release the report. But the Republicans join
the majority on the issue of the videotape. The release of the tape
in addition to the report is seen as unnecessary by 58 percent of
Republicans, 80 percent of Democrats and 72 percent of
independents.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of those polled said it was ``inappropriate'' for the
Starr report to have included graphic sexual details of Clinton's
relationship with Monica Lewinsky. In addition, 59 percent said
Starr's including such details was an effort to hurt and embarrass
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that detail is like mudslinging or name-calling,'' said
Vickie Prophitt, a 46-year-old insulation installer from Mount
Zion, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even among those who disagree with the decision to release
all the details, half approve of the overall job performance of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Those who saw Starr's report as fair and balanced _ they made up
one-third of all respondents _ were very positive in their
assessment of Congress, with 70 percent approving of the job it was
doing and 20 percent disapproving. People who considered the report
a ``one-sided look at only some of the facts'' _ half of all
respondents _ were divided in their view of Congress: 47 percent
approved, and 43 percent disapproved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress may be doing its job, but it is very upsetting and
not necessary to put out explicit sexual material,'' said Anson
Beaulieu of Bemidji, Minn., who considered the report one-sided.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I wouldn't think too much of Congress if they release the
videotapes,'' said Beaulieu, a 43-year-old self-employed auto
mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   The Times/CBS News poll had a margin of sampling error of plus
or minus two percentage points. The CBS News poll was conducted
with 429 adults and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus
five percentage points.

STOCKS PLUNGE WORLDWIDE AMID ECONOMIC JITTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices tumbled around the world Thursday after
overseas investors digested word that central banks are planning no
coordinated cut in interest rates to quell financial and economic
turmoil in Asia, Latin America and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of the release of President Clinton's videotaped
grand jury testimony in the Monica Lewinsky matter and Japanese
banking problems also weighed on stock markets, which skidded to a
12{-year low in Tokyo and finished nearly 5 percent lower in Brazil
after a plunge twice that much halted trading.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign turmoil quickly spread to the United States, where the
Dow Jones industrial average dropped 200 points in the first
half-hour before steadying for the rest of the day. It closed down
216.01 points, or 2.67 percent, to 7,873.77. The loss broke a
string of four straight gains, the first since late June, and
pushed the blue-chip indicator back into negative territory for the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Although Wall Street seemed only mildly disappointed when
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress on Wednesday
that there were no current efforts to coordinate an interest-rate
cut, overseas markets reacted by selling off sharply, and this
pressure spilled over into the U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts here said they thought Greenspan, along with
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, had sought to avoid comments that
could have reduced pressure on the House to approve $18 billion to
replenish depleted aid coffers at the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The House refused to consider the full amount anyway. Instead,
it moved ahead Thursday with a version of a foreign aid bill
approved last week by its Appropriations Committee with just $3.5
billion for the IMF. Republican leaders held out the possibility
the president might still get the full amount from a House-Senate
conference committee that will settle differences in versions of
the bill. The Senate measure contains the full $18 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, predicted Alfred Goldman, chief market
strategist at A.G. Edwards in St. Louis, ``The IMF will get their
funding. We have no choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Still another factor affecting trading was Friday's quarterly
``triple witching'' phenomenon, when options and futures contracts
expire.
</P>
<P>
   European markets slumped across the board, but the greatest fall
was in France, where the CAC 40 index fell 5.47 percent after the
communications giant Alcatel warned of lower profits, citing the
crises in Asia and Russia. Shares dived 12 1/16, to 19\, on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Leading indexes tumbled 4.99 percent in Germany and 3 percent in
London, also reflecting fears of lost business with economically
distressed countries.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, the Nikkei index fell 338.56 points, or 2.38 percent,
to 13,859.14, its lowest point since March 1986. Government leaders
worked deep into the night to find a way to reorganize the
debt-laden Japanese banking system. Stocks fell 3.61 percent in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   After absorbing the early selling, U.S. markets fluctuated in a
relatively narrow range by recent standards, but almost nothing
escaped the downdraft. All 30 Dow stocks posted losses, as did 424
of the issues in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, which
dropped 2.55 percent for the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, dominated by technology stocks,
slumped about the same amount, 2.58 percent, with Microsoft down
3\, to 104 15/16, and Cisco Systems down 3[, to 61{.
</P>
<P>
   Without minimizing the buffeting from overseas forces, many
analysts said they were not surprised by Thursday's retreat after
four sizable advances and said they remained upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pulling back into its recent bottoming pattern'' said
Richard McCabe, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch. ``It was
probably entitled to give some back after the nice bounce off
7,500'' on the Dow. He said the index could reach the mid-8,000s
within a month.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks were pummeled once again, especially major
banks with big exposure to emerging markets. Citicorp slumped 6\,
to 96{, and J.P. Morgan was the biggest contributor to the Dow's
decline, falling 5{, to 89}. American Express lost 3 3/16, to 83~.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette, which on Wednesday warned of lower sales, saw its
stock skid 3 5/16 Thursday as Merrill Lynch trimmed its estimate of
the company's earnings to between $1.30 and $1.35 a share for this
year and $1.55 for 1999, 5 cents less than before. The shares
closed at 36~ after trading as high as 62 21/32 in early April.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble, another blue chip that warned recently of
weaker results, fell 3 Thursday, to 67. Other prominent decliners
were Lucent Technologies, which dropped 4 7/16, to 72[, and
Northern Telecom, which fell 6 1/16, to 39{.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange swamped gainers
by nearly 5 to 1 as 255 made new lows compared with only 21 new
highs.
</P>
<P>
   Volume was moderate at 692.56 million shares, well below that of
most recent sessions. Traders said they spotted no surge of
activity related to the unwinding of positions in advance of
Friday's triple-witching expiration of futures and options.

 &HT;    JonBenet exhumation is just a rumor
 &HT;    By Craig Schneider
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Rumors that JonBenet Ramsey's body might be exhumed
from her Marietta grave ignited when a local television news
station, citing unnamed sources, said Colorado officials had
inquired about the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The reporter made clear that the calls to local officials were
preliminary and procedural, just in case the Colorado grand jury
decided another autopsy was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Cobb County officials have been flooded with media
calls. Denials from the Boulder, Colo., police and prosecutors have
done little to slow the interest. Fuel was added to the fire when
Cobb County Medical Examiner Joseph Burton was seen on television
confirming that Cobb officials had received some calls.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Burton declined to discuss the matter. People in his
office said the story had been blown out of proportion. They said
they didn't know who made the calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now all we've heard is a lot of rumors,'' said Cobb
County Superior Court Judge Conley Ingram, stressing that his
office has received no calls or requests for a Ramsey exhumation.
</P>
<P>
   While several media outlets have run follow-up stories, some
newspapers, such as the Rocky Mountain News in Colorado, have
declined to run anything on the so-called story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically we're trying not to run rumors on this story,'' said
Deborah Goeken, assistant managing editor for news. ``We would want
to confirm it to the best of our ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Media expert Alan Caruba said conditions were perfect to create
a whirlwind of rumor. The Ramsey grand jury was meeting for the
first day, so the pressure was on for news stories, but the meeting
was secret so there was little to report.
</P>
<P>
   Though the initial story was filled with qualifiers, subsequent
reports added weight to the rumor and made the possibility of
exhumation sound more and more real, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dubious story,'' said Caruba, a former editor for a
directory of media contacts and writer whose work has appeared in
The New York Times. ``But the pressure is on for journalists to
find new angles on an ongoing story. But there may not be a new
angle for days.''
</P>
<P>
   The public's interest in this story is heating up again. News
crews have been seen photographing JonBenet's grave in St. James'
Episcopal Church Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Eastep, 56, came from Maryland to visit the grave on
Thursday. It was his third trip. He said JonBenet reminded him of a
girl he used to baby-sit, who helped lift his spirits after he
suffered a bad car accident. ``She's my little guardian angel,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For an exhumation to occur, Boulder prosecutors must request
permission from a Cobb County Superior Court judge, and must make a
compelling case that additional evidence could be obtained. In such
a scenario, Ingram said he would allow the Ramseys to have their
say, though the judge could rule against their wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Exhumations are rare in Georgia, with only about three a year,
said Dr. Kris Sperry, the state's chief medical examiner. Having
read the girl's autopsy, he does not see any value in exhuming the
body.
</P>
<P>
   ``To call it a media circus would be a gross understatement,''
he said. ``This would be insane.''

 &HT;    Pest free: Delta won't let a roach fly in coach
 &HT;    By Joe Earle
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Can cockroaches fly?
</P>
<P>
   Not without tickets, apparently.
</P>
<P>
   At least not Thursday on a Delta Air Lines flight from Atlanta
to California.
</P>
<P>
   Delta officials delayed Flight 217 from Hartsfield International
Airport to San Francisco for more than three hours after crew
members and passengers discovered cockroaches on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're obviously not going to accept anything less than a
pest-free plane,'' said Delta spokeswoman Laura Gillig.
</P>
<P>
   The flight originated in Atlanta and was supposed to leave about
9:15 a.m. But shortly after the crew and passengers boarded the
Lockheed L-1011, they spotted ``a handful'' of roaches near the
food service area, Gillig said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot then refused to fly the plane, Gillig said.
</P>
<P>
   Delta gave the passengers coupons for lunch at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The airline called the infestation ``an isolated incident'' and
said the passengers flew out on a roach-free plane about 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   No other similar incidents were reported Thursday, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, exterminators spray passenger planes at night, during
layovers between flights, Gillig said, and finding roaches on a
plane was highly unusual. ``That's why it concerned everyone enough
to get another plane,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Delta officials did not know Thursday how the roaches got onto
the plane. They were discussing the situation with representatives
of Dobbs International Services, which provides meals for Delta
flights, and with representatives of the pest control company,
Gillig said, to try to determine the source of the bugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You thought the Year 2000 bug was bad?'' she said. ``Let me
tell you ...''

HOUSE REPUBLICANS ASK FBI TO INVESTIGATE ALLEGED SMEAR CAMPAIGN BY
WHITE HOUSE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republican leaders Thursday accused the White
House of orchestrating a smear campaign against GOP House members,
including Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Henry Hyde, and urged
the FBI to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   The White House vehemently denied that it was behind recent
disclosures of House members' past sexual indiscretions, including
an Internet magazine story about Hyde's five-year extramarital
affair in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Hyde, R-Ill., whose panel is deciding whether to
hold impeachment hearings against President Clinton, White House
Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles said any staffers participating in
such gossip would be fired.
</P>
<P>
   However, the GOP leadership was not convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are deeply troubled by recent media reports indicating that
certain individuals may be engaged in a systematic attempt to
intimidate Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde and other
elected members of the House from doing their constitutional duty
by promoting prurient allegations about their personal lives to the
media,'' the Republicans wrote in a letter to FBI Director Louis
Freeh.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these reports are true, the actions of the individuals
responsible are pure and simple intimidation _ no different than
threatening jurors to change their verdicts in organized crime
trails,'' they said. ``Therefore, we urge you to investigate these
reports in an effort to determine whether any individuals _ inside
or outside of the White House _ have made efforts to undermine the
lawful and constitutional work of the Judiciary Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI issued a statement saying it will review the House
leadership's allegations. ``Appropriate steps will be taken to
determine whether a violation of federal law has occurred,'' the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas and the third ranking Republican in the
House, said it was no coincidence that the story of Hyde's
30-year-old affair broke on Wednesday, the day before the Judiciary
Committee began debate on whether to release Clinton's videotaped
grand-jury testimony about this affair with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky. ``This is not politics as usual,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay joined seven GOP colleagues in signing the letter to
Freeh. DeLay said Hyde's private life has ``nothing to do with him
carrying out his job as chairman.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay initiated a daylong attack on the White House with a
speech on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I urge the president of the United States to stop his allies
from engaging in this disgusting conduct,'' DeLay said. ``This is a
very sad day for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Republican Rep. Dana Rohrbacher of California said, ``We
will not be intimidated; we will not be blackmailed.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the GOP attacks, Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, said his party
would not support any candidate who exploits an opponent's
checkered personal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our candidates will win in November if they engage in a debate
on issues like HMO reform, Social Security and education,'' said
Frost, who chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
``Attacks of an intimate personal nature only make the electorate
more cynical about the democratic process.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Linder, of Georgia, who chairs the Republican House
campaign committee, made a similar pledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initiating a personal attack on anybody running for office is
simply off limits,'' Linder said. ``We are soon going to have no
one of any stature willing to put themselves through this wringer,
and it is sad for America.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican attacks on the White House followed a report in
the Internet magazine Salon that Hyde, then an Illinois state
legislator, had an extramarital affair with Cherie Snodgrass, who
was also married at the time, from 1965 to 1969. Hyde confirmed the
report but vowed his committee would continue the review of
independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report alleging that Clinton
committed 11 impeachable offenses in trying to cover up his
relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statute of limitations has long since passed on my
youthful indiscretions,'' said Hyde, who was in his 40s at the time
of the affair.
</P>
<P>
   A retired Florida salesman, Norm Sommer, claimed credit Thursday
for giving the magazine the story about Hyde's affair. He said the
White House wouldn't call him back when he sought to tell his story
and many newspapers also declined to use his information. Salon was
the ``last on my list,'' he told the Associated Press. He said he
learned of the affair during a tennis match with Snodgrass' former
husband about six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The revelations about Hyde's past followed similar disclosures
about other Republicans this month.
</P>
<P>
   House Government Reform and Oversight Committee Chairman Dan
Burton, R-Ind., whose panel is investigating alleged campaign
finance abuses by Clinton, admitted to fathering a child during an
extramarital affair in the 1980s. Rep. Helen Chenoweth, R-Idaho,
acknowledged that after her divorce she had an affair with a
married man in the 1980s. Both confessions came after newspapers
began investigating their pasts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spokesman Mike McCurry has denied GOP accusations that
the White House was behind those disclosures. ``If someone from the
White House was engaged in any such activity they would no longer
be on staff,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay and other Republicans pointed a finger at White House aide
Sidney Blumenthal, who had been named in television news reports as
trying to shop the Hyde story.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to DeLay, House GOP leaders who signed the letter to
Freeh included Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.; Majority Leader Dick
Armey, R-Irving; Deputy Whip J. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.; Conference
Chairman John Boehner, R-Ohio; Conference Vice Chairman Jennifer
Dunn, R-Wash.; Linder; and Policy Chairman Christopher Cox,
R-Calif. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jane Eisner, the editorial page editor of The Philadelphia
Inquirer, knew the jagged contours of the debate before it started.
Long before the release of the independent counsel Kenneth Starr's
report, it was clear that some colleagues believed, passionately,
that President Clinton's deceit made him unfit to remain in office.
An equal number felt just as passionately that his resignation now
would weaken the nation's most cherished institutions.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Eisner said she was not expecting the feelings of
profound exhaustion and ``nausea'' she experienced when finally,
after two and a half hours of anguished arguments, Chris Sattulo,
the deputy editorial page editor, went to write the Sunday
editorial that began with the words ``Bill Clinton should resign.''
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, The Inquirer, once a staunch supporter of the
president, was one of at least 115 daily newspapers in the country
_ out of more than 1,500 _ to make the same plea to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But the informal tally boards that list newspapers like The
Inquirer, The Chicago Tribune, The Daily Oklahoman and The San Jose
Mercury in a ``resign'' column cannot reflect the depth of debate
at these papers. Old friends and colleagues find themselves
bringing to the discussion, explicitly or implicitly, religious
convictions, attitudes about sex and adultery, and their sense of
the Constitution's mandates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is far weightier than most we deal with on a
day-to-day basis,'' said Don Wycliff, the editorial page editor of
The Tribune, which on Tuesday also called for the president's
resignation. ``It's one that everybody has an opinion on _ or
virtually everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back at the debate that led up to the resignation of
President Richard Nixon in 1974, Wycliff added: ``It's a debate
that, frankly, as I said in one of the early editorials, I had
hoped I wouldn't see having to repeat twice in a lifetime. Yet it's
come to that.''
</P>
<P>
   But he is not sure that newspaper editorials on such subjects
mean as much as they once did. ``This is like when you make a
presidential endorsement _ people don't any more look to newspapers
for guidance on that as they may have once in the past. You're
making more of a statement about yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   The editorial board of The Tribune _ which had endorsed
Clinton's opponents in both the 1992 and the 1996 elections _ was
also divided, but not as sharply as The Inquirer's. According to
Wycliffe and Steve Chapman, a board member who opposed the final
decision, the board was split about 2-to-1 in favor of the
resignation call.
</P>
<P>
   At The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, which has generally supported
the president and his policies, the ratio was different and the
paper declined to call for resignation. According to Christine
Bertelson, the editorial page editor, and William Freivogel, the
deputy editor, most of the 10-member board are still opposed or
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``My vote tends to go back and forth, Ms. Bertelson said. ``What
we're trying to do is balance our personal sense of moral revulsion
against the broader issue: what does this do to the presidency?''
</P>
<P>
   Saying that she and her colleagues were ``trying to step back
from the daily melodrama,'' she added, ``If he were my employer, my
employee, my colleague or my husband I'd say, `Pack your bags,
pal.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's my president,'' Ms. Bertelsen continued. ``Whatever
happens to his soul or to his marriage or to his sexual neurosis,
that's his problem. He's got to deal with that in another arena
where I don't have any business being, and the country doesn't have
any business being.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Bronson, the editorial page editor of The Cincinnati
Enquirer, said on Thursday that he and the six colleagues on his
editorial board had earlier urged readers to withhold judgment on
the Starr investigation until the report came out. ``As soon as we
saw the Starr report and got knee deep, we said, `This really
smells, we've seen enough, the evidence is compelling and
damning,''' Bronson said.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper, a longtime Clinton opponent, called for the
president's resignation in an editorial on Sunday. It reiterated
the call on Thursday because the president was in town. Commenting
on the public safety burdens of a presidential visit, the newspaper
said on Friday, ``We'd object to that any time, but today it is
especially odious _ one more insult added to the insufferable
injuries you have done to our nation and the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Editorial pages are perhaps the clearest expression of
publishers' viewpoints. In some of the recent deliberations,
publishers have taken direct part; at the Chicago Tribune, Mr.
Wycliff said, Monday's meeting was attended by the publisher, Scott
Smith, the editor, Howard Tyner and Jack Fuller, the president of
Tribune Publishing Co. the newspaper's parent.
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Enquirer's editorials were signed off on by that
paper's president and publisher, Harry Whipple.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, publishers did not participate in the deliberations
of the The Post-Dispatch or The Philadelphia Inquirer. Among the
country's largest newspapers, USA Today has called for resignation;
The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post
have not.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a general practice, we don't discuss the details of
Editorial Board deliberations,'' said Howell Raines, the editorial
page editor of The New York Times. ``But we have a position that
we've defined in a series of editorials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've said that the debates over impeachment and resignation
ought to reflect in large measure the judgment of the American
people, expressed through Congress, on whether President Clinton
should remain in office. We've acknowledged that this is a process
that may take some time to unfold and argued that it could be
resolved through a negotiated settlement built around a
congressional censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said that an essential feature of any settlement would be
that it recognized the sanctity of the law by requiring the
president to acknowledge that he testified falsely under oath.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, The Philadelphia Inquirer had locked itself into a
decision back in January when it had editorialized, ``If,
sorrowfully, the President of the United States obstructed justice,
suborned perjury or committed perjury, he should resign.''
</P>
<P>
   The earlier, provisional call for resignation was on Ms.
Eisner's and Satullo's mind as the meeting convened at about 4 p.m.
Ms. Eisner laid out the board's options: calling for resignation,
calling for the president to stay in office or avoiding the issue.
</P>
<P>
   One of The Inquirer's columnists, Trudy Rubin, who has been
particularly critical of the independent counsel's investigation,
spoke first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trudy's first point, among many, was that one thing we could
say was that the release of this report was a grave constitutional
error,'' Sattulo recalled. ``Trudy also feels very strongly that
the investigation is improper and tainted.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rubin would not comment on the deliberations themselves, but
did say, ``The subject matter under discussion is possibly the most
important domestic issue in many of our careers. It involves
institutions, not just a man. There are very serious disagreements
on our editorial board and in the country about whether this
process is going to weaken those institutions and is going to
function in the proper fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Eisner said, ``There was a great deal of discussion saying,
`It's too soon, let's wait,''' ``I was not satisfied with that. So
I tried to lead them through a conversation: what would make the
difference?'' between calling for resignation or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would public opinion make a difference? Well, how do we judge
public opinion? Would his effectiveness in office make a
difference? How do we judge his effectiveness in office? I hoped I
was doing that to make people realize that we had come to a
conclusion,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With two members absent, the colleagues were evenly split. It
was a difficult moment in a process that usually operates by
consensus, in which votes are rare. With consensus impossible,
hierarchyy took over, and Ms. Eisner and Satullo's position was
adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Readers responded in surprising numbers. According to Kevin
Ferris, who edits the letters to the editor and community voices
sections of the newspaper, about 500 readers faxed, E-mailed or
called the paper on Sunday and Monday. The E-mail response was
split 50-50 he said; but about 60 percent of the callers wanted the
president to remain in office.

IRAN CLOSES A LEADING NEWSPAPER AND ARRESTS TOP EDITORS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS JEHL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ In a new setback for political moderates, Iran
has closed a leading daily newspaper and arrested its top editors
for publishing articles deemed detrimental ``to the country's
national interests and security.''
</P>
<P>
   The action, announced on Wednesday by the Islamic Revolution
Court, came hours after the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, issued an ultimatum against the ``creeping excesses'' of
an increasingly free-wheeling Iranian press.
</P>
<P>
   With its wholehearted embrace of President Mohammad Khatami's
calls for greater openness in Iranian society, the newspaper, Tous,
has regularly infuriated Iranian conservatives by challenging
accepted policy. It had questioned the wisdom of Iran's hard-line
stand against the Taliban movement in Afghanistan, and the
authorities apparently cited that as the reason for halting its
presses on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Founded early this year, the highly popular newspaper has
escaped two previous court-ordered closings, once by changing its
name. But several Iranian political analysts said the handling of
the current case suggested that the shutdown could well be
permanent and _ at a time of high tensions over Afghanistan _ could
presage wider restrictions on public expression in the name of
public security.
</P>
<P>
   The arm of Khatami's government that is supposed to regulate the
press responded with a thinly veiled complaint against the action,
carried out by public prosecutors more closely aligned with
Ayatollah Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any press crime should be tried in a public and open court and
with the presence of a jury,'' the ministry of culture and Islamic
guidance said in a statement Thursday. The Islamic Revolution Court
operates behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   Among those arrested were the newspaper's editor, Mahmoud
Shamsvolazein, and the director of its publishing company, Hamid
Reza Jalaipur, according to the official Iranian news agency.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no obvious sign of a schism between Khatami and
Ayatollah Khamenei over Afghanistan, the target of a mounting
Iranian military buildup and vociferous threats over the killing
there of a number of Iranian diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   But many of Khatami's supporters have expressed private concern
that the crisis with Afghanistan might draw attention from his
declared quest to ease the restrictive atmosphere of Iranian
society. And some have seen in Ayatollah's Khamenei's recent harsh
words toward Afghanistan and his direct call for a crackdown on
``enemies of the revolution in the press'' a possible sign that
conservatives hope to use the crisis to regain the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six months the rivalry between supporters of
Khatami, a relative moderate, and conservatives aligned with
Ayatollah Khamenei has claimed several victims.
</P>
<P>
   One was the mayor of Tehran, Gholamhossen Karabaschi, a close
ally of the president who was sentenced in July to five years in
prison after being convicted of corruption charges that his
supporters say were politically motivated. Another, the former
Interior Minister, Abdollah Nouri, was forced from office by the
conservative-dominated Parliament in June, in part because of his
outspoken support for Karabaschi. Two weeks ago Nouri and another
Khatami lieutenant, Ataollah Mohajerani, the minister of culture
and Islamic Guidance, were beaten by thugs after attending a Friday
prayer service.
</P>
<P>
   In general, in the crisis between Iran and the Taliban over the
killing of Iranian diplomats, newspapers here have reflected a
broad spectrum of views about possible military retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   But Tous, already more daring than most in publishing criticism
of Iran's religious rulers, had also suggested that Iran might be
wiser to talk to the Taliban than to confront them with military
force. In a week in which Ayatollah Khamenei has warned that a war
could be near and has called for nationwide demonstrations against
the Taliban, that was apparently more than the authorities could
bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are capitalizing on the war psychosis, I think, to try to
strengthen their position,'' Dovoud Bavand, a professor of
international law at Tehran University, said of Iranian
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Khatami won 70 percent of the vote in presidential
elections 16 months ago, Ayatollah Khamenei, the unelected supreme
leader, remains commander in chief, and he and other conservatives
maintain a tight grip on most important levers of power.

<P>
   If and when the House releases President Clinton's grand jury
testimony on videotape, much of the nation will get to see all four
hours almost immediately. CNN, Fox News Channel, MSNBC and a
variety of websites will carry it in full and without commercial
breaks as soon as they receive the feed from the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   But the major news networks appear to be taking a wait-and-see
attitude, wrestling with what Sandy Genelius, a CBS News
spokeswoman, described as ``uncharted territory, because of
material that may offend many people.''
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday night, CBS had still not decided whether it would
show parts of the testimony soon after the tape became available,
and if so what parts and how much, or whether, Ms. Genelius said,
``to put it on the air as it comes in.'' But the network has
decided to put the complete testimony on its website immediately,
except for a 20-second delay in case it is deemed necessary to edit
any words considered objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   ABC and NBC both plan to broadcast portions of the testimony
when it is first released, on the assumption that anything
objectionable is not likely to appear until later in the tape, and
to incorporate additional portions into regularly scheduled
newscasts. But the testimony will be broadcast simultaneously and
without interruption on the websites of both networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason for the different standard between networks and
their websites,'' Ms. Eileen Murphy of ABC said, ``is that everyone
has access to our network, including lots of children. On the
website you have to deliberately seek it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Most networks said that their decisions were made after debate
and discussion that ranged from polite to spirited. John Moody,
vice president of news editorial for Fox, said there were four
executive meetings to discuss such concerns as ``the widely held
suspicion there might graphic words and anatomical discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox would repeat the broadcast overnight and again early
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   C-Span, not unexpectedly, plans to broadcast the video in its
entirety, but not until 8 p.m. ET if it is released Friday. ``We're
committed to provide gavel-to-gavel coverage of the House,'' said
Richard Fahle, C-Span's spokesman, ``and since we're not in a race
for ratings, we'll put it on at a time when most Americans turn
their TV sets on for the night.'' But it will immediately put the
video on its website and broadcast it on its local FM radio
station.
</P>
<P>
   `We'll also re-air the video over the weekend,'' Fahle said.
``But we're not going to overplay it.''

SPAIN'S LEADERS WARY OF BASQUE REBELS' CEASE-FIRE DECLARATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ The conservative government and the opposition
Socialist Party both reacted cautiously Thursday to the first
``indefinite'' cease-fire announced by the Basque guerrilla group
ETA in its 30-year battle for an independent homeland.
</P>
<P>
   But three smaller Basque nationalist parties, including one
linked to the guerrillas, expressed optimism that the truce could
lead to a lasting peace, although the rebels vowed for now to
retain their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said from Lima, Peru, where he
is on an official visit: ``After 30 years of terrorist activity we
cannot give ETA the benefit of the doubt. If ETA really wants to
end its path of death, it should know that credibility comes with
deeds, not words.''
</P>
<P>
   Aznar survived a bomb attack by the ETA in 1995, when he was the
opposition leader.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year the rebel group _ whose initials in the Basque
language stand for Basque Homeland and Liberty _ has killed five
town councilors belonging to Aznar's Popular Party. As a result,
police guards are now assigned to more than 100 of the party's
local officials.
</P>
<P>
   Both the government and the Socialists have insisted that there
can be no talks until the rebels, who have been accused by the
authorities of causing 800 deaths, renounce violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not content with a truce,'' said Joaquin Almunia, the
Socialist Party's secretary general. ``We want peace, which means
the permanent abandonment of arms, and respect for the law and the
results of elections.''
</P>
<P>
   The cease-fire, announced in a communique late Wednesday and due
to take effect Friday, comes just before the Oct. 25 elections for
the Basque regional parliament, where the moderate Basque
Nationalist Party has governed in minority for 10 years with
support from the Socialists.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja warned earlier in the week
that the anticipated truce offer could be a ploy to gain votes for
the nationalist parties. Last Saturday they seemed to bury their
own political differences by making a united appeal for peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
   ETA has observed four limited truces since 1981. The new
unconditional cease-fire comes when 535 convicted ETA members or
suspects are in Spanish jails. Dozens more are imprisoned in
France.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish government and courts have also cracked down on
ETA's supporters. Last December the Supreme Court sentenced all of
the top 23 leaders of the leftist Herri Batasuna nationalist party
to seven years in jail for collaborating with the rebels. In July a
judge shut down the newspaper Egin, in which ETA published its
communiques.
</P>
<P>
   Another paper, Euskadi Informacion, soon opened to replace it,
and published ETA's latest cease-fire communique. The Herri
Batasuna party, which has about 12 percent of the vote in the
Basque region, selected new leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The cease-fire communique said there was a ``unique occasion''
to advance Basque sovereignty. It derided as inadequate the
home-rule powers that Madrid has already accorded the three main
Basque provinces, whose 2 million residents have their own
parliament, taxing powers and a regional police force.
</P>
<P>
   But Aznar indicated Thursday that further autonomy would not be
given easily. ``Our constitutional and legal framework,'' he said,
``have been the constant references in the search for peace and
they continue to be fully in force.''

CHINA DETAINS TWO APPLICANTS FOR NEW PARTY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Just days after dissidents in several parts of China
met small but encouraging signals when they applied to register a
political party, their counterparts in Beijing this week
encountered a different fate.
</P>
<P>
   Two dissidents who were about to submit a similar application to
the Beijing government have been detained and questioned by the
local police in the last 24 hours, and told not to proceed with
their request.
</P>
<P>
   One longtime advocate of democracy, Ren Wanding, who has spent
more than 10 years in custody, was taken from his house Thursday
afternoon for questioning and returned Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The other applicant, Ma Shaohua, a student leader of the
protests in 1989 in Tiananmen Square, was detained for four hours
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several of us had decided to go tomorrow to apply to form a
party,'' Ren said in a telephone interview after his release
Thursday night. ``They told me I couldn't go.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last 10 days three groups of dissidents have applied to
form branches of what the dissidents plan to call the China
Democratic Party. Dissidents from different regions have written
party bylaws that stress democratic principles like the election of
officials and regard for human rights. But the principles also
stress cooperation with President Jiang Zemin and the governing
Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   No party has been permitted to form since the Communist state
was founded in 1949. Because China has no clear procedure for doing
so, the dissidents are trying to register their new party as a
social organization.
</P>
<P>
   Last week two groups, in Shandong and Hubei provinces, received
what they considered somewhat encouraging responses from local
officials who, rather than rejecting the applications outright,
outlined the conditions for registration, a moderate fee, a
specified headquarters and a list of the local party's leaders and
members. A group of dissidents from the three far northeastern
provinces mailed a similar application to the Civil Affairs
Ministry here.
</P>
<P>
   Three months earlier, in Zhejiang province, a similar request
resulted in weeks of imprisonment for the applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Dissidents and scholars have wondered whether the apparent
change represents a new central government policy, dissent within
the government over how to handle such requests or an effort to put
on a good face for Mary Robinson, the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights, who completed a 10-day visit to
China on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The detentions Thursday suggest, at the very least, that China
has not relaxed the central policy.

GUNMEN SLAY 19 IN MEXICAN MASSACRE

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Gunmen dragged men, women and children from three
houses before dawn Thursday near the Pacific Coast port of
Ensenada, lined them against a wall and riddled them with bullets.
</P>
<P>
   At least 18 people _ including an infant and six other children
_ were killed on the spot. One person was reported to have died
later.
</P>
<P>
   Police offered no clear motives for the killings. But a Mexican
news agency said a man who has ties to a powerful drug-smuggling
organization, was critically wounded in the attack, and Mexico's
national media and political leaders speculated that the massacre
was linked to narcotics trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen swept into El Sauzal, a community about 60 miles
south of San Diego, Calif., about 4:30 a.m. Thursday. They entered
a compound where the three houses were located, forced the victims
into a courtyard and opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican television images from the scene showed the victims
laying in front of a low wall, all either dressed in pajamas or
partially or fully naked, as if given no time to dress by the
killers. Hundreds of spent bullet casings, from either AK-47
automatic rifles and 9 mm pistols, littered the ground near the
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Children's bikes and other toys stood mute in the yard and the
concrete porches of what appeared to be expensive houses set behind
an elaborate iron fence. El Sauzal sits about six miles north of
Ensenada on the main coastal highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears they rounded them all up, lined them up and gunned
them down,'' said Jose Ramon Espinosa, a state police agent in
Ensenada.
</P>
<P>
   Notimex, the government's news agency, quoted Baja California
state prosecutor, Marco Antonio de la Fuente, as saying the
surviving victim, Fermin Castro, worked in the marijuana growing
operations of the powerful Arrellano Felix narcotics organization.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, however, he said that there was no clear
motive for the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   The gang, headed by four Arrellano Felix brothers, is based in
Tijuana and smuggles much of the Mexican marijuana and heroin and
Colombian cocaine into the United States. Authorities say the
Arrelano Felix brothers' gang now comprises Mexico's most powerful
and bloody cocaine and narcotics trafficking organization.
</P>
<P>
   A port and fisheries center about 60 miles south of the border
on the coast, Ensenada is a popular weekend destination for many
Southern California residents.
</P>
<P>
   Although the level of violence pointed to by the massacre has
been rare in Mexico, local reporters said Thursday that the
Ensenada area has recently been racked by gangland killings and
police busts linked to Mexico's narcotics trade.
</P>
<P>
   But the Arrellano Felix brothers' many feuds with rivals have
left hundreds of dead this year in Tijuana, the border city an
hour's drive north of the site of Thursday's massacre. The brothers
have been blamed for the attempted assassination last fall of Jesus
Blancornelas, a Tijuana newspaper publisher who has often
campaigned against the smugglers and their alleged protectors
inside the Mexican government.
</P>
<P>
   Members of a well-to-do Tijuana family, the Arrellano Felixes
are widely assumed to be Mexico's dominant narcotics smuggling
organization since the death last year of Amado Carrillo Fuentes,
whose own gang was based in Ciudad Juarez, across the border from
El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Another powerful Juarez drug traffickers, Rafael Munoz Talavera,
was murdered last week in Juarez. U.S. and Mexican police suggested
Munoz was killed in the ongoing struggle to replace Amado Carrillo
as the principal trafficker in that area of the border and
predicted more deaths.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Scores of Mexican army troops and state and federal police
agents swarmed into the compound where the massacre took place,
blocking access to reporters on the scene. Roadblocks reportedly
were thrown up in the area throughout the day in hopes of turning
up suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Massacres involving women and children are rare in the Mexican
underworld. But such killings occur occasionally in the
drug-producing mountains of southern Guerrero and Oaxaca states. &QL;

 &HT;    Expect to fall into the next season with bright and beautiful
colors
 &HT;    By John Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Out of the misery of a hot and dry summer may come an
extra-lovely autumn in the Southern highlands.
</P>
<P>
   The region's experts in forestry and ecology predict the long
dry spell will produce spectacular leaf colors from the humped-back
ridges of North Georgia to the high peaks of the Tennessee Smokies.
</P>
<P>
   Foliage likely will peak one to 10 days earlier than the typical
late October color zenith, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have drought, we have good color,'' explained botanist
Dan Pittillo of Western Carolina University near Sylva, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   One of the deans of Southern Appalachian ecology, Pittillo has
seen 32 autumns in the southwestern corner of North Carolina, about
30 miles from the Georgia line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, this will be a pretty fall, especially at the
high-to-mid elevations,'' agreed Jim Petranka, associate professor
of biology at the University of North Carolina at Asheville. ``In
the valleys the color may not be as good. The valleys have really
had extended drought and the trees are already losing their
leaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the temperate world's most diverse forests, the southern
Blue Ridge is home to 150 tree species, more than on the entire
continent of Europe. This diversity helps explain why no two years
are exactly the same for fall color.
</P>
<P>
   One year, the yellow-gold of the poplars and the orange of the
maples may be intense, while in others it is the crimson of the
oaks and the orange of the gum trees that stand out. Take last
year: The colors on average were not as bright as normal, but the
duration of the season was remarkable, with brilliant hues
lingering almost to Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes fall in the Southern Appalachians so great _
even in so-called bad years, there is always plenty of color,''
Pittillo said.

 &HT;    Interviews remember '96 Games
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The Atlanta Olympics are destined to be the best
documented Games in history.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation is assembling an
Olympic oral history, which will contain hundreds of hours of
videotape and thousands of pages of transcripts recording
recollections of the 1996 Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really adds the human interest to the whole Games
experience,'' said Linda Stephenson, executive director of the
foundation, the nonprofit organization responsible for maintaining
the archives of the Games. ``Everyody seems to have a story to
tell, and we want to hear them.''
</P>
<P>
   The oral history project will be launched with a two-day public
event this weekend at the Atlanta History Center. About 50
invitees, including Olympic staff, athletes, local businesspeople
and politicians, will give in-depth interviews. But regular folks,
be they Games spectators, volunteers or out-of-town visitors, also
will have the opportunity to share for posterity their defining
Olympic moment.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals will be videotaped on a first-come, first-served
basis with about two minutes allowed to tell their story. Officials
such as Olympic chief Billy Payne and ceremonies producer Don
Mischer will be recorded for 30 minutes each and the public can
watch the tapings. Longer follow-up interviews will be conducted
later with officials and volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Every interview from athletes, such as handball team captain
Matt Ryan and gymnast Kerri Strug, to the Atlantans off the streets
will be taped, transcribed and cataloged. The oral history will be
archived at the Atlanta History Center _ alongside the rest of the
story.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic Games Collection already contains about 1,500 boxes
of documents, 3,900 hours of video footage, 300,000 photographs and
5,000 objects including uniforms, ceremonies costumes, lapel pins
and assorted souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   Other histories of the Games have been captured in print and on
film. The ``Official Report'' of the Games published last year
required three volumes and 1,500 pages of very small type to tell
the behind-the-scenes story _ from the beginning of the bid process
in 1987 to the closing ceremony Aug. 4, 1996. And Olympic
cinematographer Bud Greenspan's official three-hour film of the
Games, ``Atlanta's Olympic Glory,'' is in re-runs on television.

JEWISH SETTLER HELD AFTER PALESTINIAN TEEN IS SLAIN, ANOTHER HURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A Palestinian teen-ager was killed and another was
wounded Thursday in the West Bank when a Jewish settler fired at a
group of Palestinian youths.
</P>
<P>
   The settler later surrendered to police, saying stones had been
thrown at his car. A spokeswoman for the Israeli police said
details of the incident were being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting, in the village of Beitunia, occurred at a time of
rising tension in the West Bank, after Israeli troops killed two
brothers, fugitives from the militant Islamic group Hamas, last
week near Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths of the brothers, Imad and Adel Awadallah, inspired
pledges of revenge from Hamas and set off several days of
stone-throwing protests in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Youths who said they witnessed the shooting Thursday insisted
that it had been unprovoked, although they acknowledged that there
had been stone-throwing clashes with Israeli soldiers in the area
this week.
</P>
<P>
   The youths said two settlers fired from their car at a group of
teen-agers returning from the Beitunia high school, hitting two in
the stomach. Jewish settlers use a road through the village to
reach their communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no stone throwing and no need for shooting,'' said
Hassan al-Qadi, a high school student who said he had been at the
scene. ``They were shooting randomly.''
</P>
<P>
   One victim, Iyad Qarabseh, 17, died in a hospital in Ramallah
from what a doctor described as bullet wounds from an M-16 rifle, a
weapon that Israeli settlers and soldiers carry. Another pupil was
wounded by the same ammunition, the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting added to the pessimism surrounding a mediation
effort by the U.S. Middle East envoy, Dennis Ross, who has
apparently made little progress this week in bridging gaps between
Israelis and Palestinians that have stalled peace negotiations for
18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of settler violence that is contributing to
the demise of the peace process,'' Nabil Shaath, a member of the
Palestinian Cabinet and a senior negotiator, said. ``Without
serious Israeli action this is going to create such an explosive
situation that it is really very difficult to see how we can
contain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross, who pressed on with his mission in Gaza, said, ``Anything
that makes it more difficult to reach an agreement is the last
thing we want to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross, who had been expected to leave the region Friday, has
extended his visit until Saturday, a U.S. official said.

LINDA SMITH LASHES OUT AT OPPONENT PATTY MURRAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. Rep. Linda Smith, fresh off her decisive
victory in the GOP primary for U.S. Senate, Thursday attacked Sen.
Patty Murray's positions on education, defense, trade and sexual
misconduct by public officials.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith's accusation that Murray has ignored the needs of
Washington state apple and wheat growers was immediately
contradicted by leaders of both those industries.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference outside the U.S. Supreme Court with other
GOP lawmakers from Washington state, Smith alleged that Murray is
so compromised by her support of free trade that she has ignored
the needs of Washington's two biggest agricultural commodities:
apples and wheat. Despite U.S. trade deals with many countries,
producers of apples are suffering from trade disputes with China
and Mexico while wheat farmers narrowly escaped serious harm
earlier this year when the United States temporarily banned grain
exports to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patty Murray ... has been silent on trying to get apples into
China,'' Smith said. ``She was out when we tried to get apples into
Mexico _ she was just silent when it came to those. (And) when it
came to Pakistan, if it hadn't been for Senator (Slade) Gorton and
Representative (George) Nethercutt, we wouldn't be getting wheat
into Pakistan.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the apple and wheat industries contested those
descriptions. And even a cursory review of press clippings and
Murray office records indicates that Murray has over the years
introduced legislation, held meetings with U.S. and foreign
officials, issued news releases and given speeches about the
problems facing Washington apple and wheat growers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Murray has been very supportive of our industry,''
said Kraig Naasz, president and chief executive of the U.S. Apple
Association. (Naasz is no longtime Murray fan _ he was the press
secretary for the 1992 Senate campaign of Republican Rod Chandler,
who was defeated by Murray, and he has worked for a variety of
Washington state Republicans, including Gorton.)
</P>
<P>
   Naasz said Murray ``played a critical role'' in getting U.S.
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky to pay attention to the
apple industry's problems with Mexico, which last year accused
Washington state apple growers of harming the Mexican apple
industry by exporting to Mexico apples priced below cost.
</P>
<P>
   And Naasz said Murray is in line with the apple industry's
position on trade with China, which imposes steep tariffs on apple
imports from the United States. Murray, whose position is opposite
that of Smith but in sync with that of the apple industry, supports
Most Favored Nation status for China and believes tariff disputes
would best be resolved through negotiations with China over
membership in the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   As in the apple situation, lawmakers from both parties can claim
credit for helping the wheat industry in Washington this year, when
sanctions imposed by President Clinton against Pakistan threatened
to cut off wheat exports to that nation. Republicans, who control
Congress, played a key role in passing legislation to exempt wheat.
But Murray was highly visible on the issue, introducing
legislation, speaking on the floor, communicating the importance of
the issue to the White House and then using top White House
officials to help persuade reluctant Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patty Murray has represented state and national wheat growers
effectively, and she has a staff that understands very well the
importance of agriculture in her district,'' said Bill Flory,
president of the National Association of Wheat Growers.
</P>
<P>
   Told of the apple and wheat groups' comments, Smith spokesman
Jim Troyer said the real work on behalf of Washington state wheat
farmers was done by Nethercutt, not Murray. And he said the
continuing problems facing U.S. apple growers in China show Murray
has been ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   International trade is one of numerous issues where Smith, a
two-term Republican congresswoman from Hazel Dell, differs from
Murray, a first-term Democratic senator from Seattle. Smith is a
critic of free trade, arguing that the United States has been to
quick to overlook human rights and specific trade concerns in its
eagerness to sell products, while Murray has supported free trade.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Smith also criticized Murray's positions on education,
national defense and sexual misconduct by public officials. Smith
supports allowing states to decide about education spending, while
Murray supports a stronger federal role in education; Smith
supports funding a new missile defense system, which Murray
opposes; and Smith has called for President Clinton to resign
because of his affair with Monica Lewinsky, while Murray has
expressed anger and hurt over his conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Murray's campaign spokesman, Rex Carney, criticized Smith's
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that Congresswoman Smith is already resorting
to negative attacks and distorting Senator Murray's record, but
this is what we have seen before from her,'' Carney said. ``This is
how she operates, and the people of Washington deserve better.''

HOUSE PANEL APPROVES $80 BILLION TAX CUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Ways and Means Committee passed an $80
billion Republican tax cut on Thursday, setting up a confrontation
with President Clinton over how the nation should take advantage of
its return to fiscal health.
</P>
<P>
   Defying Clinton's insistence that projected federal budget
surpluses be set aside until Congress and the administration have
settled on a plan to shore up Social Security, the committee voted
23 to 15, largely along party lines, to dip into the surplus to pay
for a package of tax reductions likely to have broad appeal to the
middle class.
</P>
<P>
   Amid a rancorous debate over how to use the surplus, Democrats
admitted that they were sorely tempted to support the tax cut, both
because it has many provisions they have pushed for and because it
is less than two months before a congressional election. But in the
end only one of the committee's 16 Democrats, Rep. Barbara Kennelly
of Connecticut, who is running for governor and lagging in the
polls, sided with the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a vow on Thursday by Clinton to veto it, the tax bill is
expected to pass the full House as soon as next week. It will then
go to the Senate, where its prospects are uncertain. The bill has
the support of most of the Senate's 55 Republicans, and could
attract some Democrats. But under the Senate's procedures, it will
need 60 votes to pass because it will require a waiver of budget
rules to permit use of the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's committee vote was an important test of Clinton's
ability to hold his party together on politically difficult issues
as he struggles to avoid impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   His call to preserve the surplus has been the centerpiece of
Clinton's domestic policy agenda this year, and any widespread
defections by party members on the issue would have signaled
concern among Democrats that the president could no longer provide
them the cover they need to vote against popular tax cuts in favor
of the more nebulous benefits of fiscal restraint.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was tailored by Republicans to have broad middle class
appeal, and its main provision is a break for married couples. It
would raise the standard deduction for couples filing jointly to
$8,600, from $7,200. The change is intended to address the
so-called marriage penalty, the quirk in the tax code that leads
many two-income couples to pay bigger tax bills than they would if
single.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would exclude from taxation the first $400 of interest
and dividend income for couples filing jointly, and $200 for single
filers. It would accelerate the timetable under which self-employed
people will be able to deduct their health insurance costs and
speed up a gradual increase in the amount of an estate exempted
from federal taxation.
</P>
<P>
   It would make changes intended to insulate moderate-income
families from the effects of the alternative minimum tax, which was
designed to apply to wealthy taxpayers but increasingly results in
a tax increase for working families. To appeal to farm state
legislators, the measure would provide tax breaks to farmers and
ranchers who have been hit by a downturn in agriculture. And to
address the concerns of lawmakers from poor districts, it would
create tax incentives for redevelopment programs.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who heads the committee, said the
bill would preserve nearly 90 percent of the coming budget
surpluses _ projected by the Congressional Budget Office at $1.55
trillion over the next decade _ while trimming a tax burden that by
some measures is the highest since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sets money aside to save Social Security and it gives
middle-income Americans the tax relief they need and deserve,''
Archer said, adding that the tax cut might also give the economy a
boost at a time when the global financial crisis is threatening to
slow growth in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also said Clinton's demand to save the surplus for
Social Security was hollow since the administration had proposed
using the surplus to pay for emergency spending for the
peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, strengthening security around
American embassies and preparing for the year 2000 computer
problem.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats said it would be irresponsible to start spending
the surplus on tax cuts before the nation determines how to deal
with the coming financial shortfall in the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they said, nearly all of the surplus for the next 10
years will come from the payroll taxes that are supposed to be
earmarked for Social Security. Not until 2006 will the government
start to run a significant surplus without counting the excess
Social Security payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for the Social Security trust fund, we wouldn't
even be showing a budget surplus,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel of New
York, the committee's senior Democrat. ``The surplus belongs to
Social Security _ it's not a spare cookie in the bottom of the jar
there for the taking.''
</P>
<P>
   Several hours before the vote, Clinton, in a speech to a labor
union group, said using the surplus would send the wrong signal to
the world about the nation's fiscal and economic stability at a
time of increasing global financial turmoil. But mostly, he said,
it would make it more difficult to make up the looming shortfall in
Social Security, which although healthy now will run short of money
in about 30 years after the baby boom generation retires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our friends in the other party say that, well, we're
projecting a surplus and it's close to the election, so let's give
everybody a tax cut,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care how close it is to the election,'' he added, ``it
is wrong to do that until we have solved this problem.''

   BANGKOK, Thailand _ In their riskiest challenge yet to the
military rulers of Myanmar, a small group of opposition politicians
said Thursday that they would act as the country's legitimate
parliament and declared all laws and proclamations issued by the
ruling junta null and void.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 politicians, led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, are members of
the National League for Democracy, which won an election in 1990 in
the former Burma for a parliament that was never allowed to take
office.
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi announced last month that she planned
to convene parliament, the military responded with its biggest wave
of arrests since a crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in 1988
that took thousands of lives. The league said Thursday that 843
members of the party had been arrested, including 195 of its
elected representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the most volatile and unpredictable moment in
the last 10 years in Burma,'' said Josef Silverstein, an expert on
the country at Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
   With the opposition taking a giant gamble and the military
refusing to compromise, a diplomat in Myanmar called the
confrontation ``an approaching train wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   In its statement Thursday, the opposition said, ``The Committee
Representing Elected Lawmakers formed by the National League for
Democracy on Sept. 16 decided it will perform the functions of the
parliament until a formal parliament session is called under the
1990 multi-party democratic election law.''
</P>
<P>
   Its first parliamentary act was to call for the release of all
political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate response by the government Thursday, but
the junta has warned that any attempt to convene parliament would
be illegal.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days the language of official statements has grown
more threatening, describing pro-democracy forces as traitors and
terrorists. Published commentaries have suggested that Mrs. Aung
San Suu Kyi might be deported. Some political analysts say the
junta could be preparing to try to stamp out the opposition party
once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pretty serious stuff,'' a Western diplomat said in a
telephone interview from Myanmar, which has been closed to foreign
reporters for weeks. ``This is an existential moment. Time is
ticking away here. So we are all extremely worried and nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   In a country whose military leaders have demonstrated their
readiness to shoot their opponents, the heightened challenge by
Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi is a dangerous one.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition challenge has won support from parts of the
country's powerful Buddhist hierarchy and from some much-respected
retired military men, who have issued statements supporting Mrs.
Aung San Suu Kyi's call for a dialogue with the leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the ethnic insurgencies that have reached cease-fires
with the government have also recently made statements in her
support.
</P>
<P>
   Recent weeks have also seen what may be the reawakening of an
active student movement, traditionally the foundation of protest in
Myanmar.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For more than a month small groups of students have reportedly
staged hit-and-run rallies in the capital, Yangon, formerly
Rangoon, sometimes distributing leaflets before quickly disbanding.
</P>
<P>
   The All Burma Students Democratic Front, an exile group based in
Thailand, said Thursday that four high school students arrested in
connection with a demonstration on Sept. 9 had been sentenced on
Wednesday in Myanmar to five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students are the unknown quotient here,'' Silverstein
said. ``I don't know how well they are organized; nobody knows.
They demonstrated 10 years ago that they could organize secretly to
the point of being quite effective.''
</P>
<P>
   As a protective measure, the authorities have closed all
universities since the last student demonstrations in December
1996.
</P>
<P>
   As the country's economy has worsened, with inflation and
unemployment rising and food shortages emerging, diplomats and
other residents say, the patience of many people with their
military rulers may be wearing thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rank and file as well as the leadership of the NLD has
simply reached the point where they are not prepared to see time
just continue to drag on, year after year, with the government
never delivering on its promise to step aside and create a
multi-party democracy,'' a diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   But the options of the pro-democracy movement are limited. As in
1988, when virtually the whole nation rose up against its
government, the men with the guns may again have the last word.
</P>
<P>
   Any possible tactical debate in the military leadership seems to
have been won, for now, by hardliners who appear determined not to
compromise with the opposition even if it means driving their
country further into international isolation, several analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   There may be members of the ruling junta who see the benefits of
a more subtle approach, said Bertil Lintner, a journalist who is
the author of several books on Myanmar. ``But the hardliners think,
the hell with that. The moment they sit down and talk with Aung San
Suu Kyi it's almost like admitting defeat. Talking, discussion,
dialogue _ this is not part of their political vocabulary.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, ``there could be another crackdown that would
crush the NLD.'' He added: ``These guys are fighters who don't know
anything about the outside world. They don't care. They are
prepared to do totally irrational things like shooting people in
the streets, as they did in 1988.''

GUNMEN SLAY 19 IN MEXICAN MASSACRE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DUDLEY ALTHAUS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Gunmen dragged men, women and children from three
houses before dawn Thursday near the Pacific Coast port of
Ensenada, lined them against a wall and riddled them with bullets.
</P>
<P>
   At least 18 people _ including an infant and six other children
_ were killed on the spot. One person was reported to have died
later.
</P>
<P>
   Police offered no clear motives for the killings. But a Mexican
news agency said a man who has ties to a powerful drug-smuggling
organization, was critically wounded in the attack, and Mexico's
national media and political leaders speculated that the massacre
was linked to narcotics trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen swept into El Sauzal, a community about 60 miles
south of San Diego, Calif., about 4:30 a.m. Thursday. They entered
a compound where the three houses were located, forced the victims
into a courtyard and opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican television images from the scene showed the victims
laying in front of a low wall, all either dressed in pajamas or
partially or fully naked, as if given no time to dress by the
killers. Hundreds of spent bullet casings, from either AK-47
automatic rifles and 9 mm pistols, littered the ground near the
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Children's bikes and other toys stood mute in the yard and the
concrete porches of what appeared to be expensive houses set behind
an elaborate iron fence. El Sauzal sits about six miles north of
Ensenada on the main coastal highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears they rounded them all up, lined them up and gunned
them down,'' said Jose Ramon Espinosa, a state police agent in
Ensenada.
</P>
<P>
   Notimex, the government's news agency, quoted Baja California
state prosecutor, Marco Antonio de la Fuente, as saying the
surviving victim, Fermin Castro, worked in the marijuana growing
operations of the powerful Arrellano Felix narcotics organization.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, however, he said that there was no clear
motive for the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   The gang, headed by four Arrellano Felix brothers, is based in
Tijuana and smuggles much of the Mexican marijuana and heroin and
Colombian cocaine into the United States. Authorities say the
Arrelano Felix brothers' gang now comprises Mexico's most powerful
and bloody cocaine and narcotics trafficking organization.
</P>
<P>
   A port and fisheries center about 60 miles south of the border
on the coast, Ensenada is a popular weekend destination for many
Southern California residents.
</P>
<P>
   Although the level of violence pointed to by the massacre has
been rare in Mexico, local reporters said Thursday that the
Ensenada area has recently been racked by gangland killings and
police busts linked to Mexico's narcotics trade.
</P>
<P>
   But the Arrellano Felix brothers' many feuds with rivals have
left hundreds of dead this year in Tijuana, the border city an
hour's drive north of the site of Thursday's massacre. The brothers
have been blamed for the attempted assassination last fall of Jesus
Blancornelas, a Tijuana newspaper publisher who has often
campaigned against the smugglers and their alleged protectors
inside the Mexican government.
</P>
<P>
   Members of a well-to-do Tijuana family, the Arrellano Felixes
are widely assumed to be Mexico's dominant narcotics smuggling
organization since the death last year of Amado Carrillo Fuentes,
whose own gang was based in Ciudad Juarez, across the border from
El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Another powerful Juarez drug traffickers, Rafael Munoz Talavera,
was murdered last week in Juarez. U.S. and Mexican police suggested
Munoz was killed in the ongoing struggle to replace Amado Carrillo
as the principal trafficker in that area of the border and
predicted more deaths.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Scores of Mexican army troops and state and federal police
agents swarmed into the compound where the massacre took place,
blocking access to reporters on the scene. Roadblocks reportedly
were thrown up in the area throughout the day in hopes of turning
up suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Massacres involving women and children are rare in the Mexican
underworld. But such killings occur occasionally in the
drug-producing mountains of southern Guerrero and Oaxaca states. &QL;

<P>
   BOSTON _ Even here in one of the most Democratic states in the
country and one of the most liberal cities, President Clinton has
been unable to escape withering criticism for his sexual affair
with a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   As the House Judiciary Committee in Washington debated the
release of his taped grand jury testimony, Clinton arrived Thursday
afternoon for a fund-raising dinner Thursday night in the wake of
harsh comments by a leading Massachusetts Democrat who refused to
attend the dinner, which was expected to raise more than $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview that appeared Thursday in The Boston Herald,
Thomas Finneran, the speaker of the Massachusetts House and a
Democrat, referred to the Watergate scandal of 24 years ago and
said President Clinton ``almost makes Nixon look like a moral
giant, the way it is going.''
</P>
<P>
   Stopping short of calling for Clinton's resignation, Finneran
said of the scandal: ``It's not just a stain on Bill Clinton's
presidency. It's a stain on the office of the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Finneran could not be reached Thursday for further comment. His
chief of staff, William Kennedy, said the speaker left Wednesday
night for a weeklong business trip to Portugal. Kennedy said that
he did not hear the interview in which the remarks were made but
that their sentiment accurately reflected Finneran's views.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran's comments are among the strongest delivered by any
Democrat since Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel,
sent his report to Congress last week, accusing Clinton of perjury,
obstruction of justice and other violations. While the accusations
have left many Democrats ambivalent _ supportive of Clinton's
policies but chagrined over his personal behavior _ few have spoken
out so sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Harshbarger, who won the Democratic primary for governor
on Tuesday, also criticized Clinton in the article, calling his
behavior ``a terrible lapse in judgment.'' But Harshbarger tempered
his remarks with praise of administration policies and said he
planned to attend Thursday night's dinner.

JURY SAYS 3 EX-EXECUTIVES OF ARCHER DANIELS FIXED PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KURT EICHENWALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three former executives with Archer Daniels Midland Corp. _
including the son of its powerful chairman, Dwayne Andreas _ were
found guilty Thursday of engaging in an international conspiracy to
fix the prices of a widely used additive for animal feed.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict by a federal jury in Chicago marked an important
victory for prosecutors, capping a six-year effort by the
government to crack an illegal corporate cartel and bring
participants to trial. The investigation and trial have already
been declared hallmarks by the government, which said it upended a
conspiracy that controlled the prices of $1 billion in commerce
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   But the case and Thursday's verdict also has had an enormous
impact as well on Archer Daniels _ a food giant that advertises
itself as the ``supermarket to the world'' because it is a leading
processor of corn, oilseeds and wheat. The Decatur, Ill.-based
company's influence extends to virtually every grocery store aisle.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, it has been run as a virtual family fief under the
iron-fisted control of Dwayne Andreas, one of the nation's most
politically powerful executives who is known by presidents and
prime ministers alike. Despite that influence, Dwayne Andreas was
unable to stop the weight of the judicial system from falling upon
his son and onetime heir apparent, Michael.
</P>
<P>
   Over the seven-week trial, prosecutors presented evidence unlike
any ever offered in court in a price-fixing case, including audio
and video recordings of the illegal price-fixing meetings between
the defendants and their international competitors who made the
additive, known as lysine.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence, including testimony from co-conspirators,
portrayed price-fixing as common in the industry. Evidence was
offered pointing to price-fixing in at least one other product, and
conspiracies among foreign competitors that dated back decades.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants were Michael Andreas, on paid leave from his
position of vice chairman with Archer Daniels; Terrance Wilson, a
former head of the company's corn-processing division, and Mark
Whitacre, a former head of its bioproducts division, which
manufactures lysine.
</P>
<P>
   Sentencing was set for Jan. 7. The men face a maximum penalty of
three years in jail and a $350,000 fine. But the defendants could
be forced to pay more, since under the law the government is
allowed to seek twice the amount gained in the crime or lost by the
victims _ in this case, the purchasers of lysine.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Andreas nor Wilson showed any emotion when the jury of
six men and six women announced their verdict. They left the
courtroom without comment. Whitacre, who waived his right to attend
the trial, was not in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Andreas and Wilson said that they would appeal the
verdict. ``We've been fighting this for three years, and we are
going to continue to fight it,'' said John Bray, a lawyer for
Andreas. ``We're not through.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Walker, Whitacre's lawyer, said that he believed that the
jury had reached a conclusion on his client's guilt based in part
on the recorded evidence against the other defendants. ``I hate to
use the words `guilt by association,' but that's the way it
seems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The conviction of Whitacre for price-fixing is the latest turn
in a series that have bedeviled this case from the beginning. It
was Whitacre himself who first alerted the government to
price-fixing at Archer Daniels in 1992. For the next two and a half
years, he worked as a government informant, secretly recording
meetings with competitors and conversations at the highest reaches
of the politically powerful grain giant.
</P>
<P>
   But, soon after raids on Archer Daniels in 1995, Whitacre was
discredited as a witness and eventually lost his immunity from
prosecution when it was revealed that he had been secretly taking
millions of dollars from the company, even while working as a
government informant. Whitacre contended that the money was
provided as part of an under-the-table bonus plan at the company,
but government investigators concluded that was not true.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Whitacre pleaded guilty to fraud, and was sentenced
to more than nine years in prison. Any additional sentence in the
price-fixing case is likely to be concurrent, according to lawyers
in the case, meaning it will not increase the time Whitacre spends
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the trial, attacking Whitacre's character was a
central strategy of lawyers for Andreas and Wilson. They contended
that no price-fixing had ever occurred, and that Whitacre was an
out-of-control informant who set up their clients. But almost all
of the defendants' arguments were presented during
cross-examination in the government's case; the defense rested
after little more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the conviction, Walker said that Whitacre felt good
about part of the verdict. ``He feels vindicated that they did
prove there was price-fixing,'' he said. ``But he didn't prove out
the bonus plan. He is going to fight to prove out the bonus plan
for the rest of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and agents with the FBI expressed delight and relief
at the verdict. ``It's been a very long time,'' said Brian Shepard,
the FBI agent who was most involved with Whitacre during the
investigation. Shepard added that the case had ``completely
dominated'' his life since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   James Griffin, head of the midwest office for the Justice
Department's antitrust division, portrayed the victory as one that
would help in the continued enforcement of antitrust laws. ``This
verdict provides momentum for the division,'' he said. ``It proves
juries will hold accountable business executives who engage in this
kind of business activity that in effect defrauds Americans of
millions of dollars a year.''
</P>
<P>
   At this time, Griffin said, the Justice Department has more than
30 grand juries looking into potential antitrust violations.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that both sides brought an enormous amount of
resources to the case. ``This is one of the hardest-fought trials
that I have ever been involved in, in terms of the firepower
brought in by both sides,'' said Scott Lassar, the U.S. attorney in
Chicago. ``There was no stone left unturned by either the
government or the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In part, the enormous legal firepower stemmed from the riches
and influence won by the Andreas family during their decades at
Archer Daniels. Since the time of Thomas Dewey _ the former New
York governor and Republican presidential candidate who served as
an adviser to Andreas when he was a lawyer in private practice _
Archer Daniels has been a strong political force. With an ease that
bred envy among other corporations, the $9.2 billion food industry
giant navigated the shores between the Republicans and Democrats
while helping to form this country's agricultural policies.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, prosecutors portrayed Wilson, 60 years old, as
the man with the daily responsibility for the conspiracy. Andreas,
49, was portrayed as providing approvals for strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But the prosecutors also said that Andreas was responsible for
getting the conspiracy back on track when suspicions and cheating
among the competitors led prices to collapse. The central piece of
evidence in support of that argument was a videotape, taken in
October 1993, of a meeting between Andreas, Whitacre and the senior
executives of Ajinomoto Co., a Japanese competitor. Whitacre was
acting as a government informant at the time.
</P>
<P>
   On the videotape, Andreas appeared to be directing an effort to
allocate shares of the lysine market in the coming year among
competitors, a critical element of a price-fixing conspiracy.
``They can each have 2,000 tons more in 1994,'' Andreas said of the
other lysine producers. ``And we get the rest between you and us.''
</P>
<P>
   That tape had impact not only on the jury, but on Archer Daniels
itself. Once considered the most likely successor to his father,
Michael Andreas has since taken a paid leave from the company. A
spokesman for Archer Daniels had no comment on the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the government's investigation of the food and feed
additive industries has resulted in eight criminal cases against
nine corporations and eleven executives, almost all of whom pleaded
guilty. Almost $200 million in fines have been imposed by courts or
recommended as part of plea agreements. Archer Daniels itself
pleaded guilty in 1996, and agreed to pay a $100 million fine.

ANALYSIS: WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE RATE CUTS?  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID E. SANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On Monday President Clinton declared that with the
world in its greatest economic turmoil in a half-century, ``the
industrial world's chief priority today, plainly, is to spur
growth.'' The markets soared, figuring that the combination of a
presidential call to arms and a statement issued the same day by
the seven largest industrial economies meant that coordinated
action was on the way _ chiefly a cut in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday afternoon, that hope was dashed. First Germany,
then the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, said
``there is no endeavor to coordinate interest rate cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Was this a case of miscommunication? Of a weakened president
trying to address a global crisis with a strong speech instead of
an immediate action plan? Or at a moment of maximum financial
peril, is the world relying on four leaders _ in Japan, in Germany,
in the United States and in Russia _ who see the unfolding crisis
in very different terms, and are each holding on to power by a
thread?
</P>
<P>
   A miscommunication case seems highly unlikely. Greenspan, White
House officials note, helped draft the statement that the Group of
Seven nations turned out on Monday. It was no accident that the
language Clinton used in his speech Monday closely paralleled the
wording that had been worked at over the weekend among the seven
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Greenspan seemed to hint that the global crisis could
lead the Fed to cut interest rates in the United States, even if it
acted alone. He noted that the forces of deflation _ not a word
Greenspan uses lightly _ were moving toward American shores. And if
Greenspan's colleagues around the world were planning a global cut,
the last thing he would do is telegraph the punch.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the two other options. By all accounts, Clinton's
six-point plan for global recovery is still vague, at best. And
even Clinton's own advisers, speaking on condition of anonymity,
concede that its execution depends on a display of raw power by
leaders who are hardly in a position to swing for the fences.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give the president credit and support for trying
to get the country focused on this issue,'' said Robert Zoellick,
the president-designate of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, who tried to manage the competing interests
of the world's economic powers when he worked for James A. Baker 3d
at both the Treasury and State Departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it should have come months ago, and you have this sense _
as you often have in the Clinton administration _ that they were
putting it all together at the last moment.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some of the aides surrounding Clinton acknowledge that
the speech, and the actions that follow it, should have come before
Russia was in full collapse, and certainly before Latin America was
threatened. But they argue that now that Clinton has entered the
fray, he intends to push through his agenda for world recovery _
despite the calls for his resignation or impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that American leadership is indispensable
if things are going to actually happen,'' Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin said Wednesday. ``And there's equally no question that the
president has provided that leadership, and the world looks to him
for that leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's Cabinet is, of course, expected to make that
kind of argument. But it is unclear whether Clinton would be able
to whip the world into action even if he was playing at the top of
his game this month _ and clearly, he is far from it.
</P>
<P>
   He is not the only one. The central conundrum in calling for
concerted action again the global economic contagion is that no
country sees the problem _or the solution _ through the same prism.
In times of world prosperity, that is rarely a problem. At times
like this, it can be disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, there are two issues dominating the country: The
election in 10 days that will decide if Chancellor Helmut Kohl wins
another term after 16 years in power, and the imminent creation of
the European Monetary Union.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's aggressive moves to aid Russia since the fall of the
Soviet Union is a sore point with voters. He is not about to worsen
his already-pessimistic poll numbers by suggesting that Germany
should set aside its own domestic imperatives to act as one of the
locomotives to pull rest of the world out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   A senior official who deals with Germany daily on the economic
crisis notes that ``you get the sense that they think all this
would go away if the world would just pull up its socks.'' Put
simply, a crisis that began in Asia still seems distant to most
people in Germany, even more distant than it seemed to many
Americans before its economic impact here began to affect farmers
in Idaho and chip-makers in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   There is another reason for German reticence: Lowering interest
rates now, even as part of a global cut, might signal a
diminishment of the country's postwar vow to eradicate any hints of
inflation. That is hardly the message Germany wants to send just as
it is about to adopt the new, common European currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, there are completely different preoccupations. The
country's weak prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, arrives in New York on
Sunday, and hoped to bring even modest evidence that the country's
Parliament is closer to solving its huge banking problems and
stimulating an economy that is shrinking at an alarming rate. Right
now Obuchi is stuck in the mud, without the power to strike a deal
with the opposition, and stunned by the mounting criticism around
the globe that Japan is responsible for much of Asia's problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the Japanese see it, the only crisis is their internal
one,'' said Jeffrey Garten, a former top Clinton administration
official and now dean of the Yale School of Management. The result
is that Obuchi, who meets Clinton on Tuesday, is in a position to
promise nothing in the way of bank reform and fiscal stimulous
beyond what Japan has already announced _ a plan the markets and
the Treasury view as insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Boris Yeltsin is presiding over a government that
Thursday announced it was going to do exactly what the world has
warned it not to do _ print rubles to pay off its debts, even if it
triggers hyperinflation.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Clinton, trying to convince the world that he
can save his job and remake the world's financial architecture all
at once.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he can: His top aides have fanned out across Washington
this week to make the argument that Clinton is dealing with the
calls for his resignation or impeachment by digging even deeper
into major issues on his plate, starting with steering clear of the
huge icebergs that could rupture sleek economic vessel the the
United States has become. It is a tough case to make. Clearly the
only issue focusing White House aides now is the president's
survival in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we distracted?'' one White House aide asked rhetorically
this week. ``Well, its fair to say there are more people in this
building working to save the president than there are to save
Brazil.''

PRESIDENT'S ADVISORY BOARD ON RACE PRODUCES MODEST REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After more than 15 months of work, President
Clinton's Advisory Board on Race has produced an extraordinarily
modest report whose chief recommendation is the creation of a
permanent presidential council on race.
</P>
<P>
   The voluminous report breaks little new ground and is, in many
ways, simply a compilation of observations and recommendations that
the seven-member board made to Clinton as it went about its work.
While it is filled with policy suggestions on education,
affirmative action, health, the criminal justice system and
immigration, the report lists four major recommendations:
</P>
<P>
   _ Establishment of a permanent body, to be known as the
President's Council for One America, to promote harmony and
dialogue between the country's racial and ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   _ Formation of a public education program to keep the public
informed about race in America.
</P>
<P>
   _ Promulgation of a presidential ``call to arms'' to government
and private-sector leaders across the country to ``make racial
reconciliation a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Engaging youth leaders to build bridges between races.
</P>
<P>
   A number of scholars and civil rights advocates say the board
squandered an opportunity to make a bold contribution to
stimulating an informed discussion of race that moved beyond the
familiar positions of both liberals and conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those sound like a list of platitudes,'' said Randall Kennedy,
a Harvard Law School professor after hearing the panel's main
recommendations. ``My goodness, there is nothing substantive there.
It's not like I'm searching for a fight. But that's not exactly
giving people direction. Talk about lowest common denominator.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is to receive the report at the board's final meeting on
Friday. White House officials said he would incorporate some of its
recommendations and suggestions in a larger report on race and
ethnicity that he will issue by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The report marks the final chapter in the troubled history of
the advisory board, which was headed by John Hope Franklin, the
noted black historian. Almost from its inception in June 1997, the
board was troubled by a lack of organization, a youthful staff with
few policy experts in areas it studied, a lack of political
experience and continued interference by White House officials who
feared the political consequences of its work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is timidity on this question,'' said Thomas Kean, the
former Republican governor New Jersey who is a board member. ``Race
is very divisive. As the year wore on, people became _ not the
board _ but, people in the administration became concerned. We were
not encouraged to be bold. My recommendations were much bolder than
anything contained in this report.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, with attention being diverted by the investigation of
the president's affair with Monica Lewinsky, the board was
hamstrung in efforts to stimulate a dialogue on race throughout the
country, one of its major goals.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Judith Winston, the board's executive director, said the
panel was able to achieve a measure of success. ``We have done what
the president asked us to do this initial year,'' she said in an
interview. ``Certainly the advisory board has carried out its
mandate.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Winston and White House officials say the board was never
expected to be an independent body like the Kerner Commission,
which investigated the country's racial climate after a series of
urban riots in the late 1960s and produced bold policy
pronouncements. Instead, the panel was to serve as Clinton's ``eyes
and ears,'' gathering information that would help him develop his
later report on race.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't want to create a commission that sort of went off
and did things independently and on its own,'' said one White House
official, who would speak only if not identified. But with
expectations having been raised by Clinton himself when he began
his initiative on race relations with a speech at the University of
California at San Diego, there was a palpable sense of
disappointment in the board's work by civil rights advocates and
those who study the country's racial climate.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its main recommendations, the board's report did contain
many other suggestions, including some it had made before in
letters to the president. It recommended expanded enforcement of
the nation's civil rights laws. It called for an end to sentencing
disparities for crimes involving crack on one hand and powder
cocaine on the other. It recommended more money to be spent on
teacher training and school construction in minority areas, and
efforts to end income inequality.
</P>
<P>
   And, the board reaffirmed its support for race- and sex-based
affirmative action, declaring that ``for far too many minorities, a
level playing field remains a mirage.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the board ducked making any recommendations on many other
highly contentious issues that surround race and ethnicity, such as
busing to achieve school integration, the construction of
scatter-site public housing for poor minorities and the use of
school vouchers to allow poor children to attend private schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not able, in the short amount of time we had, and the
format we were working in, to cover the horizon,'' said Angela Oh,
a Los Angeles lawyer who was a board member.

   ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (Moved in `e' category)
</P>
<P>
   FEATURE Stories
</P>
<P>
   TV-CENSORSHIP (subslug) (Undated) _ Last week, Fox ran an on-air
promotion for a pair of sitcoms, ``Living in Captivity'' and
``Getting Personal.'' To make the point that the shows were sassy
and sexy compared with tamer Friday night programming on other
channels, the commercial depicted a man being chased as a
voice-over announced, ``We ran the censors off, and boy, does it
show!'' It's easy to see the appeal of such a sales pitch to the
much-coveted youth audience, which has long felt a healthy
antipathy toward anyone trying to tone down the latest records,
music videos or sitcoms. But for more mature viewers who've been
battered in the last year by Jerry Springer's catfights, Howard
Stern's genitalia gags, ``South Park's'' scatological cartoon
children and ``Dawson Creek's'' libidinous teen-agers, the sight of
one more television guardian who has turned tail and run for cover
may not be particularly comforting. By Warren Berger. &UR;  &LR; (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MONET-ART (Boston) _ The progress of Monet's reputation says
something, I suspect, not just about ``Monet in the 20th Century,''
which is the name of the show now at the Museum of Fine Arts, but
also about the public's relationship to 20th-century art generally.
Why is he so popular? Lots of great artists aren't. He didn't cut
off any ears or fail to sell his paintings before he died _ in fact
for much of his life he was immensely rich and successful _ so
there's no obvious biographical angle. Ultimately the answer must
be in the pictures, and I think it involves the essential soft core
of the art: the way works like the Water Lilies become passive
receptacles for nostalgia. Monet's popularity reveals our desire
for art as both refuge and spectacle. By Michael Kimmelman.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MEDIA-MORALS (Los Angeles) _ The questions of how honest or
constrained the arts and entertainment are in these politically
charged times are exceptionally difficult to answer. Pressure
groups engaged in what are often called the culture wars have never
been more visible, commercial concerns have never been more
pressing, and, without a doubt, the arts have never been more
probing or explicit. By James Sterngold. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FILM AND VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   GEORGIA-FILMS (Tblisi, Georgia) _ This small nation nestled
under the towering Caucasus Mountains, which has a history
stretching back several millennia but which emerged from the debris
of the Soviet Union only seven years ago, has a rich creative
tradition based on the mixture of fantasy and reality. In the 20th
century that tradition has been expressed most vividly in film, and
today a hardy group of more than a dozen filmmakers is struggling
against severe economic constraints, trying to preserve, extend and
deepen it. By Stephen Kinzer. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   PECKER-FILM (Baltimore, Md.) _ ``Pecker,'' is filmed in John
Waters's hometown of Baltimore, where he has made all 13 of his
movies, most famously his 1972 cult classic, ``Pink Flamingos.''
``It's about a photographer called `Pecker,' '' the publicity agent
explained one day on the set in December. The movie which opens on
Friday is a comedy about a young fellow (Edward Furlong) who's a
short-order cook in a sub shop and takes pictures all the time, of
rats caught in flagrante delicto (Waters often employs rats for his
films), a woman shaving her thighs on a bus, his own sweetly
dysfunctional working-class family, that sort of thing. When he is
``discovered'' by a chic Manhattan art dealer (Lili Taylor) and
becomes the sensation of the New York art world, Pecker's everyday
Baltimore life, including the relationship with his girlfriend
(Christina Ricci) who runs _ well, rules _ the local laundromat, is
threatened. By Vicki Goldberg. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   THEATER
</P>
<P>
   DYING-GAUL-THEATER (New York) _ The return of ``The Dying Gaul''
to the Vineyard Theater, where it closed in June, conjures up
titles befitting a parody of a bad movie sequel _ ``The Gaul That
Would Not Die,'' perhaps, or ``The Dying Gaul: Resurrection.'' And
on one level, that's fine with the author, Craig Lucas. `` `The
Dying Gaul' (italics)is(end italics) a Hollywood satire,'' said
Lucas, who knows that world well as the adapter of several of his
own plays to film _ ``Prelude to a Kiss'' and ``Reckless'' _ and
the author of the screenplay for ``Longtime Companion.'' By Steven
Drukman. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   INFERNO-THEATER (New York) _ The award-winning version of the
``Inferno,'' translated from the Italian by Robert Pinsky, the
United States Poet Laureate, has found its way to the footlights.
Directed by Robert Scanlan and produced by the Unterberg Poetry
Center of the 92d Street Y, the play, following a brief run in
Boston, begins performances in New York on Saturday at Playhouse 91
and runs through Oct. 4. By Celia Wren. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   LOLITA-THEATER (New York) _ Jeremy Irons will play Humbert
Humbert on the big screen, starting on Friday, when Adrian Lyne's
long delayed, much persecuted film of Vladimir Nabokov's once long
delayed, much persecuted novel, ``Lolita'' opens. By Karen Durbin.
(Moved).
 &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DANCE
</P>
<P>
   KEERSMAEKER-DANCE (New York) _ The world of dance did not pause
in its erratic spin when a young Belgian dancer named Anne Teresa
De Keersmaeker presented what amounted to her first choreography in
1981 at a festival in Westchester County, near New York City. A
solo set to Steve Reich's ``Violin Phase,'' the dance was
uncompromisingly formal and repetitious. Though it was recognizably
influenced by the post-modernist dance minimalism of the time,
unexpected undercurrents of emotion set the solo apart. Ms. De
Keersmaeker, then a student at New York University, added a duet to
the solo and two more duets to the piece on her return to Belgium
the next year. The four-part dance, called ``Fase'' and set to four
pieces by Reich, established Ms. De Keersmaeker, who was to become
a major international dance talent over the next four years. She
will return to those roots on Tuesday at the Kitchen in five
performances of ``Fase,'' which will be accompanied by a symposium
and film screenings on Thursday and a video installation. By
Jennifer Dunning. (Moved). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TRUITTE-DANCE (Undated) _ Cultural history is filled, of course,
with gifted individuals whose stories and contributions have become
lost in time. But Kevin Ward, the resident choreographer of the
Dayton Contemporary Dance Company, has not forgotten James Truitte,
an early and beloved mentor, who died in 1995 at age 72. Ward's new
``Offering,'' an homage to Truitte, will be performed by the Dayton
troupe starting Tuesday at the Joyce Theater, in a one-week season
that also includes revivals of dances by Asadata Dafora and Talley
Beatty and works by Donald Byrd and Sharon Leahy. By Jennifer
Dunning. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   STAGE-FRIGHT-MUSIC (New York) _ In music, stage fright may take
the form of icy fingers, shaky limbs, a racing heart or a blank
mind, and musicians report all manner of strategies to cope with
it. Teachers and psychologists offer strategies, too. In recent
years, schools have started addressing anxiety in courses dealing
with performance techniques or career preparation. By Eleanor Blau.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ANONYMOUS-4-ALBUM (Undated) _ Anonymous 4 has just released its
eighth recording, and it will not be surprising if this CD, ``A
Lammas Ladymass,'' sails to the top of the classical charts as most
of the group's earlier efforts have. But this new album of chant
and polyphony for the Roman Catholic feast of the Assumption, which
celebrates the Virgin Mary's passage into heaven, is itself a rite
of passage. By Cori Ellison. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   LP-IMAGES-MUSIC (Undated) _ Going back to the neighborhood of
one's youth and finding familiar objects smaller than remembered is
an experience shared by most of us. I had the same feeling, not
long ago, picking up a CD of Ravel's piano music and finding on its
cover the shrunken image of an LP record I knew some 45 years ago.
Sony Classical's Masterworks Heritage series, of which this two-CD
release is a part, represents a foolproof sales strategy, at least
where the middle-aged market is concerned. For this is our past,
perfectly reconstructed _ nostalgia we can touch in miniature By
Bernard Holland. (Moved).
 &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BARRAQUE-MUSIC (Undated) _ When the French composer Jean
Barraque died in 1973, at 45, he left behind a tiny body of work
and an enormous reputation. According to the version of
20th-century musical history put forward by Andre Hodeir in his
book ``Since Debussy,'' in 1961, Barraque, though he had written
just four works at the time, delivered the promises that had been
only partly fulfilled by Schoenberg, Stravinsky, Messiaen and
Pierre Boulez. This accolade brought him notoriety, and a paragraph
in Time magazine, but it probably caused him little embarrassment,
because it coincided pretty well with his own estimate of his
worth. In the few interviews he gave, he kept coming back to the
necessity of greatness. There was no room now, he felt, for minor
masters: the game of music had to be played for ultimate stakes.
And though he never quite said so directly, he strongly implied
that he judged himself _ and demanded to be judged _ at the level
of the few composers who for him were the absolute greats: Bach,
Beethoven, Schubert and Debussy. Whether he can be placed in their
ranks, only time _ not Time _ will tell. By Paul Griffiths.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   POP MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   ANATHEMAS-ALBUMS (Undated) _ Profanity? Check. Blasphemy? Check.
Threats and imprecations? Check. Drug references? Check. Sex talk?
Check. Distorted guitars? Check. Shouts, moans, growls? Check. With
those essentials and a little hysterical publicity, an ambitious
rock band can be on its way to becoming the anointed anathema: the
band that teen-agers flaunt as a symbol of alienation while their
parents worry enough to believe the worst. Just in time for
back-to-school, two leading anathemas have released their latest
albums: Marilyn Manson's ``Mechanical Animals'' and Korn's ``Follow
the Leader.'' By Jon Pareles. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MIDLER-MUSIC (Undated) _ Bette Midler's up-and-down recording
career has always been about juggling personas to create a portrait
of an entertainer (and woman) of many (often contradictory) parts.
And ``Bathhouse Betty,'' her first album for Warner Brothers after
more than two decades on Atlantic, is arguably her most
multifaceted collection since her 1972 debut recording, ``The
Divine Miss M.'' By Stephen Holden. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ROBERT-JOHNSON-MUSIC (Undated) _ Although the great blues singer
and guitarist Robert Johnson died 60 years ago, swallowed up at 27
by the rural Mississippi demiworld of juke joints and barrelhouses
that spawned him, he looms ever larger in Americas imagination.
Johnson had been dead for 23 years when an LP of his songs, ``King
of the Delta Blues Singers'' was released in 1961. It became a
sacred text to 60s folk and blues revivalists as well as to
rock-and-rollers curious about rock's origins. In 1990, after
protracted legal wrangling, came ``Robert Johnson: The Complete
Recordings'': two CDs, 29 songs and 12 outtakes. Improbably, it
became the record-business phenomenon of the winter of 1991,
briefly outselling Madonna, winning a Grammy and going on to sell
more than a million copies worldwide. Fifty-three years after his
death, Robert Johnson was a pop star. By Tony Scherman. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ART
</P>
<P>
   MONUMENTS-VIDEO-ART (Chrlestown, Mass.) _ From Thursday through
Saturday, on three consecutive nights, the stories of bereaved
Charlestown mothers, whose sons were murdered, will be projected in
video onto the Bunker Hill Monument, Charlestown's most conspicuous
and famous public structure. Through the wizardry of Krzysztof
Wodiczko, a Polish-born conceptual artist, the 221-foot-tall
Egyptian-style obelisk will be transformed into a nighttime granite
goddess, its massive form first made to seem weightless through
animation, and then weighty with the gravity of these mothers'
tales. By Ken Shulman. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES
</P>
<P>
   CHINESE-FURNITURE-ANTIQUES (Minnepolis, Minn.) _ The Minneapolis
Institute of Art, will show 75 pieces of Ming and Ching furniture
that was given to the museum by a long-time trustee Bruce Dayton
and his wife, next Sunday. By Rita Reif. (Moved).

<P>
   Rev. J. Philip Wogaman, a Methodist pastor and Christian
ethicist from Washington, is the third minister who will privately
counsel President Clinton as part of a newly formed pastoral
``accountability group,'' said the Rev. Tony Campolo, one of the
other ministers in the group.
</P>
<P>
   Wogaman is the pastor of Foundry United Methodist Church, where
the president and his family have attended services for several
years. The other two ministers, who confirmed their roles early
this week, are the Rev. Gordon MacDonald, pastor of Grace Chapel in
Lexington, Mass., and Campolo of St. Davids, Pa., an evangelist who
runs ministries for the urban poor in the United States and Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will pray with him, study Scripture together and do our
best to help him as he searches his heart and soul,'' Campolo said
in a statement on Monday. ``We want him to understand what went
wrong with him personally that led to the tragic sins that have so
marred his life and the office of the presidency. We want to
provide all the help that we can to spiritually strengthen him
against yielding to the temptations that have conquered him in the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   Campolo said in a brief interview that the three clergymen would
confer together, and then at least one of them would meet with the
president once a week.
</P>
<P>
   Campolo said that if the ministers sensed that the president
needed the kind of psychological counseling or treatment that the
three clergymen could not provide, they would advise him to seek
additional help.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Republican leadership asked the FBI on
Thursday to investigate rumors that ``certain individuals'' have
been dredging up embarrassing personal information about some
members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these reports are true, the actions of the individuals
responsible are pure and simple intimidation,'' top Republicans
said in a letter to the bureau's director, Louis Freeh. The letter
was signed by Speaker Newt Gingrich, Reps. Dick Armey of Texas, the
majority leader, and Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, and
several others.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department did not have an immediate comment,
although it is routine for such requests to be evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   The letter follows a rash of embarrassing disclosures about
Republican House members. The latest came on Wednesday, when an
Internet magazine told of an affair that Rep. Henry Hyde of
Illinois, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, had three
decades ago with a married woman.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's committee is reviewing evidence compiled by the
Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, to help determine
whether President Clinton should be impeached for conduct related
to his affair with a former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky.
Hyde's panel is also considering whether to release the videotape
of the president's grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has heatedly denied any role in finding such
information. In a letter to Hyde Thursday, Erskine Bowles, the
White House chief of staff, repeated the White House pledge of
``zero tolerance'' for smear tactics. And Sidney Blumenthal, a
special White House assistant who has been rumored to be the source
of some anti-Hyde leaks, Thursday dismissed those suggestions as
``completely false.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, both the Internet magazine Salon, which released
the information, and the person who provided the information to
Salon said there had been no contact with the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, DeLay called the timing of the Hyde article
``really interesting'' and accused the White House of ``lying, of
covering up, of stonewalling, of trying to destroy their enemies
for years.''

NEW TESTS DISPUTE U.S. FINDING OF IRAQ NERVE GAS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Swiss and French tests for a poison gas on
Iraqi missile warheads appear to have reached results contrary to
those from American tests that showed the presence of VX, a deadly
nerve agent, diplomats said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   If the preliminary findings are confirmed, perhaps as early as
next week, Iraq is expected to argue that the American tests were
rigged to obtain damaging evidence. In June, American experts at a
military testing center in Aberdeen, Md., said they had found
traces of the banned poison gas.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi officials have already told U.N. weapons inspectors that
if there was VX on the missile fragments tested in the United
States, the Iraqis did not put it there. Iraq has admitted to
loading Sarin nerve gas on weapons, but not VX.
</P>
<P>
   The tests in Switzerland and France were done after the Aberdeen
reports were made public and Iraq demanded further analysis outside
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations Special Commission, which has been
overseeing the disarmament of Iraq, a spokesman has been saying all
week that there would be no comment on the new results until a
final report was submitted to the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get the results in final, formal form, we will be able
to discuss them,'' the spokesman, Ewan Buchanan, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The London-based Arabic newspaper Al-Hayat said Thursday that
the results were already in the possession of the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   The contradictions between the two sets of tests may raise a
number of other questions. The Iraqi warheads under study were
discovered early this year at a weapons-destruction site north of
Baghdad. Commission officials haggled with the Iraqis for weeks
before being allowed to send some metal chunks dug up at the site
to the United States for testing.
</P>
<P>
   Other warhead fragments were stored in Iraq by the inspectors,
and there is a question whether Iraqis might have had access to
them before commission officials returned to collect samples for
the second round of tests in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   By then the Iraqis knew that the Americans had said they had
found VX. The second round of tests were done from swabs taken from
the stored fragments. The fragments themselves were not moved from
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Iraq had armed weapons with an extremely
dangerous nerve gas is one of the problems central to discussions
about Iraq's compliance with United Nations demands that it turn
over not only material but also documentation on its arms programs
so that all prohibited weapons can be accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq must also answer numerous questions about its biological
weapons program, which it denied having until 1995.
</P>
<P>
   All biological, chemical and nuclear weapons as well as certain
prohibited missile systems _ and the means to produce them _ must
be destroyed before sanctions imposed on Iraq in 1990 can be
lifted.

 &HT;    Triple threat
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Athens, Ga. -- Three years ago, they seemed like the perfect
remedy for a football recruiting campaign going bad at the
University of Georgia. With former Bulldogs coach Ray Goff under
fire after a mediocre 6-4-1 record in 1994, the Luckie triplets of
Clarkston High were among the first players to join the embattled
coach's final recruiting class.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, though, the cynics questioned their
collective worth. How many Luckies does it take to sign a letter of
intent? Three _ one to sign and two to hold the pen, the old joke
went.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after three years of maturation in the Bulldogs' program,
the Luckie identical triplets _ juniors Dustin, Mike and Miles _
are enjoying the last laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Miles, the largest of the brothers at 6-1, 280 pounds, has
solidified Georgia's offensive line, replacing center Brad
Stafford. Dustin, the starting strong-side linebacker, is second on
the team with 13 tackles. Mike, who left spring drills as the No. 1
middle linebacker, expects to return to action Saturday against
Wyoming after missing the first two games with a dislocated right
wrist.
</P>
<P>
   It's believed that the Luckies are the first triplets to play
football for a Division I program. The Detzi triplets _ offensive
tackle Jeff, linebacker Joe and defensive tackle John _ played for
Division II East Stroudsburg University in Pennsylvania 1975-78.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our play on the field has helped us step out of that
spotlight of being triplets,'' Miles said. ``When we're on the
field, we're individuals, and I think people are realizing that
now. I think we've surprised some people.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the trio has been exceeding expectations since the
beginning, when Dustin was born at 8:06 p.m. on Oct. 29, 1976, at
South Fulton Hospital in East Point. He was followed seven minutes
later by Miles and 13 minutes later by Mike. Together they weighed
about 15 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be a big singleton,'' said the players'
mother, Wendy Luckie of Statham. ``I was really shocked. So was the
doctor. We thought we'd had twins that were unexpected, but then
the doctor came back later and said there was another baby in
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Luckie, a registered nurse, raised her sons in a
single-parent home after a divorce from the boys' father. There was
help from an older son, Nick McKnight, and daughter, Megan
McKnight, a recent graduate of Agnes Scott College.
</P>
<P>
   The triplets got their first taste of college football on
weekend road trips to see their older brother play at Marshall.
Nick McKnight, now a 31-year-old private investigator, was a
starting linebacker for the Thundering Herd 1986-88. He was a
college teammate of Georgia tight-ends coach Greg Adkins and
graduated two years before Bulldogs coach Jim Donnan's arrival at
Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was pretty cheap entertainment, taking them to see their
older brother play,'' Wendy Luckie said. ``It was kind of hard,
because I was divorced and was really the only wage-earner. They
didn't get a lot of the things they wanted, but they never
complained.''
</P>
<P>
   When the trio grew into major-college prospects at Clarkston
High, there was little doubt they would remain together. There was
early interest in the triplets from Northwestern, Syracuse and
Virginia, but Georgia and Clemson were the only schools to offer
all three scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   After signing with the Bulldogs, Mike and Dustin shared a dorm
room during their freshman year; Miles and Dustin lived together as
sophomores. In the early days, their Georgia teammates struggled
telling them apart, especially Dustin and Mike, who are separated
by only one inch and five pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very close and you could tell that during their
freshman year,'' Bulldogs offensive tackle Matt Stinchcomb said.
``They're not really a loud bunch of guys anyway. They're very
soft-spoken and don't say much. I don't think it was a `Luckie
triplet faction' or anything, but now they're a lot more open with
the other teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Luckies, all three of whom are majoring in speech
communication, share an off-campus apartment and only one car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think they've matured,'' Donnan said. ``When I first
got here, they weren't as open with everyone else. They were kind
of reserved. They've done a good job of branching out and meeting
other people and not just being around each other all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Luckie says her sons have proved their point.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always said, `Mama, we just want people to know we're
good football players and not just freaks of nature,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Donnan agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys say, `Man, I'm lucky,' '' he said. ``All I say is,
`I'm Luckie, Luckie, Luckie.' ''

CARTER URGES INQUIRY INTO U.S. RAID ON SUDAN  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Former President Jimmy Carter, saying the
credibility of the United States is on the line over the bombing of
a pharmaceutical factory in the Sudan that the Clinton
administration said was making an ingredient for nerve gas, called
Thursday for a technical investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The United States hit the factory on Aug. 21, the same day that
Washington sent missiles raining down on suspected terrorist
training camps in Afghanistan linked to Osama bin Laden, whom the
administration blamed for a role in the bombings of two American
embassies in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The Sudanese government came to the United Nations to request an
independent study of the site in Khartoum, the Shifa Pharmaceutical
Industries plant, to prove that the factory's only function was
making medicine and veterinary supplies. The United States argued
strenuously against the request, and the Security Council shelved
the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Thursday, Carter said that British, German and
other foreign leaders were increasingly skeptical of American
assertions about the factory, which Washington linked to Iraqi
chemical weapons projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite early American reluctance to support this request,''
Carter said, ``this is something that now needs to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Sudanese are guilty, they should be condemned both for
lying and for contributing to terrorist activities,'' he said.
``Otherwise, we should admit our error and make amends to those who
have suffered loss or injury.''

 &HT;    On deck: Arizona Diamondbacks
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: Tonight and Saturday at 10:05 p.m.; Sunday at 4:05.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   TV/radio: TBS, WSB 750-AM.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: Tonight, RHP Greg Maddux (17-8,
2.15; first appearance vs. Diamondbacks) vs. RHP Andy Benes (13-13,
4.24; 4-12, 3.69 lifetime vs. Braves). Saturday, LHP Tom Glavine
(19-6, 2.63; 2-0, 1.29 lifetime vs. Diamondacks) vs. LHP Brian
Anderson (12-12, 4.34; 0-0, 9.00 lifetime vs. Braves). Sunday, LHP
Bruce Chen (1-0, 5.79; first appearance vs. Diamondbacks) vs. RHP
Amaury Telemaco (6-9, 3.92; 1-1, 3.29 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Quickly: This is an important game for Maddux, who was forced
from his last start after just six innings because of some
tightness in his upper right triceps. Although he brings a string
of 10 scoreless innings into the game, he will be watched closely
and will come out at the first hint of soreness. With a 5-6 record
in the second half, Maddux gets just this game and one more start
to impress the Cy Young electrorate. Once a shoo-in for his fifth
Cy Young, his fading candidacy needs a strong finish. The Braves
have beaten Benes in three different uniforms _ as a Padre, as a
Cardinal and on April 22 as a D-back. They catch the big
right-hander at his best stretch of the season. Benes is 6-2 in his
last nine starts and nearly threw his first no-hitter last time
out, when he yielded a one-out single in the ninth in Cincinnati on
Sunday. Take away a disastrous eight-run outing in New York on Aug.
22 and Benes has allowed only four runs in his last 40 innings,
striking out 35 while allowing 21 hits. He was 6-10 after his first
start of the second half but has gone 7-3 since. He went 0-1 in
back-to-back starts against Atlanta late in the season's first
month, giving up nine runs in 14 innings. Javy Lopez homered in
both of those games.

 &HT;    King of the ring
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Even the man who ran the numbers, who lives, breathes
and eats the numbers and who has been widely accused of
manipulating the numbers couldn't calculate this equation.
</P>
<P>
   There had been too many arrests during his days in the Cleveland
ghettos, too many indictments from the government, too many
lawsuits from boxers and managers and anybody who might have
entered into a financial agreement with Don King to speculate as to
how much time of his 67 years on earth has been spent in a court
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea,'' said the promoter, bringing up a loud laugh
from his belly as he sits in his 40th-floor suite in the downtown
Westin Peachtree.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot. It's good that you can be there, but you should not
always be the victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me say this. The first act of King Henry was that we would
kill the lawyers. I have to reject that. This is King Don and the
first act of King Don is that we need the lawyers. I have to
repudiate King Henry.''
</P>
<P>
   Life is sweet these days as sport's most famous circus barker.
Life is sweet when you can promote a heavyweight championship fight
a few days after you have just taken 60 people, including the 12
jurors (and spouses) who acquitted you of bilking $350,000 from
Lloyd's of London, to the Bahamas on your dime. Life is sweet when
you beat the government _ twice, on the same charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told (the resort) don't tell me how much it cost,'' King
said. ``I flew them all in. They could eat and drink all they
wanted. Gave them an envelope with something in it so they could
buy their souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted them to know I appreciated them making the
judicial system work. One of them said to me, 'You know, for four
months (during the trial), I really missed fishing.' I said, 'Get
that man a boat! Get him a yacht! Go catch yourself a marlin, a
star fish, whatever you call it!' I think he's still out there.''
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday evening, the fishing juror and 11 others will be in
town for Evander Holyfield's heavyweight title defense against
Vaughn Bean. The crowd in the Georgia Dome is expected to hit
30,000 and, depending on 11th-hour giveaways to youths, could go
higher. Much of that can be attributed to Holyfield's stature here
and his scripted visibility in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It also somewhat can be attributed to the relatively low profile
King has maintained in recent days. He is allowing Holyfield to
take the lead in the promotion, noting, ``Other promoters don't
have cooperative boxers. I do. I'm not in competition with Evander,
I'm complementing him.''
</P>
<P>
   King also has been preoccupied with the recent Lloyd's case,
contractual wars with Mike Tyson, Felix Trinidad and Julio Cesar
Chavez _ all of whom have signed with promotional rivals _ and
weekend retreats. King is not especially popular in Atlanta, or
anywhere else. That was illustrated at a recent Atlanta Sports
Council meeting when someone asked Holyfield's attorney, Jim
Thomas, ``Why did you sign with Don King? That's the only thing I
don't like about Evander.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield gave King promotional options in the fall of 1996 to
get the matchup with Tyson. The heavyweight title has been King's
lifeline. It was he who rode in a limo to an arena in Kingston,
Jamaica, with Joe Frazier but left with Foreman, later boasting
after the two fought, ``I came with the champion and I left with
the champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet King still is associated with fighters who claimed to have
been ripped off or with his days as a crime-ridden youth, during
which he killed two men. One was ruled justifiable homicide. King
served four years on the other after having a conviction on
second-degree murder reduced to manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, King has been on the winning side. In 1985, he was
acquitted of 23 counts of income tax evasion. (He rewarded that
jury with a trip to England.) In 1995, a jury hung on nine counts
of insurance fraud. Three years later in the retrial, he was
acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``America won that trial, not Don King,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some close to him say he seems reborn, despite the fact Tyson is
suing him for $100 million. King was in Mexico City in March to
promote a fight when a robber held a gun to his head and stole his
$100,000 watch. King suspected he might get shot, and was relieved
when the gunman fled. He learned later that an Austin, Texas,
journalist was shot and paralyzed the same weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's really frightening is the guy is talking to you and you
can't understand him,'' King said. ``He's a robber. He ain't got
time to be no linguist.''
</P>
<P>
   King, who never met a mixed metaphor he didn't like, says he is
now ``in the Holyfield business,'' and that, ``I'm trying to help
create the new Holyfield, who will be marketable and
merchandiseable.''
</P>
<P>
   As to Tyson's claims that King skimmed his purses, the promoter
said, ``I have no quarrel with Tyson. I wish him well. But he's
been lied to (by new management). They've been able to pour smoke
and poison into his veins and his brains.''
</P>
<P>
   King defends getting a 30 percent cut of Tyson's purses: ``This
is the way it's always been with pioneers and trailblazers. What
fighter in the history of the game ever has gotten the kind of
money that Tyson has gotten? Look at the picture from the other
side of the well, man. Tyson, when he went to the penitentiary, was
making $4 million a fight. He gets convicted of a heinous crime,
comes out and I have a deal in place with him where he makes $30
million for a fight. The man got $73 million before he even threw a
punch. I made boxing into a business.''
</P>
<P>
   Showtime executive Jay Larkin, whose cable network is carring
Saturday's fight, calls King ``the most complex individual I've
ever met.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The average human being would say he's had enough by now,''
Larkin said. ``But if Don stopped this business, he would die.''
</P>
<P>
   The kinder, gentler Don King says he is now ``taking the high
road'' on criticism. Yes, he said that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mature with age, like vintage wine,'' King said. ``I used
to fall prey to (the philosophy of) divide and conquer. When you
get older, you don't have the vitality and youth to keep getting
into skirmishes.''
</P>
<P>
   Don King? Image problems?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a numbers runner, man,'' he said. ``I'm one of the
masses, not the classes. I exemplify what Rudyard Kipling says: You
can walk with kings but keep the common touch. I'm the commoner and
challenging the system of elitists.''

 &HT;    Bean's 231 pounds his most ever
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Servicce
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Evander Holyfield's next heavyweight title defense
may be in Atlanta, but his opponent looks like he has been visiting
the famous Las Vegas buffets.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn Bean weighed in at an all-time high of 231 pounds
Thursday at the Westin Peachtree Plaza, then offered this
explanation for his seemingly bloated state: ``I feel good. I'm
still growing.''
</P>
<P>
   If this were sumo, Bean would have a 14-pound advantage over
Holyfield Saturday night at the Georgia Dome. Holyfield weighed in
at 217 pounds, which is consistent with his recent bouts.
</P>
<P>
   Bean, who is about three inches shorter than Holyfield, is eight
pounds heavier than he was for his last bout, a third-round TKO
over Lamont Burgin in April. He is a whopping 19 pounds heavier
thanfor his previous title shot against Michael Moorer in March
1997.
</P>
<P>
   His promoter, Butch Lewis, nonetheless said, ``What kind of
weight is that? It's the winning weight.''
</P>
<P>
   But Don Turner, Holyfield's trainer, said, ``He's too big, man.
That means he can't move.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield will conclude his workouts at 10:30 this morning at
the Holyfield Arena in West End. It is open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket giveaway
</P>
<P>
   Promoter Don King wants to give away 2,000 $25 tickets to
Atlanta-area kids. Any youth or church groups or other
organizations interested in receiving tickets to the fight should
contact the Don King Productions office at 404-589-7621. ... More
than 26,000 tickets had been sold by Thursday afternoon. ... What
do boxers do the day of a fight? Not usually this: Holyfield will
watch two of his sons play football games Saturday. ... Holyfield
is planning a postfight ``Homecoming Party'' at the Georgia World
Congress Center Saturday. Tickets, at $25 and $50, will benefit the
Holyfield Foundation. They are available at GWCC.

 &HT;    Holyfield sure is making his rounds
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Before Evander Holyfield defends one of his
over-accessorized belts Saturday night at the Georgia Dome, he will
attend to some really important business. That same morning, he's
determined to spectate at two of his sons' football games. First, a
battle of pee-wees and one middle-school scrap. Then, he'll get
around to fighting for millions of dollars and a piece of the
heavyweight championship of the world. Sounds like a full day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another day at the office,'' shrugged Holyfield, who
doesn't buy the notion that a man must spend the hours leading up
to a blood-letting in a deep, dark cave, with his feet elevated.
It's only a fight, after all, not an execution.
</P>
<P>
   Against this homey backdrop, today's challenge is to rank
Holyfield among Georgia's living, breathing sports personalities.
We're talking about athletes _ sorry, Ted Turner _ whose feats and
presence have made them local landmarks. Who is, or should be, most
important in the hearts of the hometown folk?
</P>
<P>
   The champeen is Henry Aaron. No debate. He's retired all the
belts. Here are my top-10 ranked contenders among the Georgia
sports heavyweights. They work just the same as boxing ratings,
meaning that for the right money, they can be changed:
</P>
<P>
   1. Holyfield
</P>
<P>
   2. Dale Murphy
</P>
<P>
   3. Herschel Walker
</P>
<P>
   4. Tom Glavine
</P>
<P>
   5. Bill Elliott
</P>
<P>
   6. Phil Niekro
</P>
<P>
   7. Gwen Torrence
</P>
<P>
   8. Dominique Wilkins
</P>
<P>
   9. Jeff Van Note
</P>
<P>
   10. Teresa Edwards
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield might be working out of the home, but he's still
covering a whole lot of ground. He has been out there _ really out
there _ in selling his fight with Vaughn Bean. Throwing out the
first pitch at a Braves game, dropping the flag at an Indy Car
race, training in the CNN Center or the westside gym that bears his
name. He was even spotted Wednesday night posing in a chef's hat
during a promotional barbeque at his home. There are no
indignities, only opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   So ubiquitous has Holyfield been around here, he should change
his first name to Peachtree.
</P>
<P>
   The profit motive behind all of that is strong, no doubt. He's
got 54,000 square feet in Fairburn to support. But there is a more
subtle undercurrent at work. In some ways, this fight is a
referendum on Holyfield's local popularity. The people will speak
with the tickets they buy. For the first time since Holyfield twice
disposed of Mike Tyson, there is a way to statistically measure his
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Where to put this supposedly undersized heavyweight who elevates
his sport and carries an Olympic torch in his spare time? I might
tend to rank Holyfield higher than some because of the fact that he
remains so connected to the community. Deep roots weigh heavily
with me; these characters should have done more than just change
planes here. He's my No. 1 ranked contender, based on
accomplishment and profile.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout most of his career, Holyfield has been an undervalued
Atlantan. Taken for granted in some aspects. Overlooked in others.
He's a couple laps down from perfect, but his intentions have been
as good as anyone who has ever earned a Midtown parade.
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to a lawyer to explain the finer points of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually everyone loves Evander, but a lot of people don't
like boxing,'' said Jim Thomas, Holyfield's point man. ``Many of
the same people like that more brutal, dangerous sport _ football.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can feel more comfortable loving a Dale Murphy than an
Evander Holyfield because it's easier to love baseball than it is
boxing. All things being equal, Evander is tops.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday _ the post-youth-football part of it, anyway _ is
scheduled to be a well-paying appreciation of Holyfield. Bean plays
the part of traditional homecoming opponent, trying to ruin a quite
sizable party.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield remembers what it was like to have sports figures who
were approachable and relevant. ``When I was growing up, different
athletes would come visit the (Warren) Boys Club,'' he said.
``Braves and Falcons, people who really inspired you. I remember
Claude Humphrey, Fulton Kuykendall, Tommy Nobis coming by. Even
Hank Aaron. And Chief Noc-A-Homa. They all talked about working
hard and setting goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he is among them, bettering the message.

 &HT;    Frazier ready to bury hatchet with Ali
 &HT;    By Terrence Moore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Imagine somebody shoving a boxing glove through the
eye of the world's smallest needle. That would be slightly less
incredible than what Joe Frazier just told us about Muhammad Ali.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier, squeezing our shoulder while sincerity ran through his
54-year-old eyes, said, ``What (Ali) and I need to do is get
together as soon as possible and kiss each other. We should
embrace. We should talk, and we should laugh together. Then we both
need to forget about all of those things that happened in the past.
It's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Hallelujah.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier is in town to help train Vaughn Bean for Saturday's
fight at the Georgia Dome against Evander Holyfield. Just so you
know, this would be a more competitive fight if Frazier were in the
ring instead of Bean. ``I'd beat up Evander, because I never let a
little guy take me out,'' said Frazier, laughing, still resembling
the human Army tank that he was as a former heavyweight champion of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   When we think of Frazier, we automatically think of the other
guy. We did just that while talking to Frazier about his popular
boxing gym back in his native Philadelphia. We also discussed his
healthy look, despite his fading hearing and eyesight and an
amputated toe.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, we thought about the last time we huddled with Frazier.
It was two years ago during the Atlanta Olympics. It wasn't pretty,
especially after we slipped, in Frazier's presence, by uttering his
old version of the worst profanity known to mankind _ Ali.
</P>
<P>
   As we told you then, it triggered the fourth Ali-Frazier brawl,
and that one was the bloodiest, even if it was verbal. For one,
Frazier threw all the punches. For another, Frazier just kept
throwing them. And with Frazier sticking and moving, Ali was
nowhere in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many low blows, Ali was victimized by Parkinson's
disease because ``I don't think the Lord agrees with the things
he's done,'' Frazier said. ``I think it was the hand of the Lord
touching him and telling him that you can be (somebody), but you
can't be thee.''
</P>
<P>
   That was before Frazier was asked about that special look on the
faces of billions around the universe when Ali stood atop the
Olympic stadium to light the flame. Frazier, straight-faced, said,
``They probably were afraid he was going to fall in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it really got ugly. Just blame it on 25 years of
bitterness. In the latter 1960s, Frazier fought to help Ali get his
boxing license back after Ali's refusal to enter the armed forces
for religious reasons landed him out of the sport for 3 1/2 years.
Even so, Ali spent his subsequent holy wars with Frazier calling
his rough-looking opponent everything from a gorilla to the
white-man's fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier fumed. Until now. ``I haven't seen (Ali) since the
Olympics in Atlanta, and that was just briefly,'' said Frazier, his
words coming as gently now as they did as harshly then.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk to his wife (Lonnie) all the time about how he's doing,
and she knows I've got no problem with him,'' Frazier said. ``Hell,
I'm 54 years old, man. We both have grandchildren running around.
This is something that has to stop, and that's why we have to get
together to end this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hallelujah and amen.

 &HT;    Gators' QB Palmer out to prove himself
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ Jesse Palmer is a strong believer in the
adage: That which does not kill you only makes you stronger.
</P>
<P>
   It is why the sophomore from Ontario is still alive and kicking
and ready to start at quarterback for No. 2 Florida in Saturday
night's showdown with No. 6 Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer believes _ at least he hopes _ that he saw the worst side
of being a college quarterback last October when he got his first
career start against Auburn. Doug Johnson, the regular starter, had
been suspended for the game, giving Palmer his first real shot at
taking the job.
</P>
<P>
   But in front of a hostile crowd at Jordan-Hare Stadium, Palmer
threw two interceptions in the first half, and coach Steve Spurrier
pulled him in favor of senior Noah Brindise. The Gators went on to
win the game 24-10, but questions have remained about Palmer and
his ability to do the job in a big game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is hard for people to believe, but I really
learned an awful lot in the game with Auburn,'' Palmer said. ``I
got a feel for the pressure, knowing that every throw you make,
every decision, could make or break the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer insists that he will take those lessons and put them to
good use before a larger and even more hostile house of 107,000 at
Tennessee's Neyland Stadium. Spurrier hopes he's right because
after two starts this season the jury is still out on Palmer as the
leader of the Gators' offense.
</P>
<P>
   In games with the Citadel and Northeast Louisiana, Palmer has
thrown for 593 yards and eight touchdowns. But he also has thrown
three interceptions and floated several other passes that could
have been intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse will start because he's the best we've got right now,''
Spurrier said. ``He's thrown some beautiful passes. Hopefully, he
can learn from his mistakes, and, hopefully, we can put him in a
better position to make some plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee is preparing for Palmer, but Volunteer players and
coaches think Spurrier has a quarterback ace in the hole in
Johnson. Johnson, recovering from May 8 shoulder surgery, did not
see action against the Citadel and got only a handful of plays
against Northeast Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said earlier this week that his shoulder is close to 100
percent. But Spurrier is not convinced that Johnson, who threw for
2,023 yards and 21 touchdowns last season, is completely ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell that he's not throwing the ball the way he used
to,'' Spurrier said. ``If something happens, he'll be capable. But
you can tell his throwing motion is not what it was at this time
last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Given Johnson's performances in big games, including 261 yards
passing and three touchdowns in last year's win over Tennessee,
Volunteer coach Phillip Fulmer thinks Johnson will be a factor
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to expect Doug Johnson,'' Fulmer said. ``He's
been big in the big games, and I would put this one in that
category.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier has not ruled out the possibility of using two
quarterbacks, as he did in Florida's 32-29 upset of No. 1 Florida
State last November.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's what it takes to get the job done, then that's what
we'll do,'' Spurrier said. ``We will always put the best players on
the field. The quarterback position is no different.''

CONGRESS MOVES TO REVERSE CLINTON'S SATELLITE-EXPORT PROCEDURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Calif., Miss.)  (bl) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a major rebuke of President Clinton's export
policy, House and Senate negotiators agreed Thursday to shift the
control over exporting U.S. satellites back to the State Department
from the Commerce Department.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some space experts and a senior government auditor have said
that controls on exports of satellites to China have been loosened
since the administration transferred licensing authority to the
less restrictive Commerce Department in 1996, compromising national
security. The Commerce Department denies this.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, more than 10 House and Senate committees are
investigating whether this approach has contributed to the release
of sensitive satellite technology and engineering know-how to China
that may have helped Beijing improve the reliability of its
long-range missiles.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The investigations were first prompted by the disclosure that in
1996 U.S. companies helped the Chinese figure out what went wrong
with their Chinese rocket that exploded while carrying a U.S.
satellite. This unauthorized assistance by the U.S. companies
prompted a criminal investigation by the Justice Department into
whether the companies improved the Chinese missile program.
</P>
<P>
   The issue became caught up in the campaign finance debate
earlier this year when The New York Times disclosed that nearly
$100,000 was funneled into the Democratic Party in 1996 from the
Chinese military through a Chinese aerospace executive who was also
an officer in the Chinese military.
</P>
<P>
   It was further disclosed that last February the president
ignored objections from prosecutors and approved the launch of
another U.S. satellite on a Chinese rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about these revelations, Congress proposed returning
authority for licensing satellites back to the State Department
which historically had been much more cautious than the Commerce
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration aides have threatened a White House veto
if Congress shifted the licensing authority over satellites. At a
Senate hearing Thursday, senior Defense, State and Commerce
department officials urged lawmakers to keep the current system.
</P>
<P>
   William Reinsch, the undersecretary of commerce for export
administration, said later that his boss, Commerce Secretary
William M. Daley, would again urge Clinton use his veto.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's troubles from the Monica Lewinsky scandal have
weakened his support on Capitol Hill, and it was unclear Thursday
whether Democrats would sustain a White House veto.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the licensing provision is included in the Pentagon's
$271 billion budget bill for the 1999 fiscal year. Given the
growing concerns that U.S. combat readiness is eroding and
top-quality troops are leaving in large numbers, vetoing the
military budget bill would carry huge political risks for the
president.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, the White House seemed to be pulling back from
its veto threat, even though National Security Adviser Samuel
Berger played a central role in placing the Commerce Department in
charge of licensing satellites in 1996. Berger was the deputy
national security adviser at the time.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made no decision whether to recommend whether the
president veto the bill,'' said White House spokesman David Leavy.
</P>
<P>
   One State Department official said, ``It's hard for us to fall
on our sword over this.''  &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The satellite provision is part of a conference report worked
out by House and Senate negotiators Thursday and requires full
House and Senate approval. That could come as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   The provision would transfer the licensing jurisdiction over
commercial communications satellites to the State Department,
effective March 15, 1999. Satellites would be returned to the
so-called munitions list, the inventory of the nation's most
sensitive military and intelligence-gathering equipment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the president would have to certify that the export
of missile equipment or technology, including satellites, would not
hurt the U.S. space-launch industry, and would not indirectly and
measurably improve China's missile or missile-launching expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers applauded the transfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This change reflects the sentiment that the Clinton
administration has fallen down on the job, and we need to do a more
effective job of controlling'' technology that has both commercial
and military uses, said Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., who has held
several hearings on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., who heads a Select House
committee investigating technology transfers to China, also cheered
the decision. But Cox noted that after a U.S. company receives a
license to transfer sensitive technology, like satellites or
supercomputers, to China, ``there is precious little
follow-through.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats reluctantly agreed to the deal, but only after
watering down or eliminating several more extreme conditions the
House included in its version of the bill. The House, for example,
had voted overwhelmingly to ban all satellite exports to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no effective difference between Commerce and State,
except that State takes forever,'' to process license applications,
said Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Armed
Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Levin said the provision requires the State Department to come
up with a plan for an orderly and timely process to deal with
license applications.
</P>
<P>
   But Reinsch, the Commerce Department official, warned in an
interview that putting the State Department in the lead would delay
the licensing process, and put U.S. satellite companies at a
competitive disadvantage with foreign rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will hurt American companies with no national security
benefits,'' Reinsch said.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress approves the jurisdiction transfer, and Clinton
signs the bill, the process will revert back to what had been in
place until 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The administration had switched jurisdiction to the Commerce
Department, largely at the behest of several major U.S. satellite
makers who argued that with the end of the Cold War, satellites
should be treated more as commercial products than military
devices.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1995, Secretary of State Warren Christopher decided
against relaxing export controls over the shipment of satellites to
China, where they could be launched more cheaply than in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   But Berger argued that Christopher had failed to properly
consider the interests of the White House or American businesses
seeking trade with China. Ultimately, Berger engineered a deal that
stripped the State Department of its broad licensing authority.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his top national security aides insisted that the
new procedures under the Commerce Department did not relax export
controls or threaten national security.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of
Congress, concluded otherwise. With the State Department in charge,
for example, the Pentagon effectively had a veto over satellite
exports. Under the new procedures, the Pentagon had one vote among
five federal agencies, and had to persuade a majority to stop an
export. The new rules allowed for a three-step appeals process for
an agency opposing a satellite export.  &QL;

ASIAN CRISIS PINCHES SMALL COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By REBECCA ROLWING  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Times are grim at VSM Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sales have nose-dived,'' said Charles Vaughan, president of
the Tempe, Ariz., company that manufactures gas handling systems
and furnaces for the semiconductor industry.
</P>
<P>
   The business is among many small- and medium-sized companies
getting hammered as the effects of the Asian economic crisis
trickle down from the semiconductor's industry giants to its
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's catching it,'' Vaughan said.
</P>
<P>
   Small companies sometimes bleed more because they have less cash
to endure a financial crisis and may rely on one or two large
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Layoffs, consolidations, hiring freezes, forced vacations and
shorter workweeks are occurring quietly as the Phoenix area's chip
suppliers tighten their belts to ride out the crunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the larger companies and the problems they're
having garner the most public attention. You don't hear much about
the small companies but certainly they're being impacted,'' said
Nancy Russell, president of the Arizona Association of Industries.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the state's mid-size high-tech companies, like
Three-Five Systems Inc., SpeedFam International Inc. and others
also are making adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   After laying off a third of its staff in June, VSM's 24
remaining workers have gone to a four-day work week. Sales this
year are half of what they were for 1997, a number Vaughan declined
to disclose.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the company will survive by marketing to other
industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're small enough that we can dodge the bullet,'' Vaughan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Around the world many semiconductor plants are shutting down,
making their equipment available to be refurbished and sold. The
availability of the used products cuts even further into the demand
for new equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a glut of equipment on the market,'' said Ken Rich,
who has a two-man operation that sells new and refurbished
equipment to semiconductor plants in Arizona and New Mexico. Three
years ago the company employed seven.
</P>
<P>
   Sales are off 80 percent from last year. The decline began
around January and has since ``fallen off a cliff,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ASM America, a 280-employee company in Phoenix, manufactures
equipment for the semiconductor industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are holding up fairly well but it's getting tougher and
tougher,'' President Daniel Queyssac said.
</P>
<P>
   The company has a hiring freeze in place and has instituted
forced vacation time.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Queyssac remains optimistic that the semiconductor
industry's troubles are turning around, noting that Intel Corp.
announced stronger sales for its third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Others are less hopeful. Motorola Inc. is the fourth major maker
to halt U.S. production of computer memory chips. It also announced
this week that it's shelving plans for a plant in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   SpeedFam International Inc., a Chandler, Ariz., semiconductor
equipment manufacturer, recently laid off at least 70 workers. It
was its second job reduction this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Management is now saying that they expect the industry
downturn to last until mid-1999,'' wrote Joe Blankenship, who
follows the company for the investment firm Peacock, Hislop, Staley
&AMP; Given Inc. ``This outlook is consistent with our recent revisions
of industry prospects for semiconductor equipment, in light of
continuing erosion of Asia economies.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the industry recovers, it will still take several months
before manufacturers begin to order new equipment again.
</P>
<P>
   Three-Five Systems felt sniffles of the Asian flu when Motorola
and some other customers demanded prices to meet the rates of Asian
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The Tempe manufacturer of displays for cellular phones and other
devices complied, dropping prices 10 percent.
</P>

   ``We believe this action will result in gross margins being
reduced by nearly 66 percent,'' Blankenship wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Three-Five doesn't comment on analyst's forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to have an impact. The question is how much,'' CFO
Jeff Buchanan said. The company plans to ask its suppliers, most of
whom are Asian, to cut their rates as well.
</P>
<P>
   Three-Five also expects demand for cellular phones to pick up
and grow over the next several years. That means Three-Five can
spread its fixed costs over a greater number of products and make
its devices for less. &QL;

STARS HOPE SEVERYN WILL FILL NEED OF ENFORCER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAIL, Colo. _ The irony of Brent Severyn's wardrobe hits like a
bare-fisted punch in the nose.
</P>
<P>
   Severyn's ``lucky shirt'' for this season is an ominous black
cotton number that stretches across his heavily muscled frame and
blares in bright, white letters: ``Austin 3:16.''
</P>
<P>
   The slogan, well known nationally by arenas full of raving fans,
is the cry of ``Stone Cold'' Steve Austin, one of professional
wrestling's biggest stars. Severyn will wear the shirt almost daily
this season, an emblem perhaps that his role as a Stars winger this
season will make him not unlike a professional wrestler _ part
skilled athlete, part physical tough guy and part showman.
</P>
<P>
   Severyn is the Stars' recently acquired enforcer _ a role in the
NHL that might be as difficult to talk about as it is to perform.
No player wants to say that Severyn was brought in simply to fight
the other team, and yet that's likely his main job. No management
person wants to say that Severyn could become one of Reunion
Arena's most popular Stars simply because he can batter another
person senseless, and yet that's likely what will happen. And no
coach wants to single Severyn out as something the team ``needs'' _
and yet the Stars simply had to get a fighter if they want to stay
healthy in the enforcer-laden Pacific Division this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only been in this type of role for three years, and it
takes some getting used to,'' said Severyn, 32, who left the Mighty
Ducks of Anaheim via free agency after last season. ``There's a lot
to it, and there's a lot of pressure involved around it _ big-time
pressure. Your whole team is relying on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the debate on whether pro wrestling is real or fake, the
debate on whether there is the need for a fighter in the NHL is a
touchy subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``The organization thought there was a need in that area, so
they went out and filled it,'' captain Derian Hatcher said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he paused before emphasizing the importance of the
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ``And to be completely honest,'' he said. ``I think most of the
players felt there was a need, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Stars saw San Jose Sharks defenseman Bryan
Marchment take out both Mike Modano and Joe Nieuwendyk with what
the Stars called ``dirty'' hits that caused knee injuries. This
season, part of Severyn's job will be to beat some respect into
Marchment and any other player who attempts to rough up one of the
Stars' top scorers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to go out there and take care of my teammates,''
Severyn said. ``I'm not going to score goals. Obviously, I'm here
to help protect my guys, play good defensive hockey and not hurt my
team or be a liability when I'm out there.''
</P>
<P>
   And as easy as that sounds, it's something that most NHL teams
struggle to find.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, I think it's one of the hardest jobs in
hockey,'' Hatcher said.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason Stars coach Ken Hitchcock quickly disposed of
his two previous tough guys _ Shane Churla and Bill Huard. Churla
was too enthusiastic and sometimes took penalties that hurt the
team. Huard won his fights and played well in a limited role, but
he wanted more ice time and didn't mind griping about it.
</P>
<P>
   Severyn says he knows the position is difficult; he has only
been trying to master it for three seasons. Severyn worked his way
up as a defenseman who often played on both the power play and the
penalty kill in the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Colorado Avalanche needed a tough guy three seasons
ago, it went to Severyn and asked him to fill the role. With the
chance to grab an important spot on the defending Stanley Cup
champions, Severyn took firm hold of the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the guys I fight these days, they've been goons most
of their lives,'' Severyn said, using the colloquialism frowned
upon by most enforcers.
</P>
<P>
   Because he has good skills and is a good skater, Hitchcock said
he would like to try to play Severyn eight to 10 minutes a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a smart player as far as establishing what happens during
a game,'' Hitchcock said. ``He knows his role, and it's no
different than the role (Joey) Kocur has with the Red Wings.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, for the Wings, Kocur had six goals, five assists
and 92 penalty minutes while playing an average of eight minutes in
62 games. He also was good enough to play in 18 of the Wings' 22
playoff games en route to winning the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Severyn likely won't get that many goals and will probably have
twice as many penalty minutes. But he would also like to be around
for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in Colorado and we made it to the conference
finals, it was the greatest thing in the world,'' he said. ``That's
what life is all about for me.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where the comparisons to pro wrestling will end for Brent
Severyn. The native of Vegreville, Alberta, is ready to take a few
punches in hopes of hoisting the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a lot of time hitting the bag and lifting weights and
doing all that has brought me to this moment in my life,'' he said.
``I've been doing this for the past three years, so everyone thinks
I'm just a sluggo. I know I can play. But if this gets me to where
I want to be, I'm ready to do it.''

GUNMEN SLAY 19 IN RAID ON 3 FAMILIES IN MEXICO  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM DILLON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENSENADA, Mexico _ Gunmen dressed in black and carrying assault
rifles pulled three families from their homes early Thursday
morning and shot at least 20 men, women and children against a wall
in what the police described as a drug-related slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, the authorities were still providing conflicting
versions of events that occurred in a suburb of this city, 60 miles
south of the California border.
</P>
<P>
   The executions took place in the concrete driveway of a
two-story stucco home on a hillside in Vista al Mar, a cluster of
houses a mile from the Pacific Ocean. Soldiers from the Ensenada
army garrison and Baja State judicial police officers refused to
let reporters enter the walled compound Thursday afternoon, as
detectives stood staring at a pool of blood in the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Killed or wounded in the attack were Fermin Castro, 38, his wife
and 2-year-old son; his brother-in-law, Francisco Flores
Altamirano, 30, Flores' 52-year-old mother, his sister, his wife
and five children aged 4 through 13, and a family of seven
neighbors, including a pregnant teenager and a 1-year-old child. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The killing came hours after Castro produced a rodeo for an
independence day celebration near Ensenada, a relative said.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said at least 17 victims died immediately. Two
women and a man were left wounded, and one of the women has since
died, according to a bulletin issued by Baja California State
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's attorney general, Jorge Madrazo, said in an interview
that 19 people were killed in the attack by gunmen armed with AK-47
and 9-millimeter weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo said the head of one of the three families, Castro, had
been under federal investigation on suspicion of working with a top
lieutenant of the Arellano Felix drug smuggling gang, which is
based here in Baja California state.
</P>
<P>
   The government news agency Notimex Thursday quoted the state
attorney general, Marco Antonio de la Fuente Villarreal, as saying
Castro was a cultivator of marijuana for the Arellano Felix group,
which has been known as one of Mexico's most violent.
</P>
<P>
   Castro's fate was not clear. The state government bulletin
listed him as one of 19 dead in the attack. But the same bulletin
said that he had been taken to an Ensenada hospital and had
survived the attack.
</P>
<P>
   A relative of Castro, who asked not to be identified, said
Thursday night that Castro was alive.
</P>
<P>
   Castro's relative said she received a call at 8 a.m. from her
sister-in-law, who said, ```There had been a shootout in my
brother's house and that they had killed everybody, but they
weren't sure if anybody had been left alive or who had done it or
why,'' she recounted.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if she was sure her relative had not been involved in
illegal activities, the relative said, ``If he did things we didn't
know about, he must have had it all pretty hidden.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She said he is a former teacher who moved here 20 years ago from
another part of the state and has a rodeo company based in Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Castro interviewed outside his home Thursday said he
had grown wealthy in recent years as a successful cattleman, and he
is well known in Ensenada as an organizer of rodeo events. Eighteen
horses grazed in a fenced enclosure behind his home Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Contreras, a contractor who said he had done
construction work for Castro, said, ``I think what caused this
killing was just the envy of people jealous because Fermin had so
many cattle.''
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with the case said that one teen-age girl
survived the attack by hiding in a closet.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Attorney General Madrazo said that Castro was
suspected of being an associate of Ismael Higuera Guerrero, a
lieutenant in the Arellano Felix organization said to have become
increasingly important as the brothers have been forced to operate
from hiding. Higuera has been using Ensenada as a trafficking base.
</P>
<P>
   In December, when federal authorities intensified efforts to
apprehend or suppress the Arellano Felix gang after several
high-profile slayings were attributed to them, prosecutors sought
to obtain a search warrant for Castro's property here, known as
``El Rancho del Rodeo,'' but were apparently denied the warrant by
a judge.
</P>
<P>
   The Baja State bulletin said that authorities in Ensenada
received a call at 5 a.m., reporting that ``it appeared that there
were from 10 to 12 persons dead, that it could be caused by
firearms, and that they were members of three families.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At 5:20, on arriving at the place, we realized that at one
side of the patio there were 18 bodies lying on the ground; 17
apparently dead, and one of them, of the feminine sex, still alive.
But once transported to the Hospital del Carmen by an ambulance,
she died at 7:50 a.m.,'' the bulletin said.
</P>
<P>
   One Mexican law enforcement official said Thursday that one
hypothesis is that the executions are related to the slaying of a
major trafficker, Rafael Munoz Talavera, on Sept. 11 in Ciudad
Juarez. He formed an alliance with the Arellano Felix brothers last
year during a violent attempt to take control of the cartel based
in Juarez.
</P>
<P>
   But the authorities acknowledged that they were still largely
baffled by the ferocity and ruthlessness of Thursday's killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really happened there?'' one Mexican official asked out
loud. ``At this point, who knows?''

INDUSTRY TREND SEEN AS CITICORP, TRAVELERS PLAN MAJOR LAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER TRUELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the first of what is expected to be major layoffs
at financial companies, Citicorp and Travelers Group Inc. _ which
plan to merge into Citigroup Inc. _ confirmed Thursday that they
would eliminate several thousand jobs, many in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts, which the two companies declined to specify either by
number, percentage, or location of jobs, are expected to be spread
across the combined company, which currently employs more than
160,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Citicorp and Travelers executives who declined to be identified
by name said the cuts were likely to fall particularly hard on
businesses that have been hit by the recent decline in financial
markets, such as the issuing and trading of bonds and equities, and
in areas that overlap, such as foreign exchange trading, credit
card services, data processing, headquarters' staff and human
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these businesses are based in and around New York City _
where the two companies now employ 28,000.
</P>
<P>
   Several New York companies, including Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and
other big banks and brokerage houses, were also expected to
announce layoffs _ crimping, or even halting, a run of several
years of prosperity for New York, where financial services had
become an increasingly important part of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, 100,000 of the projected Citigroup work force is
based in the United States, so the brunt of the expected
retrenchment at the financial behemoth will probably fall on
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   And the cutbacks will not stop with Citibank and Travelers if
the global economic turmoil continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this environment continues I would expect all the companies
I follow _ the banks with big broker dealers _ to rethink their
staffing,'' said Diane Glossman, bank analyst at Lehman Inc.,
referring to the recent downturn in financial markets. ``J.P.
Morgan already announced a program earlier this year, Bankers Trust
is already revamping its business, Bank of Boston already
restructured in Europe and Asia.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The swoon in financial markets had led to frequent speculation
that Citibank and Travelers might even call off their pending
merger, which had yet to obtain the required approval from the
Federal Reserve Board. The company they are proposing to create
would offer banking, insurance, brokerage and other financial
services to companies and individuals in 100 different countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company is being very circumspect,'' said Judah Kraushaar,
an analyst at Merrill Lynch. ``They're saying it's up to the Fed.
He added, ``From my own point of view, there's a high probability
the deal will close in October.''
</P>
<P>
   Citibank and Travelers refused Thursday to confirm various
reports, first carried on CNBC television, that the two companies
would eliminate 5 percent of their combined work force, or about
8,000 jobs by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   But John M. Morris, a spokesman for Citibank who said he also
spoke for Travelers, admitted the cuts ``may be as much as that.''
He said that he could not confirm the 8,000 number, which he said
had been ``plucked out of the air,'' or the related report that 5
percent of the companies' combined work force would be cut by the
end of the year. But the spokesman said those numbers were
``directionally correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said such cuts were to be expected and that they might
well involve more than 8,000 jobs, or 5 percent of the combined
companies' work force. ``My own hunch is that this is a piece of
something that'll be broader,'' said Kraushaar, adding, ``I don't
find this surprising at all. There is a lot of bureaucracy in a
bank that you don't find in a company like Travelers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Mandle, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co., the
brokerage firm, said, ``We thought the cost saves were going to be
greater than what the companies were talking about'' at the April
merger announcement. ``We thought it was more like $600 million,
rather than the $400 million they were talking about,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Glossman, the Lehman analyst, said, ``There are clear
opportunities to cut spending and cut right up front. I would not
be surprised to see more than 5 percent of the staff involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to play down Thursday's speculation of layoffs, Morris
said, ``There is no companywide goal. Each manager has been asked
to look for efficiencies, and to see that their costs are in line
with any revised business expectations they would have.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as specific numbers are concerned, Morris added, ``we are
not prepared to say that, because it's vague at the moment.'' He
also stressed that the cost-cutting was not a single program but a
host of different initiatives, some dating from before the
announcement of the merger. About a year ago, Morris said as an
example, Citicorp announced a program of 7,500 layoffs, which he
said is now ``about half done.''
</P>
<P>
   Travelers chairman Sanford Weill and Citicorp chairman John Reed
made no comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But Weill addressed a gathering of investors and analysts at the
St. Regis Hotel in Manhattan on Thursday. The famous financier _
who rose through the brokerage business to build up a huge
insurance, brokerage and financial services conglomerate _ made no
bones about the combined companies' intention to cut costs. ``We
all get spoiled in good times,'' he told the conference, according
to Morris. ``We probably say `yes' too many times. And we'll
probably be saying `no' too many times and that will be good. It's
time to plan for the worst and pray for the best instead of the
reverse.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's top executives seem to have been preparing its
employees and the markets for more austerity. ``We have to operate
a company in bad weather as well as in good weather,'' Travelers
president and chief operating officer James Dimon, a key lieutenant
of Weill's, told investors recently, according to Morris. ``A
company should be successful in adverse conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has had an opportunity to be ebullient for very long in
this environment,'' Morris said. ``Business conditions are not what
they were on April 6 when we announced our merger.''

GUNMEN SLAY 19 IN MEXICAN MASSACRE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DUDLEY ALTHAUS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Gunmen dragged men, women and children from three
houses before dawn Thursday near the Pacific Coast port of
Ensenada, lined them against a wall and riddled them with bullets.
</P>
<P>
   At least 18 people _ including an infant and six other children
_ were killed on the spot. One person was reported to have died
later.
</P>
<P>
   Police offered no clear motives for the killings. But a Mexican
news agency said a man who has ties to a powerful drug-smuggling
organization, was critically wounded in the attack, and Mexico's
national media and political leaders speculated that the massacre
was linked to narcotics trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen swept into El Sauzal, a community about 60 miles
south of San Diego, Calif., about 4:30 a.m. Thursday. They entered
a compound where the three houses were located, forced the victims
into a courtyard and opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican television images from the scene showed the victims
laying in front of a low wall, all either dressed in pajamas or
partially or fully naked, as if given no time to dress by the
killers. Hundreds of spent bullet casings, from either AK-47
automatic rifles and 9 mm pistols, littered the ground near the
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Children's bikes and other toys stood mute in the yard and the
concrete porches of what appeared to be expensive houses set behind
an elaborate iron fence. El Sauzal sits about six miles north of
Ensenada on the main coastal highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears they rounded them all up, lined them up and gunned
them down,'' said Jose Ramon Espinosa, a state police agent in
Ensenada.
</P>
<P>
   Notimex, the government's news agency, quoted Baja California
state prosecutor, Marco Antonio de la Fuente, as saying the
surviving victim, Fermin Castro, worked in the marijuana growing
operations of the powerful Arrellano Felix narcotics organization.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, however, he said that there was no clear
motive for the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   The gang, headed by four Arrellano Felix brothers, is based in
Tijuana and smuggles much of the Mexican marijuana and heroin and
Colombian cocaine into the United States. Authorities say the
Arrelano Felix brothers' gang now comprises Mexico's most powerful
and bloody cocaine and narcotics trafficking organization.
</P>
<P>
   A port and fisheries center about 60 miles south of the border
on the coast, Ensenada is a popular weekend destination for many
Southern California residents.
</P>
<P>
   Although the level of violence pointed to by the massacre has
been rare in Mexico, local reporters said Thursday that the
Ensenada area has recently been racked by gangland killings and
police busts linked to Mexico's narcotics trade.
</P>
<P>
   But the Arrellano Felix brothers' many feuds with rivals have
left hundreds of dead this year in Tijuana, the border city an
hour's drive north of the site of Thursday's massacre. The brothers
have been blamed for the attempted assassination last fall of Jesus
Blancornelas, a Tijuana newspaper publisher who has often
campaigned against the smugglers and their alleged protectors
inside the Mexican government.
</P>
<P>
   Members of a well-to-do Tijuana family, the Arrellano Felixes
are widely assumed to be Mexico's dominant narcotics smuggling
organization since the death last year of Amado Carrillo Fuentes,
whose own gang was based in Ciudad Juarez, across the border from
El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Another powerful Juarez drug traffickers, Rafael Munoz Talavera,
was murdered last week in Juarez. U.S. and Mexican police suggested
Munoz was killed in the ongoing struggle to replace Amado Carrillo
as the principal trafficker in that area of the border and
predicted more deaths.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Scores of Mexican army troops and state and federal police
agents swarmed into the compound where the massacre took place,
blocking access to reporters on the scene. Roadblocks reportedly
were thrown up in the area throughout the day in hopes of turning
up suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Massacres involving women and children are rare in the Mexican
underworld. But such killings occur occasionally in the
drug-producing mountains of southern Guerrero and Oaxaca states. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Abandoning any pretense of bipartisanship, the
House Judiciary Committee spent the day Thursday wrangling over
whether to make public a videotape of President Clinton's grand
jury testimony in the Lewinsky case and discussing how to edit
reams of pages delivered by the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of 11 votes, Democrats on the panel pushed
unsuccessfully for a delay in releasing both the videotape and the
2,000-page appendix of supporting material attached to the
independent counsel's report, arguing that the material should not
be released at all or should be released all at once. They
expressed grave concern during the gathering about making the
information public piecemeal, calling the strategy politically
motivated.
</P>
<P>
   The panel is expected to approve release of the videotape of the
president's grand jury session without any redactions, as early as
Saturday. A videotape of the president's deposition in the Paula
Jones case in January, in which his testimony about Monica Lewinsky
has become the foundation for special prosecutor Kenneth Starr's
central charges of perjury, may also be released.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, Clinton's private lawyer, issued a statement
Thursday in which he said he had demanded that Starr destroy the
videotape of Clinton's grand jury testimony. Its continued
existence, he said, ``was to ensure its public release and
embarrass the president.''
</P>
<P>
   In a seething response Thursday night, Starr said the
independent counsel's office considered the videotaped testimony to
be ``evidence of a crime.'' The prosecutor is contending that
Clinton lied to the grand jury as well as in his Jones deposition.
The videotape does not cast Clinton in a flattering light,
depicting him as occasionally impatient, frustrated and quibbling
in his discussion of his affair with Ms. Lewinsky. Democrats said
an edited transcript of the testimony would have sufficed.
</P>
<P>
   While much attention has been focused on disputes over the
president's videotaped testimony, the panel spent much of the day
arguing about the supporting documents that Starr sent to Congress
to bolster his case that the president's actions may be cause for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The panel agreed on over 100 separate redactions of the report's
2,000-page appendix, which includes background information, maps of
the West Wing, a table of Ms. Lewinsky's White House visits and a
table of the contacts between the two of them. It also contains
lengthy footnotes and legal references.
</P>
<P>
   Their protracted debates mainly involved squabbles over eight
passages containing the most sexually explosive material, a person
familiar with the proceedings said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In their first meeting since Starr delivered his report to
Congress on Sept. 9, the panel's Republicans and Democrats bickered
about the merits of releasing the videotape and zeroed-in on the
most sensitive sexual material. They debated, among other things,
the relevance of mentioning sexual props. Both sides said they took
into consideration relevance and good taste.
</P>
<P>
   But, during a debate that boomeranged between collegiality and
partisanship, members accused each other of political motives and
questioned each other's sincerity in pursuing the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to let the public join in the decision-making
process,'' said Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., a member of the
committee, who argued that the committee is searching for a balance
between privacy and decency concerns and the public's right to
know. ``The very fact today is balance. It must be presented in a
balanced fashion so the American people can make their own
judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson's argument was echoed throughout the day by other
Republicans on the panel, who argued that the public should make
its own determination based on the same evidence handed to
Congress. And they accused Democrats of putting Clinton's concerns
ahead of the country's. The president's testimony, they said, is
vital to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats insisted, as they have all week, that hasty disclosure
of the materials is a strategy that will humiliate Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Republicans are trying to do is get the bad stuff out
about the president, as much as they can, as fast as they can,''
said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., a member of the panel. Frank
added, ``They're frustrated that the president's official standing
is as high as it is, and they're trying to tear it down.''

 &HT;    Clinton welcomed , but not without a few protesters
 &HT;    By Jim Bebbington and Laura Bischoff
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ It took Bill Clinton's sexual turmoil to put the
civic spirit into Debbie Graham and Peggy Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   The two, from nearby Kenwood, stood in a warm, drizzling rain in
a crowd of about 150 protesters Thursday near a Amberley Village
home where Bill Clinton visited for a $5,000 per plate fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   They had never protested anything in public before, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called her today and said 'I'm angry' and she said she was
angry, too,'' said Graham, 43.
</P>
<P>
   The two were not alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about sex; this is about honor,'' said Jane Thole,
a homemaker from suburban Sycamore.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of a crowd filled with veteran protestors were
dozens of people who said Clinton's behavior with Monica Lewinsky
infuriated them so much they came to shout their outrage in public
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Their signs were blunt:
</P>
<P>
   ``Resign''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton is unfit for any public office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Adulterers end up in Hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said Clinton's affair with Lewinsky and the public
turmoil it has created has made her job more difficult trying to
raise her son to respect women.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of mothers who are dealing with these very
difficult issues,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   The new protestors found strange bedfellows with the others,
most anti-abortion protestors, who unfurled religious banners and
held large, graphic photographs of fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   A protesting regular, who would not give his name but said he
had picketed hundreds of abortion clinics, looked around. ``There
are a lot of people here I have never seen before,'' he said. ``New
faces. It's real good.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's dark-windowed limousine and its caravan whisked past
the group in less than a minute, serenaded with the angry shouts of
``Time to resign.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the home of attorney Stanley Chesley, Clinton helped
raise an estimated $250,000 for the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee, eating lunch with about 50 people including
Cincinnati Mayor Roxanne Qualls, who is running for Congress, and
Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Leland.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told them the money raised would help get Qualls and
other Democrats elected to Congress. He alluded only briefly to the
Lewinsky scandal, talking instead about work that needs to be done
to strengthen the economy and the nation's schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary and I are fine,'' he said. ``We're working on what we
need to work on. We are doing fine.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Chesley's home, Clinton made unscheduled visits in
downtown Cincinnati, dropping in at the Findlay Market for about 20
minutes, shaking hands and saying hello to the 100 patrons there,
then crossing the street for a bowl of Tex-Mex chili.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an experience for me because I knew the chili was good
but I didn't know it was that good,'' said Greg Magruder, co-owner
of the Gold Star Chili on Race Street. ``It was an experience I'll
probably never get over in my life _ to meet a person of that
magnitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Magruder answered the president's questions about how he got
into the restaurant business and served Clinton a 3-ounce bowl of
chili and cup of Maxwell House decaf. ``He seemed to enjoy it,''
Magruder said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was becoming well fed; in his remarks an hour earlier at
the Chesley fund-raiser Clinton said he had eaten so much he was
feeling a little sleepy.
</P>
<P>
   Magruder said Secret Service agents ate at the restaurant on
Wednesday and asked questions without identifying themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Magruder plans to hang the photo of him and the president in the
restaurant as well as in his home.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Kroeger of Kroeger &AMP; Sons Meats in the Findlay Market said
Clinton received cheers from most of the people around.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of neat to see. It was good for the neighborhood.
It made people here feel special,'' Kroeger said.

 &HT;    Staunchest allies stay faithful
 &HT;    By Scott Shepard
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- African-Americans, long suspicious of the nation's
law enforcement establishment, have become President Clinton's most
ardent defenders in his bid to withstand impeachment, while some
Latino leaders say there is growing uneasiness over investigating
the personal lives of politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Their defense of Clinton follows a yearlong White House effort
to promote a national conversation on race relations. The
President's Race Advisory Board, which has been responsible for
conducting this dialogue, meets Friday with Clinton. The
seven-member advisory board is expected to issue a report to
Clinton sometime this fall with a recommendation to create a
council to continue its work.
</P>
<P>
   During a news conference Wednesday with Czech Republic President
Vaclav Havel, Clinton said he will consider creating a permanent
body to continue the national dialogue he started last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect this to be a central part of the work I do for the
rest of my life,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   For many African-Americans, independent counsel Kenneth Starr's
investigation of Clinton's sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky is
not unlike J. Edgar Hoover's infamous investigation of the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr.'s sex life in the early 1960s, said David
Bositis, a senior policy analyst at the Joint Center for Political
and Economic Studies, the nation's leading African-American think
tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word `prosecutor' has an entirely different meaning in the
African-American community than in the white community,'' said
Bositis. ``Hoover probably spent millions of dollars investigating
King, and Hoover didn't even have the excuse of an independent
counsel law.''
</P>
<P>
   A history of police brutality and persecution of black people by
the nation's law enforcement system has prompted many
African-American officials to rally behind the president, not in
approval of his conduct but to ensure that Clinton gets a fair
hearing as Congress proceeds on Starr's report, said Rep. Sheila
Jackson Lee (D-Texas).
</P>
<P>
   ``For those of us with a history in the civil rights movement,
this is an issue of fundamental fairness,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine of the 35 members of the House Congressional Black
Caucus voted last week against public release of Starr's report to
Congress. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), who heads the caucus,
vowed that her organization intends to be ``the fairness cop'' as
Congress decides what to do about Starr's report of possible
impeachable offenses by the president.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the fairness issue, however, many African-Americans view
Clinton as their most important political ally since Lyndon
Johnson. They see Clinton as standing up to Republican-led efforts
to do away with affirmative action, programs designed in the late
1960s to correct past discrimination and ensure equal opportunity
for minorities, as well conducting a yearlong ``national
conversation'' to mend racial divisions in the country.
</P>
<P>
   A poll by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press
just before Starr's report was released showed Clinton with an 88
percent job approval rating among African-Americans, considerably
higher than the 61 percent approval rating among white people.
</P>
<P>
   The poll did not provide such a breakdown among Latinos, but
Hispanic leaders at the grass-roots level suggested this week that
Latino support for Clinton mirrors the national trend, with roughly
2 out of 3 approving of the job he is doing but disapproving of his
personal conduct.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 election, Clinton received 88 percent of
African-Americans' votes and slightly more than 70 percent of
Latino votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latinos are pretty much mainstream,'' said Guillermo Galindo,
incoming chairman of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in Dallas.
``They don't like what the president did, but they think he's been
a pretty good president overall.''
</P>
<P>
   The political fall of former HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros,
accused of lying to the FBI about a mistress, has contributed to
Latino concerns about investigating the personal lives of public
officials, Galindo added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether we should be looking into such
matters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa Orenstein, a lawyer, said a meeting of Democratic and
Republican Latino leaders in Dallas on Saturday concluded with
``the overwhelming feeling'' that Starr's investigation had gone
too far into Clinton's personal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it really our business to be peeping into windows?'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Hispanic Caucus, however, in contrast to the
black caucus, has not asserted any caucus role if Congress proceeds
with impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that the Hispanic leadership is stuck in a political
fix,'' said Rodolpho de la Garza, a professor of government at the
University of Texas in Austin and vice president of the Thomas
Rivera Policy Institute, a Latino-oriented think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Latino leaders are promoting Energy Secretary Bill Richardson as
a possible vice presidential running mate for the Democratic
nominee in 2000, de la Garza noted: ``And if the nominee is (Vice
President Al) Gore, (Latinos) criticizing Clinton now could hurt
Richardson's chances.''

 &HT;    Congress pushes the pause button on Clinton video
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman and Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- The House Judiciary Committee unexpectedly delayed
release of President Clinton's videotaped testimony Thursday, and
Republican leaders asked the FBI to investigate an alleged smear
campaign by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In an atmosphere bereft of the cooperation promised by leaders
in both parties, Judiciary Committee members bickered all day over
release of additional material from independent counsel Kenneth
Starr's report to Congress, including Clinton's Aug. 17 testimony
to a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that any of the material would be released before
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.), the committee chairman, said his
panel's work bogged down over what to keep from the public out of
the 2,700 pages of supporting evidence that accompanied Starr's
445-page report on his investigation of the president's efforts to
conceal his relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to agree on things that are extraneous and aren't
relevant to the central issues,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, Clinton's private lawyer, issued a statement
saying that Starr had earlier refused a request to destroy the tape
of Clinton's testimony after it was viewed by an absent grand
juror. Kendall said the only purpose for preserving it ``was to
ensure its public release and embarrass the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Kendall's comments and the objections of some
congressional Democrats, the release of the videotape is virtually
certain. But Hyde said he would not make it available in advance of
printed documents, including the transcript of Clinton's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The public is likely to get more of the sexually explicit
details that characterized the release of the first part of Starr's
report a week ago, said Rep. Chris Cannon (R-Utah), a committee
member. ``We're talking about the Kenneth Starr report, and that's
a blusher,'' Cannon said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, fears of more disclosures about elected officials'
private lives prompted an extraordinary pledge from the chairmen of
the House Democratic and Republican campaign committees to cut off
campaign financing to candidates who make an issue of their
opponents' personal lives.
</P>
<P>
   The statements by Rep. John Linder of Georgia, the Republican
campaign committee chairman, and Rep. Martin Frost of Texas,
Linder's Democratic counterpart, came on the morning after Salon,
an on-line magazine, revealed that Hyde had an affair with a woman
30 years ago while both were married to other people.
</P>
<P>
   Frost said he would refuse to give committee money ``to any
Democratic candidate who initiates an attack on the personal
private life of an opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Linder agreed, but later said candidates were free to make an
issue of their opponents' ``character.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fine,'' Linder said. ``We've been doing it for 200
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Distinguishing between what is permissible and what is not will
be done on a case-by-case basis, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The story about Hyde's relationship drew expressions of anger
from Democrats and Republicans alike.
</P>
<P>
   But House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other GOP leaders went a
step further, sending FBI Director Louis Freeh a letter asking him
to investigate whether the White House was involved in planting the
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not that specific story originated with the White
House or its allies, clearly there is credible evidence that an
organized campaign of slander and intimidation may exist,'' the
letter said.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas) offered no evidence of
White House involvement in the Hyde story other than a brief report
on ABC News based on anonymous sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hire a private investigator to go find the dirt, and they
give it to a reporter,'' DeLay said, with no substantiation.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jim Kennedy denied that administration
officials gave Salon any information for its story.
</P>
<P>
   And the retired salesman Salon says tipped off the magazine
about the Hyde affair also denied that the White House was
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me make very clear that nobody ... has been in contact
with me from the White House,'' Norm Sommer said. ``I tried to call
the White House to offer support but they never called me back.''
</P>
<P>
   White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles sent Hyde a letter
promising that ``any staff found to be engaging in such conduct
will be fired immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Members from both parties acknowledged little could be done to
stop the flow of stories of sexual liaisons.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few weeks, news organizations have reported on Rep.
Dan Burton's (R-Ind.) adulterous relationship with a woman that
produced a child and on Rep. Helen Chenoweth's (R-Idaho) six-year
affair with a married man in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   One House member was unfazed by the specter of disclosure of
still more lurid details. ``You think I'm worried about that?''
said Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), once reprimanded by his
colleagues for a sex scandal. ``I gave at the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's edict banning indecorous references to Clinton on the
House floor remained in effect, but one Republican lawmaker used a
variation of the fable of the emperor's new clothes to make his
point without once mentioning the president's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day, however, the emperor was caught in deeds that brought
disgrace to his ability to lead and dishonor to his office,'' Rep.
Joseph Pitts of Pennsylvania said. ``He was caught with his clothes
off.''

 &HT;    'Do nothing' charges hurled at GOP
 &HT;    By Bob Deans
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cincinnati -- President Clinton left Washington behind Thursday,
traveling to Ohio where he derided the political culture of the
nation's capital as ``too obsessed with itself'' to address the
nation's business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington always thinks everything's about Washington,''
Clinton told an elite group of supporters who donated $10,000 per
couple to the Democratic Party to have lunch with the president in
the home of a prominent Cincinnati attorney. ``It's not about
Washington, it's about America.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used the fund-raiser, which generated more than $200,000
for a pair of Democrats running for the U.S. House of
Representatives, to chastise Republicans and challenge his own
party to focus on issues, not scandal, in the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not about me,'' Clinton said of the coming election.
``It is about the people of this country, it is about their
children, their future and our common efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   The money Clinton raised in Cincinnati was intended to support
the House candidacies of Cincinnati Mayor Roxanne Qualls and former
Kentucky Attorney General Chris Gorman.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton lashed out at the Republican-led Congress that is
reviewing possible impeachment proceedings, accusing the
Republicans of waging ``a strategy of not doing anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Clinton, ``They've killed tobacco legislation and campaign
finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   He then blasted a Republican plan to give back to taxpayers much
of an anticipated federal budget surplus through an $80-billion tax
cut, a proposal he earlier in the day in Washington pledged to
veto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd just kind of like to watch the ink turn from red to black
and see it dry,'' Clinton explained to backers in Cincinnati,
``before we start shoveling it out the door again.''
</P>
<P>
   Any available surplus money should be set aside, Clinton said,
until Congress and the White House can agree on a plan to shore up
the Social Security system, which is on track to go broke sometime
in the third decade of the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he favored targeted tax cuts to help lower-income
Americans pay for child care and education, and to help encourage
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton drew praise from the luncheon's sponsor, attorney Stan
Chesley, who said Americans should ``thank our lucky stars,'' to
have Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``This president is here to stay,'' Chesley told about 40
wealthy Democrats. ``He's not going anywhere, and he's not going to
be goaded into resigning.''
</P>
<P>
   Near Chesley's home, however, several dozen protesters gathered
to demand that Clinton step down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put America first and resign now,'' read the headline above a
blistering editorial in Thursday's Cincinnati Enquirer, one of 87
newspapers across the country whose editorial boards have called
upon the president to step aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your authority is crippled beyond repair,'' the Enquirer
intoned. ``Each day you remain makes it harder to remove the stains
you will leave on our White House.''
</P>
<P>
   A Cincinnati-area radio station, WOFX , took a different
approach, putting up billboards along Clinton's motorcade route,
picturing him and former intern Monica Lewinsky arm-in-arm beneath
the Rolling Stones lyric ``I can't get no satisfaction.''

MEXICO PROMISES FULL INQUIRY INTO TAINTED ELITE DRUG UNIT  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By TIM GOLDEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexico's attorney general promised Thursday to
conduct a ``profound'' investigation into possible corruption of an
elite American-trained police unit and insisted that antidrug
cooperation with the United States should continue without
interruption.
</P>
<P>
   But Attorney General Jorge Madrazo Cuellar also bristled at the
statement by law-enforcement officials in Washington that problems
with the Mexican unit might have resulted in the betrayal of
important American information to powerful traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We share with the United States much, much more information
that we ourselves generate than we get from officials there,''
Madrazo said.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo spoke in an interview here after U.S. officials had
disclosed that three top investigators of an organized-crime unit
of the attorney general's office had failed lie-detector tests that
U.S. experts administered this month. The investigators were all
found to be lying when they were asked whether they had provided
information to traffickers, officials of both countries said.
</P>
<P>
   Several American officials described the test results as a
catastrophic sign that the integrity of the unit had been
compromised. Speaking privately, some of the officials also
questioned whether the Mexican authorities were really intent on
finding out what had occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in their position have access to every file in that
unit,'' one American official said. Referring to the United States
Drug Enforcement Administration and its informers in Mexico, the
official asked: ``Do they know who the DEA's sources are? No. But
they know who all the American targets are.''
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo insisted that he would get to the bottom of the case. To
insure an impartial investigation, he said, he had taken the
unusual step of assigning the inquiry not to his own
internal-affairs investigators, but to auditors in his office who
answer to the comptroller of the republic.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he had immediately removed the three senior
officials from the unit, along with two lower-ranking investigators
who also tested badly. Of eight tested, three senior officials
passed easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to follow this investigation wherever it goes,''
Madrazo said. ``We are not going to protect anyone. Somebody who
does not pass a polygraph has to go. Those are not American rules.
They are mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as a fuller picture emerged, however, Mexican and American
officials continued to contradict one another about its meaning.
</P>
<P>
   American officials had initially said that the lie-detector
tests were routine, part of the follow-up testing that is regularly
and randomly applied to carefully screened antidrug units that the
United States has helped establish in several countries.
</P>
<P>
   But in subsequent interviews officials acknowledged that members
of the Mexican unit became targets for testing after American
informers and other information had suggested that they might have
ties to powerful cocaine traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo said the only such information Mexico had came from
slips of paper captured in the raid of a drug gang's safe house
that were shared with U.S. investigators. The papers included what
appeared to be traffickers' notes about the federal police and
military officials who were pursuing them.
</P>
<P>
   Two notes shown to a reporter relate conversations or meetings
with what seem to be two of the three senior organized-crime
investigators in question.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials said they would not release the investigators'
names to assure their safety.
</P>
<P>
   The meaning of the notes is unclear. But they seem to indicate
that the officials said they could not help the traffickers, but
would not harm them, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't throw somebody in jail on the basis of something like
this,'' one Mexican investigator said, pointing to other notes that
appeared to indicate contacts between the traffickers' associates
and two well-known newspaper editors.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. officials said what appeared to be contacts between the
agents and the traffickers were indeed suspicious.

GROUP SEES PROBLEM FOR PROSECUTORS IN RELEASE OF TAPED TESTIMONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER S. CANELLOS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The release of President Clinton's videotaped
testimony could have an unintended side effect for those outraged
by his conduct: It could make it more difficult to bring a criminal
indictment against him, a conservative legal foundation warned
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial Watch, a right-leaning legal group, predicted that the
release of the video would violate normal grand jury rules, and
create such prejudicial publicity, that Clinton's lawyers could
move to quash any indictment brought against him, once Congress
finishes its impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this points out why indictments should have been brought
first,'' said Judicial Watch Chairman Larry Klayman, in a prepared
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Other legal specialists were less alarmed. While the impeachment
inquiry could jeopardize future indictments, they said, the release
of the video would be only one argument among many that Clinton's
lawyers might use to try to dismiss charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Boston defense lawyer Norman Zalkind said making
Clinton's video testimony public could violate his rights. Under
federal rules, grand jury testimony is shielded until after
indictments are brought, and then it released selectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grand jury testimony is supposed to be secret and the
defendant is entitled to that secrecy'' for reasons of fairness,
Zalkind said.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the testimony is taped is also unusually
prejudicial, Zalkind said, meaning that potential jurors would be
developing impressions of his truthfulness long before any trial.
</P>
<P>
   However, F. Dennis Saylor, a former federal prosecutor, noted
that claims of pretrial publicity usually result in changes of
trial venue _ not the dismissal of indictments.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to try Clinton today, there's so much
publicity that this would be only a drop in the bucket,'' Saylor
said. ``I don't see it as an issue at all in terms of a future
prosecution of Clinton.''

FEDERAL OFFICALS ACCUSE MAN FROM CAMOROS OF ORCHESTRATING EMBASSY
BOMBING

<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal authorities charged on Thursday that the bombing of the
U.S. embassy in Kenya last month was orchestrated by an Islamic
extremist from the island nation of Comoros who reported directly
to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who is now the focus of the
world-wide inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Broadening the case against bin Laden's organization, the
government offered a $2 million reward for information leading to
the arrest of Haroun Fazil, who has been eluding authorities since
a warrant was issued for his arrest late last month.
</P>
<P>
   Fazil has been accused of 12 counts of murder, one for each
American who died in the Kenyan embassy; murder conspiracy, and the
use of weapons of mass destruction. He could face life imprisonment
or the death penalty if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials also said they had arrested a Texas man whom
they described as the former personal secretary to bin Laden when
both men lived in the Sudan in 1994. The defendant, Wadih el Hage,
of Fort Worth, is the first American citizen known to have been
charged in the investigation of bin Laden and the embassy attacks.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage appeared before a federal magistrate judge in Manhattan
late on Thursday and was charged with three counts of making false
statements to investigators. A federal prosecutor, Patrick
Fitzgerald, told the magistrate that the government would indict el
Hage on new charges by Monday, and he was ordered held without
bond. His lawyer, Bruce McIntyre, had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   The charges disclosed on Thursday by Mary Jo White, the U.S.
attorney in Manhattan, and Lewis Schiliro, assistant director of
the FBI in New York, show now more clearly how investigators are
methodically building the case against bin Laden, his operatives
and lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden was charged in a sealed indictment earlier this year
that accused him of various acts of terrorism. The government has
not said when or whether it plans an indictment in the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White said that Fazil was ``a very active member of the
Kenyan cell'' of bin Laden's terrorist group. ``He's an allegedly
major player in the organization,'' Ms. White said.
</P>
<P>
   Schiliro said that the new charges ``will get us closer to a
resolution of this case, but it is by no means ended.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcements on Thursday also shed light on the
investigation of bin Laden that dates back to before the nearly
simultaneous attacks in Kenya and Tanzania. In those attacks, on
Aug. 7, more than 250 people died, 12 of them Americans, and
thousands of people were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   A federal complaint unsealed on Thursday shows that el Hage was
interviewed by the authorities in New York as early as September
1997, and questioned about bin Laden's activities and his
associates.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the complaint says, el Hage admitted to having
worked as bin Laden's personal secretary, and also to knowing two
of his top military commanders, identified as Abu Ubaidah al
Banshiri and Abu Hafs el Masry.
</P>
<P>
   Al Banshiri drowned in a ferry accident in East Africa in 1996,
the court papers said, but they offered few other details about
either men.
</P>
<P>
   Schiliro would not say where the authorities believe Fazil has
fled, or how he may have left the Comoros islands, which are in the
Indian Ocean southeast of Tanzania and Kenya. Earlier this month,
the FBI and the Comoros police raided two homes on the island of
Moroni, looking for Fazil, and also questioned his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities described Fazil as an explosives expert in his
mid-20s who speaks fluent French, Swahili, Arabic, and English, and
is adept with computers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the federal complaint did not describe precisely
Fazil's rank in Bin Laden's organization, it suggested that his
role in the Nairobi attack was more significant than any of the
three other defendants who have been arrested and are being held in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The federal complaint said that Fazil's duties in al Qaeda
included the preparation of various reports for bin Laden and his
top lieutenants. In the Kenyan bombing, Fazil was accused of
renting the room in the Hilltop Hotel in Nairobi where
investigators believe that the bomb was constructed, and of hiring
two people to clean the room after the attack.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 7, the day of the attack, the government said, Fazil
drove a white pick-up truck which led another vehicle, which was
carrying the bomb, to the embassy site in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors did not directly accuse el Hage of a role in the
embassy bombings. But the documents say that Fazil and el Hage, the
Texan, were close, and that the two shared a house last year in
Nairobi. El Hage moved to Kenya from the Sudan in 1994, the
government said, before returning to the United States in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage did not speak in court on Thursday, but his supervisor
at the Fort Worth, company where he works, Lone Star Wheels and
Tires, said that el Hage told him on Monday that he had to take
care of personal business in New York, and would return in two
days.
</P>
<P>
   He left that afternoon on a 4:30 plane and the supervisor,
Mahmoud Mazouni, said that el Hage did not appear nervous or
troubled.

CLINTON ACCUSES REPUBLICANS OF BEING OBSESSED WITH SCANDAL,
IGNORING ISSUES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Bristling with campaign rhetoric, President Clinton
accused Republicans Thursday of being obsessed with scandal and
doing little to address the issues critical to Americans.
</P>
<P>
   A newly assertive Clinton, striking a political tone belying his
own precarious situation, tried to regain the offensive before
Congress ponders whether to begin impeachment proceedings on
perjury and obstruction charges related to his affair with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In speeches to Democrats here and in Massachusetts, as well as
to union members in Washington, Clinton appeared to echo sentiments
found in public opinion polls and presented himself as a man at
work while Republicans were steeped in political machinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I would like for you to think about is not me. Hillary
and I, we're doing fine. We're working on what we need to be
working on and we're doing fine. What I'm concerned about is the
rest of the people in this country and one more time having
Washington obsessed with itself instead of America,'' Clinton told
a handful of wealthy contributors here.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to energize Democratic voters, Clinton seized on four
issues to mark his return to the political arena _ America's role
in the global economy, education spending, Social Security reform
before tax cuts and passage of a patient bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember those four issues. Look at the (past) eight months.
We've got one appropriation bill, they killed campaign finance
reform and they killed tobacco legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``As near as I can tell that's the record of the last eight
months. That is what this is about. It is not about me. It is about
the people of this country. It is about their children, their
future and our common effort. I am going to do everything I can to
fight for these things and try to help people who believe in them
get elected,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Those were also the eight months that independent counsel
Kenneth Starr investigated allegations that Clinton committed
perjury and obstructed justice by covering up an affair with
Lewinsky. Clinton acknowledged on Aug. 17 that he misled Americans
about the relationship but continues to maintain that he testified
truthfully.
</P>
<P>
   The president's comments came as the Republican-led House
Judiciary Committee delayed a decision on whether to release the
president's videotaped testimony to a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The more combative statements Thursday stood in marked contrast
to the president's efforts last week to be contrite and seeking
forgiveness for his extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton received one of his harshest greetings here in
the heartland as Cincinnati's largest newspaper, the Enquirer,
demanded the president's resignation and published readers'
reactions over four full pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have disgraced yourself and the presidency,'' the
Enquirer's editorial said.
</P>
<P>
   The paper ran some of the 1,400 comments it had received about
Clinton's lies to Americans about his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cincinnatians are angry and disappointed with the mess you're
in,'' the paper said in a front page story headlined: ``Mr.
President, we would like a word with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton came here for a $500,000 fund-raising luncheon for the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which provides
donations to House candidates, at the home of lawyer Stanley
Chesley.
</P>
<P>
   Chesley offered an emotional testimonial on Clinton's behalf,
bemoaning Starr's investigation which he said ``hounded and pursued
every move made'' by the president and first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have now is rank partisan politics,'' Chesley said,
praising the first family for standing tall and doing their jobs.
He blasted the media for obscuring the good economic news of
Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton later raised $1 million for Democratic candidates at two
events in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But even on normally friendly Democratic turf, the president
faced stinging criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts House speaker Tom Finnerman refused to appear with
the president at a party unity rally, saying: ``Bill Clinton almost
makes Nixon look like a moral giant.''
</P>
<P>
   The president began his day with a politically laced speech to
the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers were he
received a warm welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make this a season of doing things for you _ not
idleness and not indulgence, but doing things for you,'' Clinton
told the IBEW in Washington. ``That is the choice _ partisanship
over progress, people over politics _ in every issue facing the
Congress and the country, that is the choice. And the people need
to make their voices heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton threatened to veto the Republicans $85 million tax cut
being proposed by Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, and suggested some
Republicans want to dismantle Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have asked some of our Republican friends, I've said, you
know, we've been waiting 29 years for this, couldn't we at least
see the ink turn from red to black and then watch it dry for a
minute or two before we get carried away?'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's election year and it's popular. But it isn't right,''
Clinton said, again calling for Congress to save the surplus for
overhauling Social Security. ``I have said over and over again that
if Congress sends me a bill that squanders the surplus on tax cuts
before we save Social Security I'll veto it.''
</P>
<P>
   He called on Congress to pass funding for the International
Monetary Fund to help stave off the international economic crisis,
to approve money for smaller class sizes and to pass restrictions
on health insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we ought to be talking about in Washington D.C. _
something that will affect the lives of the children in this
country,'' Clinton told the union. &QL;

A HESITANT HUMBERT MAKES A STAND  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 20) 
</HEADLINE>

 Karen Durbin is the film critic for Mirabella magazine.

   ALAN DERSHOWITZ: ``You're a very strange man, Claus.''
</P>
<P>
   CLAUS VON BULOW: `'You have no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   _ From ``Reversal of Fortune'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This is perhaps the most memorable exchange in Barbet
Schroeder's stylish 1990 film about the infamous Danish socialite
accused of trying to kill his rich American wife.
</P>
<P>
   As played by Jeremy Irons _ elegantly, insinuatingly reptilian,
gray of skin as well as hair _ von Bulow appears to have something
chillier than blood running in his veins. And he delivers his
riposte to the actor Ron Silver's Dershowitzian blurt in the driest
of drawls.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Irons has made an excellent thing out of playing very
strange men. In 1988, he even played two at once _ the terminally
codependent twin gynecologists, Beverly and Elliott Mantle, in
David Cronenberg's mordant tragedy of manners ``Dead Ringers.''
</P>
<P>
   When Irons won an Academy Award three years later for ``Reversal
of Fortune,'' his acceptance speech included a prominent thank you
to Cronenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Now, audiences will finally be able to see Irons play Humbert
Humbert on the big screen, starting on Friday, when Adrian Lyne's
long delayed, much persecuted film of Vladimir Nabokov's once long
delayed, much persecuted novel, ``Lolita'' opens.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with Claus von Bulow and the woman-sharing,
morphine-addicted Mantle twins, Nabokov's notorious lover of
nymphets is a walk in the park. Nevertheless, it's a walk Irons at
first refused to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't much like him,'' the actor said recently over lunch
in his suite at the Lowell, a quietly smart hotel in the East 60s
favored by well-heeled Brits. ``I saw him as a sort of dirty old
man, as a raincoat man, you know. I thought I'd played enough of
these creepy people, so I said no.''
</P>
<P>
   Irons, of course, isn't the only one who said no to ``Lolita.''
After completing the film, Lyne spent two years being turned down
by one American distributor after another. They, too, reacted as if
Humbert Humbert was a raincoat man, and one of the great novels of
the 20th century a celebration of pedophilia.
</P>
<P>
   In a society eager to tell itself that child abuse is not
primarily a family crime but the province of depraved day care
teachers and suburban satanic cults, the distributors took one look
at Lyne's soulful, sophisticated movie and ran scared. The director
finally settled for a deal with Showtime, the cable network, to
broadcast it twice in August.
</P>
<P>
   The American rejection helped fuel the hysterical attacks on the
film (the conservative Daily Mail in London campaigned to have it
banned as perverted and obscene), and damaged its financial
prospects as well.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most galling to the filmmakers, the snub by the American
distributors appeared to stem not from artistic objections but from
a squeamish second-guessing of the marketplace. It was simply a
kind of pre-emptive self-censorship.
</P>
<P>
   Irons had come to town the night before the interview to join
Lyne at a gala screening of ``Lolita'' to benefit the Film Society
of Lincoln Center. The choice of the film was partly spurred by the
distributors' refusals.
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Koch, the Society's executive director, said the program
committee was reliably tipped that the movie was good. ``So, we
decided this was an ideal thing to show to our constituents because
they might not have another opportunity to see it on the screen.
Part of our mission is to show things that aren't available
elsewhere. My personal predilection is to show things that are
controversial.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lincoln Center screening was a crowd-pleaser. Better yet, it
was a seal of approval for ``Lolita'' from an unassailable source:
the Society's yearly New York Film Festival is one of the most
prestigious in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Better still, the deal with Showtime had broken the malignant
spell hanging over the film, and by the time of the benefit,
``Lolita'' had found a theatrical distributor, Samuel Goldwyn
Films, as well. For Irons and Lyne, celebration was in order.
</P>
<P>
   The next day found Irons hung over and as shamefaced as a
schoolboy about it. ``Margaritas,'' he said, looking a little
stunned. ``I'm no longer used to drinking like that. I fear it's
made me very dull.''
</P>
<P>
   Not likely. Even sandbagged by the aftereffects of tequila,
Irons is one of the most articulate actors in the business. And he
delivers his thoughts in his famously mellifluous voice _ a sort of
warm murmur, the aural equivalent of brown velvet. (Random House
has just issued ``Lolita'' on audiocassette with Irons narrating.)
</P>
<P>
   He hadn't planned on doing much publicity for ``Lolita.'' ``It
was difficult enough to play without having to justify it,'' he
said. ``But because people were talking such rubbish about it, I
felt I must plow in there.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also moved, he said, to ``put a bit of chat behind'' the
movie because for a time, at least, Lyne was so hurt by the attacks
on the film that ``he wasn't being the best ambassador for it.''
</P>
<P>
   At 47, Irons is lithe and handsome, looking every inch (all 73
of them) the soulful romantic hero that propelled him to fame in
``The French Lieutenant`s Woman'' almost two decades ago and that
he reprised recently as a doomed British journalist in ``Chinese
Box.''
</P>
<P>
   As that film proved, nobody dies better on camera. But for the
most part he has eschewed the predictable and glamorous career path
that beckoned early on in favor of more interesting work.
</P>
<P>
   He joked that he would do more romantic roles except that
``Richard Gere plays them all.'' Instead, he said, ``My career's
made up of roles that other actors have passed on,'' adding with a
certain glee that Lyne talked to Robert Redford, Warren Beatty and
Hugh Grant, among others, about playing Humbert.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lyne had his eye on Irons from the start. He first
raised the possibility eight years ago at a screening of ``Reversal
of Fortune,'' adding that he had two projects in mind, one of which
turned out to be ``Indecent Proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave that role to Mr. Redford,'' Irons said mockingly. A
few years later, Lyne started going after Irons in earnest,
repeatedly pressing his case and showing him scripts until the
actor finally agreed. ``Many phone calls and much heart searching''
is the way the Irons summed it up. Friends and colleagues advised
against taking the role because ``they thought he was an unsavory
character'' (a stricture that would wipe out the best part of
Robert De Niro's career and make much of Shakespeare impossible to
cast).
</P>
<P>
   ``I read and reread the script,'' Irons said, ``and I was very
knocked out by Adrian's passion.'' Finally, the decision was made
when he talked it over with Glenn Close, who is a friend and who
played an infamously unsavory character _ the bunny-boiling Fury _
in Lyne's ``Fatal Attraction.'' ``Don't worry,'' she said. ``He'll
take care of you.''
</P>
<P>
   To explain why he wanted Irons, Lyne recited a passage from the
novel when the teen-age Humbert visits a young prostitute and is
unable to haggle because ``she saw the awful lone longing in my
lowered eyes.'' The phrase conjures up Irons's face on the screen.
His Humbert is, like Nabokov's, witty, erudite and a ruthless bully
in the pursuit of his compulsion _ a point the film drives home by
having him strike Lolita more than once.
</P>
<P>
   But he's also fully human, as he would have to be in order to
undergo the ultimate redemption of love and remorse that makes the
novel moving as well as brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   Irons said he found his way into the relationship between the
middle-aged man and the budding girl by making Humbert ``boyish,''
a case of arrested development. ``When he was with her,'' Irons
said, ``he felt terribly happy. He felt 14, and yet he knew he
wasn't. That's how I was able to play him without embarrassment.''
</P>
<P>
   By the film's end, Irons's Humbert knows very well who he is and
what he's done: his face has become a mask of sorrow and regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just want to see the history of the entire relationship in
his face,'' said Lyne. ``He's a man who's left with nothing.'' He's
a man who started with nothing as well, for what is compulsion but
``an awful lone longing,'' a fathomless emptiness screaming to be
filled?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps what makes ``Lolita'' so disturbing is not simply, as
Irons and Lyne suggested, the current prominence of the once
unmentionable subject of pedophilia. Perhaps the real problem is
that Irons and Lyne have done their work too well.
</P>
<P>
   Like Nabokov 40 years ago, they violate the real taboos that
surround the alarming, fascinating, tabloid-television-worthy
subject of sex with children. Instead of a drooling monster preying
on an ``innocent victim,'' they make their pedophile familiar,
engaging, even at times sympathetic. And the 12-year-old child he
desires feels desire as well; her sexuality may be different from
and incompatible with his, but it is real.
</P>
<P>
   Irons isn't a strange man at all; he just plays one in the
movies. He's been married for 20 years to the actress Sinead Cusack
and talks with obvious delight about their sons, Sam, 19, and Max,
12. He loves cars and vehicles of all kinds, particularly his
trusty BMW motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   He relieved the stress of playing Humbert by going rollerblading
whenever he wasn't wanted on the set in North Carolina. The day of
the interview at his hotel, he was eager to fly back to Ireland,
where he and his family have a second home and where, just for fun,
he's rebuilding a 16th-century tower house castle that's on the
point of collapse. He doesn't feel the need to earn more money
because, he has said, ``I'm rich enough already,'' and he rejects
``the cardboard life'' of a superstar; he much prefers the real one
he has.
</P>
<P>
   Irons spent the morning after the Lincoln Center benefit touring
the Guggenheim Museum's motorcycle exhibit with Ulton Guilfoyle,
who helped organize the show. Time and again, as he and Guilfoyle
wound upward through the museum, women of all ages would notice
Irons and, with the consistency of whooping cranes, execute the
same little dance of desire: shock of recognition followed by a
backward step and a long, thorough look; then a slow move past the
object of attraction in a sort of polite arc; finally, having
achieved a suitably discreet distance, say, three feet, a half-turn
back for a last wordless look before moving on. Girls shriek at
Leo. Women silently drink in Irons.
</P>
<P>
   As for the object of all this libidinous kerfuffle, well, to
coin a phrase, Irons seemed to have no idea. His own fond gaze was
reserved for the motorcycles.

<P>
   Initial public offerings are viewed by many investors as the
ultimate no-brainer. Virtually no homework is required in order to
win. All you have to do is buy a company's stock on the day it goes
public and realize huge one-day profits.
</P>
<P>
   The coming IPO of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. is feeding into this
perception. Like schoolboys flipping through an issue of Playboy,
investors reading the preliminary prospectus are titillated by the
huge sums that the firm's partners stand to gain if, as expected,
the firm goes public this November. Investors wantpart of the
action.
</P>
<P>
   All but lost is a more important question: Should investors be
drawn to Goldman's IPO simply because it is a new issue?
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to understand why investors think they should.
Imprinted on their memories are IPO success stories like the saga
of Netscape Communications, which soared to more than $75 from $28
on its initial offering day in 1995. IPOs are just so much money in
the bank, they figure.
</P>
<P>
   A funny thing has happened, however, on the way to the bank.
Consider the performance of two newsletters that focus on IPOs: New
Issues, published by the Institute for Econometric Research in
Deerfield Beach, Fla., and Emerging and Special Situations, from
Standard &AMP; Poor's. If returns like Netscape's were readily
achievable, these newsletters should have easily beaten the market.
But I calculate that they lagged behind the return of the Wilshire
5000 by 5.2 and 7.3 percentage points a year, respectively, from
1983 through July 1998. The Wilshire, made up of about 7,600
companies, is used as a proxy for the entire stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the experience of these newsletters unique. Academic
studies have consistently found that the average IPO lags
significantly behind the market in the five years after going
public.
</P>
<P>
   How could the public's perception become so distorted? Memories,
it seems, are selective: Investors far more readily recall the
Netscapes than the laggards.
</P>
<P>
   If this were the end of the story, my advice would be to avoid
the Goldman offering. But it's not, thanks to a recently published
study by two professors, Alon Brav of the University of Chicago and
Paul Gompers of Harvard. They discovered a peculiarity of previous
studies that made the performance of IPOs appear to be worse than
it was.
</P>
<P>
   Here is why: Most companies that go public are of the ``small
cap growth'' variety; they have small market capitalizations and
relatively high price-to-book ratios. Historically, such companies
have underperformed the broad market. When previous studies found
that IPOs underperformed, all they were really reporting was the
pattern of small-cap growth stocks.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, such studies are not particularly relevant to the
IPO of a business like Goldman, which is certainly not a small-cap
company and may or may not qualify as a growth stock depending on
the price it brings. To correct for this, the professors studied
IPOs after adjusting for market capitalization and price-to-book
ratios. They found that the average IPO matched the market's
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The implication is that the investment value of a company going
public has nothing to do with the fact that it is a new issue.
While you shouldn't automatically avoid IPOs, neither should you
reflexively buy them.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one more cautionary note to the findings: More
companies go public near market tops than near bottoms. A company
typically doesn't go public when it thinks the market will
undervalue it.
</P>
<P>
   Where are we now? The Institute for Econometric Research
compares weekly IPO dollar volume with gross domestic product on an
annualized basis. Lower readings are more bullish. This ratio,
which normally fluctuates between zero and 0.5 percent, soared to
2.53 percent in mid-July, when volume was extremely high. Even
though volume has fallen, the current reading is a still-bearish
1.68 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that there is no reason to expect that the
Goldman offering will fare better or worse than the market over
all. But the recent pace of IPOs casts doubt on the health of the
market itself.
</P>

`THE WEATHERBOX': KNACK FOR PLAYING GEORGE AND MARTHA, AND BAD
TIMING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at the end of review.)

<P>
   NEW YORK_ When Carol enters her childhood home, angry and having
broken a window to get in, you half expect her to declare ``What a
dump!'' When she and her brother Tom begin to trade insults in a
well-worn routine of sibling hatred, there's more than a little
George and Martha in them. ``The Weatherbox'' is no ``Who's Afraid
of Virginia Woolf?'' but there are echoes.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Albee was an adviser on Travis Baker's pointed,
entertaining one-act play, and it's a good match. Kim Levin, the
director, seems to have taken a no-holds-barred, dead-ahead
approach, and it works. Baker's characters may not have the brutal
eloquence of Albee's _ in fact, their taunts are deliberately
childish (``I have a life and you don't,'' ``You don't know
anything about anything'') _ but there's power in the directness
and simplicity of their longstanding fury.
</P>
<P>
   Carol (Geneva Carr) has come home to see her dying mother, whom
Tom (Rob Sedgwick) is taking care of. But this is no sentimental
farewell. Carol wants an apology from the woman who she feels
ruined her life. Tom just wants Carol to go away and lets her know
with the dialogue's typical subtlety: ``Please leave. We don't want
you here.'' Carol ignores him and begins to vent. Then Tom breaks
her nose. (George and Martha were always right on the edge of
physical violence, too.)
</P>
<P>
   While Carol and Tom are at the emergency room, their baby
brother, Dylan, arrives, sneaking into his mother's room with a
boyish giggle. ``I'm a little drunk, Mom _ sorry,'' he says to the
sleeping woman. Dylan (Ivan Martin) is the bad boy of the family,
the James Dean character, and his mother's favorite. He also has a
drug problem. When he sees his mother's pain-killing morphine
supply, he analyzes the situation aloud. ``We are not going to
steal our mother's drugs for our own recreational use,'' he says,
and promptly does just that, while reciting ``The Love Song of J.
Alfred Prufrock.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a dream sequence _ or maybe just a drug-induced altered
reality (signaled by Ed McCarthy's inventive lighting) _ Mother
(Johanna Leister) bounds out of bed, exuding youth, energy and
beauty, and talks about her own dreams and needs.
</P>
<P>
   The audience knows exactly how to feel about each of the
children: adore Dylan, dislike Tom, be a little annoyed by Carol.
But the play doesn't leave it at that. Tom and Carol are too
painfully human not to be sympathetic too. And it's clear that
Dylan has used his status as favorite to cop out on a lot of real
life. One physical symbol of the shifting perspective is a scene
change near the end: when the lights go up again, we are in the
same room but looking at it from an almost opposite angle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Weatherbox'' goes off track at times, and the explanation
of the title is a particularly tortured metaphor about hope and
answers, but over all it's a satisfying, involving drama.
</P>

 WASHINGTON: it down.''  (mk)

<P>
   But some said the party-line friction in the panel was
predictable, members said. Last week, 11 of the Democrats on the
panel voted against a House-passed resolution to release Starr's
report and many of its accompanying documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe some Democrats would like to thwart the procedures
established under the resolution,'' said Rep. Charles Canaday,
R-Fla., a panel member.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that the partisan battle threatened to intensify, the
panel's ranking Democrat, Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, filed a
letter of protest Thursday with Hyde over the chairman's request of
the Paula Jones tape without consulting Democrats. ``I have serious
concerns regarding the propriety of your seeking the release of a
videoptaped deposition in a private civil case that has now been
dismissed,'' Conyers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's meeting also came at a time of ill-will between the
parties over the disclosure that Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman
of the committee, had conducted a extramarital affair 30 years ago.
Meanwhile, House Republicans and Democrats continued to face
divisions within their own ranks. At the same time, Rep. Tom
Coburn, R-Okla., a conservative, expressed reservations about
making public Clinton's videotaped testimony, saying it will
``heighten partisan conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As we move toward the possibility of impeachment, Congress
will face extraordinary temptations to exploit the situation for
political gain,'' he said. ``I fear that, in this particular case,
this temptation will prove irresistible and we will fail an
important test.''
</P>
<P>
   An opening salvo in the Judiciary Committee meeting came when
Democrats requested that the gathering be held in public and not
under the cloak of secrecy. The motion was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans have decided that the appropriate way to fight for
openness is in total secrecy,'' Barney Frank said during one of the
committee's sporadic breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats complained that they had not had enough time to
sift through the material and the proposed redactions.
</P>
<P>
   But in an attempt to deflect charges of partisanship, Hyde
allowed members to speak on and on during the debate. After the
meeting, the chairman said: ``There's been lot's of debate. It's
been productive debate, not frivolous debate.'' He added, ``It gets
passionate at times, interesting at times.''
</P>
<P>
   One official familiar with the material and the proceedings said
Clinton's testimony shows him repeatedly relying on legalisms and a
narrow definition of sexual relations in his reponses. He also
refuses to answer a series of more prying questions about the
extent of the affair, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, many of the toughest questions are asked by grand
jurors and not lawyers in the proceeding, the person added.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee aides have spent days poring over documents
in boxes delivered by Starr but Thursday's debate centered only on
the contents of one box, which indicates the process will be long
and slow.

UN LEADER CITES PRICE OF GLOBALIZATION  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ZACHARY R. DOWDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- As debt crises envelop national economies,
globalization is ``losing its luster'' in many quarters of the
world, its down side fueling the rise of nationalism,
protectionism, and antidemocratic forces, UN Secretary General Kofi
Annan told an audience at Harvard University last night.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a capacity crowd of about 1,200 students and faculty
at Sanders Theater, the United Nations leader said the prosperous
years of the 1990s may have so seduced world leaders and financiers
that they may have neglected the political consequences of
globalization.
</P>
<P>
   He said the neglect of political questions has made
globalization _ the economic interdependence among nations _ a
scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Globalization is seen not as a term describing objective
reality, but as an ideology of predatory capitalism,'' he said in
his 20-minute address. ``Whatever reality there is in this view,
the perception is unmistakable: Millions of people are suffering;
savings have been decimated; decades of hard-won progress in the
fight against poverty are imperiled.''
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference after the address, Annan expressed his
grav-est concern for the welfare of minorities, particularly Shiite
Muslims, in the worsening threat of military conflict between Iran
and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   He was invited to speak by the Harvard Academy of International
and Area Studies and introduced by Harvard's president, Neil L.
Rudenstine, and Samuel P. Huntington, chairman of the academy.
</P>
<P>
   Annan also took questions from the audience ranging from the
escalating tensions in Iraq over UN inspectors' access to suspected
weapons sites, to the decades-old conflict over the disputed
territory of Kashmir, claimed by Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
   One group of students held a banner calling for Annan to help
free Iraq from the grip of heavy sanctions, which have caused
humanitarian crises in the country since they were imposed after
President Saddam Hussein's troops invaded Kuwait at the beginning
of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Annan admitted the deleterious effects of sanctions on a general
population when the target is the leader of a nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sanctions can be a blunt instrument,'' he said, adding that
the reason for their imposition cannot be forgotten and that the UN
has tried, through such programs as the food-for-oil initiative, to
better focus sanctions' impact on leaders and not inhabitants of a
country.
</P>
<P>
   One student asked Annan about the UN's role in resolving the
crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where clashes between
the soldiers of President Laurent Kabila and rebel forces have
drawn several central African nations into the fray, threatening
regional stability.
</P>
<P>
   But Annan said he was hopeful that a conference among the
African nations' leaders next week will put some of those tensions
to rest.
</P>
<P>
   His analysis of the pitfalls of globalization, he said, emerges
out of his own thinking and two recent conferences on the topic.
</P>
<P>
   The view sweeps across the globe to explain the development of
three political instruments, primarily among nations that have not
benefited from globalization's reach, particularly poor nations.
</P>
<P>
   Among countries in Asia and Africa that are expressing excessive
nationalism, Annan said, ``globalization is presented as a foreign
invasion that will destroy local cultures, regional tastes, and
national traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   These developments, he said, are exacerbating longstanding
enmity along ethnic lines, for example, or are unearthing age-old
border disputes that threaten to plunge countries into the kind of
wars and internal strife that plagued Rwanda and the former
Yugoslavia when globalization came into vogue during the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Another foe of globalization is the protectionism inherent in a
form of political populism, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Embattled leaders may begin to propose forms of protectionism
as a way to offset losses supposedly incurred by too open an
embrace of competition, and too free a system of political
change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Annan said, the crises born of globalization are
leading to the emergence of ``illiberal solutions,'' including the
prominence of the ``strongman,'' the political leader who acts
decisively and lends the nation a much-desired sense of
self-determination, if only in appearance.
</P>
<P>
   That development, which impedes the advance of democracy, is
also one of the most dangerous in the era of globalization, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As central power disintegrates and bread lines grow, there is
a growing temptation to forget that democracy is a condition for
development _ and not its reward,'' he said.

`THEY STILL MAMBO IN HAVANA': MURDER MYSTERY IN A CUBA REVISITED 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(bl) 
 By D.J.R. BRUCKNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A woman is murdered on the Havana waterfront just
before the action of ``They Still Mambo in Havana'' begins. The
search for the killer provides a loose framework for a series of
encounters between Cubans and Cuban exiles visiting from Miami and
New York that allow the playwright, Rogelio Martinez, to direct
some pointed ridicule at the attitudes of both groups.
</P>
<P>
   But the search follows false leads and turns up no credible
suspect, and that outcome is a telling comment on the play itself.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who came to this country in 1980 in the Mariel
boatlift, certainly knows the weaknesses of his characters. His
denizens of Havana will do anything for dollars, and their various
forms of often amusing prostitution give the writer many
opportunities to satirize the consuming mental and moral laziness
they wallow in. If anything, he is even sharper about the
self-deceiving guilt of the returning exiles; their language
reveals that these people are a good deal coarser and more corrupt
than any of them would admit.
</P>
<P>
   The fatal flaw here is the story line, which, if it exists, is
impossible to follow. No matter how engaging some of the episodes
are, the narrative incoherence of the play gets seriously annoying
before its 90 minutes are out. Perhaps the play is still being
written. A couple of scenes about a British tourist in Havana look
suspiciously as if they were inserted just to provide a role for
Philip Courtney. He is probably funny enough to justify the
addition, but it would be nice if his character had an integral
part in the story.
</P>
<P>
   The cast as a whole is fairly strong, with especially memorable
comic contributions from Marc Ardito as a historian with an
uncertain grasp of the present, Vanessa Aspillaga as an actress
whose whole personality has been swallowed up by her profession and
David Zayas as a violinist for whom music has become a distraction
from his pursuit of men.
</P>
<P>
   And the performance gets some welcome help from Eduardo Machado,
the popular playwright, who is the director here; he cannot mask
the discontinuities, but he keeps things moving so rapidly that the
viewer does not get entirely lost in the voids of the script.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, ``They Still Mambo'' ends with the audience left to
wonder what the murdered woman had to do with it, and even more
puzzled, perhaps, about why in the last scene all the men in the
cast lose their pants. This is a dangerous gambit; a viewer might
take the loss as a metaphor for the play.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Thirty years ago, President Lyndon Johnson's Kerner
Commission concluded that America was moving toward two societies:
one black, one white, separate and unequal.
</P>
<P>
   Today, after 15 months of study and hundreds of racial dialogues
around the country, President Clinton's race advisory board
describes a somewhat different America: ``more united'' than
divided along racial lines, but a nation where ``discrimination is
still a fact of life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We as a nation need to understand that whites tend to benefit,
either unknowingly or consciously, from this country's history of
white privilege,'' concludes the report.
</P>
<P>
   Its tone runs from blunt warnings on continuing divisions to
benign exhortations for racial understanding.
</P>
<P>
   White privilege, the authors said, is built into the daily
indignities that minorities endure and whites generally do not.
Whites aren't followed by store detectives who see the word
``shoplifter'' in the color of their skin, the report said. They
don't find themselves paying more for a car than the average black
customer. They don't find themselves waiting for service or being
refused it altogether, as minorities, too often, still do.
</P>
<P>
   The report, however, is tough both on those who blink at
residual racism and on those who deny that there has been no
progress since the heady days of the civil rights revolution.
``Those who argue that there has been no change, however, and that
racism is an unchanging fixture in American life are, in our
observation, incorrect,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The story of race in America, the advisory board said, is still
very much a work in progress. ``That we have changed and will
continue to change is inevitable. How we make this transition is
the story to be written and is within our control.''
</P>
<P>
   The 200-page report is expected to be the last word from the
seven-member advisory board to the President's Initiative on Race.
The racially diverse board has worked to jump-start a national
conversation on race and gather facts for the report on the state
of race relations in America that Clinton plans to release early
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The advisory board will present its findings to Clinton today at
the White House. Its final meeting there will cap a yearlong
assignment that stretched into 15 months. Its work was marred by a
slow start, an often vague sense of a purpose, and a president
distracted by personal and political problems.
</P>
<P>
   The report will be accompanied by a separate, 74-page document
prepared by the president's Council of Economic Advisers, at the
advisory board's urging. The economic document provides statistics
on the social and economic state of minority America.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the advisory board urged Clinton to take ``bold
and decisive action to further the movement toward redeeming the
promise of America,'' as he stated when he launched the race
initiative in a commencement address in San Diego in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Board members seemed to have advice for Clinton on just about
every subject _ among them, education, criminal justice, and job
creation. They recommended, for example, that he push for an
increase in the mininum wage, seek greater increases in funding for
civil rights enforcment agencies, and work to find money to help
cities and towns repair dilapidated schools.
</P>
<P>
   Filing of the report marks the formal end of the President's
Initiatve on Race, which included three forums led by Clinton, nine
advisory board meetings, 175 conversations led by Clinton
administration officials, and more than 1,300 other local dialogues
involving 17,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the effort winds down, board members clearly believe
Clinton's notion should be perpetuated in other forms.
</P>
<P>
   In one major recommendation, the board urged Clinton to
establish ``The President's Council for One America,'' to
demonstrate his long-term commitment and ensure that such efforts
continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of creating a more just and unified society requires
continued leadership from the office of the president,'' the board
said.
</P>
<P>
   Historian John Hope Franklin, chairman of the advisory board,
said in an interview Thursday that he hoped the race effort would
be ``institutionalized.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of genuine interest in it, a lot of thinking
about it,'' especially on how to resolve this ``350-year-old
problem,'' Franklin said.
</P>
<P>
   The report lays out a detailed account of the history of
minorities in America, how they arrived, and what they confronted
when they got here. ``History has consequences, and we cannot begin
to resolve `the race problem' if we are ignorant of the historical
backdrop,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Although many observers had criticized the advisory board for
not tackling such hot topics as affirmative action and a proposal
that the nation issue an apology for slavery, the report addressed
both issues.
</P>
<P>
   Board members said they had given an apology for slavery
``considerable thought over the course of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We concluded that the question of an apology for slavery
itself is much too narrow, in light of the experience of blacks
over the course of this nation's history,'' they said. ``The
apology we must all make cannot be adequately expressed in words
but in actions.''
</P>
<P>
   The board also recommended that Clinton's ``mend it, don't end
it'' policy on affirmative action be give further study, calling it
``an area clearly in flux.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Leadership is needed to forge public consensus,'' the board
said.
</P>
<P>
   In other recommendations, board members asked Clinton to convene
``a high-level meeting'' with media executives to discuss the
problem of racial stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   They also urged him to study the problems of police misconduct
toward minorities, environmental racism, and minorities' access to
technology. In addition, they recommended that he reduce the
disparity in prison sentences for crimes involving powdered
cocaine, favored by whites, and its concentrated form, crack, which
is more commonly used in poorer neighborhoods where minorities are
concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher F. Edley Jr., a Harvard law professor and adviser to
Clinton's race initiative, called the board's report ``a
commendable effort.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a relatively short period, they've surveyed an enormous
amount of territory and performed a great service, but it's not the
end,'' Edley said. ``It's only a milestone; the president wants to
continue the effort, both within the admnistration and around the
naton.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how Clinton could overcome damage to his moral authority
in the wake of the Lewinsky scandal and regain the voice he has
used to exhort Americans to deal with the race issue, Edley paused
for a long time and then said:
</P>
<P>
   ``You lay claim to the bully pulpit by climbing into it and
demonstrating your right to stand there. There is no domestic issue
that presents a better opportunity or a greater need for the
president to do just that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
TOWARD RACIAL HARMONY
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The advisory board on President Clinton's race initiative
recommends 10 things that Americans should do to promote racial
reconcilation:
</P>
<P>
   -- Become informed about people from other races and cultures.
</P>
<P>
   -- Commit at least one day each month to thinking about how
issues of racial prejudice and privilege affect each person you
come into contact with that day.
</P>
<P>
   -- Make a conscious effort to get to know people of other races.
</P>
<P>
   -- Make a point to raise concerns about comments or actions that
appear prejudicial, even if you are not the target of such comments
or actions.
</P>
<P>
   -- Initiate a constructive dialogue on race within your
workplace, school, neighborhood, or religious community.
</P>
<P>
   -- Support institutions that promote racial inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   -- Participate in a community project to reduce racial
disparities in opportunity and well-being.
</P>
<P>
   -- Insist that educational institutions reflect the nation's
diversity.
</P>
<P>
   -- Visit other areas of the city, region, or country to
experience other cultures, beyond their food.
</P>
<P>
   -- Urge groups you can influence to reduce racial disparities,
lessen discrimination, and improve race relations.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, estimates derived from doppler radar indicated
that 6 inches of rain fell across parts of Dade County in southern
Florida as heavy showers and thunderstorms erupted. On Thursday,
clusters of tropical showers and storms again doused the state,
with heavy rains fed by tropical moisture drawn northward by a low
pressure system over the Gulf of Mexico. On Friday, the low, which
will have the potential to develop into a tropical depression, will
stay nearly stationary over the Gulf, all the while drawing
tropical moisture over Florida and again setting the stage for
heavy showers and storms. Tropical showers may reach as far north
as the eastern Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy showers and thunderstorms will skirt the central Gulf
Coast as the low over the Gulf also summons tropical moisture
northwestward. New Orleans will lie in the line of fire of these
storms. Meanwhile, the broad circulation around the low in the Gulf
will draw slightly drier air southwestward into Texas from the Ohio
Valley, thereby limiting showers and storms along the Texas coast.
But dry air will likely not reach southeast Texas, paving the way
for storms near the lower Rio Grande Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered showers and storms will develop Friday afternoon and
evening from eastern Montana to northwest Minnesota as a burgeoning
area of low pressure teams with fast jet stream winds over
south-central Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, variable clouds and isolated showers and
thunderstorms will prevail near a stationary front splayed across
the northern Middle Atlantic States.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Hot and Dry
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday marked the 29th consecutive day without measurable
rain at Huntington, W.Va., three days shy of the city's all-time
record dry streak. Not coincidentally, temperatures this week
soared into the 90s, higher than the highest readings of the
summer. With the ground bereft of moisture, little energy from the
sun was spent on evaporation. Instead much of the available energy
from the sun was used to directly heat the ground, which, in turn,
warmed the overlying air. In all likelihood, the bonus energy was
enough to boost temperatures to HuntingtonUs highest levels of
1998.

CHAVEZ OBLIVIOUS TO THE OBVIOUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ What a bleeding cut interrupted two years ago Oscar
De La Hoya is expected to resume tonight at the Thomas &AMP; Mack
Center.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, the WBC welterweight champion, faces Julio Cesar
Chavez in a fight that has generated considerable interest but
appears to be a lousy matchup of a wonderful young fighter and a
fading former champion.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez is a 7{-1 underdog and given almost no chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even going to watch,'' said trainer Emanuel Steward,
who has worked with and is close to both fighters.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya (28-0, with 23 knockouts) won their June 7, 1996,
bout at Caesars Palace. The junior welterweight fight was stopped
with blood dripping from a deep cut above Chavez's left eye.
</P>
<P>
   However, it was Chavez who was the winner in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe the six-time world champion, now 36, was saved from
a terrible beating and remained a viable candidate for a lucrative
rematch as a result. He'll make a guaranteed $6.5 million, which
will help him pay off reported tax debts in Mexico. De La Hoya will
make $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez (101-2-2, 84 KOs) secured the bout with his comments
after the fight: He gave De La Hoya no credit for his effort even
though the champion landed three times as many punches, according
to computer statistics (94-35) and most of those who saw the fight.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, who calls the fight ``personal,'' is determined to
score a knockout this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad thing is that he couldn't just admit the loss. A real,
true champion will admit a loss,'' said De La Hoya, only the latest
to complain about Chavez's propensity for making excuses after
disappointing performances. ``... Now I'm motivated to try to earn
that respect by knocking him out. That's my goal.''
</P>
<P>
   No one will be surprised if Chavez gets cut again, which would
ruin De La Hoya's plan but could again protect Chavez's image.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada State Athletic Commissioner Dr. Barry Markham examined
Chavez and said that his skin is in excellent condition. However,
he has suffered cuts in several of his most recent fights and now
appears prone to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be surprised if he survived the first round without being
cut. It just figures,'' said Gil Clancy, one of De La Hoya's
trainers.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming De La Hoya, 25, wins one way or another, there will be
many more big-money fights, including a long-awaited date with
legitimate contender Ike Quartey on Nov. 21 at Thomas &AMP; Mack.
</P>
<P>
   For Chavez, one of the great fighters of his generation, this
could be his last dance with glory. He remains among the better
fighters in his weight class but hasn't looked like the methodical
mauler of old for many fights.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to explain his performances, he said he lost his
focus because of a divorce from his wife and the tax situation and
lost motivation when De La Hoya didn't give him an immediate
rematch. More likely, age and a long career are taking an
inevitable toll.
</P>
<P>
   These are sensitive subjects with Chavez. When asked about De La
Hoya's criticism of his post-fight comments, he cursed in Spanish
and stormed away. In calmer moments, he says he will surprise the
world tonight. And he explained why.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez trained for two months in the solitude and altitude of
the Rocky Mountains, in Breckenridge, Colo., away from all his
troubles back home. His body seems to be proof that he worked hard:
At Thursday's weigh-in, he was only 144{ pounds _ 2{ under the
weight limit _ and looked as good as he did the night of the first
fight. (De La Hoya weighed 146{.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel !ital!stronger!off! than I did two years ago. I'm going
to break him up with punches this time,'' Chavez said.
</P>
<P>
   If Chavez loses, he says he'll give De La Hoya his respect. If
Chavez wins, he expects the same the from his young rival. The
champion can only smile at the latter notion.
</P>
<P>
   In typical prefight hype, De La Hoya called this a dangerous
fight. In more candid moments, he was compelled to say what he
truly believes: ``I'm prepared to make him look like an amateur in
the ring.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to accept (one's decline),'' De La Hoya said. ``You
don't want to accept it. And that's when it gets dangerous, when a
fighter gets hurt. Julio Cesar Chavez should retire after this
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   No one will be surprised if that comes to pass.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal authorities charged on Thursday that the
bombing of the U.S. embassy in Kenya last month was orchestrated by
an Islamic extremist from the island nation of Comoros who reported
directly to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who is now the focus
of the world-wide inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Broadening the case against bin Laden's organization, the
government offered a $2 million reward for information leading to
the arrest of Haroun Fazil, who has been eluding authorities since
a warrant was issued for his arrest late last month.
</P>
<P>
   Fazil has been accused of 12 counts of murder, one for each
American who died in the Kenyan embassy; murder conspiracy, and the
use of weapons of mass destruction. He could face life imprisonment
or the death penalty if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials also said they had arrested a Texas man whom
they described as the former personal secretary to bin Laden when
both men lived in the Sudan in 1994. The defendant, Wadih el Hage,
of Fort Worth, is the first American citizen known to have been
charged in the investigation of bin Laden and the embassy attacks.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage appeared before a federal magistrate judge in Manhattan
late on Thursday and was charged with three counts of making false
statements to investigators. A federal prosecutor, Patrick
Fitzgerald, told the magistrate that the government would indict el
Hage on new charges by Monday, and he was ordered held without
bond. His lawyer, Bruce McIntyre, had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   The charges disclosed on Thursday by Mary Jo White, the U.S.
attorney in Manhattan, and Lewis Schiliro, assistant director of
the FBI in New York, show now more clearly how investigators are
methodically building the case against bin Laden, his operatives
and lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden was charged in a sealed indictment earlier this year
that accused him of various acts of terrorism. The government has
not said when or whether it plans an indictment in the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White said that Fazil was ``a very active member of the
Kenyan cell'' of bin Laden's terrorist group. ``He's an allegedly
major player in the organization,'' Ms. White said.
</P>
<P>
   Schiliro said that the new charges ``will get us closer to a
resolution of this case, but it is by no means ended.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcements on Thursday also shed light on the
investigation of bin Laden that dates back to before the nearly
simultaneous attacks in Kenya and Tanzania. In those attacks, on
Aug. 7, more than 250 people died, 12 of them Americans, and
thousands of people were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   A federal complaint unsealed on Thursday shows that el Hage was
interviewed by the authorities in New York as early as September
1997, and questioned about bin Laden's activities and his
associates.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the complaint says, el Hage admitted to having
worked as bin Laden's personal secretary, and also to knowing two
of his top military commanders, identified as Abu Ubaidah al
Banshiri and Abu Hafs el Masry.
</P>
<P>
   Al Banshiri drowned in a ferry accident in East Africa in 1996,
the court papers said, but they offered few other details about
either men.
</P>
<P>
   Schiliro would not say where the authorities believe Fazil has
fled, or how he may have left the Comoros islands, which are in the
Indian Ocean southeast of Tanzania and Kenya. Earlier this month,
the FBI and the Comoros police raided two homes on the island of
Moroni, looking for Fazil, and also questioned his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities described Fazil as an explosives expert in his
mid-20s who speaks fluent French, Swahili, Arabic, and English, and
is adept with computers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the federal complaint did not describe precisely
Fazil's rank in Bin Laden's organization, it suggested that his
role in the Nairobi attack was more significant than any of the
three other defendants who have been arrested and are being held in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The federal complaint said that Fazil's duties in al Qaeda
included the preparation of various reports for bin Laden and his
top lieutenants. In the Kenyan bombing, Fazil was accused of
renting the room in the Hilltop Hotel in Nairobi where
investigators believe that the bomb was constructed, and of hiring
two people to clean the room after the attack.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 7, the day of the attack, the government said, Fazil
drove a white pick-up truck which led another vehicle, which was
carrying the bomb, to the embassy site in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors did not directly accuse el Hage of a role in the
embassy bombings. But the documents say that Fazil and el Hage, the
Texan, were close, and that the two shared a house last year in
Nairobi. El Hage moved to Kenya from the Sudan in 1994, the
government said, before returning to the United States in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage did not speak in court on Thursday, but his supervisor
at the Fort Worth, company where he works, Lone Star Wheels and
Tires, said that el Hage told him on Monday that he had to take
care of personal business in New York, and would return in two
days.
</P>
<P>
   He left that afternoon on a 4:30 plane and the supervisor,
Mahmoud Mazouni, said that el Hage did not appear nervous or
troubled.

COWBOYS CONFIDENT DAVIS DISPLAY A FLUKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ They have reviewed film of how Terrell Davis
danced all over their defense. They have gone over their botched
on-field assignments with their coaches. They have studied their
playbooks with the same intensity that many of us have studied the
Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   And pointing to a schedule that features few remaining offensive
powerhouses, and a track record that has seen their defense rank no
worse than 10th in each of the past six seasons, Cowboys players
and coaches are confident that last week's meltdown in Denver will
not be an every-week occurrence. That confidence exists even though
Davis' 191-yard effort was the 10th time in the past 11
regular-season games that the Cowboys have yielded more than 100
yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys (1-1) have nearly completed their defensive
preparations for the New York Giants (1-1) on Monday Night
Football. They have assured themselves that Giants running back
Tikki Barber, who has 69 yards rushing this year, does not pose the
same threat as Davis, who had 138 yards rushing in the first
quarter against the Cowboys last week.
</P>
<P>
   They intend to stick with their base 4-3 defense, eschewing the
multiple-set strategy that doomed them against the Broncos.
Linebacker Randall Godfrey said the Cowboys used four different
sets in the first quarter and at times were caught in their nickel
defense when the Broncos ran the ball and in their run defense when
the Broncos passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't plan on doing anything terribly different against the
Giants than we did against the Broncos,'' middle linebacker Fred
Strickland said. ``We overpursued some, lost some containment, and
then Terrell Davis just made some great runs. They spread us out
some. And we became more worried about the pass than the run. But
we've been able to correct things in practice. And now it's just
time to convert that to the next game.''
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jerry Jones never expected to have his rushing defense
ripped apart like wet toilet paper. In fact, Jones hired Chan
Gailey to fix the club's offensive problems. In turn, Gailey has
been so confident in his defensive staff that he basically allows
Dave Campo, the defensive coordinator since 1995, to run the
defense while he pays more attention to what the offense is doing.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey acknowledged that he was upset with the coaching and the
playing last week, but added that he was part of the problem. He
said he spent no more time with the defense this week than any
other week, and that his game-day duties will continue to include
an emphasis on the offense _ and the progress of quarterback Jason
Garrett.
</P>
<P>
   The defense, Gailey said, does not need him any more than it
ever has.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a great deal of confidence in our defense and our
staff,'' Gailey said. ``If you look back at the history of the
Cowboys' defense _ they were No. 2 in the league last year. The
defense played really well with this staff and this nucleus of
players for quite a few years. That's the confidence I have. That's
why I can say that last week was not the norm and that we will come
back and play well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, if (last week) was to happen three, four, or five times,
then you got a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   If you apply Gailey's logic to just this season, it would appear
that the Denver game was just a bump in the Cowboys' road back to
respectability. In Week 1, the Cowboys held the Arizona Cardinals
to 45 yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   But questionable drafts, injury, and retirements have left the
Cowboys with no dependable pass rushers, and just one Pro Bowler
among its front seven, defensive tackle Leon Lett, who has but two
tackles and has been playing on a sore knee. Defensive end Kavika
Pittman (four tackles), Strickland (four tackles) and defensive
tackle Chad Hennings (three tackles) all have struggled this
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' defensive staff fully expects other teams to
attempt to copy the success that the Broncos had, which included
spreading the field to let Davis pick holes in the Cowboys'
defense, or letting quarterback John Elway find pass catching tight
ends open in the slot.
</P>
<P>
   But of the Cowboys remaining opponents, only the Warren
Moon-Ricky Watters-Joey Galloway-led Seattle Seahawks (Nov. 22) and
the Brad Johnson-Robert Smith-Cris Carter-Randy Moss-led Minnesota
Vikings (Nov. 26) have the same kind of offensive firepower as the
Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around a long time and things like (the Broncos
game) just don't happen all the time _ and thank goodness,''
defensive line coach Jim Bates said. ``We're going to do our best
to make sure it doesn't happen again.''

PANEL DEFERS RELEASE OF VIDEOTAPE  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With several Democrats waging a political trench
fight, the House Judiciary Committee abruptly postponed plans
Thursday to release the videotape and much of the sealed, sexually
explicit evidence in President Clinton's potential impeachment
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   But the delay was expected to defer additional public
humiliation for Clinton and the former White House intern, Monica
S. Lewinsky, for little more than a day or so.
</P>
<P>
   The panel cut off the intensely partisan talks Thursday night
after wrangling for nearly eight hours behind closed doors over
scores of proposed redactions in 2,700 pages of material, including
Lewinsky's grand jury testimony. The infighting grew so protracted
that the panel had yet to begin debating one of the most
potentially explosive pieces of evidence, a videotape of Clinton's
grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fighting page by page, item by item,'' said
Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Lowell Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is scheduled to resume talks Friday. But the
prolonged negotiations, which often focused on testimony so
salacious that several lawmakers later expressed discomfort at the
exercise, forced Republican leaders to drop plans to release the
material Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If the panel reaches a final agreement Friday, the material
could be released as early as tomorrow or as late as next Tuesday
or Wednesday because of weekend staff shortages and a Jewish
holiday on Monday, according to committee aides.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Republican-controlled committee, trying to play
down the panel's partisan infighting as they conduct the historic
inquiry, warned members that they face possible disciplinary action
if they publicly discuss specifics of the private meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a productive debate,'' said Representative Henry J. Hyde,
an Illinois Republican who is chairman of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a frivolous debate,'' Hyde said as he hurried out a
back door after the meeting, avoiding dozens of journalists. ``It
got passionate at times, but we are accomplishing a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The showdown unfolded amid fallout from a report on Wednesday
that Hyde engaged in an adulterous affair 30 years ago. Hyde issued
a statement attributing the relationship to a ``youthful
indiscretion.''
</P>
<P>
   But amid a swirl of charges and countercharges over the report,
committee members of both parties expessed confidence in Hyde's
ability to continue leading the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The committee, which is expected to recommend to the full House
by early October whether to impeach Clinton, tangled repeatedly as
some Democrats vigorously opposed releasing portions of grand jury
testimony, asserting it could unnecessarily harm innocent
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats echoed concerns raised by Lewinksy's lawyers,
who had asked the panel to black out many sections of her testimony
that could offend people, including Lewinsky's scathing criticism
of Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``A wide range of people could be hurt,'' Meehan said, ``from
people whose names nobody knows to people who hold prestigious
positions in government and the private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   The material under debate includes a lengthy appendix to the
445-page report that the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr,
delivered last week to the committee. The appendix includes court
orders, discussions of legal issues, a diagram of the Oval Office,
and other reference material, including information about the
former sexual harassment lawsuit that Paula Corbin Jones filed
against Clinton.

MARKET PLACE: THE MAN WHO MOVES, AND SCARES, MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Alan Greenspan talks, the market listens. And
most of the time it doesn't like what it hears.
</P>
<P>
   During the last two years, on 31 occasions, the Federal Reserve
chairman has testified before Congress on a variety of matters. On
21 of those dates, almost 70 percent of the time, the market fell
immediately after his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Make that 22. Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped
by 216.01 points, a loss of 2.67 percent. It was the first full day
of trading after Greenspan's testimony Wednesday, in which he told
the House Banking Committee that there was no coordinated effort
among the world's central banks to cut interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were clearly disappointed that Greenspan presented no
solutions to the economic problems that have terrified many of the
world's markets. ``I was disturbed that the comments Mr. Greenspan
made about the changes that need to be made were all in the future
tense,'' said M. Cary Leahey, chief U.S. economist at High
Frequency Economics Ltd. in Valhalla, N.Y. ``He gave the impression
that he was no closer to solutions than he was in December.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's comments were just the latest in a long line of
disappointing utterances, at least where investors are concerned.
That the stock market falls fairly consistently when the Fed
chairman speaks is an indication that stock buyers think he's the
market's version of a wet blanket.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, investors have come to love Greenspan for his
ability to keep the economy on course. Until this summer, negative
reactions to his comments were temporary, usually lasting less than
a week. But his testimony before Congress on July 21 came only two
trading days after the broad stock market averages reached their
peaks. Since then, it's been rough sledding for shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking what happens to stocks after the Fed chairman's
testimony _ what might be called the Greenspan effect _ comes
courtesy of Tom McClellan, of The McClellan Market Report, a
technical analysis investment advisory service based in Lakewood,
Wash. McClellan went back to 1996 for his research and included
only those occasions when Greenspan addressed Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to be his personality that he has been able to talk
down the market with words rather than actions,'' McClellan said.
``But it is funny how the market and investors hear what they want
to hear in the words that cross his lips.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's speech at the University of California at Berkeley
two weeks ago, which ignited the market Sept. 8, is a prime example
of investors' hearing in the Fed chairman's comments exactly what
they want to hear. Even though the speech gave only the hint that a
rate cut might be forthcoming, the market rallied by 380 points.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, though, Greenspan drives the market down with
his talks. For example, on July 18, 1996, he appeared at his
twice-yearly question-and-answer session with congressional
committees _ known as the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, after a 1970s
law the requires the Fed chairman to make such congressional
appearances. He reminded the lawmakers that even if the nation was
indeed in a new economic era, as many were arguing, inflation could
still threaten economic stability and growth. For the next three
days, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 21, 1997, Greenspan addressed the Senate Budget
Committee. The only fretting he did in this talk was to worry about
a possible pickup in wage costs. The Dow lost 3.3 percent of its
value in the next five trading days.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the chairman has been especially talkative. He has
testified before Congress 15 times to date; in all of 1997, he
spoke on 14 occasions.
</P>
<P>
   So far in 1998, on nine occasions investors have reacted
negatively to Greenspan's testimony; on three occasions, they liked
what they heard. Twice, the market had no reaction at all.
</P>
<P>
   McClellan has limited his research to congressional testimony.
``When I looked at the dates of his speeches that were not
testimony,'' he said, ``there wasn't as good a correlation for what
the market did afterward. Routine speeches to the Rotary Club or
the University of California don't have the same effect on the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   The Greenspan effect could, of course, be a calculated one.
``He's been trying to let air gently out of the balloon for nearly
two years now,'' Leahey said, referring to inflated stock prices.
``The market has listened to him for a day and then has forgotten
what he said two days later.''

RABBI'S ARREST IN WIFE'S KILLING IS A TRIAL FOR THE FAITHFUL
</HEADLINE>
   (bl) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHERRY HILL, N.J. _ Nearly four years have passed since Rabbi
Fred Neulander returned from temple one autumn evening to find his
wife bludgeoned to death in their Colonial home here. Yet the more
time that passes, the more Neulander seems to embody a wrenching
test of faith for the 900 families who worship at the Congregation
M'Kor Shalom, the synagogue he founded more than 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   His family had barely finished sitting shiva for his wife, Carol
Neulander, when the whispers began about the couple's marital
problems. Then, an unusually talkative prosecutor publicly branded
Neulander as a possible suspect. The homicide investigation soon
revealed that Rabbi Neulander was involved in an affair with a
Philadelphia radio personality, forcing him to resign from the
temple and relinquish his status as one of southern New Jersey's
most prominent clerics.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the years of open speculation and a torrent of news
leaks, nothing prepared many Cherry Hill residents for the events
of the last week, when Neulander was arrested on charges that he
hired a hit man to kill his wife. He was led in front of television
and newspaper photographers wearing handcuffs and an orange prison
jumpsuit.
</P>
<P>
   To those who accept Neulander's apologies for his adultery, and
his steadfast denial of any involvement in the killing, the arrest
and impending trial are expected to pose strong challenges to their
faith in the rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   ``My faith in him as a person and my faith in his innocence
remain,'' said David Diamondstein, one of a handful of congregants
who still attend the wedding services and bar mitzvahs that
Neulander is asked to perform. ``But if evidence arises to change
that, I will be very disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   But the many congregants who believe that Neulander orchestrated
his wife's killing on Nov. 1, 1994, have been grappling with even
more profound questions, which cut to the core of their faith. How
does a believer reconcile the sins of a spiritual leader with the
message of peace he has so eloquently espoused?
</P>
<P>
   ``To us, he was God's voice, right here,'' said one member of
M'Kor Shalom, who insisted on anonymity. ``How could he deceive us
for all those years when he was disobeying God's law? How could he
let down so many people who looked to him for guidance? How can we
believe in anything he said all those years?''
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of any religious leader is startling, but Rabbi
Neulander's fall from grace is especially remarkable because of his
stature before the killing. He and his wife founded the temple in
an old warehouse in Mount Laurel in 1974 and, through his charisma,
expanded the congregation to become the largest Reform temple in
southern New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   M'Kor Shalom, which means ``A Source of Peace,'' was part of the
Reconstructionist movement, which sought to preserve traditional
Jewish rituals but adapt them to modern life and contemporary
social causes. It was one of the first temples in the area to grant
equal status to women, said Cherry Hill Mayor Susan Bass Levin, a
former congregant. Under Neulander's direction, its social action
committee financed a wide range of community projects, including
programs for the homeless and an AIDS ministry.
</P>
<P>
   M'Kor Shalom eventually joined the more mainstream Reform
movement, and before his departure, the rabbi gave personal
attention to the synagogue's Hebrew school. But he never abandoned
his flair for showmanship. He once commemorated the Exodus by
directing the schoolchildren onto the temple grounds, where they
were left to wander aimlessly, like their ancestors who were exiled
in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   During his sermons, he frequently prowled the aisles, posing
moral questions like a TV talk show host.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was incredibly respected,'' said the Rev. William Levering,
a minister at the First Presbyterian Church in nearby Haddonfield.
``Both a mover and shaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind that winning public image, however, Neulander, 57, also
led a tangled secret life. He has admitted to adultery with two
women in his congregation, including Elaine Soncini, a radio host
who had gone to him in 1992 seeking solace after her husband's
death. As their affair progressed, Ms. Soncini began pressuring
Neulander to end his marriage, according to her statements to
police, and threatened to break off their relationship if he did
not leave his wife by Christmas 1994.
</P>
<P>
   According to law enforcement officials familiar with Ms.
Soncini's testimony before a grand jury, she said that several
months before Carol Neulander was killed, the rabbi told her,
``Trust me, something will happen by the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that Ms. Soncini also testified that after
Mrs. Neulander's death, the rabbi told her, ``See, I told you to
trust me.''
</P>
<P>
   Camden County Prosecutor Lee Solomon has argued in court that
Neulander hired a hit man to kill his wife because he feared a
divorce would reveal his adultery and cost him his position as head
rabbi. The authorities have been unable to locate the killer or the
blunt object they said was used to kill Mrs. Neulander, but they
plan to call at least two other witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Neulander, one of the couple's three children, was
talking on the telephone with Mrs. Neulander a few minutes before
she was killed. Ms. Neulander has testified that her mother told
her that there was a deliveryman at the door, and that he had been
sent by her father.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Neulander's former racquetball partner, Myron Levin, has
also told the authorities that the rabbi had talked openly about
ending his marriage. Several weeks before the killing, Levin
testified before the grand jury, the rabbi slammed his racquet to
the ground during a game and exclaimed, ``I wish I would come home
one day and find my wife dead on the floor,'' according to law
enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   Levin testified that Neulander then asked if he could help him
arrange her death.
</P>
<P>
   But Neulander's lawyers said the statements by Rebecca Neulander
and Ms. Soncini are hardly evidence of a murder plot and may not be
admissible in court. A defense lawyer, Jeffrey Zucker, also
ridiculed Levin, 72, as a ``feeble old man with a vivid
imagination'' and said he was not credible because he had a lengthy
criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``This case has no murder weapon and no murderer,'' said Dennis
Wixted, another lawyer for the rabbi. ``And so far, there's no
provable motive except the supposition that if you're having an
affair you are responsible for your spouse's death.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most striking things about the case, investigators
say, was the condition of Neulander's clothing the day of the
killing. The living room in which the rabbi found his wife slain
was spattered with blood. But when an ambulance responded to the
rabbi's emergency call, there wasn't a speck of blood on his hands,
face or clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't check for a pulse, didn't hold her, didn't kneel on
the floor, didn't get anywhere near her,'' said one investigator.
``Is that how you would react if you had nothing to do with it?''
</P>
<P>
   Wixted said he did not know what was on Neulander's clothes that
day because the prosecutor's office had not yet turned over
discovery material.
</P>
<P>
   With the trial looming, nearly everyone in the community is
bracing for a new round of media coverage, salacious details and
soul-searching, Mayor Bass Levin said. And nowhere is there more
anxious anticipation than at M'Kor Shalom.
</P>
<P>
   A few members quit M'Kor Shalom after Neulander was ousted in
1995 and never joined another synagogue, said a religious leader
who insisted on anonymity. Dozens of families quit and joined one
of Cherry Hill's five other temples.
</P>
<P>
   But most congregants have stayed, and the temple's leaders have
handled the crisis by saying that Neulander's infidelities were
wrong. Today M'Kor Shalom has more members than it did when Mrs.
Neulander was killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have new leadership now and we're in a new place,'' said
Linda Angstreich, a director and former board president. ``This
temple has come a long way in four years and we're doing
terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Angstreich said that she and other board members had
avoided discussions of the slaying case because ``it's not an issue
that we should comment on.''
</P>
<P>
   For individuals and family members, however, the court
proceedings are certain to rekindle questions over the character of
a man they used to rely on for moral guidance.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Karl is taking a more detached view. Karl said Neulander
performed his son's bar mitzvah a few months before the killing,
and when the accusations later arose at the dinner table, he urged
his children to remember the distinction between the frailties of
human beings and the power of God.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's odd,'' said Karl, a Cherry Hill judge. ``Our discussions
about him are a lot like the discussions we're having now about
President Clinton. You question these things because he's a role
model and he's supposed to behave in a certain way. But I tell my
kids, people are people. The reality is, you have to teach them not
to be in awe of anyone.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal authorities charged on Thursday that the
bombing of the U.S. embassy in Kenya last month was orchestrated by
an Islamic extremist from the island nation of Comoros who reported
directly to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who is now the focus
of the world-wide inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Broadening the case against bin Laden's organization, the
government offered a $2 million reward for information leading to
the arrest of Haroun Fazil, who has been eluding authorities since
a warrant was issued for his arrest late last month.
</P>
<P>
   Fazil has been accused of 12 counts of murder, one for each
American who died in the Kenyan embassy; murder conspiracy, and the
use of weapons of mass destruction. He could face life imprisonment
or the death penalty if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials also said they had arrested a man whom they
described as the former personal secretary to bin Laden when both
men lived in the Sudan in 1994. The defendant, Wadih el Hage, of
Arlington, Texas, is the first American citizen known to have been
charged in the investigation of bin Laden and the embassy attacks.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage appeared before a federal magistrate judge in Manhattan
late on Thursday and was charged with three counts of making false
statements to investigators. A federal prosecutor, Patrick
Fitzgerald, told the magistrate that the government would indict el
Hage on new charges by Monday, and he was ordered held without
bond. His lawyer, Bruce McIntyre, had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   The charges disclosed on Thursday by Mary Jo White, the U.S.
attorney in Manhattan, and Lewis Schiliro, assistant director of
the FBI in New York, show now more clearly how investigators are
methodically building the case against bin Laden, his operatives
and lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden was charged in a sealed indictment earlier this year
that accused him of various acts of terrorism. The government has
not said when or whether it plans an indictment in the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White said that Fazil was ``a very active member of the
Kenyan cell'' of bin Laden's terrorist group. ``He's an allegedly
major player in the organization,'' Ms. White said.
</P>
<P>
   Schiliro said that the new charges ``will get us closer to a
resolution of this case, but it is by no means ended.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcements on Thursday also shed light on the
investigation of bin Laden that dates back to before the nearly
simultaneous attacks in Kenya and Tanzania. In those attacks, on
Aug. 7, more than 250 people died, 12 of them Americans, and
thousands of people were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   A federal complaint unsealed on Thursday shows that el Hage was
interviewed by the authorities in New York as early as September
1997, and questioned about bin Laden's activities and his
associates.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the complaint says, el Hage admitted to having
worked as bin Laden's personal secretary, and also to knowing two
of his top military commanders, identified as Abu Ubaidah al
Banshiri and Abu Hafs el Masry.
</P>
<P>
   Al Banshiri drowned in a ferry accident in East Africa in 1996,
the court papers said, but they offered few other details about
either men.
</P>
<P>
   Schiliro would not say where the authorities believe Fazil has
fled, or how he may have left the Comoros islands, which are in the
Indian Ocean southeast of Tanzania and Kenya. Earlier this month,
the FBI and the Comoros police raided two homes on the island of
Moroni, looking for Fazil, and also questioned his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities described Fazil as an explosives expert in his
mid-20s who speaks fluent French, Swahili, Arabic, and English, and
is adept with computers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the federal complaint did not describe precisely
Fazil's rank in Bin Laden's organization, it suggested that his
role in the Nairobi attack was more significant than any of the
three other defendants who have been arrested and are being held in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The federal complaint said that Fazil's duties in al Qaeda
included the preparation of various reports for bin Laden and his
top lieutenants. In the Kenyan bombing, Fazil was accused of
renting the room in the Hilltop Hotel in Nairobi where
investigators believe that the bomb was constructed, and of hiring
two people to clean the room after the attack.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 7, the day of the attack, the government said, Fazil
drove a white pick-up truck which led another vehicle, which was
carrying the bomb, to the embassy site in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors did not directly accuse el Hage of a role in the
embassy bombings. But the documents say that Fazil and el Hage, the
Texan, were close, and that the two shared a house last year in
Nairobi. El Hage moved to Kenya from the Sudan in 1994, the
government said, before returning to the United States in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage did not speak in court on Thursday, but his supervisor
at the Fort Worth, company where he works, Lone Star Wheels and
Tires, said that el Hage told him on Monday that he had to take
care of personal business in New York, and would return in two
days.
</P>
<P>
   He left that afternoon on a 4:30 plane and the supervisor,
Mahmoud Mazouni, said that el Hage did not appear nervous or
troubled.

 &HT;      BOEHNER WANTS FBI TO PROBE SMEAR CAMPAIGN;

<P>
   WASHINGTON, Sept. 17 -- The White House's alleged ``Scorched
Earth'' campaign against detractors of President Clinton is adding
fuel to the fire of House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John A. Boehner, R-West Chester, and seven other House
Republican leaders have requested FBI Director Louis Freeh
investigate a ``systematic attempt (by Clinton allies) to
intimidate ... elected members of the House from doing their
constitutional duty by promoting prurient allegations about their
personal lives to the media.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans made their request in a letter to Freeh
Thursday, after reports surfaced of a 25-year-old adulterous affair
involving House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill -- which Hyde
admitted. Hyde would preside over impeachment hearings if they are
held.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that this tactic has been employed by the White House
to attack opponents of the president during this entire
investigation,'' Boehner said.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Clinton critics -- Reps. Helen Chenoweth, R-Idaho, and
Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind. -- have recently had their past infidelity
reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sick,'' Boehner said of any effort to blackmail Clinton
enemies. Because the House of Representatives would hold hearings
and vote on whether the Senate should hold an impeachment trial,
Boehner added that ``outing'' congressmen would be comparable to
trying to intimidate potential jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials heartily denied the
Republicans' allegations. In a letter to Hyde, White House Chief of
Staff Erskine Bowles promised to fire any staffers involved in
spreading gossip about lawmakers' private lives. White House Press
Secretary Mike McCurry also said any employee involved ``would no
longer be on staff.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a friend of the husband of Hyde's old mistress
claimed full credit for publicizing the story of that affair.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans are not convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly there is credible evidence that an organized campaign
of slander and intimidation may exist. If it does, any individuals
promoting such a campaign may be in violation of federal criminal
law,'' they wrote in the letter to Freeh.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans attached 11 examples of evidence from television and
newspaper reports pointing to a ``White House Smear Campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This goes to the core of the Constitution -- the separation of
powers. The executive branch is employing these tactics against the
legislative branch'' Boehner said. ``If this is coming from the
White House, I would recommend it be included in the impeachment
report.''

 By JOYCE WADLER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The mother of Charles Lindbergh, his biographers have
noted, was one of those omnipresent moms: Separated from
Lindbergh's father when Lindbergh was 2, she accompanied her son to
college, and hovered so close to him that at 25 the man who would
be the world's most famous aviator had never had a date.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, it seems reasonable to pose a question to Reeve Lindbergh,
the flier's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible Charles Lindbergh took to the air because it was
the only way he could get away from mom?
</P>
<P>
   A delighted howl from Ms. Lindbergh, in town from Vermont, in
comfortable clogs, a long, flowered skirt and a pink cotton
sweater, who, if her father was cool, mother reserved, reflects
neither of either.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think that, too?'' she says. ``That's always been my
theory. Single-engine plane, one seat. By golly, that would be the
way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   She assumes the role of the Lone Eagle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got to cross the Atlantic, Mom. Can't take you. It's a
one-seater. Monoplane. MONO _ get it, Mom? _ one.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two new books on Lindbergh, who became one of the
century's greatest heroes when he flew the Atlantic solo in 1927:
</P>
<P>
   A. Scott Berg's ``Lindbergh'' (Putnam), an 800-page biography
done with the Lindbergh family's cooperation, portrays Lindbergh as
an emotionally remote man who insisted that his wife cry in private
after the death of their first son and who ignored his wife for
much of their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is ``Under a Wing'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster), by Reeve
Lindbergh, 53, a novelist and children's book writer who is the
youngest of Lindbergh's six children. Ms. Lindbergh recalls a
father who made lists of his children's failings, but who was
playful and affectionate, too.
</P>
<P>
   It also depicts Ms. Lindbergh's attempts to deal with her
father's anti-Semitic remarks after his death _ of hearing him on
tape in a 1941 speech in Des Moines, saying that one of the
``greatest dangers'' to the United States is the influence of Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was transfixed and horrified, ablaze with shame and fury,''
she writes. `` `Not you!' I cried out silently to myself and to him
_ `No! You never said such things.'''
</P>
<P>
   Is it coincidence that the two books are out at the same time?
</P>
<P>
   Yes and no.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lindbergh's publisher made the decision to release her book
at the same time as Berg's. But her memoir was prompted not by
concern about the biography, but by the death of her sister, Anne,
five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a way to keep her voice alive,'' Ms. Lindbergh says.
``And in writing about her, I ended up writing about all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lindbergh likes Berg and, while she finds his portrait of
her father ``a little skewed,'' she likes his book. She sent Berg
chapters of her own book for comment as she was writing. She cannot
get too shook up about Berg's suggestion that her mother, the
writer Anne Morrow Lindbergh, had an affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think love is wonderful,'' says Ms. Lindbergh, who married
her second husband the day she divorced her first and has had an
unconventional domestic life herself. ``I graduated college in '68.
What can I say?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Lindbergh admits, there was a desire to protect her
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I write about the whole Des Moines thing twice, because the
first time I mentioned it, I didn't deal with it,'' Ms. Lindbergh
says. ``My editor pointed that out. The rage and the tears.
Originally, it wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   And why, as the analysts say, do we think that is?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lindbergh laughs again.
</P>
<P>
   A famous name, Ms. Lindbergh says, is like ``another member of
the family, like your eccentric uncle.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lindbergh describes the uncle: ``Moody, sometimes horrific,
a real pain in the neck. He intrudes where he's not supposed to be,
he makes inappropriate jokes, but sometimes he comes home loaded
with presents. Every so often you wish someone would take him away
and lock him up. Uncle Lindy.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Lindbergh was a girl, if her father was recognized in a
restaurant, the family had to leave. At Radcliffe, friends told Ms.
Lindbergh that they were surprised they liked her, considering her
father was a fascist.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Ms. Lindbergh realized, it is inevitable that family
history becomes your own. Ms. Lindbergh has two grown daughters and
an 11-year- old son. Fourteen years ago she lost her first son,
Jonathan, to complications from encephalitis. Jonathan was 2, the
same age Ms. Lindbergh's brother had been when he was kidnapped and
killed. Ms. Lindbergh's mother insisted that her daughter sit with
her child's body.
</P>
<P>
   I never saw my son's body after he died,'' Anne Lindbergh said.
</P>
<P>
   Reeve Lindbergh talks again about fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Johnny died, we ordered this very simple little stone
that said, `Jonathan Lindbergh Brown, with love and light,''' Ms.
Lindbergh says.
</P>
<P>
   She averts her face, looking down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a very light, a kind of illuminating personality. Very
humorous. When the gravestone came back, the word Lindbergh was in
bigger letters than the others. I was so angry I made them take it
back and redo it. I never do things like that, never send food back
or make a fuss, but the idea that this little child should be
remembered as a Lindbergh rather than as himself.''
</P>
<P>
   She resents the fame?
</P>
<P>
   ``At times of loss I want things to be humane and real. Not be
inflated by me or anyone else.''

 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal authorities charged on Thursday that the
bombing of the U.S. embassy in Kenya last month was orchestrated by
an Islamic extremist from the island nation of Comoros who reported
directly to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who is now the focus
of the world-wide inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Broadening the case against bin Laden's organization, the
government offered a $2 million reward for information leading to
the arrest of Haroun Fazil, who has been eluding authorities since
a warrant was issued for his arrest late last month.
</P>
<P>
   Fazil has been accused of 12 counts of murder, one for each
American who died in the Kenyan embassy; murder conspiracy, and the
use of weapons of mass destruction. He could face life imprisonment
or the death penalty if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials also said they had arrested a man whom they
described as the former personal secretary to bin Laden when both
men lived in the Sudan in 1994. The defendant, Wadih el Hage, of
Arlington, Texas, is the first American citizen known to have been
charged in the investigation of bin Laden and the embassy attacks.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage appeared before a federal magistrate judge in Manhattan
late on Thursday and was charged with three counts of making false
statements to investigators. A federal prosecutor, Patrick
Fitzgerald, told the magistrate that the government would indict el
Hage on new charges by Monday, and he was ordered held without
bond. His lawyer, Bruce McIntyre, had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   The charges disclosed on Thursday by Mary Jo White, the U.S.
attorney in Manhattan, and Lewis Schiliro, assistant director of
the FBI in New York, show now more clearly how investigators are
methodically building the case against bin Laden, his operatives
and lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden was charged in a sealed indictment earlier this year
that accused him of various acts of terrorism. The government has
not said when or whether it plans an indictment in the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White said that Fazil was ``a very active member of the
Kenyan cell'' of bin Laden's terrorist group. ``He's an allegedly
major player in the organization,'' Ms. White said.
</P>
<P>
   Schiliro said that the new charges ``will get us closer to a
resolution of this case, but it is by no means ended.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcements on Thursday also shed light on the
investigation of bin Laden that dates back to before the nearly
simultaneous attacks in Kenya and Tanzania. In those attacks, on
Aug. 7, more than 250 people died, 12 of them Americans, and
thousands of people were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   A federal complaint unsealed on Thursday shows that el Hage was
interviewed by the authorities in New York as early as September
1997, and questioned about bin Laden's activities and his
associates.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the complaint says, el Hage admitted to having
worked as bin Laden's personal secretary, and also to knowing two
of his top military commanders, identified as Abu Ubaidah al
Banshiri and Abu Hafs el Masry.
</P>
<P>
   Al Banshiri drowned in a ferry accident in East Africa in 1996,
the court papers said, but they offered few other details about
either men.
</P>
<P>
   Schiliro would not say where the authorities believe Fazil has
fled, or how he may have left the Comoros islands, which are in the
Indian Ocean southeast of Tanzania and Kenya. Earlier this month,
the FBI and the Comoros police raided two homes on the island of
Moroni, looking for Fazil, and also questioned his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities described Fazil as an explosives expert in his
mid-20s who speaks fluent French, Swahili, Arabic, and English, and
is adept with computers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the federal complaint did not describe precisely
Fazil's rank in Bin Laden's organization, it suggested that his
role in the Nairobi attack was more significant than any of the
three other defendants who have been arrested and are being held in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The federal complaint said that Fazil's duties in al Qaeda
included the preparation of various reports for bin Laden and his
top lieutenants. In the Kenyan bombing, Fazil was accused of
renting the room in the Hilltop Hotel in Nairobi where
investigators believe that the bomb was constructed, and of hiring
two people to clean the room after the attack.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 7, the day of the attack, the government said, Fazil
drove a white pick-up truck which led another vehicle, which was
carrying the bomb, to the embassy site in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors did not directly accuse el Hage of a role in the
embassy bombings. But the documents say that Fazil and el Hage, the
Texan, were close, and that the two shared a house last year in
Nairobi. El Hage moved to Kenya from the Sudan in 1994, the
government said, before returning to the United States in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage did not speak in court on Thursday, but his supervisor
at the Fort Worth, company where he works, Lone Star Wheels and
Tires, said that el Hage told him on Monday that he had to take
care of personal business in New York, and would return in two
days.
</P>
<P>
   He left that afternoon on a 4:30 plane and the supervisor,
Mahmoud Mazouni, said that el Hage did not appear nervous or
troubled.

BARBARA BOXER FACES CLINTON LIABILITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Resending, clarifying Clinton's brother-in-law Anthony (not Hugh)
is married to Boxer's daughter.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This US Senate race would have been tight even if
the incumbent wasn't related to Bill Clinton by marriage, even if
she hadn't led the charge against powerful Republicans accused of
sexual misconduct then sidestepped discussion of the president's
behavior for more than seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Now Senator Barbara Boxer finds herself neck-and-neck with her
little-known challenger, Republican state Treasurer Matt Fong.
Although many California voters insist they don't care about her
Clinton connection, either through party affiliation or family,
political observers say the association has to hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere she goes, Boxer is asked about Clinton, whose
brother-in-law, Anthony, is married to her daughter. She attacks
Fong's opposition to raising the minimum wage, and the buzz is
about her position on impeachment proceedings. Discussion of
Clinton's behavior dominated the first quarter of a recent
candidates' debate.
</P>
<P>
   Getting her message out may only get more difficult in the days
ahead. Desperate for fund-raising dollars, Boxer intends to invite
the Clintons to campaign with her this fall. Presidential problems
aside, she says he is still good for California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton isn't governing how voters view Boxer, but the first
question she gets is always, `What do you think of the Clinton
controversy?' and `Why haven't you been a big critic of his?'''
said Mark DiCamillo, director of the San Francisco-based Field
Poll, which recently showed Boxer and Fong tied at 45 percent
percent of the vote with 10 percent of the electorate undecided.
``But she already had an extremely partisan image... I think she
has a real problem this time around.''
</P>
<P>
   Swept into office by a slim margin during 1992's ``Year of the
Woman,'' the liberal, Bay Area Democrat has long been considered
vulnerable in socially moderate, fiscally more conservative
California. Now, as she told political reporters in Washington last
week, she is in ``the race of my life'' with Fong, who captured
enough of the conservative base to win the June primary but is
generally considered more of a Jack Kemp-style moderate Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt Fong is as close as he is because Barbara Boxer is a very
polarizing figure in California,'' said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a
political scientist at Claremont Graduate University. ``She is not
very popular, and I don't know how she moves those undecided
voters, especially with the static of Bill Clinton and his
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Compounding Boxer's own problems, Democratic voter turnout is
expected to be low, dampened by disgust over Clinton's initial
denial that he had an adulterous affair with a White House intern.
Last month, Clinton admitted to the nation that he did have a
relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky. Last week, Boxer took to the
Senate floor to denouce his behavior as ``immoral,'' a late slap
that political analysts say could cost her crucial crossover votes
from Republican women. Fong, a fourth-generation Chinese-American,
could also siphon off the Asian vote which, while small, could
matter in such a tight race, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt Fong is incredibly lucky, but since Barbara was
incredibly lucky last time, who is she to complain?'' said Susan
Estrich, a University of Southern California law professor. ``She
wouldn't have denounced Clinton unless she felt she had to, and I
don't blame her for it. But I don't think it will help her,
particularly since she is going to continue using him for
fund-raising.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer's campaign manager, Rose Kapolczynski, said the
candidate's strong views would have caused a close Senate contest
regardless of the opposition. As she noted, at least one recent
poll put Boxer ahead of Fong, and the movement in others has not
been dramatic despite Clinton's troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence this is hurting us,'' Kapolczynski said.
``I traveled the state with her in August and the people she was
meeting are not obsessed with the president's problems. They're
more concerned about education, women's right to choose, the
environment... The biggest impact is we can't really get our
message out.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong stressed that he is running against Boxer, not Clinton. Not
surprisingly, however, he is as happy to play up the Clinton-Boxer
connection on the campaign trail as he is to push a federal tax
reform package that would eliminate capital gains, inheritance
taxes, and ``the IRS as we know it.'' Fong calls Boxer a hypocrite
for aggressively criticizing Republicans accused of sexual
harassment but keeping relatively quiet about Clinton for as long
as possible. An outspoken feminist first elected to represent Marin
County in Congress in 1982, Boxer went after both Clarence Thomas
during his US Supreme Court confirmation hearings and Oregon
Senator Bob Packwood, who was forced to resign after several female
employees accused him of sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as being an issue in the campaign, it's about her
putting politics over principle by her duplicity in treating
Democrats and Republicans differently...,'' said Fong, a US Air
Force Academy graduate often teased for his wooden speaking manner
and discomfort at the podium. ``In California, as much as the
president dominates the news, I'm not running against the
president. The bottom line is Barbara Boxer can't step away from
Barbara Boxer.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, California voters don't typically pay attention to
elections until the candidates hit the airwaves with millions of
dollars in TV advertising, as both Boxer and Fong are expected to
do this fall. For now, the race could go either way. &UR;  &LR; ``People
don't look at either candidate and see a heavyweight.''

SPORTS COLUMN: ISLANDERS' FANS TAKING WILD RIDE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINEOLA, N.Y. _ Just when you thought you had seen every
possible outrage for sports fans, along comes a new one: the
Islanders moved their offices off Long Island and into New York
City the other day, on the brink of the new training season.
Involved in a dispute that is either about the safety of Nassau
Coliseum or how much money can be wrung out of this faded
franchise, the new management is also threatening to seek other
sites in the three-state region for regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of the Islanders have told fans that if they want to
see the first exhibition next Friday, they are going to have to
schlep to the upstate village of Lake Placid, five hours in each
direction. A thoughtful team official did arrange a free bus ride,
but will the owners subsidize travel to possible league games in
Connecticut, New Jersey and New York City? I am guessing they will
not.
</P>
<P>
   Here we are, looking forward to a classic 10 days of the
Once-Again Amazing Mets, Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire, but this
grubby Islander business is the true face of sports in America. The
Islander scenario is: Buy team. Wait for ink to dry. Get into feud
with stadium management. Threaten to move games.
</P>
<P>
   This is what has happened to the Islanders, a bad team playing
in a dismal barn, but with a great history and fans just aching to
be treated decently. Once upon a time, the Islanders won four
straight Stanley Cups, from 1980 through 1983, with charismatic
stars like Mike Bossy, Denis Potvin, Billy Smith and Bryan
Trottier. Then the ownership grew remote, and the team went
downhill. A prospective owner named John Spano lied himself into a
prison sentence. Needing somebody to run this historic franchise,
the league found Steven Gluckstern and Howard Milstein, developers
whose eyes just might be more on the wide-open spaces surrounding
the Coliseum than on finding players or pleasing fans.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting until the team was assembling at training camp upstate,
the new owners claimed the Coliseum was unsafe, which must have
been shocking news to Michelle Kwan and everybody else who skated
there in the recent Goodwill Games.
</P>
<P>
   When the ownership of the Islanders and SMG, which administers
the Coliseum, could not agree on safety, the new management
demanded an inspection, and moved out, the biggest pre-emptive
evacuation of a sports franchise since Robert Irsay sneaked the
Colts out of Baltimore one dark and stormy night.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, all sides discussed their ugly little grudge match at
the offices of the Nassau County executive, Thomas Gulotta. After
six and a half hours, the talks broke up. Gulotta, bristling with
real or feigned anger, likened the ownership to ``a pig at a
trough'' and said he would not tolerate a ``gun at the head'' of
Nassau County taxpayers. He said some of the same things to SMG
when Gluckstern and Milstein were trying to buy the team last
February. Gulotta also said the six and a half hours of discussion
had been 99 percent about money and 1 percent about safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just wasn't the case,'' said David Seldin, the president
of the Islanders, formerly with the Jacksonville Jaguars and once
on the board of governors of SMG while working for the Pritzker
company in Chicago. ``Safety was a significant issue in the
discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, a lawyer for the Islanders, John Zuccotti,
said the Islanders might be willing to let the NHL make the final
determination about whether the building was safe.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the meeting broke down, the owners discovered that
Nassau County had already secured a temporary restraining order to
be heard in court next Wednesday. Wednesday evening, Bill Daly, the
senior vice president of legal affairs for the NHL, said that an
inspection would be arranged by Tuesday or Wednesday and that there
was time to determine if the season could begin on Oct. 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bottom line is, this is a lease dispute,'' said Daly, who
added, ``We have to make sure the building is safe before we
require the team to play there.'' It seems rather seedy, but New
York fans have seen this stuff before. George Steinbrenner has been
blustering about needing a new stadium, but taxpayers in New Jersey
and New York just might resist building one for him. It takes
courage to stand up to owners because the grim potential is losing
a team. Brooklyn lost the Dodgers 40 years ago and in a few years
could welcome a minor league team in Coney Island to partly cover
up the gaping hole in its civic heart.
</P>
<P>
   Things go faster these days. These new Islander owners just
arrived, but already they are packing up and moving off Long
Island, the fans' loyalties being crushed under the wheels.

STOCKS PLUNGE WORLDWIDE AMID ECONOMIC JITTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (shortens 6th graf and corrects figure to $3.4 billion sted $3.5
billion.)  (bl) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices tumbled around the world Thursday after
overseas investors digested word that central banks are planning no
coordinated cut in interest rates to quell financial and economic
turmoil in Asia, Latin America and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of the release of President Clinton's videotaped
grand jury testimony in the Monica Lewinsky matter and Japanese
banking problems also weighed on stock markets, which skidded to a
12{-year low in Tokyo and finished nearly 5 percent lower in Brazil
after a plunge twice that much halted trading.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign turmoil quickly spread to the United States, where the
Dow Jones industrial average dropped 200 points in the first
half-hour before steadying for the rest of the day. It closed down
216.01 points, or 2.67 percent, to 7,873.77. The loss broke a
string of four straight gains, the first since late June, and
pushed the blue-chip indicator back into negative territory for the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Although Wall Street seemed only mildly disappointed when
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress on Wednesday
that there were no current efforts to coordinate an interest-rate
cut, overseas markets reacted by selling off sharply, and this
pressure spilled over into the U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts here said they thought Greenspan, along with
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, had sought to avoid comments that
could have reduced pressure on the House to approve $18 billion to
replenish depleted aid coffers at the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The House refused to consider the full amount anyway. Instead,
approved only $3.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, predicted Alfred Goldman, chief market
strategist at A.G. Edwards in St. Louis, ``The IMF will get their
funding. We have no choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Still another factor affecting trading was Friday's quarterly
``triple witching'' phenomenon, when options and futures contracts
expire.
</P>
<P>
   European markets slumped across the board, but the greatest fall
was in France, where the CAC 40 index fell 5.47 percent after the
communications giant Alcatel warned of lower profits, citing the
crises in Asia and Russia. Shares dived 12 1/16, to 19\, on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Leading indexes tumbled 4.99 percent in Germany and 3 percent in
London, also reflecting fears of lost business with economically
distressed countries.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, the Nikkei index fell 338.56 points, or 2.38 percent,
to 13,859.14, its lowest point since March 1986. Government leaders
worked deep into the night to find a way to reorganize the
debt-laden Japanese banking system. Stocks fell 3.61 percent in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   After absorbing the early selling, U.S. markets fluctuated in a
relatively narrow range by recent standards, but almost nothing
escaped the downdraft. All 30 Dow stocks posted losses, as did 424
of the issues in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, which
dropped 2.55 percent for the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, dominated by technology stocks,
slumped about the same amount, 2.58 percent, with Microsoft down
3\, to 104 15/16, and Cisco Systems down 3[, to 61{.
</P>
<P>
   Without minimizing the buffeting from overseas forces, many
analysts said they were not surprised by Thursday's retreat after
four sizable advances and said they remained upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pulling back into its recent bottoming pattern'' said
Richard McCabe, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch. ``It was
probably entitled to give some back after the nice bounce off
7,500'' on the Dow. He said the index could reach the mid-8,000s
within a month.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks were pummeled once again, especially major
banks with big exposure to emerging markets. Citicorp slumped 6\,
to 96{, and J.P. Morgan was the biggest contributor to the Dow's
decline, falling 5{, to 89}. American Express lost 3 3/16, to 83~.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette, which on Wednesday warned of lower sales, saw its
stock skid 3 5/16 Thursday as Merrill Lynch trimmed its estimate of
the company's earnings to between $1.30 and $1.35 a share for this
year and $1.55 for 1999, 5 cents less than before. The shares
closed at 36~ after trading as high as 62 21/32 in early April.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble, another blue chip that warned recently of
weaker results, fell 3 Thursday, to 67. Other prominent decliners
were Lucent Technologies, which dropped 4 7/16, to 72[, and
Northern Telecom, which fell 6 1/16, to 39{.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange swamped gainers
by nearly 5 to 1 as 255 made new lows compared with only 21 new
highs.
</P>
<P>
   Volume was moderate at 692.56 million shares, well below that of
most recent sessions. Traders said they spotted no surge of
activity related to the unwinding of positions in advance of
Friday's triple-witching expiration of futures and options.

CUBS SLUGGER FLIES OUT THREE TIMES  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ED GUZMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Millimeters. Fractions of millimeters. That's how
close Sammy Sosa came to taking sole possession of the major league
home run lead.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, one night removed from driving in six runs and hitting his
63d home run, failed to connect Thursday afternoon, going 0-4 with
an eighth-inning walk. He just got under pitches to fly out three
times while grounding out and breaking his bat in the fourth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was a home run by his teammate Gary Gaetti leading
off the 10th inning that gave the Chicago Cubs a 4-3 victory at
Qualcomm Stadium. Gaetti's 18th home run, off Padres relief ace
Trevor Hoffman, was the Cubs' fifth home run of the series, in
which each of the four games was decided by a late inning homer.
</P>
<P>
   The victory extended the Cubs' lead in the National League
wild-card race to one game over the idle Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Beck recorded his career-high 49th save of the season, but
only after shortstop Jose Hernandez fielded a hard grounder off
Beck's body and threw out Carlos Hernandez, with the tying run at
third.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres argued the out call, and television replays showed
that Hernandez was safe. But the Cubs still took their third
straight victory and fifth in six games.
</P>
<P>
   The Sosa phenomenon, meanwhile, continued to take hold of the
San Diego crowd, as another standing ovation greeted his his first
at-bat Thursday afternoon. The cheering for Sosa had been the
subject of discontent among Padres players, and the fireworks
Wednesday night after Sosa's homer only made them more furious.
Several Padre pitchers, including Joey Hamilton, Trevor Hoffman and
Sterling Hitchcock, continued to voice their displeasure after
Wednesday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players were upset not so much because the fans cheered
Sammy but because the organization saw fit to shoot off fireworks
and other stuff on our scoreboard after he hit the home run,''
right fielder Tony Gwynn said. ``We thought we were in a race here.
The fans cheering was expected, but they don't need to shoot off
fireworks. It's kicking us in the gut. But hey, today we just go
about our business and win some ball games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres pitching staff, usually seen milling around the
batting cage in the previous games of this series, was nowhere to
be found before Thursday afternoon's contest. They were reportedly
still fuming over Wednesday night's festivities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you read what the Padres players said in the newspaper
today?,'' said Cubs outfielder Glenallen Hill. ``Well, I think
that's kind of selfish not to be involved in such a great part of
history. Someday, each one of them will reflect back on this time
and they will say, `I was there, I saw it, it was a great thing.'
We know they're fighting for who gets home-field advantage. I
wouldn't let winning and losing sidetrack you from being a part of
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Cubs first baseman Mark Grace: ``I can understand their
feelings, but all of America is rooting for Sammy. The fans last
night cheered every time their pitcher struck Sammy out. They
wanted the Padres to win. Sometimes guys have to back away from the
competition and realize what's going on and see that in their
lifetime, they may never be a part of this again.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about this issue, Sosa seemed almost puzzled by all
the commotion. ``They know that it's the first time in history that
two people hit 63 in the same year,'' said Sosa in a pre-game news
conference on the field. ``I think that everyone should be happy,
even the Padres. Everybody likes baseball and I just want to keep
bringing people to the ball park and make this game a little bit
more exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   One fan who feels Sosa has brought excitement to baseball is the
Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson, who was here Thursday afternoon to
congratulate Sosa. Before the top of the fourth inning, the video
screen at Qualcomm Stadium showed Jackson's three-home run
performance in Game 6 of the 1977 World Series. When the screen
faded to a shot of him in the stands, he was received with a
standing ovation from the crowd. But Jackson has also been
impressed by the way Sosa has handled the media attention and the
pressure of the home run chase.

 &HT;      BOEHNER WANTS FBI TO PROBE SMEAR CAMPAIGN; 
 &HT;      WHITE HOUSE DENIES INVOLVEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Ronald F. Eckstein  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Sept. 17 -- The White House's alleged ``Scorched
Earth'' campaign against detractors of President Clinton is adding
fuel to the fire of House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John A. Boehner, R-West Chester, and seven other House
Republican leaders have requested FBI Director Louis Freeh
investigate a ``systematic attempt (by Clinton allies) to
intimidate ... elected members of the House from doing their
constitutional duty by promoting prurient allegations about their
personal lives to the media.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans made their request in a letter to Freeh
Thursday, after reports surfaced of a 25-year-old adulterous affair
involving House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill -- which Hyde
admitted. Hyde would preside over impeachment hearings if they are
held.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that this tactic has been employed by the White House
to attack opponents of the president during this entire
investigation,'' Boehner said.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Clinton critics -- Reps. Helen Chenoweth, R-Idaho, and
Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind. -- have recently had their past infidelity
reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sick,'' Boehner said of any effort to blackmail Clinton
enemies. Because the House of Representatives would hold hearings
and vote on whether the Senate should hold an impeachment trial,
Boehner added that ``outing'' congressmen would be comparable to
trying to intimidate potential jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials heartily denied the
Republicans' allegations. In a letter to Hyde, White House Chief of
Staff Erskine Bowles promised to fire any staffers involved in
spreading gossip about lawmakers' private lives. White House Press
Secretary Mike McCurry also said any employee involved ``would no
longer be on staff.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a friend of the husband of Hyde's old mistress
claimed full credit for publicizing the story of that affair.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans are not convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly there is credible evidence that an organized campaign
of slander and intimidation may exist. If it does, any individuals
promoting such a campaign may be in violation of federal criminal
law,'' they wrote in the letter to Freeh.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans attached 11 examples of evidence from television and
newspaper reports pointing to a ``White House Smear Campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This goes to the core of the Constitution -- the separation of
powers. The executive branch is employing these tactics against the
legislative branch'' Boehner said. ``If this is coming from the
White House, I would recommend it be included in the impeachment
report.''

 By LISA W. FODERARO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Howard Sanders had garnered the trappings of American
success: a degree from Harvard Business School, a position with a
high-powered Manhattan investment firm and an apartment on Central
Park West.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanders, who is black, felt so strongly about one day owning
a home in Harlem, where he had grown up, that it became a condition
of his marriage proposal. Today, he and his wife, Karen, and their
daughter, Samantha, live in a five-bedroom brownstone with a
Japanese garden on West 147th Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to live next to a white family,'' Sanders, 32,
said. ``I effectively have integrated. I've gone to predominantly
white schools. I work in a white firm, and I can live anywhere I
want. It really is psychologically soothing for me to be in
Harlem.''
</P>
<P>
   What started in the early 1990s as a trickle of young
African-American lawyers, doctors, professors and bankers moving
back to Harlem and other historically black neighborhoods seems now
to have reached the flood stage.
</P>
<P>
   Black professionals are snatching up 5,000-square-foot
brownstones off avenues named for black leaders. And their
financial commitments extend beyond new boilers and restoring
woodwork; they are also looking to bring the amenities they had
found in Soho and the Upper West Side to neighborhoods that, while
on the upswing, are still marked by abandonment and a dearth of
shops and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Falling crime rates, relatively low housing prices, striking
residential architecture and signs of economic renewal are all
factors in the influx of affluent young black people to
historically black neighborhoods. But certain intangibles _
Harlem's storied place in the black consciousness, a new
generation's changing sensibility about integration, simple
idealism _ have played a role as well, scholars and new arrivals
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an economic incentive because you can basically get
housing for 30 to 40 percent of what you'd pay 25 blocks away,''
said Darren Walker, who gave up a doorman building in midtown
Manhattan and a career in the bond department of a Swiss bank to
move to Harlem and become a vice president of the nonprofit
Abyssinian Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I have always had a fascination with the Harlem of legend
and folklore,'' he said. ``Reading the writers of the Harlem
Renaissance created a lot of mythologies in our heads. I just feel
this visceral kind of connection that I don't know how to
describe.''
</P>
<P>
   Real estate brokers say there has also been a parallel increase
over the last five years in buyers without those connections _
white families and a small number of Asian-Americans _ who are
simply attracted by the amount of space and bygone splendor their
money can buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got houses up there with Honduran mahogany and 24-karat
gold leaf molding in the dining rooms,'' said Willie Kathryn Suggs,
a broker who estimates that buyers who are not black now account
for about 30 percent of her clients for row houses and
condominiums. ``To be able to have that kind of house in the city
is attractive to all kinds of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Other brokers say that the percentage of new buyers who are not
black is probably lower, between 10 and 15 percent, but that the
number is increasing more rapidly than the number of black buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Suggs cited as one example a white couple _ the husband is a
lawyer and the wife is a business consultant _ who closed last
month on a row house in the Hamilton Heights neighborhood, and who
told her they were interested in attracting theater companies to
the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers say they have seen the effects of Harlem's pull. Housing
prices in West Harlem have risen 20 percent in five years,
according to R. Kenyatta Punter, a broker with the Harlem-based
Myers, Smith &AMP; Granady realty agency. Hard to market in the early
1990s, brownstones are now selling briskly, at prices ranging from
$80,000 for an abandoned shell to $450,000 for a house in perfect
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the homes predate the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s,
which is when many black people moving to New York chose to live in
Harlem, in part because it had a surplus of rental apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the 1930s and accelerating through the '40s and
'50s, large numbers of black professionals left Harlem, although a
small middle-class presence remained through the decades, said
Winston James, an assistant professor of history at Columbia
University who specializes in the Harlem Renaissance. Their
departure followed the decay of apartment buildings during the
Depression and new opportunities for integration in places like
Brooklyn and Queens.
</P>
<P>
   James said the recent return of well-to-do blacks began in the
early 1990s and now seems ``to be expanding tremendously.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense of idealism among a large number of black
professional young people,'' he said. ``There is a terrible
frustration about the condition of black people in the society
despite the progress of many members of the professional class. I
suppose one of the ways people attempt to make some kind of
contribution is by their physical presence.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That is certainly true of Dr. Michael Jones. A 29-year-old ear,
nose and throat resident at Mount Sinai Medical Center, Jones said
he decided to move to Harlem after receiving both his undergraduate
and medical degrees from Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important for me to be in Harlem because I needed a
sense of purpose,'' he said. ``Being in Chelsea or Tribeca or the
Upper East Side, I wouldn't feel that my presence could make a
difference. Children on my block say, `Hey, Doc.' They see me
working hard. And because they can see it and touch it, they may
feel it's something they can attain.''
</P>
<P>
   His home, on West 147th Street between Convent and St. Nicholas
Avenues, is a handsome 6,000-square-foot brownstone in the leafy
section known both as Sugar Hill and Hamilton Heights.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With Jones' BMW parked out front and his carefully tended pink
and white impatiens in back, the house has become a beacon for
young people tempted to give Harlem a try. ``I started having
networking parties and became a funnel for a lot of young black
professionals who wanted to find brownstones here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One drawback is the lack of stores and services. Although ground
was recently broken for Harlem USA, an ambitious retail and
entertainment complex on 125th Street that is to include the area's
first Gap and Disney stores, commercial development farther north
has been spotty.
</P>
<P>
   ``When friends come to visit or when I'm tired and want to grab
a quick cup of gourmet coffee, I absolutely wish those amenities
were here,'' Jones said. ``But it's my dream to make them happen.
It's up to us to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Having already carved out a busy sideline in real estate
development by buying, renovating and selling old brownstones and
boardinghouses, mostly in Hamilton Heights, Jones is now determined
to fill the void of stylish restaurants with his latest venture,
the Sugar Hill Cafe. The plan calls for a combination coffeehouse,
restaurant and jazz club on three floors of a brownstone at 458 W.
145th St.
</P>
<P>
   Jones bought the building in June for $300,000 with two partners
who are also Harlem residents: Dineo Khabele, a fellow in
gynecology-oncology at Montefiore Medical Center, and her husband,
James Hunter, an engineer. The three plan to spend $450,000 to
renovate the tattered turn-of-the-century building, where the
original oak floors and elaborately carved mantelpieces are still
intact. They are now seeking financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the most affluent neighborhood in Harlem,'' Jones
said, ``without any quality dining establishments within walking
distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Other black professionals are considering buying franchises to
open businesses like florists and copy centers. The franchise
chains are expanding into Harlem and four other city neighborhoods
through a new program sponsored by the Local Initiatives Support
Corp., a nonprofit group in Manhattan, and Bankers Trust Co.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsors are recruiting entrepreneurs to team up with local
community development groups to buy the franchises, benefiting from
below-market financing and looser equity requirements. The first
such franchise, a Sterling Optical store, opened in Harlem on Sept.
2 on the corner of 125th Street and Lenox Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   While no hard numbers exist to document the movement of black
professionals to Harlem, the higher real estate prices speak
volumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last five years, it has really gained momentum,'' said
Sherman Edmiston, a Harlem real estate agent whose wife, Essie
Green Edmiston, owns an art gallery there. ``We are getting more of
the younger people coming here with the idea that they want to be
part of the rebuilding of Harlem. They've got fresh ideas and a
considerable amount of money.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the Edmistons were pioneers in deciding 10 years
ago to move their home and art gallery from Park Slope in Brooklyn
to Harlem. Like many parts of the city, Harlem was then still in
the violent throes of the crack epidemic, and art meccas like SoHo
or 57th Street would have seemed a more likely choice for their
gallery, which sells the art of such black masters as Jacob
Lawrence and Romare Bearden.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we felt that our concentration is really on developing the
collections of black collectors, and there's a poetry to our being
in Harlem as opposed to being downtown,'' said Edmiston, who also
works in the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   The couple might have also considered Bedford-Stuyvesant, a
historically black community in Brooklyn that has plenty of scruffy
bodegas and garish beauty parlors but is known for its beautiful
brownstones. It, too, is drawing black professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis A. Watkins, district manager of Community Board 3, which
covers Bedford-Stuyvesant, attributes the trend to rising housing
prices in more gentrified Brooklyn neighborhoods like Park Slope
and Brooklyn Heights. ``You can buy the same town house in Bed-Stuy
for $250,000 that would sell for a half-million dollars in Park
Slope,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But for Monique Greenwood, the executive editor of Essence
magazine, and her husband, Glenn Pogue, a broadcast engineer for
WNBC-TV, money was not the only motivator. ``We could easily go to
the suburbs,'' she said, ``but we're about rebuilding our
communities and living in them.''
</P>
<P>
   One concern the couple had was the public schools. Ms. Greenwood
said that while she wanted her 6-year-old daughter, Glynn, to
attend a public school, ``I wasn't convinced that I wanted my child
to suffer because of my political beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   After checking out several private schools in Brooklyn, as well
as the public elementary schools, the couple decided that Glynn
could receive as good an education in the gifted program in their
neighborhood school as in private school. But they knew it would
mean more involvement on their part.
</P>
<P>
   During the last school year, the couple met weekly with other
parents, teachers and administrators as part of the school-based
management team to discuss issues, from the curriculum to grant
money. In the spring, they sat on the selection committee
responsible for hiring the new principal.
</P>
<P>
   Like Dr. Jones in Harlem, Ms. Greenwood also missed the
smorgasbord of services in wealthier New York neighborhoods. So
she, too, took matters into her own hands. Three years ago, she and
her husband opened Akwaaba Mansion, a lavish bed-and-breakfast in
the 18-room house that is also their home. (Akwaaba means welcome
in Akan, a language spoken in Ghana.)
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, they opened Akwaaba Cafe, a restaurant with
burgundy banquettes and light fixtures of copper wire, parchment
paper and colored glass beads. ``I realized I had to be involved in
economic development,'' Ms. Greenwood said, ``because the amenities
I would want in a neighborhood just weren't there.''
</P>
<P>
   While the commercial life of Harlem may never be as abundant or
luxurious as points south in Manhattan, that's fine with Sanders,
the investment banker. (It's easy enough, he said, to drive five
minutes south for Sunday brunch on Amsterdam Avenue.) Harlem, he
says, feeds his soul in a way that other Manhattan neighborhoods
never could.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be quite honest, there are cultural differences, and when
you live in your own community, there's not that pressure to
assimilate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm basking in my own culture when I go to the Schomberg
Center,'' he said, referring to the New York Public Library's
Schomberg Center for Research in Black Culture. ``If I lived in the
West Village I couldn't do that. I'd have to seek out activities
that brought me into contact with black professionals.''

WILLIAM CLAY FORD JR.: A DIFFERENT SORT OF SCION  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Clay Ford Jr., soon to be chairman of Ford Motor Co., is
not exactly a car man from central casting.
</P>
<P>
   The auto industry has been feuding with environmentalists ever
since air quality became an issue in the 1960s, but Ford has long
been active in environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   He is a great-grandson of a famously autocratic industrial titan
and leads an extended family that still controls 40 percent of
Ford's voting stock, but he is happy to share power and the
spotlight with Jacques A. Nasser, who will become Ford's president
and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   After the company announced on Sept. 11 that Ford, 41, and
Nasser, 50, would succeed Alexander Trotman, 65, at the end of the
year, Ford talked about driving down roads less traveled. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You've said Ford will seek environmental leadership in your
tenure. Is there a tension between that and maximizing profits?
</P>
<P>
   A. In the short term, there probably is a tension. But I think
in the long term, if we are the leading corporate citizen, it will
do several things for us. It will create an image for Ford in the
marketplace that is different from others, and in a cluttered and
crowded marketplace in which differentiation is hard to obtain,
particularly in image. If we achieve this, we will attract better
employees and the highest caliber of people out of universities.
They're going to want to come work for a company like Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is it true that when you joined the Ford board, you were
asked to distance yourself from the environmental movement?
</P>
<P>
   A. Somebody close to the board thought it would be a good idea
if I stopped associating with crazies, and I assured them that not
only was I not doing so, but that the group I was involved with,
which was very benign _ the Nature Conservancy _ was made up of a
cross-section of our customers. At the time, I was in Switzerland,
where business and environmentalists actually had a dialogue. In
this country, all they did was snipe at each other. I felt that
somebody needed to start building bridges, so I really chose to
stay involved.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are you going to have formal meetings with Nasser to
coordinate your division of responsibilities?
</P>
<P>
   A. We're going to have to set aside some formal time so that we
can both make sure we actually do it. And then there's going to be
a lot of just wandering into each other's offices and picking up
the phone. The less formal that we can make this, and the more of a
true partnership in making it easy, I think, the better it's going
to be for the company. That's something that both he and I want to
do. We really have a running start on this because we've known each
other a long time. We get on very well; we think the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Splitting the jobs of chairman and chief executive is
unusual. You're busy now with running the Detroit Lions football
team and other activities. Might you someday want to add the job of
chief executive at Ford?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't believe so. I really believe this is a great setup.
One of the nice things about this arrangement is that it does use
the strength of two capable people. Having watched how large this
company has become, and how tough it is to manage, I think
separating these jobs makes a lot of sense. And internationally, as
you know, that is quite common _ less so in this country. Jac and I
both concluded this is the way to go. We're both relatively young,
and I think we'll hopefully be at this a long time together. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. After Princeton, why did you choose to study management at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology rather than at the more
famous Harvard Business School?
</P>
<P>
   A. As a liberal arts major as an undergrad, I felt I would be
best served by going to the most quantitative program that I could
find. I felt that would give me the best rounding-out experience,
and, in fact, I think that was true.
</P>
<P>
   I was one of only two non-engineers in my class at MIT, and it
was a great experience.

 &HT;    Lockhart looking iffy for playoffs
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phoenix _ Has Keith Lockhart's gimpy right hamstring knocked the
second baseman out of the playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart won't go that far but he is second-guessing how he has
treated the injury, first sustained Aug. 22. He has made four
starts since then but felt the hamstring twinge so strongly in his
last game last Saturday that he hasn't been able to play since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess maybe I should have gone on the DL when I first did
it,'' Lockhart said Thursday. ``But everyone I talked to said it
wasn't bleeding. Usually if it's black and blue, it's done pretty
good and this wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's at the point now if it does anything else, then they'll
have to shut it down. I'm still going to have to play a few games.
It's getting to playoff time. That's why every day is pretty
crucial. I'm just trying to be real crucial. But I also have to
play a few games to keep sharp.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Cox would not rule out the possibility that rookie Marty
Malloy could take Lockhart's place in the first round, but also
made it sound that a less-than-100 percent Lockhart would still be
his preference.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very good defensive player,'' Cox said. ``Even if he's
85 (percent), he gets to everything. And if he can play that way
... ''
</P>
<P>
   Cox was also waiting for a more definitive reading of Walt
Weiss. Though the shortstop thought he was over a problem with his
left quadriceps, Weiss scored from first base Wednesday on a Curtis
Pride double and felt the quad act up. He was replaced by rookie
call-up Mark DeRosa three innings later and was in discomfort
Thursday. Ozzie Guillen started in his spot Thursday after
left-hander Omar Daal.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore calling?
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are declining comment on interest the Baltimore
Orioles are reportedly showing Atlanta assistant GM Dean Taylor.
With O's GM Pat Gillick having given word he will step down after
this year and his assistant, Kevin Malone, freshly hired in Los
Angeles, the Orioles are conducting a low-profile serach for a new
front-office head.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was interviewed by the Dodgers for their vacancy but did
not make a short list of finalists. Braves GM John Schuerholz would
not verify that the team had given permission to Baltimore to talk
with Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I can say right now,'' said Taylor, ``is any
comment on this needs to come from them.'' And the O's aren't
talking.
</P>
<P>
   Bautista ready
</P>
<P>
   The Braves were planning to activate outfielder Danny Bautista
from the DL before Thursday's game, 24 days after he sustained a
slight tear in the medial colateral ligament in his right knee
during a collision with Los Angeles catcher Tom Prince. Cox said he
would probably hold Bautista out until Saturday's game against
Arizona lefty Brian Anderson.

GOP SEEKS FBI PROBE OF EMBARRASSING DISCLOSURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders, livid over the disclosure of a
30-year-old affair involving House Judiciary Committee chairman
Henry Hyde, Thursday asked the FBI to investigate whether the White
House is involved in a conspiracy to embarrass GOP members by
exposing their private lives.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Hyde led the Republican move to release videotape of
President Clinton's secret grand jury testimony, GOP leaders said
one or more White House aides have orchestrated an investigation of
private lives that is designed to scare Republicans who are
investigating the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reason to believe that top aides that have access to
the Oval Office have been orchestrating a conspiracy to intimidate
members of Congress by using their past lives,'' House Majority
Whip Thomas DeLay said, while declining to name a suspect at the
White House. The FBI said it would investigate.
</P>
<P>
   A letter signed by Republican leaders did not directly accuse a
specific White House official of peddling the Hyde story. But an
accompanying document noted that media reports have focused on the
tactics of White House aide Sidney Blumenthal and adviser James
Carville.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman James E. Kennedy said last night that the
publication of the Hyde story was ``tragic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a zero tolerance policy for any White House staff
found engaging in such conduct,'' Kennedy said. ``However, the
Republican members who sent the letter have taken this tragic case
and used it for their own partisan purposes. We have no intention
of responding further to such a politically motivated event.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican document quoted conservative commentator George
Will as saying on September 6 that Blumenthal was trying to ``smear
Henry Hyde.'' Earlier this year, independent counsel Kenneth W.
Starr called Blumenthal to testify about whether he was leaking
personal material on Starr and his assistants.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican document also quoted Carville as saying in June
that, ``I happen to like Henry Hyde. But people do research and
hand me stuff. Some of it I use, some it I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal and Carville did not return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Salon, the Internet magazine that published the article, said it
learned about the affair from a friend of the man whose wife had an
affair with Hyde, not from a White House official.
</P>
<P>
   Both political parties, and many campaigns, have ``opposition
research'' offices that conduct investigations into the actions and
lives of opponents. A few months ago, the White House accused
Republicans of spreading rumors about the president, with Hillary
Rodham Clinton saying that a ``vast right-wing conspiracy'' was
afoot.
</P>
<P>
   Salon editor David Talbot, who wrote the Hyde story, denied that
it came from a White House tip. He said in a television interview
that the original tipster contacted 50 media organizations before
reaching Salon. The magazine said it decided to publish the article
to draw attention to what it called the unfair focus on Clinton's
private life. ``It's time to put an end to the confusion of the
personal and the political,'' the magazine said in a letter to
readers. The letter said the Hyde story deserved to be published
because ``ugly times call for ugly tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans weren't buying Salon's explanation. DeLay and
other Republicans said the White House has hired a detective
company to dig into the private lives of GOP members and then pass
it along to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, DeLay cited an ABC-TV news report that said two
unnamed reporters had been contacted by White House officials about
the Hyde story. Republicans also noted that the president's
brother, Roger Clinton, issued an ominous warning about the
exposure of private lives.
</P>
<P>
   If an issue is made of the president's actions, Roger Clinton
said on CNN's Larry King Live last month, ``some of the political
people...had best watch themselves because of the old glass house
story. Be very careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Roger Clinton's statement _ by coincidence or not _ three
House Republicans have been compelled by media investigations to
acknowledge sexual affairs:
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, of Illinois, acknowledged Wednesday that as a married man
he had an affair from 1965 to 1969. House Government Reform and
Oversight Committee chairman Dan Burton, one of the president's
toughest antagonists, admitted he had an affair and had a child out
of wedlock. The third Republican to admit having an affair was
Representative Helen Chenoweth of Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, former White House aide George Stephanopoulos
broadly hinted that ``White House allies'' were investigating
Republicans with a ``deterrent strategy'' in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has said he would never resign, and I think some
around him are willing to take everybody down with him,''
Stephanopoulos, a commentator for ABC, said on the network's ``This
Week'' program.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said there is no comparison between what happened
between the president and Monica S. Lewinsky and the affairs of the
three Republicans that have been exposed in the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abuse of power is far more serious than having an affair 30
years ago. I just urge the president to stop his allies from
engaging in this kind of disgusting conduct,'' DeLay told reporters
Thursday. Starr said in his report that Clinton abused the power of
his office by trying to prevent the testimony of Secret Service
agents and others during the investigation into whether the
president lied about his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   There are numerous cases in which people affiliated with
campaigns mention possible infidelity to reporters covering an
opponent. Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign was considered
nearly dead after Gennifer Flowers alleged she had an affair with
him when he was Arkansas governor.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Democrats voiced suspicions that Star magazine,
which published the Flowers story, got the information from the
Republican Party. But Star magazine and the GOP denied that
Republicans had anything to do with the story.

CLINTON HOST A NATIONAL FIGURE IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ While not well known in his home city, John P. Manning,
who with his wife, Lyle, opened up his Beacon Street townhouse for
a $25,000-per-person fund-raiser for President Clinton Thursday
night, is a national name in affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
   His company, Boston Capital Corp., owns 88,000 units of
affordable housing, located in every state but Alaska and Hawaii,
making the firm the fourth-largest in its field in the country.
Company spokesman David Gasson said the properties collectively are
worth about $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly called Boston Capital Partners, the firm was founded in
1974 to arrange financing of affordable housing through syndication
of partnerships and other investment units that incorporated tax
shelters then available to investors.
</P>
<P>
   Following changes in federal tax laws in 1986, the only
significant shelters that remain are Low Income Housing Tax
Credits, which Boston Capital uses to create investment units that
it sells to Fortune 500 companies as well as individuals.
</P>
<P>
   As Congress and successive administrations have renewed these
programs, Manning, president and chief executive of Boston Capital,
and Herbert F. Collins of Gloucester, chairman, also have become
major political contributors. According to the nonprofit Center for
Responsive Politics, the two men in the past four years alone have
given more than $600,000 to Democratic and Republican causes and
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Manning, 50, is listed as giving $$391,238 to Democrats between
1994 and 1998, including $205,000 in ``soft money'' to the
Democratic National Committee, and nearly $92,000 to the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, 68, gave $232,000 during that period, mostly to
Republicans, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. His
largest single contribution was $100,000, given last April, to the
Republican National Committee. Collins also gave $1,000 each to
several Democrats, including Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and
former Senator George Mitchell of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are the masters of playing both sides of the
table,'' said one Boston real estate investment veteran who has
worked alongside Manning and Collins for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Along with running Boston Capital, Manning is a member of the
President's Export Council, which advises on trade issues. Gasson,
the Boston Capital spokesman, said Manning has also served on
Federal National Mortgage Association committees and on the US
Conference of Mayors Task Force on Housing.

   As the ruble plunged and worried allies and foreign creditors
waited for clues to Russia's anti-crisis plans, the Primakov
government appeared divided over how to solve the country's
considerable economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Primakov government is starting to resemble all the previous
ones under Yeltsin _ divisive groups paralyzed by internal
squabbles, unable to implement any of their decisions, unlikely to
last long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parallel power structures are being set up'' in the new
government, wrote the influential business daily Kommersant. The
Moscow Times called the Cabinet ``a strange-bedfellows blend of
reform Communists and moderate market reformers.''
</P>
<P>
   The broad coalition of Communists and liberals in parliament
that installed Primakov has already broken up; Communist leader
Gennady Zyuganov has already begun distancing himself from the
government. A leading liberal legislator, economist Grigory
Yavlinsky, has refused a senior Cabinet post, saying he did not
want to join a ``debate club.''
</P>
<P>
   And Yeltsin told the nation he would spend another week shopping
for a new finance minister, a key post in a Cabinet that has not
decided whether it plans to pull the country back from the brink of
economic collapse by printing money or doing things to convince the
West to give Russia some.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been paralyzed ever since Aug. 17, when the default
on $40 billion in debts touched off the ruble's nosedive, caused
the country's banking system to shut down and dashed foreign
confidence in Russia's markets.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the ruble, which lost some 30 percent of its value on
the streets of Moscow on Wednesday, was weaker again, trading for
15.80 per dollar compared with an official 12.45 on Wednesday. It
was worth 6.5 a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   With labor leaders planning a mass demonstration Oct. 7 that
organizers Thursday said could get out of control if workers, owed
billions of rubles in back wages, do not get paid, Primakov has
made paying off late wages his first priority.
</P>
<P>
   To fund this, Primakov's Communist first deputy Yury Maslyukov,
60, and the newly appointed Central Bank chairman, Viktor
Gerashchenko, 60, have advocated abandonning the austerity programs
backed by the International Monetary Fund, which over six years
brought inflation down but left millions of Russians without cash.
</P>
<P>
   But First Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Shokhin, appointed
Wednesday, Thursday criticized calls to print rubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any talk about (monetary) emission provokes inflation,'' said
Shokhin. Shokhin also picked a fight with the government's acting
chief tax inspector, Boris Fyodorov, saying someone else would get
the job. In a statement, Fyodorov refused to quit.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russia's Central Bank appeared to be pursuing a plan
to print more money. An official said banks could free up their
funds by exchanging their near-worthless government securities for
cash. This plan, according to the bank's deputy chairman, Andrei
Kozlov, would be funded by the new rubles.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was likely to fuel the suspicions of foreign investors
that the Russian government would bail out insolvent Russian banks
while Western creditors would be stiffed.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to these concerns, Shokhin said the government would
try to work out a new deal on the bad loans with foreign banks to
revive confidence in Russia. Shokhin also expressed hope that the
IMF would kick in with the next $4.3 billion installment of a $22.6
billion package that was agreed on in July, but postponed after
Russia defaulted on its debt payments.
</P>
<P>
   Russian and Western business leaders say Russia will need
outside help avoid defaulting on its foreign debt payments. The
trouble is convincing the West to give that help.
</P>
<P>
   The American Chamber of Commerce in Russia said U.S. companies
were cutting back jobs after losing $469 million in Russia during
the latest government crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all...believed in the reform process,'' chamber president
Scott Blacklin said. ``And now it turns out we were wrong.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUSAKA, Zambia _ It was only two weeks after their mother died
from AIDS that their aunt took them to the bus station. She said
she did not want to take care of them anymore. She told them to go
to Lusaka, find a police station and ask for an orphanage.
</P>
<P>
   The children, Calvin Katoya and Jackson Kabaso, who would like
to be soccer stars someday, did as they were told, riding the bus
an hour from the small town of Kabwe, then asking strangers where
to go. But the police could not help them. As the days went by, the
boys, 12 and 15, slept in the rusting, abandoned cars nearby. They
had no money or food.
</P>
<P>
   Edith and Khuzini Banda lived with their aunt for about year
after their mother died in 1994. But then the aunt said her home
was too crowded. She sent the girls _ then only 13 and 14 _ to live
alone in their mother's house. The girls make do by renting out
half the two-room house for $15 a month, and begging from the
neighbors when food runs out.
</P>
<P>
   The two keep their cinder-block room tidy, decorated with
magazine layouts of models and Hollywood stars. They hope the
headmaster will be lenient about their school fees, which are eight
months over due.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, said Edith Banda, she is jealous of those who still
have parents. ``It would be nice to have someone who cares about
us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS epidemic has been raging in Zambia for nearly two
decades, and as the deaths pile up, so do the orphaned children. It
is much the same in many other parts of Africa. In rural areas of
East Africa, four of every 10 children who have lost one parent by
age 15 have lost that parent to AIDS, according to U.N. figures. In
1997 alone, the disease orphaned 1.7 million children, more than 90
percent of them in Africa south of the Sahara.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Zambia, a landlocked county in southern Africa that
has never embraced birth control, that has the highest proportion
of orphaned children in the world, according to the United Nations.
Here, an estimated 23 percent of all children under 15 are missing
one or both parents, many of them dead from AIDS, and the numbers
are expected to keep rising.
</P>
<P>
   For now, most of the children have been absorbed into extended
families. Almost 75 percent of all households are taking care of at
least one orphan. But in this country, where half of all households
are living in extreme poverty, the strain of caring for extra
children is beginning to take its toll. Many children are being
squeezed out. In 1991 Lusaka had 35,000 children living on the
street. Today there are more than 90,000.
</P>
<P>
   Zambian officials believe the number of adults infected with
HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, will not decline before 2010,
which means that the orphan population will not peak until 2020.
Recent U.N.reports estimate that there are now nearly half a
million orphaned by the disease in Zambia. That number is expected
at least to double in the coming decade, further straining the
country's meager resources.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that already the orphans are suffering. When there
is not enough to eat, orphans often get less than the other
children in the household. They are also often the last to get
shoes and the last to go to school. In the rural areas, girls are
being married off at 12 or 13, far younger than the usual age of
18. The reason: the family no longer has to feed the girl and, in
keeping with local custom, can claim a bride price.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the children say the orphans are more likely to be
forced to work long hours, to suffer from beatings and to
experience sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start talking about the rising number of orphans, you
are quickly talking about a rise in all these related issues _
child labor, child abuse and sexual abuse,'' said Stephan Dahlgren,
a project officer with Unicef based in Zambia. ``The more
vulnerable children you have, the more the problems escalate.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the huge number of people infected with HIV in Zambia,
there is little planning for death. Most people are never tested
for AIDS and would not admit to it even if they did find out they
are infected. Only among the educated elite is this beginning to
change.
</P>
<P>
   Zambian health authorities believe that the prevalence of HIV
here will peak this year because recent surveys report significant
behavioral changes. But even that seems like bitter news: The
infection rate in urban areas is expected to plateau at 28 percent.
In rural areas, experts calculate, it will be 22 percent, giving
Zambia one of the world's highest infection rates.
</P>
<P>
   As is the case elsewhere in Africa, the vast majority of
infected Zambians are between 15 and 40, meaning that they are
dying when they should be in their most productive years. This,
combined with wide-scale layoffs as the government tries to retool
a socialist economy by selling off state-owned businesses, has made
it all the more difficult for families to absorb the growing number
of orphans. Children, orphaned or not, have hard lives in Zambia.
Nearly half are stunted from a lack of food, about 20 percent
severely so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows about AIDS,'' Dahlgren said. ``If you go into
a small village and ask a chief about AIDS, he knows all about it.
But when it comes down to `What is this disease that so and so died
from?' then it's tuberculosis or malaria.''
</P>
<P>
   Many orphans are losing both their parents and all their
inheritance at the same time. Relatives quickly swoop in and grab
property, be it cooking pots or farm land, and the children have
little to say about it. In theory, they could appeal to the courts,
but few Zambians have the wherewithal and the money to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Florence and Veronica Phiri once lived comfortably with their
parents in the modest house they owned. Their father was an
electrician. But in 1994 both parents died within months of each
other. The girls were 8 and 6.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, their father's family took over the house and sent
the girls to live with an aunt in a rural village. There, the girls
said, they were beaten and had to work long hours fetching water
and collecting wood.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, their mother's relatives intervened and brought
the girls back to Lusaka to live with their maternal grandmother,
who sells vegetables in the market. Florence and Veronica and four
cousins who are also orphans spend most days playing in the dusty
streets in front of their grandmother's dilapidated house.
</P>
<P>
   Florence and Veronica have nothing that ever belonged to their
parents and do not expect they ever will. At her grandmother's,
Florence said, some days there is no food.
</P>
<P>
   But she is still glad to be there. ``It is much better than
before,'' she said, shyly adjusting her ragged clothes.

FEWER STUDENTS SEEK FRATERNITIES AT MIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Fraternities at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology attracted fewer pledges this fall, after a year of bad
publicity that started with Scott Krueger's death from an alcohol
overdose following a fraternity rush party.
</P>
<P>
   The number of pledges dropped about 7 percent, from 366 last
year to 316, MIT officials said Thursday. And some fraternities
said students were more hesitant in pledging, largely because they
had heard horror stories about binge drinking in the houses, which
have historically played a key role in housing MIT students.
</P>
<P>
   But the school says it's unclear whether the smaller number
actually reflects a shrinking interest in fraternity life.
</P>
<P>
   Each fraternity had to give a bed to a resident adviser, meaning
they had room to house 36 fewer pledges overall. And two
fraternities were forbidden from taking pledges because of drinking
violations last year. Normally, those fraternities would have
absorbed between 15 and 25 students. Those two factors alone may
account for the 50 fewer pledges.
</P>
<P>
   The school had been expecting even more of a decline,
anticipating that 100 fewer students would choose to live in
fraternities, and had cleared space in graduate housing for those
students.
</P>
<P>
   MIT and the fraternities say they can't quantify how many more
pledges might have tried to live in the houses, or if interest
dropped off because of the Krueger death and other
nationally-publicized incidents last year.
</P>
<P>
   Krueger's fraternity was indicted Thursday on manslaughter
charges. Five other fraternities were sanctioned last year,
including the two forbidden from rushing students. Last years's
incidents prompted the institute to announce this summer that all
freshmen will have to live on campus beginning in 2001, when new
dorms are built.
</P>
<P>
   At other schools, freshmen often rush fraternities or sororities
in their first year but do not live in Greek houses until at least
their second year. But a dearth of residence halls on the MIT
campus, and more recently a tight housing market in Cambridge and
Boston, have made the Greek housing the residences of necessity for
even freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   The school had 21 fraternities before it built its first dorm.
Today it has 36 fraternities, sororities, and so-called independent
living groups, and 10 residence halls.
</P>
<P>
   At Sigma Phi Epsilon, students said Thursday they had signed up
about ten fewer pledges this year, down from about 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are several parents I talked to who were very nervous
about sending their son into a fraternity,'' said Jesse Davis, an
18-year old freshman from Castine, Maine. ``It's not that they
don't trust their kids, it's that they don't trust the
fraternities. They know the administration has cracked down, but
they don't believe we've changed. They all saw ``Animal House,''
where the administration cracked down and the fraternity didn't
care. In our case, it really has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, others said while concern was up, the number of pledges
didn't drop. One fraternity had 19 students vying for 12 beds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very nervous going into rush,'' said Michael Bonnet,
20, the rush director at Zeta Psi. ``There's been a big backlash;
everybody was making dire predictions that we'd get only half the
freshman who'd pledged before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freshman were a little more cautious shopping around,'' he
said. ``But a lot of them found they liked what they saw.''

 LUSAKA, Zambia: ragged clothes.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year a community group donated money for her school fees, a
school uniform and shoes. But Veronica will have to wait; there was
not enough money for her.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in this city, as the sun sets, casting shadows over
the modern government-sponsored high rises, entire families settle
in for the night on the sidewalks. Scattered among them are the
ragged street children, many of whom make money as prostitutes and
look for any means to get high.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at the Fountain of Hope, a nonprofit organization that
works with the street children, say the children have even found a
way of getting a powerful high from fermented human feces, a
substance known as jekem.
</P>
<P>
   In the daylight, many idle the hours away kicking a soccer ball
around outside the Fountain of Hope headquarters. The organization
is trying to offer them a special four-year education program that
will ready them for school exams. But the street children here are
like street children everywhere _ hardened and focused on immediate
survival.
</P>
<P>
   The stories the children tell of fear, rejection and loneliness
are numbingly similar. Simon Phiri, who is 14 but looks about 10,
can not even remember when his parents died. Slumped in a chair, he
peels the dirt from his palms as he talks sullenly about his short
life. For a while, he said, he stayed with his mother's best
friend. But after a while, he left.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were always insulting me,'' he said. ``They always ate
when I went out and never saved me anything. `'
</P>
<P>
   He said he has spent many nights sleeping in the aisles of the
local market place. But now he sleeps on the floor of a friend's
older brother's house. He must get his own food, though, and he has
no money for soap. He earns money doing odd jobs in the market, he
said. The counselors said that he has a sexually transmitted
disease. Nearly half the boys do.
</P>
<P>
   Simon has not been to school in at least four years, though he
hopes to be an accountant when he grows up. ``I would like to work
in an office,'' he said, suddenly brightening.
</P>
<P>
   Finding homes for the street children is not really a
possibility, say center employees. There are only a handful of very
small orphanages in Zambia, including the Kabwata Orphanage, where
Calvin and Jackson ended up after three days without food.
Eventually the police contacted Lorraine Miyanda, who runs the
place, and she bent the rules to admit the boys. Usually the
orphanage will not take children over the age of 10.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Miyanda said she has little hope that anyone will ever
take the boys into a new home. In many African countries there is
little tradition of taking in children who are not blood relatives
and formal adoption is extremely rare. Child advocates say that
this may be a particular problem in the future because of the way
AIDS tends to devastate whole families, particularly in villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The extended family in Africa is far better than in the West
about taking in relatives.,'' said Mark Louden, a South African who
is writing a book on AIDS orphans. ``There is no formality about
taking care of cousins. They slip right into saying `Mom.' In
Africa you have 30 Moms. The problem is that AIDS doesn't usually
take just one woman in a family; it tends to take all the wives of
the brothers because the brothers tend to behave similarly.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, dozens of fledgling organizations have
sprung up in Zambia to try to help the children. But there is
virtually no government money available and many of the
organizations are staffed only by volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that the government in unsympathetic,'' said Louis
Mwewa, the coordinator of Children in Need, an umbrella
organization that tried to represent the groups. ``But we are a
poor country and they do not have money.''
</P>
<P>
   In Matero, one of Lusaka's poorer neighborhoods, where small
houses with tin roofs stretch for miles, overwhelmed grandmothers
and households that are a collection of siblings living on their
own are easy to find. In one house, Brenda Tembo, 52, cares for 14
of her grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, no one in her household had eaten yet:
there was no food in the house. Mrs. Tembo was waiting for someone
to buy tomatoes from her vegetable stand before buying corn meal,
which would feed more of them for less. Five children in the
household should be in school, but there is no money for tuition.
</P>
<P>
   There is barely enough room for all the children to lie down on
the floor at night. The homemade plywood table and the three
rickety chairs must be put outside when it is bedtime. ``I am not
alone like this.'' she said, pointing across the dirt road at
another house. ``Right over there, it is the same.''
</P>
<P>
   While the grandmothers struggle with the burden of feeding and
clothing the children, some child advocates are more worried about
those who are growing up in the households run by siblings, where
chaos sometimes reigns.

 LUSAKA, Zambia: sometimes reigns.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like the Banda girls, the Zulu siblings survive on the rent they
receive from their parents' house in a neighborhood called Kuanda
Square. The seven children live in the back in a tumbledown
two-room structure. But recently the oldest boy got married and set
up his own household, leaving less money for the rest of the
children, who range in age from 19 to 11. The 19-year-old is known
in the neighborhood as a drinker who regularly beats the younger
ones.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit, there was no food in the dank-smelling house.
Shoes and dirty clothes were strewn about. With the 19-year-old
sitting silently nearby, no one complained of any difficulties. All
but the youngest appeared to have found some way of making money,
from working as a maid to selling sugar cane in the market. But
each keeps that money for himself or herself, the children said.
The 11-year-old appears to survive on the generosity of the others,
but it was clear they expected her to do most of the housework.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the laundry is difficult,'' the girl admitted,
twisting the hem of her skirt nervously.
</P>
<P>
   By 1991 the needs of the orphans in the Matero neighborhood had
become so apparent that some local women banded together to try to
help. They have registered 2,047 orphans in the neighborhood and
assigned someone to look in on each household and help solve
problems that crop up. To raise money for school fees, they make
doormats, bake bread, sew and batik fabrics. Six days a week, they
also give about 60 of the children a free meal, with the help of
the local Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year the group, called Kwasha Mukwena, has promised
to pay the school fees for 279 children _ fees that range from less
than $10 for the younger children to about $30 for the oldest. But
they have only raised the money to pay fees for 132.
</P>
<P>
   As the lunch hour drew near recently, orphans began arriving in
the carefully swept church yard. In the back, over an open fire,
the women had made a vegetable and peanut stew to be eaten with a
corn porridge. The children, in tattered clothing, were painfully
obedient. Some, as young as five, carefully carried full plates to
the room where even the toddlers ate without spilling a drop.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen children also carried plastic boxes _ a signal to the
workers that they were having a particularly hard time. Before
eating, these children put half their food in their boxes. Either
they knew they would get no supper and were saving for later, or
they had been told to bring food home for other children in the
household or face punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that people are so cruel,'' said Patricia Ngoma, who
volunteers with the program. ``But they have nothing themselves.''

CARDINAL DEFENDS CATHOLIC SILENCE ON HOLOCAUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD HIGGINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. _ As Clark University dedicated its
first-in-the-nation doctoral program in Holocaust studies Thursday,
Cardinal John J. O'Connor of New York City defended the wartime
silence of Pope Pius XII as ``not only justified but necessary to
save lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal spoke to reporters shortly before giving the main
address inaugurating Clark's program at its Center for Holocaust
Studies.
</P>
<P>
   During the ceremonies, other speakers criticized the ``silent
complicity'' of Christians in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, long an advocate of improved Catholic-Jewish
relations, said in response to a reporter's question that he was
``personally persuaded that the silence of Pius XII'' was the
wisest approach in the context of Nazi persecution, because it
``enabled him and others to save the greatest number of lives.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor also said that he favored the opening of the wartime
archives of the Vatican, which are scheduled to remain closed to
independent scholars for another 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Warning against the dangers of forgetting the Nazi crusade to
extinguish worldwide Jewry, Cardinal O'Connor and other speakers
praised Clark's initiative in creating the five-year doctoral
program in Holocaust studies. The center, which opened in 1996,
welcomed its first three doctoral students last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Holocaust is a defining, pivotal event in world history
and, therefore, should be part of the educational cannon,'' said
Clark's president, Richard Traina. He added that it would provide
an opportunity to study in depth ``humankind at its worst and its
best.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, serious study of the Holocaust has a permanent place in
academia,'' said Deborah Dwork, director of the center and one of
two full professors in the field at Clark. Dwork is working on
creating an undergraduate concentration in Holocaust studies.
</P>
<P>
   She said studying the Holocaust as an historical subject
separate from the broader field of Jewish studies would not, as
some critics have said, ``obscure the long and rich history of the
Jewish people.'' Nor, she said, can it be accepted as a definition
of Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to exploring the victims of the Holocaust, the
program will use history, sociology and psychology to study the
rescuers, perpetrators and silent bystanders of the Nazi's ``final
solution,'' which resulted in the deaths of more than six million
Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not remember the Holocaust?'' O'Connor asked rhetorically in
his remarks. ``The question is absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitler, he said, used the Holocaust to try to ``redefine and
destroy Judaism and Christiantiy, and its study is quite as
important for Christians as it is for Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, who heads the nation's third largest archdiocese, has
long been a champion of interfaith dialogue with Jews and strongly
backed the Vatican's establishment of formal ties with Israel in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor introduced Holocaust education programs into his
archdiocese, for which he received an award from Clark last year.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that he was making a ``shocking'' statement,
O'Connor compared the centrality and sacramentality of the
Holocaust in the Jewish psyche to the Christian belief in the
resurrection of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say to Jews, `Forget the Holocaust,' is to say to
Christians, `Forget the resurrection.' There is that much of a
sense of sacramentality about the subject for Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the Vatican archives, O'Connor said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I would like to see them open,'' he said, adding that the
fact that they remain closed is not unique and is due more to the
protective instincts and principles of archivists rather than an
effort to conceal alleged misbehavior.

EXECUTION-STYLE MURDERS SEEN LINKED TO DRUG CARTEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SAUZAL, Mexico _ Nineteen people, including two diapered
infants, were dragged from their beds and systematically killed
early Thursday morning in this Pacific coastal village in what
authorities suspect was an execution ordered by one of the nation's
biggest drug-smuggling cartels.
</P>
<P>
   The murders were carried out with such apparent order _ each
victim was individually shot, and the pajama-clad corpses were
stacked next to each other _ that the scene shocked even the most
experienced investigators, who have grown accustomed to deadly
fights over the area's growing narcotics trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears they rounded them all up, lined them up and gunned
them down,'' said Jose Ramon Espinoza, a judicial police officer
from the nearby town of Ensenada, a popular tourist resort just
over an hour's drive south from San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   If the narcotics connection is confirmed, the massacre would be
one of Mexico's worst crime-related killings _ and the latest
incident in a growing wave of drug-related violence along the
US-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general of Baja California state, Marco Antonio de
la Fuente Virrarreal, said the head of one of the households grew
marijuana for the Arellano Felix drug-smuggling gang, one of
Mexico's biggest drug cartels.
</P>
<P>
   He said the man, Fermin Castro, oversaw the Arellano Felix's
marijuana plantations nearby. Castro wasn't killed in the attack,
but was in very serious condition with a bullet wound to the head,
health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state and the country are in a state of consternation over
the killing of 19 people in El Sauzal,'' Baja California Gov.
Hector Teran Teran said Thursday. ``It appears to be related to
narco-trafficking because of the ties of Fermin Castro to the
Arellano-Felix organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor said authorities were looking for three automobiles
seen leaving the scene of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   At least one man was seriously wounded in the attack about 60
miles south of the California borner. Authorities have a witness in
protective custody, a 15-year-old girl who hid under a bed during
the slaughter, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the attack took place at 4:30 a.m. in El Sauzal, a
suburb of the resort town of Ensenada.
</P>
<P>
   The victims appeared to be asleep when the gunmen showed up;
most of the bodies were wearing pajamas _ or nothing at all _ and
the beds in at least one of the houses were unmade, as if sleeping
people had been pulled from them.
</P>
<P>
   Television images showed the victims lined up in a pool of blood
in front of a wall. A television reporter said one woman was
clutching a baby in her arms; both were dead.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the Red Cross in Ensenada, Eugenio Carrillo,
said the victims were the residents of three neighboring houses. He
said the dead included nine adults, two teen-agers, six children
and a baby.
</P>
<P>
   A 15-year-old girl hid under a bed and escaped notice by the
attackers, and police were questioning her about what she saw, a
judicial police officer said. He did not elaborate and the report
could not be confirmed independently.
</P>
<P>
   Children's toys littered the yard outside one house, according
to the television footage. The yard was filled with broken glass
and chairs were overturned on the porch, indicating a struggle.
Turkeys cackled in the yard.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of bullet casings surrounded the bodies, and the Televisa
television network said most were from a Kalashnikov assault
weapon, although some were from smaller-caliber weapons and
shotguns.
</P>
<P>
   A Mexico City criminologist, contacted by Baja authorities
shortly after the shooting, said that descriptions of the scene
bear signs of a drug-gang hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is because of the methodical nature of the incident,''
said the criminologist, who asked not to be identified. ``The
assailants took the time to drag 22 people out of bed, line them
up, and then shot them. And it's usually drug gangsters who can
afford these types of weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The criminologist also said there were several farm workers also
on the property in the pre-dawn hours, but none were among the
victims
</P>
<P>
   Ensenada Judicial Police officer Jose Ramon Espinoza said the
victims were members of three families: the Flores family and two
families that both had the last name Castro. It was unclear whether
the three families were related.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears they rounded them all up, lined them up and gunned
them down,'' Espinoza said. He said he had no information on
suspects or a possible motive.
</P>
<P>
   The drug gang led by the Arellano Felix brothers is based in
Tijuana, 60 miles to the north.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers, once known for the violence with which they
controlled their territory, had recently been settling into a
quieter, more businesslike style after making themselves famous for
shootouts in broad daylight.
</P>
<P>
   But Mexican authorities suspect the Arellano Felix brothers were
behind the slaying of a rival last week in Ciudad Juarez, just
across the border from El Paso, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Munoz Talavera, considered a front-runner to succeed
deceased Juarez cartel leader Amado Carrillo Fuentes, was found
shot to death in the back seat of an armored Jeep Cherokee.

HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ADJOURNS WITHOUT DECISION ON CLINTON
VIDEOTAPED TESTIMONY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Judiciary Committee members waged a fiercely
partisan battle Thursday over whether to release President
Clinton's videotaped testimony in the Monica Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   The panel of 21 Republicans and 16 Democrats met behind closed
doors through the day, but adjourned in the evening after 11 votes
without announcing a decision.
</P>
<P>
   The videotape was turned over to Congress by independent counsel
Kenneth Starr as a basis for possible impeachment proceedings
against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., acknowledged, however,
that the decision to release the tape and other Starr information
was all but made and the panel is now trying to decide just what
and how much to make public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to release as much of it as we can,'' he said. But
he said the committee is sifting through ``17 boxes'' of supporting
material supplied by Starr, a process that will continue today.
</P>
<P>
   Several committee members said they hope to act on a formal
motion authorizing the release by early afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the panel spent most the day fighting
tooth-and-nail to delay the release of the tape, which House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., had hoped to make available Friday.
But a spokesman for the committee said even if the committee does
wrap up its work Friday it may be several days before the
videotape, in which Clinton first admitted to having an improper
relationship with Lewinsky, is actually made public.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats lost on 11 attempts to keep the tapes from going
public and to limit disclosure of other materials.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bitter fighting inside the committee room, Hyde said
both sides managed to keep things ``civil.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're partisan, sure. We're all strongly partisan, but it's
been civil,'' he said. He said the delay in making a final decision
was the result of both sides trying to air their differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strong views strongly held are entitled to be heard,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the Democrats made sure they were heard,
beginning with a substitute motion offered by Reps. Sheila Jackson
Lee, of Texas, and Zoe Lofgren, of California, that would have
blocked the public release of any further Starr information.
Sources said that motion was defeated, however, with the vote
breaking down along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Lee declined to discuss the proceedings, noting that
members were bound to keep them secret even though they were
debating whether to make public more explicit details about
Clinton's sexual encounters with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But she did describe committee Democrats as determined to keep
as much as possible of the Starr materials out of the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're trying to pursue constitutional rights, you can't
be anything but persistent,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, she said that her position on the issue ``is that no
documents should be released.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican committee member Lamar Smith, of Texas, conceded that
there was a strong partisan split on the committee about what to
release. ``Everybody has strong opinions, but it's still civil,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith declined as well to discuss any specific details of the
committee deliberations. But other committee sources confirmed that
the panel spent much of the afternoon discussing how to edit out
some of the sexually explicit material in the Starr records, which
could be embarrassing to people. One committee source said the
panel worked from a staff report that broke down nearly every sex
act or salacious reference in the materials.
</P>
<P>
   Further souring the committee's executive session Thursday,
Republican leaders called on FBI Director Louis Freeh to open an
investigation into whether someone connected to the president tried
to undermine the panel's work by planting a story in an Internet
magazine about an extramarital affair Hyde had 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde acknowledged the affair, but the White House joined with
Democrats and Republicans in condemning the story, saying that it
has no relevance to the chairman's qualifications to lead an
inquiry into whether Clinton lied and tried to cover up his own
indiscretions with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., accused Hyde and other
Republicans of trying to further discredit Clinton by releasing
grand jury testimony that would be kept secret in any normal court
proceeding. He said GOP leaders were simply trying to build a
public relations case for impeachment against the president. Polls
show that many Americans are against Congress pursuing the matter
any further.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (videotape) wasn't made for sweeps week. It was made for
the purpose of informing grand jurors. This is a public relations
campaign for impeachment,'' Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to get impeachment without public sentiment.
So I think they've decide that the thing to do is batter the
president,'' he said. ``They have decided that discrediting the
president is the main goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers, the ranking Democrat on the committee, also
criticized Hyde for not consulting him about a request the chairman
made to Arkansas Judge Susan Webber Wright, seeking the release of
a videotaped deposition Clinton gave to lawyers in the Paula Jones
sexual harassment suit last January. In it he denied having any
sexual relations with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hope to use the president's deposition to support
Starr's claim that Clinton committed perjury in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Wright agreed to the request Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Hyde, Conyers questioned whether the deposition
could even be considered by the committee since it was not a part
of the report and other materials Starr submitted to Congress last
week. He also raised questions about the legality of the Hyde
request and the deposition itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have serious concerns regarding the propriety of your
seeking the release of a videotaped deposition in a private civil
case that has now been dismissed,'' Conyers said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Democratic committee member efforts to prevent
the release of the president's videotaped testimony to the public,
Clinton attorney David Kendall also tried to dissuade Republicans
from going ahead with it.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall issued a statement saying that Starr had refused a
request to destroy the tape made on Aug. 17, even though a
transcript of the president's testimony was also made at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only purpose of preserving this videotape after any absent
grand jurors viewed it was to ensure its public release and
embarrass the president,'' Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr responded by issuing a statement of his own, claiming that
federal law required him to keep the videotape and to turn it over
to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consistent with our legal and ethical obligations, we cannot
and will not destroy evidence of a crime,'' he said.

 (Attn.: N.Y.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was ``Animal House Night'' at the Phi Gamma Delta
fraternity in the Fenway and Scott S. Krueger, an MIT freshman who
had been in Boston just five weeks, stood in a line with other
pledges as he had been instructed to do by a fraternity brother,
according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
   There was a ``prescribed amount of alcohol'' that the pledges
had to drink.
</P>
<P>
   A ``pledge trainer'' provided beer and Jack Daniels whiskey. The
pledges drank the alcohol and they sang a Phi Gamma Delta drinking
song that included the refrain ``drink her down, drink her down,
drink her down, down, down.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Krueger's ``big brother,'' a current fraternity member
who was to help guide Krueger through his years at the fraternity
and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, gave him a gift _
a bottle of Bacardi spiced rum.
</P>
<P>
   Krueger, 18, joined in the drinking, became nauseated, and lay
down on a couch. Two fraternity brothers then carried him to his
room, put him on his stomach, placed a garbage can near his head _
and left him there. Ten minutes later, Krueger was covered with
vomit and unconscious. MIT police were called and then Boston
police and emergency medical technicians. Krueger was blue in the
face, his blood alcohol level was .401, and 40 hours later, he was
dead.
</P>
<P>
   That recounting of the final hours of Krueger's life was
contained in papers Suffolk District Attorney Ralph C. Martin 2d
filed Thursday in court after he announced his office indicted the
Phi Gamma Delta fraternity on one count of manslaughter and one
count of hazing for Krueger's death.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy M. Burke, the attorney for the ``pledge trainer,'' said
Thursday he disagreed with prosecutors' summary of Krueger's death.
``There was never any compulsion to drink a prescribed amount of
alcohol,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after Martin announced the indictment, Krueger's parents
angrily accused MIT of failing to take proper care of their son.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sent our son to MIT for five weeks and came down here and
picked him up in a box and took him back (home) in the back of a
station wagon,'' Krueger's mother, Darlene, said. ``We trusted MIT
with our son and they failed us miserably.''
</P>
<P>
   MIT has said it had little authority over what occurred in the
fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said it was the first time in the nation that a
fraternity _ instead of individuals _ was charged with manslaughter
for the hazing death of a pledge. None of the fraternity members
who purchased alcohol or provided it to Krueger were charged. Also
not charged were any officers of the Boston chapter of the
fraternity, or the alumni corporation that owns the fraternity
house in the Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a possibility the criminal charges will be ignored,
at least initially, by the fraternity. Martin is pushing the legal
envelope by charging an ``unincorporated association,'' lawyers
said, and attorneys for the fraternity may decide no one should
react to the criminal complaints. The Boston attorney who has
identified himself as Phi Gamma Delta lawyer in court papers,
Michael O'Malley, did not return telephone calls Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said his office considered charging the corporation that
runs MIT, but after reviewing the law, concluded that a judge would
throw it out.
</P>
<P>
   Krueger's parents and their attorney, Leo V. Boyle, met with
reporters after Martin's press conference. The Kruegers are
considering civil lawsuits against MIT, the fraternity, and
individuals involved in Krueger's death, Boyle said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kruegers said their goal was not to win money from MIT or
others involved, but to put parents, their children, and college
administrators on notice that alcohol kills. Krueger's father,
Robert, said he blames himself for his son's death because he did
not investigate how widespread alcohol use was at MIT _ and at Phi
Gamma Delta _ before his son joined the fraternity. The Kruegers
live in Orchard Park, N.Y., a Buffalo suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Darlene Krueger said she drove her son to Cambridge in the fall
of 1997 and that he had only two days to find a place to live. He
chose Phi Gamma Delta before she had ever seen it. She said she did
not know that it was in Boston, 28 minutes by foot from MIT's
Cambridge campus.
</P>
<P>
   The last time she saw her son, she said, was a week later when
she visited him at Phi Gamma Delta, which she described as a
``dive.'' Scott Krueger told her he was living in a basement room,
but would move in five weeks. He rushed off to a fraternity event.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 27, 1997, she was called by a nurse at Beth Israel
Deaconess Hospital and was told that her son was in the emergency
room.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle and the Kruegers broadly supported Martin's decision. A
corporation could be fined up to $1,000 on the manslaughter charge
and $3,000 for the hazing charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't put a value on my son's life,'' Darlene Krueger
said. ``But I think the fines should be greater.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyle said MIT should accept responsibility for Krueger's death
and should personally apologize to the Kruegers. ``This isn't
something MIT should feel good about,'' Boyle said.
</P>
<P>
   MIT has said it has no direct legal ties to Phi Gamma Delta and
that the problem of ``dangerous drinking'' is a nationwide one, not
limited to MIT. Ken Campbell, an MIT spokesman, declined to respond
directly to Boyle's assertion that the university has a significant
responsibility for Krueger's death.
</P>
<P>
   MIT is also moving to sever any ties it has to Phi Gamma Delta.
</P>
<P>
   Since Krueger's death, MIT's reaction has included ordering
freshmen to live in dormitories beginning in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, MIT Dean of Students Rosalind Williams said MIT
cooperated with Martin's investigation. ``The steps MIT has taken,
and will take, demonstrate our ongoing commitment to deal with this
national problem,'' she said.

CLINTON FINDS CASH FOR DEMOCRATS   AMID BOSTON PROTESTERS  
 PROTESTER GREET CLINTON IN BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ President Clinton, looking to shed the pall of
Washington for the familiar exuberance of a fall election campaign,
stormed through Boston Thursday night on a round of big-ticket
fund-raisers, but found himself confronted along city streets by an
outpouring of anger.
</P>
<P>
   A few supporters on Beacon Street, standing outside a
closed-door fund-raising reception attended by wealthy donors, held
signs declaring, ``We're with you,'' and ``Impeach Ken Starr.''
</P>
<P>
   But their numbers were dwarfed by protesters who chanted ``Time
to resign'' and ``Gore 98'' and thrust placards into the air with
such sayings as ``Monica, you're grounded; Bill, you're fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Thursday night, Clinton basked in the applause of more
than 600 supporters in the chandeliered ballroom of the Park Plaza
Hotel, where Senator Edward M. Kennedy declared in a fevered voice,
``This was Clinton country in '92, it was Clinton country in 1996,
it is Clinton country tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry, taking pains to separate his support for
Clinton's policy from his support for his personal actions, pointed
out that the battle was now over the ``heart and soul of the
Congress'' in the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, Washington sages believe the Clinton crisis may
cost Democrats 20 or more seats in the House of Representatives and
another four or five seats in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a time for Democrats anywhere in the country to be
faint of heart and to lose sight of what our battle is about,''
Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
   It was yet another day of political tumult for Clinton. As he
jetted from Washington to Cincinnati to Boston, the Judiciary
Committee huddled in private in an attempt to determine whether it
would release his videotaped testimony to the public. And at a
fund-raiser in Cincinnati, Clinton provided the most optimistic
view of of his marriage since he admitted his affair with Monica
Lewinsky exactly one month earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary and I, we're doing fine,'' Clinton said. ``We're
working on what we need to be working on, and we're fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Clinton: ``It is not about me. It is about the people about
this country.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Democratic officials said they were unbowed by the
protesters, and instead said that even in controversy and crisis,
Clinton had one of the most successful fund-raising nights of his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The three fund-raisers _ a cocktail party for $25,000
contributors, a reception for those who gave or raised $10,000, and
a $1,000 a plate dinner _ brought in over $1 million, and caps a
nearly $5 million fund-raising week for the party, in a striking
juxtaposition to Clinton's problems in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The $25,000 contributors gave so-called soft money, which is
unregulated by the federal government and which Democratic
lawmakers have proposed banning. The $1,000 contributors donated
``hard'' money, which can be used by various candidates around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton touched down at Logan Airport at 6:30 p.m. He descended
the stairs of Air Force One with Vice President Al Gore a step
behind, and was greeted by a small group of Winthrop Police
officers and the family of a local Secret Service agent.
</P>
<P>
   He immediately sped off to Beacon Hill, where approximately 40
big-ticket contributors and elected officials gathered at the
Beacon Street condominium of longtime Democratic patron John P.
Manning, president of Boston Captial, and his wife, Lyle Howland.
Senators Kennedy and Kerry were also inside, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   After just under an hour chatting with the group, Clinton led
his motorcade several blocks to the Park Plaza Hotel for the
reception, followed by dinner. The president planned to return to
Washington late Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   All told, Democratic Party officials said they would exceed
their $1 million goal for the Boston events, which came just three
days after Clinton raised well over $3 million in a whirlwind tour
through Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The money was to be split between the Democratic National
Committee, the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee and the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to aid candidates in
the November midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one I know of has canceled,'' said Steven Grossman,
chairman of the Democratic National Committee. ``Boston has come
through again and again and again. It is and continues to be one of
the best places to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Grossman said that fund-raising replies have actually risen as
the controversy worsens over Clinton's longtime affair with former
White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky and his subsequent denials.
The party, Grossman said, has made more than 35,000 telephone calls
recently to small donors and has seen a 5 percent rise in responses
over similar solicitation campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very good about the unwavering support that we've had
from our strongest supporters,'' said Grossman. ``People have said
they believe this is a defining moment for the party and they want
to be there to make sure the interests are protected.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are saying they want us to talk about things that
matter,'' Grossman said. ``They hate this report. They hate this
tape about to come out. The GOP is risking overplaying their
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not find such smooth waters throughout the day
Thursday. At a fund-raising event in Cincinnati, the Democratic
congressional challenger, Mayor Roxanne Qualls, declined a chance
to ride in Clinton's limousine from the airport to the fund-raising
event in her honor, and offered him words that were damning in
their modest praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is still the president,'' she told reporters.
``He's still the leader of the party. I will extend to him the
courtesy due his office.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Cincinnati Enquirer Thursday joined a
growing list of newspapers calling on Clinton to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, Clinton, trying to refocus attention away from
his travails, delivered a campaign-style speech to an auditorium
filled with cheering union loyalists supporting HMO overhaul and
opposing a Republican-backed tax cut. Time and again, Clinton
seemed to bask in the long rounds of applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the choice: partisanship over progress, people over
politics,'' Clinton said. ``In every issue facing the Congress and
the country, that is the choice and the people need to make their
voices heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton repeated his frequent call for any surplus funds to be
poured into Social Security reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make this a season of doing things for you, not
idleness and indulgence, but doing things for you,'' Clinton said
to the legislative convention of the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an election year and it's popular,'' Clinton said of the
tax-cut proposal. ``But it isn't right.''

CARDINAL DEFENDS CATHOLIC SILENCE ON HOLOCAUST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD HIGGINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. _ As Clark University dedicated its
first-in-the-nation doctoral program in Holocaust studies Thursday,
Cardinal John J. O'Connor of New York City defended the wartime
silence of Pope Pius XII as ``not only justified but necessary to
save lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal spoke to reporters shortly before giving the main
address inaugurating Clark's program at its Center for Holocaust
Studies.
</P>
<P>
   During the ceremonies, other speakers criticized the ``silent
complicity'' of Christians in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, long an advocate of improved Catholic-Jewish
relations, said in response to a reporter's question that he was
``personally persuaded that the silence of Pius XII'' was the
wisest approach in the context of Nazi persecution, because it
``enabled him and others to save the greatest number of lives.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor also said that he favored the opening of the wartime
archives of the Vatican, which are scheduled to remain closed to
independent scholars for another 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Warning against the dangers of forgetting the Nazi crusade to
extinguish worldwide Jewry, Cardinal O'Connor and other speakers
praised Clark's initiative in creating the five-year doctoral
program in Holocaust studies. The center, which opened in 1996,
welcomed its first three doctoral students last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Holocaust is a defining, pivotal event in world history
and, therefore, should be part of the educational cannon,'' said
Clark's president, Richard Traina. He added that it would provide
an opportunity to study in depth ``humankind at its worst and its
best.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, serious study of the Holocaust has a permanent place in
academia,'' said Deborah Dwork, director of the center and one of
two full professors in the field at Clark. Dwork is working on
creating an undergraduate concentration in Holocaust studies.
</P>
<P>
   She said studying the Holocaust as an historical subject
separate from the broader field of Jewish studies would not, as
some critics have said, ``obscure the long and rich history of the
Jewish people.'' Nor, she said, can it be accepted as a definition
of Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to exploring the victims of the Holocaust, the
program will use history, sociology and psychology to study the
rescuers, perpetrators and silent bystanders of the Nazi's ``final
solution,'' which resulted in the deaths of more than six million
Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not remember the Holocaust?'' O'Connor asked rhetorically in
his remarks. ``The question is absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitler, he said, used the Holocaust to try to ``redefine and
destroy Judaism and Christiantiy, and its study is quite as
important for Christians as it is for Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, who heads the nation's third largest archdiocese, has
long been a champion of interfaith dialogue with Jews and strongly
backed the Vatican's establishment of formal ties with Israel in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor introduced Holocaust education programs into his
archdiocese, for which he received an award from Clark last year.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that he was making a ``shocking'' statement,
O'Connor compared the centrality and sacramentality of the
Holocaust in the Jewish psyche to the Christian belief in the
resurrection of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say to Jews, `Forget the Holocaust,' is to say to
Christians, `Forget the resurrection.' There is that much of a
sense of sacramentality about the subject for Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the Vatican archives, O'Connor said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I would like to see them open,'' he said, adding that the
fact that they remain closed is not unique and is due more to the
protective instincts and principles of archivists rather than an
effort to conceal alleged misbehavior.

ARCA SERIES PROVIDES STEPPINGSTONE FOR DREAMERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Benny Parsons raced in the ARCA series. So
did Davey Allison, Alan Kulwicki, Tim Richmond, Ernie Irvan and
Jeremy Mayfield.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the names current Automobile Racing Club of America
drivers look to for inspiration. They are the drivers who made it
to the NASCAR Winston Cup, the pinnacle of the stock-car racing
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our series is designed to be a steppingstone to Winston Cup,
primarily,'' said Joe Walls, the competition director for the
series that races at Texas Motor Speedway tomorrow with the Z-MAX
250.
</P>
<P>
   However, the name that should be associated with the series is
perhaps Walter Mitty.
</P>
<P>
   ARCA is a series for dreamers, both those who dream of the big
time and those who simply dream of racing a stock car at a
superspeedway.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Gibson is one of the former. The 41-year-old driver has
raced in the series off and on since 1981. He was the rookie of the
year in 1986 and is second in the points this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to run Winston Cup next year, and I've been running
ARCA until the opportunity comes along,'' Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Burke is one of the latter. The 52-year-old driver from
Houston has an impressive resume in open-wheeled racing, but
yesterday morning's practice session was his first experience in a
stock car on a 1.5-mile oval.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's not so much a steppingstone as another goal
reached,'' he said. ``It is a very good goal to accomplish, to be
able to run in ARCA.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke's dream is on hold. He crashed his car in a practice
session yesterday, and it couldn't be repaired in time for
qualifying today.
</P>
<P>
   But at least he had the opportunity to try.
</P>
<P>
   The ARCA series consists of 23 races on tiny tracks in the
Midwest to superspeedways in Concord, N.C., Talladega, Ala.,
Hampton, Ga., and this year, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers include a handful of full-time racers intent on
taking it to the next level, and part-timers with jobs in the
``real'' world, racing for the love of it.
</P>
<P>
   The series has more than 150 registered drivers, including a
political lobbyist from Alabama, a race instructor from England, a
real estate agent from Florida, and one of Joe Frazier's former
sparring partners.
</P>
<P>
   They are the dreamers who simply want to race a stock car. Most
of them compete in fewer than five races a year.
</P>
<P>
   ARCA also has a core group of racers who run for the
championship and dream of moving up to a major NASCAR series.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't go jump into a Winston Cup car or a Busch car
without any seat time in a big track,'' Walls said.
</P>
<P>
   The budgets are smaller in ARCA, about $750,000 for the full
series compared to the $1.5 million or so to finance a Busch ride,
but the cars are virtually the same as in Winston Cup. The only
major difference is a rear spoiler that's 11/2 inches larger.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there is another major difference. A Winston Cup field
consists of nothing but some of the best drivers in the world. An
ARCA field ranges from experienced racers like Gibson to rookies.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Burke, the Z-MAX 250 has four drivers in an ARCA
race for the first time. To earn the opportunity to qualify,
drivers had to have experience in another type of racing or compete
in a three-day course at a racing school, and take a few laps
around the track to prove to ARCA officials they can handle the
car.
</P>
<P>
   However, a lack of experience doesn't necessarily mean a lack of
talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's got to start somewhere,'' Gibson said. ``As long
as you use your head, and as long as they come and ask questions, I
don't have a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Why should he? He might have thousands of laps more experience
than some of his fellow competitors, but all the ARCA racers have
something in common.
</P>
<P>
   They are all dreamers.

HOUSE VOTES SMALL FRACTION OF MONEY SOUGHT FOR IMF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Wis.)   (af)  
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Thursday night approved only a fraction
of the nearly $18 billion that President Clinton is seeking for the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The action, which prompted a presidential veto threat, left the
agency in limbo as the IMF's reserves dwindle and economic crises
spread.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has approved the full amount, and there is still a
chance that when both houses meet in the next few weeks to iron out
their differences on this and other issues, they will agree to
provide the Clinton administration's full request.
</P>
<P>
   But even if they do, the lending agency's financing is tied up
with other contentious matters, such as restrictions on
international family planning, that have also drawn veto threats.
So, full funds are by no means certain.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the House say they have doubts about the IMF's internal
integrity and the use of U.S. taxpayer money for what they say are
risky overseas investments the agency makes without proper
accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders had blocked the House from considering the
$17.9 billion requested as it took up a $12.5 billion bill that
finances many of the nation's overseas assistance programs.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP leaders wrote rules to include only $3.4 billion for the
agency, procedurally blocking an attempt by Democrats to provide
the additional $14.5 billion sought by the president.
</P>
<P>
   The overall foreign operations bill provides economic assistance
for international groups such as the World Bank and the
Export-Import Bank, aid to former Soviet republics and money for
the Peace Corps.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation includes language barring U.S. assistance to
foreign groups that perform abortions or violate abortion laws of
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   There was no separate vote on the agency financing, but the
overall bill passed Thursday night, 255-161.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who is leading the opposition, said
that the bill, which provides $316 million less than this year's
levels, reduced the president's flexibility and, in terms of vision
and money, failed to fulfill the nation's role as a global power.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gerald B.H. Solomon, R-N.Y., speaking of the IMF
legislation, said the public resents giving money to countries like
Russia that are bad investments, where the money will ``go in the
front door and out the back door.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguing for the full amount, Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., said:
``How long do people in this House think we can survive as an
island of economic success in a world of economic chaos? The answer
is, not very long.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration said in a statement that failure to provide
the full amount would undermine the United States' global
leadership and expose workers, businesses and farmers to
unacceptable economic risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president would veto the bill if it were presented to him
in its current form,'' said the statement, a carefully calibrated
phrasing that carries less weight than a quotation from the
president himself but is more forceful than the more typical
statement, which couches such threats as recommendations by
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   The veto threat is only the latest of several issued by the
administration on 13 spending bills now moving through Congress.
The bills are supposed to be passed and signed by Oct. 1, the start
of the new fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House and the Senate bought themselves some extra time
Thursday, voting to finance all government programs at the current
year's levels through Oct. 9. The action puts off Congress' annual
confrontation with the White House for nine days.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the daylong debate in the House, members argued most heatedly
over whether to repeal a ban on all U.S. assistance to the former
Soviet republic of Azerbaijan. The administration wanted Congress
to lift the ban, saying it had hindered U.S. negotiators in
appearing neutral in the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, who prevailed, argued that lifting the ban would
reward a corrupt regime that has engaged in ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   Most strenuous in favor of the repeal was Rep. Bob Livingston,
R-La., and chairman of the appropriations committee. Some members
suggested that Livingston seemed to be carrying the banner for U.S.
oil companies, which are seeking a share in a hugely lucrative
pipeline through the Caspian Sea region _ and are also a vital
force in Livingston's New Orleans district.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston conceded during the debate that oil companies
``might'' benefit from lifting the ban, but, he said, so would the
industrialized Western world.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., and the minority whip, declared,
``The big oil lobby has dollar signs in its eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 231 to 182 to keep the ban in place. The measure
is not part of the Senate's foreign operations bill, and its fate
in the eventual House-Senate conference is uncertain.

AN ODD FIT, MAYBE, BUT ALLEN FIGHTS HIS WAY THROUGH ON CBS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Marcus Allen's up-and-over leap into your living
room as part of CBS' ``NFL Today'' show wasn't like one of those
plays he made during his Hall of Fame career.
</P>
<P>
   But at a time when many well-spoken and good-looking retired
pros sprint toward a TV career as a way to avoid the real life of
post-NFL stardom, Allen's decision to vault to the visual medium
rather than curl up and hibernate caught some by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   As an L.A. Raider, he'd be accessible to reporters, all right.
But this was no walking sound bite like a Todd Christensen, Howie
Long or Bob Golic, who you knew would head straight for the
camera's red light when it was time to quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd talk all the time (to reporters), I just felt not every
question deserved an answer,'' Allen said. ``Just because people
ask you a question, doesn't mean you have to volunteer information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought there was plenty of intrigue chatting with
me. I chose to be engaging when I wanted to be engaging. I was
always very loquacious when I wanted to be. I just choose to be
what I wanted to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the first two weeks, Allen has provided what little
spark has come flickering from the Jim Nantz-conducted CBS sunrise
service that includes the demure George Seifert and the erratic
Brent Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Allen isn't as demonstrative as a Terry Bradshaw, but he's
always been the kind of person to say something that means
something. You have the remote. Turn up the volume if you can't
hear it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone I talked to said just be yourself,'' Allen said about
advice he received from former teammates like Joe Montana and
Ronnie Lott. ``If you try to be someone else, everyone can see
through that.''
</P>
<P>
   So what kind of person is Allen?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a ham,'' he said. ``Anyone who knows me knows that I am. A
lot of you guys (in the media) may not have known that before, but
that was my choice. There's always a delicate balance between
public and private life. As an athlete, you find your balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen knows how to work within the media. He did the TV work
twice as an active player, once as a Fox analyst on a Detroit-Green
Bay regional game during a Chiefs bye week in '94, then working in
the ABC studio with Robin Roberts and Dave Wannstedt during the '95
wild-card playoffs a week prior to the Chiefs-Colts playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   Allen knows how to make the media work for him. It was that
Monday night game in 1992 when Allen agreed to sit down with Al
Michaels for a taped interview and get everything off his chest
about Al Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Allen also knows how the media can be relentless and
overbearing. For the first three years of his career in Kansas
City, he became caught in the swirl of the O.J. Simpson controversy
because of Allen's personal relationship with those involved in the
criminal and civil trial. Allen had to hide out from tabloid
journalists and was told by attorneys representing Simpson not to
even say ``no comment'' when harangued by reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``That period in my life didn't deter me in any way at all (from
getting into TV work),'' said Allen. ``When I was a kid, I used to
watch all the pregame shows and I wanted to do it then. This wasn't
an overnight decision.''
</P>
<P>
   KCBS Channel 2 anchor Jim Hill backs that up.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of athletes wait until the end of their career and think
about getting into this, but Marcus has always thought ahead,''
said Hill, who even had Allen work as an ``intern'' for him in the
offseason during his Raiders career. Allen counts Hill as one of
his closest friends in the business. Hill, after all, was one who
made broadcasting a post-NFL career move himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's also one of the most unassuming superstars I've ever
met,'' Hill said. ``He knows who he is and doesn't push it off on
anyone. We've talked a lot about broadcasting and our positions and
our place in life. He knows who he is and doesn't get caught up in
a lot of other stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that stuff _ like the Allen vs. Davis episode _ doesn't
enter Allen's mind anymore unless someone else brings it up. But
don't be surprised if Allen comes up with something positive to say
about Davis down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only natural some assume that now I have a platform, I'm
going to use it (against Davis),'' Allen said Thursday morning,
driving from his Kansas City home to the airport to jet into New
York for this weekend's work that will include analysis on the
Oakland-Denver and San Diego-Kansas City games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that over time, I've lost any sense of vengeance. I'm
so far beyond that I can be critical and praising. There's complete
objectivity there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some may want you to slam other people, and maybe that's part
of today's climate, but you don't have to be a slave to it.
Actually, I think there's a lot of integrity surrounding the whole
(CBS) show. We'll be more entertaining as we become more settled.
But right now, we're just trying to figure out the logistics.''

   WHAT SMOKES
</P>
<P>
   -- ESPN has milked at least five more telecasts down the stretch
that include live action from the Mark McGwire-Sammy Sosa
swat-a-thon. Those games include Sunday (11 a.m.
Cincinnati-Chicago), Tuesday (5 p.m., Chicago-Milwaukee and/or
Houston-St. Louis) and Wednesday (5 p.m. and 7:30 p.m.
doubleheaders TBD) as well as games next Friday and Sunday. Fox
offers up the Giants-Dodgers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   -- In celebration of the 25th anniversary of Billie Jean King's
tennis triumph over Bobby Riggs, ESPN Classic has a 90-minute
special with !racepay!Dick Schaap!off! Sunday at 6 p.m., while the
Lifetime Channel has its angle on ``Breaking Through'' with Maura
Driscoll on Monday at 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT CHOKES
</P>
<P>
   -- If you feel the need to pay $49.95 to see Oscar De La Hoya
hand another loss to former boxer Julio Cesar Chavez, God bless
you. Especially if they throw in a promotional oil change with the
deal. Why not just wait a few days and it'll be on HBO, OK?
</P>
<P>
   -- On the East Coast, Fox's ``Ally McBeal'' season premier had a
better overall rating (8.3) for adults 18-49 going head-to-head
with the San Francisco-Washington game on ``Monday Night Football''
(8.1) from 9-to-10 p.m. OK, so at that point, the 49ers already had
the Redskins whupped pretty good. But when has ``MNF'' ever lost to
anyone in the ratings?

BURTON SEEKS VOTE ON CONTEMPT RESOLUTION AGAINST RENO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chairman of a House investigation committee
said Thursday that he was seeking a vote of the full House on a
contempt of Congress resolution against Attorney General Janet
Reno, escalating a bitter dispute over the appointment of an
independent prosecutor to examine possible campaign finance abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the House Government Reform
and Oversight Committee, said he had discussed the vote with
Speaker Newt Gingrich after a breakdown in negotiations with Reno
over allowing lawmakers on his panel to read two confidential
reports urging her to seek an independent counsel to investigate
possible improprieties in President Clinton's 1996 re-election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that the attorney general believes the president is
above the law,'' Burton said after discussions collapsed. He
apparently was referring to Reno's repeated refusals to refer
campaign finance issues to an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear when a contempt vote would be scheduled, with
lawmakers distracted by the furor over possible impeachment
proceedings against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Saying she was disappointed, Reno insisted she had tried to
comply with the subpoena for the documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This summer, in response to oversight requests, we have made
some of the most extraordinary accommodations in American law
enforcement history,'' Reno said. ``We briefed members of Congress
on a pending investigation, and we have allowed them to review
portions of sensitive law enforcement documents regarding that
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday, Burton suggested that he might
take the issue a step further, by turning over information
uncovered in his committee's campaign finance investigation to Rep.
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee that
is weighing impeachment proceedings against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Burton appeared to be referring to what Republicans viewed as
White House intransigence in responding to the panel's request for
documents, including legal challenges. Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr said in his report to the House that he found a similar
pattern in his investigation of Clinton's relationship with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The contempt citation involves two reports, one written last
fall by FBI Director Louis Freeh and another sent to Reno in late
July by Charles La Bella. La Bella is the former head of the
Justice Department unit responsible for investigating possible
illegalities arising from the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Both reports said that evidence compiled during the Justice
Department's investigation of campaign finance issues justified the
appointment of an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   After negotiations between the Justice Department and the
lawmakers, Burton and a few other senior lawmakers in the House and
Senate were permitted to read edited copies of the reports this
month. But Thursday, discussions that would have allowed other
lawmakers on Burton's panel to review the copies broke down.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Reno has said she would not allow all members of
Burton's committee to review the documents, congressional and
Justice Department officials said. Burton then proposed that six
lawmakers be allowed to view the material. Reno agreed, but only if
the committee agreed in advance to withdraw its subpoena for the
documents and drop the contempt resolution. Burton refused.
</P>
<P>
   The committee voted Aug. 6 to cite Reno for contempt. But before
the measure can be approved, it must be voted on by the full House.
</P>
<P>
   Although Reno has refused repeated demands by Republicans to ask
for the appointment of an independent counsel, she has, in recent
weeks, ordered 90-day inquiries into three campaign finance
accusations involving Clinton's re-election that could lead to an
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   One of the inquiries centers on whether Clinton and White House
aides coordinated a Democratic advertising campaign, for what are
known as issue advertisements, in an effort to violate federal
spending limits that he agreed to when he accepted taxpayer
financing of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A second inquiry focuses on Vice President Al Gore's statements
about his telephone fund-raising calls from the White House, and
the third centers on possible perjury by former deputy White House
chief of staff Harold Ickes concerning his dealings with the
Teamsters union.

TWO KURD GROUPS UNITE AGAINST BAGHDAD IN PACT BROKERED BY U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The State Department announced Thursday that it had
brokered a settlement between two feuding factions of the Iraqi
Kurds, uniting them against the government of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The move by the United States to reunite the factions
underscores how few options remain for the Clinton administration
in trying to organize an opposition to Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago one of the faction leaders, Massoud Barzani, was
seen as a traitor by the administration, after he had betrayed the
CIA in its covert program against the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
   The accord was announced Thursday by Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright after meetings here between Barzani, leader of
the Kurdish Democratic Party, and the man once considered his
rival, Jalal Talibani of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their joint meetings this week have opened a new and hopeful
chapter in their efforts to work together on behalf of their
people,'' Albright said. ``Without unity, the road ahead will
remain very difficult. With unity, there is every reason for the
Iraqi Kurds to look forward with hope.''
</P>
<P>
   The factions have set up a timetable to resolve their remaining
differences, through a power-sharing arrangement or through
elections.
</P>
<P>
   In its efforts to try to organize an opposition to topple
Saddam, the United States is compelled to work with Iraqi minority
groups, the Kurds of northern Iraq or the Shiite Muslims in the
south.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Persian Gulf war in 1991 the United States
began a covert-action program that sought to unite Barzani and
Talibani under the umbrella of a CIA-backed organization, the Iraqi
National Congress. Both Kurdish leaders were on the CIA payroll.
</P>
<P>
   But in August 1996, Barzani was having one of his periodic
battles with Talibani, who was then backed by the Iranian military,
and invited the Iraqi army to move north in his territory to
counter Iranian support for his rival. As a result the Iraqi army
shattered what was left of the CIA presence in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his betrayal of the United States the administration has
decided that it cannot give up on Barzani, because his deal with
the Iraqis had turned him into the dominant Kurdish leader.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In recent months the principal deputy assistant secretary of
state for Near Eastern affairs, David Welch, has met both leaders
to try to mediate peace talks, and he led the negotiations in
Washington this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose for us is not only to help the Kurdish people, but
to reinforce our Iraq policy, which would benefit from containment
of Saddam from the north,'' said a senior administration official
who insisted on anonymity. ``We've been involved in a painstaking
effort to try to move them to understand that if they are united
they are less vulnerable to outside pressures. We've tried to prove
to them that their interests lie with us, not with Baghdad or
Tehran.''

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
UPON joining the Astros, Randy Johnson shot down suggestions he was
the missing piece to the team's postseason puzzle, the long-awaited
answer in the club's journey to baseball's promised land.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And, no, he couldn't walk on water.
</P>
<P>
   Seven weeks later, his teammates aren't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   A case can be made that the Astros were a first-place team
before Johnson ever brought his 97-mph fastball to the Lone Star
State. The Astros were already 21 games over .500 when he arrived
from the Seattle Mariners on July 31 in arguably the biggest trade
in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the 6-10 lefthander is 8-1, two of those victories
coming against the Pittsburgh Pirates, whom Johnson will face in
the opener of a three-game series tonight at Three Rivers Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   He threw consecutive shutouts in his first four starts at the
Astrodome. His ERA since leaving the American League is 1.16.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was already an outstanding ballclub; all he did was take
us to another level,'' hitting instructor Tom McCraw said. ``He
puts us on equal footing with some of the other elite clubs in the
league. He solidifies us. They know it; we know it.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be the biggest difference between the pre-Johnson days
and now for the National League's Central Division champions.
</P>
<P>
   For a franchise that has not won a playoff series in 37 years of
existence, the bar has been raised this time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a guy now who can shut you out on any given day,''
pitcher Mike Hampton said. ``When he's on, you're not going to be
able to do anything against him. When you think someone might have
to face him three times in the postseason he's definitely an impact
player.''
</P>
<P>
   The excitement of the last-minute trade to acquire Johnson
triggered a seven-game winning streak and a revival of the starting
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros won 31 of their first 40 games after the deal and are
32-13 since July 31, the best record in the major leagues in that
span. They reached a club-record 43 games over .500 (96-53 on
Saturday) and are on pace to win 100 games for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere has the ``Johnson Factor'' had more of an impact than
the starting rotation. In the first four months of the season, the
starting five _ Shane Reynolds, Hampton, Jose Lima, Sean Bergman
and Pete Schourek _ combined to go 46-29 with a 3.76 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the results have been phenomenal. Reynolds and Lima
are 6-1 since the Johnson trade. Hampton, plagued by a lack of
support, is 3-1. Overall, the starters (including Johnson) are 25-8
with a 2.98 ERA over the last seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain players that have the ability, not only to
improve a ballclub but to really help everyone around them take
their game to another level, and I think Randy is one of those
people,'' general manager Gerry Hunsicker said. ``We're fortunate
to have three or four others like that on our team as well, but
Randy certainly is one of those special people that makes everyone
around him better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when you're dealing with an All-Star-caliber player
like Randy Johnson, he makes the whole team better for a number of
reasons. He makes the pitching staff better because he instills
confidence in them and challenges them to improve on their current
performance. He makes the position players better because he gives
them the confidence that they don't have to go out and score five
or six runs when he's pitching to win a ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just makes everybody feel better about themselves and the
ability of the team to win.''
</P>
<P>
   But is Johnson the reason?
</P>
<P>
   ``This team was in first place before I even got here,'' Johnson
said. ``To think I'm going to take them to the promised land is not
fair to me. It's going to take 24 other guys; it's not going to
take one guy. I'm not the missing part to the puzzle. I can only go
out and pitch once every five days.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Astros began the season, the organization freely
admitted it lacked a dominant, intimidating No. 1 starter to
complement one of the best offenses in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has Greg Maddux. Toronto has Roger Clemens. Boston has
Pedro Martinez. San Diego has Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   And now, the Astros have Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   All agree that even without Johnson, the Astros still would have
won the Central. But without him, a deep venture into the playoffs
seemed unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a pretty good team. We believed we had a good team, but
we just thought we were still kind of missing that one little
piece,'' second baseman Craig Biggio said. ``We have a lot of good
pitchers on our team, but we really didn't have that one main horse
like a Maddux-type guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now all of a sudden you have that kind of guy, somebody to
match up head-to-head with. He's been huge.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are 24-3 in series in which Johnson pitches. Three of
his victories have come after Astros losses. And when he doesn't
receive much support, one run can be enough.
</P>
<P>
   On Labor Day against Cincinnati, Johnson allowed a leadoff
eighth-inning double and let the runner advance to third on a wild
throw. He then got the next three hitters swinging, and the Astros
went on to win 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``The margin of error is slim. You'd better execute every chance
you've got because there won't be a lot of scoring,'' McCraw said
of facing Johnson. ``You'd better get the bunt down to get the man
over, better get a good pitch to get him (the runner) in.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to do all those little things to get that one run
because you know there's not going to be five runs scored in the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   While Johnson can dictate a game _ he holds the top four
strikeout performances by an Astros pitcher this season, including
a season-high 16 against the Pirates on Aug. 28 _ knowing he will
hold the opposition has taken some pressure off his own hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the psychological lift. We may not score six runs every
game. It's nice to win a ballgame when you're not hitting,'' McCraw
said. ``We have an outstanding offensive unit, and we're going to
score our runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, we're not going to hit every day. There lies the
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Johnson's coming will be the difference in the playoffs
remains to be seen. The Pirates already are believers. Johnson is
2-0 with 28 strikeouts in 16 innings against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear so much about him,'' Pittsburgh shortstop Kevin
Polcovich said, ``and then you face him and realize he really is as
good as everyone says he is.''

FRANCE BLOCKS COKE'S BID FOR ORANGINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: This story has been added to the business front page).  
 (af)  
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Co.'s plan to take control of a leading French soft
drink brand was blocked Thursday after the French government
rejected the acquisition, saying it would hurt consumers and give
Coke too much dominance in the French market.
</P>
<P>
   Coke had announced the $840 million acquisition of the French
brand Orangina, a unit of Pernod-Ricard SA, in late December, and
highlighted it in its annual report. The deal was one of the first
major moves by M. Douglas Ivester, who became chief executive of
Coca-Cola in October.
</P>
<P>
   Orangina is the No. 2 soft drink in France, behind Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Pepsico Inc. filed an objection to the takeover
with the French government, contending that it would stifle
competition. Pepsi said that Orangina distributed Pepsi products to
many restaurants and other businesses in France and added that it
had been interested in buying the brand itself.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Coca-Cola, Randal Donaldson, said Thursday:
``We're disappointed with the government's initial decision.
However, the government had indicated there is an open door for
further consideration of undertakings. We will continue to evaluate
our options.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Thursday whether Coke, which had been under
pressure from the French government to guarantee jobs and make
other concessions to win approval, would pursue the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Orangina workers had objected to the takeover, fearing they
would lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   A Pepsi-Cola spokesman, Brad Shaw, said: ``We're obviously very
pleased. This will send a signal around the world that France has
solid, well-defined rules enforcing open competition and is
prepared to enforce those rules.''
</P>
<P>
   But others seemed surprised by the ruling. ``What it shows is
that the competition and protectiveness between Coke and Pepsi is
at a high level and manifested not just in stores but in courts and
government tribunals,'' said John Sicher, the publisher of Beverage
Digest, an industry publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``The French government's action was partly based on Pepsi's
complaint,'' he added. ``This will further embitter the companies
toward each other and intensify the competitive environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Conway, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said:
``I don't see it as a major issue affecting the direction of the
company. It's a disappointment because it had a high share in
France, and expectations were that this brand could be acquired.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Swanson, an analyst at A.G. Edwards, said, ``It's an
opportunity lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The rejection of the Orangina bid comes at a time when Coca-Cola
has seen its share price plummet by nearly a third. It closed at
$60.8125 Thursday, a 52-week low, falling from its high of $87.9375
on July 14. About 75 percent of Coca-Cola's profits come from its
international sales, which have been hurt by financial crises
abroad.

PRESIDENT'S ADVISORY BOARD ON RACE PRODUCES MODEST REPORT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 2nd graf for re-editing; subs for new 9th and 13th grafs, and
subs 20th graf to insert date of Clinton speech)  sw) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After 15 months of work, President Clinton's
advisory board on race relations has produced a modest report whose
chief recommendation is the creation of a permanent presidential
council on race.
</P>
<P>
   The voluminous report breaks little new ground. Indeed, much of
it is a compilation of observations and recommendations that the
board made to Clinton earlier, as the members went about their
work. While it is filled with policy suggestions on education,
affirmative action, health, the criminal justice system and
immigration, it underscores these four recommendations as major:
</P>
<P>
   _ Creation of a permanent body, which would be known as the
President's Council for One America, to promote harmony and
dialogue among the nation's racial and ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   _ The government's development of an education program to keep
the public informed about race in America.
</P>
<P>
   _ A presidential ``call to arms'' to leaders of government and
the private sector to ``make racial reconciliation a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Engagement of youth leaders in an effort to build bridges
among the races.
</P>
<P>
   A number of scholars and civil rights advocates said the board
had squandered an opportunity to make a bold contribution to
stimulating an informed discussion of race that moved beyond the
familiar positions of liberals and conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those sound like a list of platitudes,'' Randall Kennedy, a
Harvard Law School professor, said of the board's main
recommendations. ``My goodness, there is nothing substantive there.
It's not like I'm searching for a fight, but that's not exactly
giving people direction. Talk about lowest common denominator!''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Kennedy noted, the board called for the Justice
Department to consider restricting the use of racial profiling by
federal law-enforcement agencies and urging local police
departments to do the same. Kennedy, who opposes racial profiling _
the use of race as a factor in determining the profiles of likely
criminal suspects _ said that if the board felt as he did, then it
should have called for the practice to be outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is to receive the report at the board's final meeting,
on Friday. White House officials said he would incorporate some of
its recommendations in a larger report on race and ethnicity that
he will issue by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The current report brings the final chapter in the troubled
history of the seven-member board, which was headed by the noted
black historian John Hope Franklin. Almost from its inception, in
June 1997, the body, formally the Advisory Board to the President's
Initiative on Race, was plagued by a lack of organization, a
youthful staff with few policy experts, a lack of political
experience and continued interference by White House officials who
feared the political consequences of its work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is timidity on this question,'' said a Republican member
of the board, Thomas Kean, former governor of New Jersey. ``Race is
very divisive. As the year wore on, people became _ not the board,
but people in the Administration _ became concerned. We were not
encouraged to be bold. My recommendations were much bolder than
anything contained in this report.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Kean said, he would have challenged the news and
entertainment industries to put an end to the perpetuation of
racial stereotyping.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem the board faced was that with public attention
diverted by the Lewinsky episode, it was hamstrung in efforts to
stimulate a nationwide dialogue on race, one of its major goals.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin, the board's chairman, did not respond to a request on
Thursday for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   But Judith Winston, the executive director, said the board had
been able to achieve a measure of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done what the president asked us to do this initial
year,'' she said. ``Certainly the advisory board has carried out
its mandate.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Winston and White House officials said the board had never
been expected to be an independent body like the Kerner Commission,
which investigated the nation's racial climate after the urban
riots of the late 1960's and produced bold policy pronouncements.
Instead, the panel was to serve as Clinton's ``eyes and ears,''
gathering information that would help him develop his later report
on race.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't want to create a commission that sort of went off
and did things independently and on its own,'' said one White House
official, who would speak only on the condition of anonymity. But
with expectations raised by Clinton himself when he began his race
relations initiative with a speech at the University of California
at San Diego in June 1997, there was a palpable sense of
disappointment in the board's work among civil rights advocates and
those who study the country's racial climate.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its main recommendations, the board's report did make
other suggestions, many of which the panel had made before in
letters to the president. It urged tighter enforcement of the
nation's civil rights laws, an end to sentencing disparities for
crimes involving crack on one hand and powder cocaine on the other,
greater spending on teacher training and school construction in
minority areas, and efforts to end income inequality.
</P>
<P>
   It also reaffirmed its support for race- and sex-based
affirmative action, declaring that ``for far too many minorities, a
level playing field remains a mirage.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the board ducked making any recommendations on many other
highly contentious issues that surround race, like busing to
achieve school integration, the construction of scatter site public
housing and the use of school vouchers to allow poor children to
attend private schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not able, in the short amount of time we had and the
format we were working in, to cover the horizon,'' said one board
member, Angela Oh, a Los Angeles lawyer.

 &HT;    WASHINGTON 'TOO OBSESSED WITH ITSELF,' CLINTON SAYS
 &HT;    800&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Amid a rising roar of public protest, President Clinton
tended to his Democratic base Thursday, deriding the political
culture of the capital as ''too obsessed with itself'' to address
the nation's business.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wooed hundreds of supporters at the Park Plaza Hotel
after being introduced by the biggest names in Massachusetts
Democratic politics, Sens. Edward M. Kennedy and John F. Kerry.
</P>
<P>
   Also addressing the Democratic Party dinner, Vice President Al
Gore called Clinton ``the best thing we have going for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in Cincinnati, the president sought to portray the
impeachment fever gripping Washington as out of touch with the
concerns of mainstream America.
</P>
<P>
   ''Washington always thinks everything's about Washington,''
Clinton told an elite group of supporters in Cincinnati who donated
$10,000 per couple to have lunch with the president in the home of
a prominent attorney. ''It's not about Washington, it's about
America.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the coming election, ''It is not about me,'' Clinton
said. ''It is about the people of this country, it is about their
children, their future and our common efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   In both cities, the scandal inspired public protests on a scale
not seen for many years.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, scores of people lined Arlington Street near the site
of Clinton's fund-raiser, brandishing placards supporting and
opposing the president.
</P>
<P>
   Some read ``Scum'' and ``Impeach Clinton Now,'' while another
read ``Don't be a sucker for Ken (porno) Starr _ save the
presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Across from the Bull and Finch Pub on Beacon Street, the model
for the bar in the TV series ``Cheers,'' dozens of people waved
signs and chanted ``Gore in '98'' and ``Hey hey, ho ho, Clinton's
got to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the protesters, Raymond Ahrens, a 49-year-old real estate
developer, held a handmade sign reading ``America cares about
you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a political situation,'' Ahrens said. ``They're trying
to reverse two elections. They're trying to take away our future.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Walter Kane, 38, who said he was a Persian Gulf war
veteran and a lifelong Democrat, said Clinton should resign.
``Nixon had that much decency,'' said Kane.
</P>
<P>
   In Cincinnati, a crowd of protestors included dozens of people
who said Clinton's behavior infuriated them so much they came to
shout their outrage in public for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Their signs were blunt:
</P>
<P>
   ``Resign''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton is unfit for any public office''
</P>
<P>
   ``Adulterers end up in Hell.''
</P>
<P>
   As the president urged supporters to look beyond his personal
troubles to the policy issues affecting the nation's future, House
Republicans were preparing to release a videotape of Clinton's Aug.
17 grand jury testimony about his affair with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   With the House Judiciary Committee debating the issue, Clinton's
personal attorney, David Kendall, released a statement in
Washington criticizing Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr for
refusing to destroy the videotape and accusing Starr of
deliberately trying to ''embarrass the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall said that he asked Starr before Clinton testified to
destroy the videotape after it was viewed by any grand jurors who
might have missed the president's actual testimony, which was
beamed live, via closed circuit television, from the White House
Map Room, where Clinton testified, to the grand jury room at the
U.S. Courthouse several blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   ''I asked the OIC (office of independent counsel) to agree to
discard the videotape after showing it to any grand jurors who
missed the testimony,'' Kendall said in a written statement. ''The
OIC refused to do so,'' Kendall added, even though a full
stenographic transcript of the testimony also was available.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only purpose of preserving this videotape after any absent
grand jurors viewed it was to ensure its public release and
embarrass the president,'' Kendall wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appearance in Cincinnati was in support of two House
candidates, Mayor Roxanne Qualls of Cincinnai and former state
Attorney General Chris Gorman of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Baring a bit of political tooth after weeks of absorbing
personal criticism from prominent figures in both parties, Clinton
lashed out at the Republican-led Congress that is reviewing
possible impeachment proceedings, accusing the Republicans of
waging ''a strategy of not doing anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Clinton, ''They've killed tobacco legislation and campaign
finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   He then blasted a Republican plan to give back to taxpayers much
of an anticipated federal budget surplus through an $80-billion tax
cut, a proposal he earlier in the day in Washington pledged to
veto.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd just kind of like to watch the ink turn from red to black
and see it dry,'' Clinton explained, ''before we start shoveling it
out the door again.''
</P>
<P>
   Any available surplus money should be set aside, Clinton said,
until Congress and the White House can agree on a plan to shore up
the Social Security system, which is on track to go broke sometime
in the third decade of the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he favored targeted tax cuts to help lower-income
Americans pay for child care and education, and to help encourage
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton drew praise from the luncheon's sponsor, attorney Stan
Chesley, who said Americans should ''thank our lucky stars,'' to
have Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   m ''This president is here to stay,'' Chesley told about 40
wealthy Democrats. ''He's not going anywhere, and he's not going to
be goaded into resigning.''
</P>
<P>
   Near Chesley's home, however, several dozen protesters gathered
to demand that Clinton step down.
</P>
<P>
   ''Put America first and resign now,'' read the headline above a
blistering editorial in Thursday's Cincinnati Enquirer, one of 87
newspapers across the country whose editorial boards have called
upon the president to step aside.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your authority is crippled beyond repair,'' the Enquirer
intoned. ''Each day you remain makes it harder to remove the stains
you will leave on our White House.''
</P>
<P>
   As House Republicans prepared to release videotape of Clinton's
grand jury testimony, the White House rebuked the House Judiciary
Committee for considering the tape's fate behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they're going to have a debate about what the public has a
right to see, they ought to have a debate so the public can see
it,'' presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters flying
with Clinton aboard Air Force One en route to Cincinnati from
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles sent a letter Thursday
to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., flatly
denying suggestions that the White House had urged on-line magazine
Salon to pursue a story that broke Wednesday disclosing that Hyde
had an affair three decades ago with a married woman. Hyde
acknowledged the affair, which took place over four years in the
1960s, after the Salon story appeared on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''The White House has zero tolerance for staff who are found to
be prying or encouraging others to pry into the personal lives of
members (of Congress) or any other government official,'' Bowles
wrote. ''Let me reassure you: any staff who are found to be
engaging in such conduct will be fired immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowles took the additional step of saying journalists were free
to break confidentiality vows given to any White House source who
passed along rumors or information about stories meant to be
personally damaging to members of Congress or other public
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Bowles invited any journalist who might have received such
information in a confidential conversation with a White House
staffer to step forward and identify the staffer, writing, ''I am
committed to taking appropriate action based on any reliable
information.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If there is someone in our building who has so completely lost
their mind that they think this is helpful, they should be fired,''
Lockhart said. ''Everyone in our building says they're not the
source'' of the Hyde revelations.

CLINTON CONTROVERSY ENCROACHES ON SCHUMER'S SENATE BID 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (budgeted earlier as NY-CAMPAIGN-RDP)   (bl)  
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ In Washington on Thursday, the House Judiciary
Committee debated whether to release to the public videotapes of
President Clinton's grand jury testimony in the Monica Lewinsky
case. Here in central New York, one of the committee's most
prominent Democrats, Rep. Charles Schumer, was touring a factory
that makes cat litter, soberly noting the economic distress of this
downtrodden region and proposing a series of measures to create
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after Schumer won the Democratic nomination to
challenge Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., the Judiciary Committee
deliberations served as a reminder of a major complication that
Schumer faces in his campaign to become New York's next junior
senator. And it goes beyond the man currently holding that job.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton's difficulties escalate, Schumer finds himself
balancing the conflicting demands of his campaign, which Democrats
consider one of the most promising in the nation, and his
obligations as one of 15 Democrats on a committee on the verge of
historic deliberations. The situation is potentially more
perplexing because Schumer has long been close to Clinton and has
viewed his association with the president as a political benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said he had no regrets about missing Thursday's debate.
He noted that the Judiciary Committee was divided along party lines
over whether to disclose the tapes. Schumer also contended that the
debate in Washington did not involve great constitutional issues,
but rather partisan maneuvering by Republicans out to embarrass a
Democratic president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are a bunch of shenanigans down in Washington,'' Schumer
said, standing on the rooftop of an Arm &AMP; Hammer factory in
Syracuse with a sweeping view of industrial New York at his back.
He said he would oppose the release of the videotapes of Clinton's
grand jury testimony. ``We certainly should have the process go
forward,'' Schumer said. ``But releasing these tapes with these
salacious-type materials is not moving the process forward.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know what moving the process forward is?'' Schumer
continued. ``Talking about creating jobs in central New York.
Talking about fighting crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer declined to say what he would do if the Judiciary
Committee moved to bring impeachment proceedings. Asked if he might
step down from the committee so he could press on with his
campaign, he responded, ``I'll cross that bridge when I get to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Thursday's debate, though, happened at a less than
propitious time for Schumer, who is enjoying what is unquestionably
the best political week of his career. The 48 hours after a primary
victory _ especially for a victor who had faced long odds, as
Schumer did in defeating Geraldine Ferraro and Mark Green _ are
usually a guaranteed burst of free and almost invariably good
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night Schumer introduced a series of strikingly harsh
television advertisements attacking D'Amato. They accuse the
senator of lying in asserting that Schumer was a proponent of big
tax increases. Each advertisement ends with this line: ``D'Amato:
too many lies for too long.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, D'Amato left little doubt that he would try to
make the most of Schumer's predicament with the Judiciary
Committee. Even as the panel began its deliberations, D'Amato, who
spent the day in an unsuccessful effort to push for passage of his
bill to restrict automated teller machine fees, issued a news
release saying that Schumer had missed 100 votes this year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked the senator's position on releasing the videotapes,
D'Amato's press secretary, Harvey Valentine, responded: ``This is a
matter properly before the Judiciary Committee, which has all the
facts. Chuck Schumer should do his job. If and when this matter
comes to the Senate, the senator will do his job.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's advisers are, by all indications, just starting to
assess how possible Judiciary Committee hearings could disrupt the
campaign. One associate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
suggested that Schumer might actually benefit from this, listing
members of Congress _ from former Rep. Elizabeth Holtzman to former
Sen. Howard Baker _ who became famous because of their televised
roles in the Watergate hearings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Think about the potential to put a spotlight on him,'' this
associate said. ``These could be live, televised hearings.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Schumer's position on the Judiciary Committee could give
him valuable television exposure, it also threatens to keep him out
of New York for a good deal of time, and that could be a problem.
One of the first questions posed by a Syracuse reporter to Schumer
on Thursday was why he had campaigned so infrequently there.
</P>
<P>
   There are other ways hearings could complicate Schumer's
candidacy. More than most Democrats, Schumer has made clear that he
wants Clinton to campaign with him in this state. It is hard to
imagine that happening if Schumer is serving on the committee that
is considering whether to recommend impeachment proceedings against
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   And the prospect of hearings makes it likely that Schumer will
be pressed to answer more questions about Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky,
a situation that D'Amato's advisers said they welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, for example, Schumer spent an hour touring the Arm and
Hammer plant, which manufacturers cat litter and laundry detergent,
and then climbed to the roof to offer a detailed review of his
economic proposals. Those include using any money from a tobacco
industry settlement to finance a property tax cut and deregulating
the power industry to try to lower electricity costs here.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not what Brenda Tyler, a television reporter with
WTVH, the CBS affiliate in Syracuse, wanted to ask about after
Schumer finished his speech. ``You are on the Judiciary
Committee,'' Ms. Tyler said. ``Why are you hear instead of making
that important vote?''

 CARL LOEB KEMPNER, 74, BROKER AND EDUCATIONAL PHILANTHROPIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carl Loeb Kempner, the managing senior partner at the Wall
Street firm of Hamershlag, Kempner &AMP; Co. and a longtime supporter
of education, died Sept. 15 at his home in White Plains, N.Y. He
was 74 and had been battling prostate cancer for more than 20
years, according to his son Michael Kempner.
</P>
<P>
   A grandson of Carl Loeb, founder of the firm that became Loeb,
Rhoades &AMP; Co., Kempner worked at several firms in several
businesses before he joined a securities company called Hamershlag,
Borg in 1966. He eventually became head of the firm, which took on
his name, and remained active until shortly before his death.
</P>
<P>
   Among his proudest achievements was making a ``cold call'' on
the telephone to J. Paul Getty's country estate in England and
selling the wealthy oilman some stock. Kempner became one of
Getty's brokers and visited the estate in England frequently. ``I
used to joke that I went to school on a Getty scholarship,''
Michael Kempner said.
</P>
<P>
   From 1976 to 1979 Kempner was chairman of the small firms
advisory committee of the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   He was also actively involved in philanthropy related to
education. He was president of the board of trustees at the Rectory
School in Pomfret, Conn., from 1972 to 1978. He was a trustee of
Choate Rosemary Hall from 1977 until 1985 and served as its
treasurer and as chairman of its investment committee. He was on
the Committee of University Resources at Harvard, and he founded
and headed the Presidents Council and established the Kempner
Distinguished Professorships at Purchase College, part of the State
University of New York,
</P>
<P>
   He also was on the Presidents Council at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, where he was being treated.
</P>
<P>
   Kempner was born in Pittsburgh, the son of Alan Kempner, who was
an executive with the publishing company of Farrar &AMP; Strauss, and
Margaret Loeb Kempner. He graduated from the Choate School in 1941
and then attended Harvard University. He left Harvard to join a
Navy training program and served in the Naval Reserve until 1946.
He never finished college.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 51 years, Doris Coleman Kempner,
who is a psychiatric social worker in White Plains. He is also
survived by his mother, Margaret Loeb Kempner of Purchase, N.Y.;
two daughters, Kathryn Kempner Poteat of Southern Pines, N.C., and
Margaret A. Kempner of Fairfield, Iowa; two sons, Carl Jr. and
Michael, both of New York; two brothers, Alan Jr., of Scottsdale,
Ariz., and Thomas, of New York, and three grandchildren.

ARCA DRIVERS TRYING TO GRIP ONTO TMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ An unusually dusty racing surface and
rock-hard right-side tires combined to keep Automobile Racing Club
of America practice speeds in the ho-hum 170-mph range at Texas
Motor Speedway yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the ARCA Bondo/Mar-Hyde Series, where drivers race
on everything from superspeedways to dirt tracks.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the big deal about a little charcoal-gray dust?
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to hear us whine and complain about your
racetrack,'' series points leader Frank Kimmel said after posting
the day's top speed at 170.940 mph. ``We're not that type of
people. And I don't think the racetrack is all together at fault.''
</P>
<P>
   ARCA drivers preparing for tomorrow's Z-MAX 250 were greeted by
a dirty and slick surface when practice opened yesterday morning,
despite the efforts of speedway crews to clean the track with a jet
dryer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a combination of things,'' said Kimmel, driver of the No.
46 Advance Auto Parts/VisionAire Chevrolet Monte Carlo. Yesterday's
ARCA practice marked the first racing on the track since June 5-6,
when the NASCAR Craftsman Truck and Pep Boys Indy Racing League
series competed under the lights on a newly reconfigured and
repaved 1.5-mile trioval.
</P>
<P>
   Two months of intense Texas heat followed, with the rain that
plagued spring activity at the track returning only in the past
week. Whatever traction-enhancing rubber was put down in June is
long gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the track being green (free of rubber,) a blow dryer just
doesn't do what it needs to clean it,'' Kimmel said. ``Once we got
enough cars out there, it seemed like the track got better and the
speeds started picking up.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a reference to the afternoon session, at which 23 ARCA
drivers posted speeds. They ranged from Kimmel's hot lap at nearly
171 mph to the shakedown cruise by Norm Benning at 140.627 mph.
Speeds in the 160-plus-mph range were the norm, with the fastest 13
cars all cracking that barrier during ARCA's first appearance at
TMS.
</P>
<P>
   For comparison, the track's NASCAR Winston Cup qualifying record
was set by Jeremy Mayfield in April 1998 at 185.906 mph. Jeff Green
established the NASCAR Busch Grand National qualifying record at
180.054 mph in April 1997. And the Craftsman Truck qualifying mark
belongs to Jack Sprague at 178.642 mph, set in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The track is going to improve, and make our tires better come
race day,'' said Bill Baird, second-fastest at 169.907 mph in the
No. 52 Saturn Machine/Spee Dee Pop Chevy. ``When the IRL cars get
out there (this morning) it's going to be interesting to see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimmel said his recent experience with IRL cars at Atlanta Motor
Speedway indicate the open-wheelers will not only lay down fresh
rubber, but also pick up a lot of gray dust.
</P>
<P>
   But Kimmel also said he was not happy with the right-side tire
compound that Hoosier is providing ARCA teams this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Hoosier has missed a little bit on the tires _
again,'' said Kimmel, winner of a series-leading nine races. ``They
brought a hard tire here because Atlanta and Charlotte (similar
1.5-mile tracks) are so fast, and this place is going to be just as
fast. Look at our tires when they come in. They don't have any
rubber buildup _ nothing. That just shows you that (car) is sliding
across the racetrack. No grip.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're here with what we've got. Now it's up to us to make
it a good race.''
</P>
<P>
   Baird said he expected the track to completely change by time
the ARCA cars qualify at 11 a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The track's going to do what it's supposed to do _ the more
you run it the better it's going to get,'' said Baird, who was
among six drivers to either spin or brush a wall during the day.
Baird spun off the backstretch and through the grass but did not
damage his car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still the surface everybody has to race on,'' Kimmel
said. ``I mean, we race on dirt. You can complain all you want to,
but that pothole's still there for everybody who goes through it.
We just have to get used to this place.''

IS USC FALSELY RAISING EXPECTATIONS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Three weeks into Paul Hackett's first season at
USC, and the Trojans are undefeated and ranked 16th in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   USC is off to its best start in three years _ wasn't this
supposed to be a rebuilding year? _ but few questions have been
answered because of the generous opening schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations are probably already too high following victories
over Purdue and San Diego State, but that's what happens after
years of mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   USC remains a bit of a mystery, full of encouraging signs that
could immediately disappear if the Trojans lose to a quality
opponent. Problem areas, like the offensive line, remain as
unproven today as they were before the season.
</P>
<P>
   Any lingering doubts probably will persist after Saturday, when
the Trojans host perennial Pacific-10 doormat Oregon State. With a
victory over the Beavers, USC could easily be ranked in the top 15
heading into its Sept. 26 encounter with Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we had played Florida State earlier,'' linebacker Chris
Claiborne said. ``Win or lose, at least you get to see where you
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne's not overlooking Oregon State, but he's experienced
enough to realize the difference when you play a marquee opponent,
especially in Tallahassee, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to find out who the leaders are and who's going to
step up in the big games,'' Claiborne said. ``You get to find out
who's going to step up and stand with you.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, USC's players will be thrilled with a 3-0 start,
but they realize the first three games are not going to signal a
return to the glory days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like we've been truly tested,'' offensive lineman
Travis Claridge said. ``We have to wait until we're in a pressure
cooker, when the crowds are loud.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't think the Trojans are ignoring Oregon State. It is the
conference opener, and with few exceptions, players are almost
programmed by Hackett to give comments that will not antagonize an
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess there are doubts every game,'' Claridge said. ``I pray
to God no one is looking past Oregon State.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a tough temptation not to ignore a lesser opponent, but if
there is a silver lining, the Trojans' confidence is as high today
as it's been in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, as of right now, I don't think anybody can beat us
as long as we do our job,'' wide receiver Billy Miller said. ``No
matter who we play. As long as we keep building, we might have
something special.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never really thinking this was a rebuilding year. We
lost a couple games last year by only seven points. It's my senior
year. I think when we came into the season, we had nothing less on
our mind than a national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a slightly loftier goal than Hackett ever mentioned. He
usually stops at going to the Rose Bowl. But all along, Hackett has
tried to slowly build up the Trojans, realizing that Florida State
awaits them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was important to get a good start, which we've
done,'' Hackett said. ``And it's more important to beat Oregon
State, because it's in the conference. After (this week), we go on
the road and go to Florida, which will be something.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to avoid getting caught up in the schedule, Hackett
has stressed to the Trojans that they should worry only about
themselves. Especially when it comes to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have thought we'd be ranked this high at the
beginning of the season, but a lot of teams have lost,'' linebacker
David Gibson said. ``We're probably where we should be, but that
means nothing right now.''
</P>
<P>
   USC's ascent in the national polls has been so rapid that the
Trojans may not even drop out of the rankings if they lose to
Florida State. It's an ironic thought considering USC was not even
ranked in the first preseason polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way people are losing, we're moving up the polls fast. But
we've got a lot to prove still,'' Claiborne said. ``This season,
we're on the road for respect.''
</P>
<P>
   The real danger for the Trojans could be that they read too much
from their Florida State encounter, win or lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing a stronger opponent will give you an edge, but it's
not until the end of the season when you know you've arrived,''
Gibson said.

CITY'S JOBLESS RATE SHRINKS TO 7.3 PERCENT, LOWEST SINCE 1990 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LESLIE EATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the booming economy creating more jobs than at
any time since the 1950s, New York City's unemployment rate tumbled
to 7.3 percent in August from 9.3 percent a year ago, the State
Department of Labor said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The city unemployment rate, which edged down again last month,
is now at its lowest level since 1990. While the unemployment rate
in the city remained higher than the national average, its
2-percentage-point drop far outpaced the dip of 0.3 percent in the
national average in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, unemployment in August averaged 4.5 percent, down
from 4.8 percent in August 1997. Statewide, unemployment fell to
5.1 percent from 6.2 percent in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, the city has added more than 87,000 new public
and private sector jobs, an increase of 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``To find that, you'd have to go back to the '50s,'' said Jim
Brown, a labor market analyst for the state. The survey did not
include self-employed workers, agriculture workers or domestic
workers employed by private households.
</P>
<P>
   While commuters have accounted for some of the city's gain in
jobs, city residents have also increasingly found employment _ 54
percent of the adults who live in the city were working last month,
Brown said. The last time so many people were working, as a
percentage of the population, was in late 1989, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The new jobs came in almost every sector except manufacturing,
Brown said. Employment grew on Wall Street and in services like
accounting, and new jobs were also created at construction sites,
stores, hotels and airlines.
</P>
<P>
   City officials hailed the strength and breadth of the expansion.
``It's an explosion of jobs in New York,'' said Deputy Mayor Joseph
Lhota. And, he contended, the numbers show ``that we have a very
diversified economy _ this is not being fueled just by Wall
Street.''
</P>
<P>
   As the stock market continues to fluctuate, charges that the
city relies too much on Wall Street have become an increasingly
sore point for city officials, particularly since some securities
firms have recently announced big losses in overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the state comptroller's office issued a report
warning that the city had ``to an unprecedented extent'' become
dependent on Wall Street in the 1990s. While securities firms
employ only about 5 percent of the people who work in the city,
these workers account for more than 17 percent of total earnings.
</P>
<P>
   And some critics of city policies say that the surge in jobs is
leaving behind many people without college degrees, especially
women who have been forced off welfare.
</P>
<P>
   The current unemployment rate ``still leads other urban areas,
and it's a significant problem for us because this is the top of
the boom,'' said David R. Jones, president of the Community Service
Society of New York, which has just published a report on the
city's labor market.
</P>
<P>
   The society's report said that fewer people of working age had
jobs in New York than in other urban areas, although Jones conceded
that this had been the case for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merely saying, `That's the way it's always been' may not be a
sufficient guide for economic policy,'' he said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS &QC;  &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The fastest-growing areas of the state, in terms of jobs, were
Putnam and Rockland Counties, where the number of jobs surged 5.3
percent in the last 12 months, state data show. On Long Island,
24,000 jobs were added over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Rochester lost jobs, as did several rural areas,
including Greene and Sullivan Counties.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate was lowest in upstate Tompkins County,
which includes Ithaca, at 2 percent. It was highest in the Bronx,
where unemployment was at 9.2 percent, down from more than 11
percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The other boroughs reported similar percentage drops over the
12-month period to August. The jobless rate dropped to 8.6 percent
from 10.6 percent in Brooklyn, to 6.2 percent from 7.7 percent in
Manhattan, to 6.3 percent from 8.3 percent in Queens and to 6.9
percent from 9.2 percent on Staten Island.

STRICT BAIL CONDITIONS SET FOR YOUNG GOTTI 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ Although he is expected to be released from
jail in a few days, John A. Gotti, the son of the imprisoned Mafia
boss, will be confined to virtual house arrest under bail
restrictions set Thursday. His phone calls will be monitored,
visitors will be screened and a 24-hour guard will be posted
outside his door.
</P>
<P>
   The set of strict bail conditions that will finally free Gotti,
who was arrested nine months ago on charges of extorting payments
from the Scores nightclub in Manhattan and other accusations, was
agreed upon by lawyers for Gotti and the federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I concede these are onerous conditions,'' said one of Gotti's
lawyers, Gerald Shargel, after the bail hearing in U.S. District
Court here. ``Our view is that having him out on bail is a
substantial advantage in terms of having him help prepare for his
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting near Shargel during the hearing was Gotti, a poised and
brawny man of 34 with close-cropped hair and gray glasses who was
dressed in chinos and a tan prison shirt. Behind him was his sister
Victoria, a writer of whodunits; her husband, Carmine Agnello, who
federal officials have described as a member of the Gambino crime
family; her uncle Peter Gotti; and two rows of casually dressed
friends notable for their muscular builds and immaculately white
sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gotti and a dozen or so of her brother's friends and
relatives are putting up $10 million worth of houses and other
property to assure that Gotti does not flee or violate conditions
of bail. The government wants to take a close look at those
properties, not just to validate their appraisals and titles but to
make sure they were not bought with the proceeds of organized
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Shargel and another Gotti lawyer, Bruce Cutler, said they
expected that process to be completed sometime next week, allowing
Gotti's prompt release from a federal wing of the Westchester
County Jail. The trial is being held in Westchester because the
investigation was started by law enforcement authorities here.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti's lawyers, relatives and friends said they were delighted
that he will now be reunited with his wife, Kim, and four young
children and will be free to help his lawyers prepare his defense
for a trial scheduled to begin Jan. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gotti, whose latest novel is titled ``I'll Be Watching
You,'' said her brother's family celebrated Wednesday night by
giving a pizza party rounded off with sweets from Dunkin' Donuts.
Ms. Gotti, who has offered her $4 million house in Old Westbury as
collateral for bail, praised Judge Barrington Parker, who ordered
the release Wednesday, for rejecting government arguments that
Gotti posed an imminent threat to society.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used his head and his heart and based his decision strictly
on the law,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In contrast to the reticence of most family members embroiled in
organized crime cases, Ms. Gotti willingly repeated some of her
remarks for a bank of radio and television microphones. She was
then whisked away in a black stretch limousine.
</P>
<P>
   When Gotti is released, he will have to wear an electronic ankle
bracelet that will allow the authorities to trace his whereabouts.
He will only be able to leave his home in Oyster Bay for meetings
with lawyers. All telephone calls will be monitored except those
over a specially installed line that will be restricted to
confidential discussions with his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The records of that line will be monitored to make sure that
only the lawyers are called. The government will limit Gotti's
visitors, insuring that business associates or those whom the
government suspects of criminal activities are barred. Gotti has
interests in an automobile-parts business and in real estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call these feel-good conditions because they make the
government feel good, but they don't mean anything,'' Shargel said.

COMMENTARY: RAPID TRANSIT FAST BECOMING AN OXYMORON 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you ride the subway every day, the following will
not come as a news flash: the trains move more slowly than they
used to.
</P>
<P>
   Don't confuse this with the fact that fewer trains run on many
lines, something else you already knew. The overcrowding got so bad
that transit officials finally announced plans Thursday to expand
both subway and bus service. It was a welcome development, even
though an uncharitable person might take it as a de facto
concession that the subwaymeisters were off track in previously
insisting that service reductions imposed in 1995 were marginal.
</P>
<P>
   Having more trains, however, does not mean having faster trains.
And whether you ride a creaking F train through Borough Park,
Brooklyn, or bump slowly along on the No. 6 line from Pelham Bay
Park in the Bronx, you have probably wondered if the phrase ``rapid
transit'' is inching closer toward an oxymoron.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of speed is not just in your imagination. New York City
Transit acknowledges having slowed down its trains after a couple
of fatal disasters earlier in the decade. Go-slow orders gained
urgency after a crash in 1995, when one train slammed into another
on the Williamsburg Bridge, killing a motorman and injuring dozens
of passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is all about safety,'' said Bob Slovak, a spokesman for New
York City Transit. ``Safety comes first.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough. Who wants to argue that safety should come second?
But some people with know-how, both inside and outside the subway
system, question whether the slowdown was absolutely needed. ``You
could have safety and higher speeds,'' insisted one subway official
who has studied the situation but who asked, for reasons that
should be obvious, to keep his name out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, express trains routinely reached speeds of 55 miles
per hour. Today, the top speed is about 40 mph, partly because
train motors have less power. Operators who comfortably took
stretches of track at 30 mph are now ordered to keep it to 25. As a
result, the journey on many subway lines takes several minutes
longer than it used to, though precisely how much longer is unclear
because transit officials would not provide hard figures.
</P>
<P>
   What, you may ask, is the big deal about a few minutes? Nothing,
really. But you may have noticed that this is not exactly a patient
city.
</P>
<P>
   When subway doors take an extra two seconds to close, passengers
act as though they are sitting on beds of needles. Some would bowl
over their grandmothers to make the switch from a local train to an
express. They gain what? A minute and a half? But to a New Yorker,
a lost minute can seem like an eternity.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no group of riders feels the slowdowns more than those
who must travel late at night. ``I feel sorry for people who work
at midnight,'' said the subway official mentioned earlier. ``If you
have to go at that hour from the Bronx to Brooklyn, you practically
have to pack a picnic box.''
</P>
<P>
   He, for one, is not convinced that safety is the only concern of
the subway brass. Cutting power to the motor happens to be a money
saver, he pointed out. Same with orders to motormen to increase
their ``braking distance,'' which is the number of feet recommended
to stop a train going at a specified speed. Higher braking
distances are time consuming and not always necessary, he said, but
they reduce costly wear and tear on brake shoes and other
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   One well-informed passenger who cannot understand the lower
speeds is Stan Fischler, a Brooklyn-born subway buff who has been
traveling underground for six decades. He has written several
loving books about the New York system, which, in general, he finds
to be in capable hands.
</P>
<P>
   Riding on several subway lines this week in his customary spot _
by the front window of the front car _ Fischler gave a companion a
running analysis of the tracks, the signals, the switching systems,
the skills of various motormen and so on. Nothing delighted him
more than a No. 2 express train reaching top speed on a tear from
72nd Street to Times Square. ``You feel that bounce?'' he said as
it took a curve at 59th Street. ``That's a New York bounce.''
</P>
<P>
   Fischler has trouble shaking a feeling that, in their admirable
concern for safety, transit officials have overreacted. ``It
doesn't make sense,'' he said. ``Say you have a crash on the BQE.
Do you lower the speed to 30 miles an hour because of it?''

 &HT;    Ex-FBI man hands over Ray evidence
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- A former FBI agent said he turned over evidence to a
top Justice Department official Thursday that he had removed from
James Earl Ray's abandoned car 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Former agent Donald Wilson had balked Wednesday at giving the
two slips of paper he took from Ray's car to Barry Kowalski, who is
heading the Justice Department's newly reopened investigation into
the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Kowalski then
obtained a federal search warrant and vowed to take possession of
the material Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The documents were furnished to them voluntarily today,''
Wilson said late Thursday from his suburban Chicago home. ``It was
not subject to a search warrant.'' Justice Department spokesman
Myron Marlin declined to comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said in March that he had retrieved the two scraps of
paper from Ray's abandoned Ford Mustang when he was an FBI agent
stationed in Atlanta in April 1968. Both papers contain the word
``Raul.'' Ray, who died in prison in April while serving a 99-year
sentence for King's murder, insisted on his innocence and
maintained he had been set up by a smuggler he only knew as
``Raoul.''
</P>
<P>
   King was killed in Memphis on April 4, 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno authorized a limited investigation
last month into Wilson's allegations and into claims by former
Memphis restauarant owner Loyd Jowers that a mobster paid him
$100,000 to hire an assassin.
</P>
<P>
   Jowers, who is 71 and in ill health, does not want to talk with
Kowalski unless he receives immunity, said Lewis Garrison, Jowers'
attorney.

FOOTBALL DROUGHT ENDS AT TEXAS' MARY HARDIN-BAYLOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELTON, Texas _ The campus of the University of Mary
Hardin-Baylor sits a scant two miles from the major north-south
traffic artery that cuts through Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The roar of the 18-wheelers on Interstate 35 is, however, no
more than a distant afterthought. Newer buildings pleasantly blend
with those that well could have been constructed when the campus
moved to its present site in 1886.
</P>
<P>
   A turn-of-the-century prairie colonial mansion sits to the right
of the main entrance, a restored relic of the days when cotton was
king of the Brazos River Valley. Ancient oaks abound, as do
numerous Texas Historical Markers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, we've been a quiet, laid-back institution,'' UMHB
President Jerry Bawcom admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Well, hello, millennium. Mary Hardin-Baylor _ are you ready to
rumble? Are you ready for some ``footbaaaaaall''?
</P>
<P>
   After 153 years, the answer appears to be a resounding yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response has been incredible,'' coach Pete Fredenburg
said.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA Division III fighting Crusaders play their first-ever
home football game against Belhaven (Miss.) College tomorrow night
just down Sixth Street at Belton Tiger Stadium. The Crusaders are a
bit bloodied but certainly unbowed after a 37-14 loss at Trinity
University, a Division III nationally ranked team, two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably had more fans (in San Antonio) than they did,''
proudly noted freshman offensive tackle Bryan Larned, from Plano
East Senior High School. ``Though we were getting beat 28-0 at the
time, when we scored a touchdown our fans just went crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   UHMB officials guess that close to 4,000 may show up for
tomorrow night's game against another first-year program. They also
estimate that more than 2,500 new Crusaders football fans made the
initial trek to the Trinity game. Bawcom _ formerly president of
Texas Wesleyan _ guesses that about that many showed up a few weeks
ago at Tiger Stadium for Football Funfest, the first meeting
between the team and its new constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They almost filled one side of the bleachers,'' Bawcom
boasted. ``And we only had our freshmen and a few upperclassmen on
campus at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when UMHB opened the doors Aug. 14 to its new
12,500-square-foot Andersen Athletic Fieldhouse, almost 200
prospective players showed up for two-a-day practices. The response
was so great that the university immediately added a junior
varsity, which will also play a 10-game schedule.
</P>
<P>
   UHMB has also added a 60-member marching band, a drill team and
has doubled its cheerleading squad to 22 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was coming to school here anyway,'' said freshman
cheerleader Kerrie Chambers of Pflugerville. ``But when I found out
we were having football, it made it more attractive. Every
university has its own traditions. To me, it's exciting to be a
part of starting one of our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Final fall enrollment figures are not yet in. But as of midweek,
the student body had increased from 2,313 last fall to 2,479.
Freshman enrollment was up from 352 to 512. Bawcom said that
male-enrollment applications over the summer increased from 27
percent to 42 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   UMHB officials first discussed adding a football program a
decade ago. The genesis of the idea was increasing male enrollment
in the traditionally female institution that became coed in 1971.
But that goal was only part of the overall picture when trustees
finally approved football in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made this decision strictly for philosophical reasons,''
said athletic director Ben Shipp, an alumnus and former baseball
coach. ``One, name recognition. Two, to provide a source of fun,
entertainment and camaraderie for our general student populace.
Three, to bring about greater involvement by the local community.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we're already seeing positive fallout on all three
fronts.''
</P>
<P>
   His players are not of Division I-A quality, admits Fredenburg,
a former defensive coordinator at Baylor (13 years), Louisiana
State and Louisiana Tech who said he sought a simpler, more stable
life for his family when he took the job July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Division III, but we're right here in the heart of the
best football players in America,'' Fredenburg said. ``And there
are so many kids who want to continue to play after high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kinds of kids will run through a wall for you. They may
be an inch or two shorter than the kids we had at Baylor, but they
still have the same kind of heart to play the game.''

   WASHINGTON _ Abandoning any pretense of bipartisanship, the
House Judiciary Committee spent the day Thursday wrangling over
whether to make public a videotape of President Clinton's grand
jury testimony in the Lewinsky case and discussing how to edit
reams of pages delivered by the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of 11 votes, Democrats on the panel pushed
unsuccessfully for a delay in releasing both the videotape and the
2,000-page appendix of supporting material attached to the
independent counsel's report, arguing that the material should not
be released at all or should be released all at once. They
expressed grave concern during the gathering about making the
information public piecemeal, calling the strategy politically
motivated.
</P>
<P>
   The panel is expected to approve release of the videotape of the
president's grand jury session without any redactions, as early as
Saturday. A videotape of the president's deposition in the Paula
Jones case in January, in which his testimony about Monica Lewinsky
has become the foundation for special prosecutor Kenneth Starr's
central charges of perjury, may also be released.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, Clinton's private lawyer, issued a statement
Thursday in which he said he had demanded that Starr destroy the
videotape of Clinton's grand jury testimony. Its continued
existence, he said, ``was to ensure its public release and
embarrass the president.''
</P>
<P>
   In a seething response Thursday night, Starr said the
independent counsel's office considered the videotaped testimony to
be ``evidence of a crime.'' The prosecutor is contending that
Clinton lied to the grand jury as well as in his Jones deposition.
The videotape does not cast Clinton in a flattering light,
depicting him as occasionally impatient, frustrated and quibbling
in his discussion of his affair with Ms. Lewinsky. Democrats said
an edited transcript of the testimony would have sufficed.
</P>
<P>
   While much attention has been focused on disputes over the
president's videotaped testimony, the panel spent much of the day
arguing about the supporting documents that Starr sent to Congress
to bolster his case that the president's actions may be cause for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The panel agreed on over 100 separate redactions of the report's
2,000-page appendix, which includes background information, maps of
the West Wing, a table of Ms. Lewinsky's White House visits and a
table of the contacts between the two of them. It also contains
lengthy footnotes and legal references.
</P>
<P>
   Their protracted debates mainly involved squabbles over eight
passages containing the most sexually explosive material, a person
familiar with the proceedings said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In their first meeting since Starr delivered his report to
Congress on Sept. 9, the panel's Republicans and Democrats bickered
about the merits of releasing the videotape and zeroed-in on the
most sensitive sexual material. They debated, among other things,
the relevance of mentioning sexual props. Both sides said they took
into consideration relevance and good taste.
</P>
<P>
   But, during a debate that boomeranged between collegiality and
partisanship, members accused each other of political motives and
questioned each other's sincerity in pursuing the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to let the public join in the decision-making
process,'' said Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., a member of the
committee, who argued that the committee is searching for a balance
between privacy and decency concerns and the public's right to
know. ``The very fact today is balance. It must be presented in a
balanced fashion so the American people can make their own
judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson's argument was echoed throughout the day by other
Republicans on the panel, who argued that the public should make
its own determination based on the same evidence handed to
Congress. And they accused Democrats of putting Clinton's concerns
ahead of the country's. The president's testimony, they said, is
vital to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats insisted, as they have all week, that hasty disclosure
of the materials is a strategy that will humiliate Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Republicans are trying to do is get the bad stuff out
about the president, as much as they can, as fast as they can,''
said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., a member of the panel. Frank
added, ``They're frustrated that the president's official standing
is as high as it is, and they're trying to tear it down.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But some said the party-line friction in the panel was
predictable. Last week, 11 of the Democrats on the panel voted
against a House-passed resolution to release Starr's report and
many of its accompanying documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe some Democrats would like to thwart the procedures
established under the resolution,'' said Rep. Charles Canaday,
R-Fla., a panel member.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that the partisan battle threatened to intensify, the
panel's ranking Democrat, Rep. John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, filed
a letter of protest Thursday with Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman
of the panel, over Hyde's request of the Paula Jones tape without
consulting Democrats. ``I have serious concerns regarding the
propriety of your seeking the release of a videotaped deposition in
a private civil case that has now been dismissed,'' Conyers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's meeting also came at a time of ill-will between the
parties over the disclosure that Hyde had conducted an extramarital
affair 30 years ago. An opening salvo in the Judiciary Committee
meeting came when Democrats requested that the gathering be held in
public and not under the cloak of secrecy. The motion was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans have decided that the appropriate way to fight for
openness is in total secrecy,'' Barney Frank said during one of the
committee's sporadic breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats complained that they had not had enough time to
sift through the material and the proposed redactions.
</P>
<P>
   But in an attempt to deflect charges of partisanship, Hyde
allowed members to speak on and on during the debate. After the
meeting, the chairman said: ``There's been lot's of debate. It's
been productive debate, not frivolous debate.'' He added, ``It gets
passionate at times, interesting at times.''
</P>
<P>
   One official familiar with the material and the proceedings said
Clinton's testimony shows him repeatedly relying on legalisms and a
narrow definition of sexual relations in his responses. He also
refuses to answer a series of more prying questions about the
extent of the affair, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, many of the toughest questions are asked by grand
jurors and not lawyers in the proceeding, the person added.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee aides have spent days poring over documents
in boxes delivered by Starr but Thursday's debate centered only on
the contents of one box, which indicates the process will be long
and slow.

JUDGE EXTENDS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS FOR FOSTER PARENTS AND
CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some foster parents and children have the same
constitutionally protected rights to their relationship as birth
parents when the authorities try to remove children from a home, a
federal judge ruled in a decision released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Kimba M. Wood of U.S. district court for the southern
district of New York, limited her ruling to foster children whose
birth parents' rights already have been terminated, and to foster
parents who have cared for their foster child continuously for more
than 12 months since the child's infancy and who have agreed to
adopt the child.
</P>
<P>
   But the 50-page decision expands the limits of the shifting
constitutional definition of family, and potentially applies to
thousands of children now in preadoptive foster homes in the eight
counties of the court's district.
</P>
<P>
   Children's rights lawyers hailed the decision, which holds that
such foster parents have due process rights to contest a removal
promptly. They say it is a shield against the power of New York
City's Administration for Children's Services and its agents to
arbitrarily break up relationships that often have the same
emotional strength as biological bonds.
</P>
<P>
   But a lawyer representing the city and a foster care agency sued
in the case said that the work of foster care agencies would be
made more difficult by the ruling. The lawyer, Christopher Cloud,
said the same agencies that face lawsuits for failing to remove
children quickly enough in cases of suspected abuse or neglect by
foster parents would now also be vulnerable to lawsuits for
removing children too quickly in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1977, when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to decide
whether there was a constitutionally protected right in the
relationship of foster parent and child, at least 10 court
decisions across the country have ruled against individual foster
parents who tried to assert such rights.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Guggenheim, a professor of law at New York University and
an expert in child welfare law, said Wood's decision represented an
important new contribution to the question of who best represents
the interests of children without parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this as potentially good for children,'' he said. ``This
is a recognition that when children no longer have parents it's a
good thing for caregivers who have a significant relationship in
their lives to be given an opportunity to be heard before their
placement is changed.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The judge in this case wasn't saying you can't
remove foster kids from foster parents. The judge was saying due
process can be violated if it's done cavalierly.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision came in a lawsuit stemming from the sudden removal
of a 4-year-old boy from the Bronx home of Sylvia Rodriguez, who
had been his foster mother since he was 1 month old, and who was in
the final stages of adopting him.
</P>
<P>
   The child, Andrew, had been abandoned by his biological parents
at birth and placed in Ms. Rodriguez's home by Cardinal McCloskey
Children's and Family Services, a foster care agency under contract
to the city.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Andrew's removal, the agency viewed Ms. Rodriguez as an
affectionate and caring foster parent, the judge wrote, and in
August 1993, it entered into an adoptive placement agreement with
her. But on March 18, 1994, before the adoption paperwork had been
finalized in court, a caseworker who went to the home for a
scheduled visit found only Ms. Rodriguez's 12-year-old grandson,
Edwin, supervising Andrew and his 3-year-old foster brother, Thomas
Green.
</P>
<P>
   After waiting for two hours and consulting his supervisor, the
caseworker removed the two younger children, feeling that Edwin, a
special education student, was unable to manage them alone.
</P>
<P>
   The foster care agency filed a report of suspected abuse or
maltreatment, and the city began an investigation. For three months
the foster mother had no chance to contest his removal and was
denied the right to visit Andrew, who was transferred to another
foster home.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, however, after an independent review hearing, the
city found no neglect and ordered the child returned to the care of
Ms. Rodriguez, who adopted him on Aug. 17, 1995. She then filed a
suit seeking damages against the agency and the city.
</P>
<P>
   The city and the agency had asked Judge Wood to summarily
dismiss Ms. Rodriguez's lawsuit, in part on the grounds that as a
foster parent she had no constitutionally protected rights in the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers for the plaintiffs, who took the case pro-bono, said
the ruling allowed the case to proceed to trial against the city
and the agency on compensation for the harm done to Ms. Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can imagine what it's like to have your 4-year-old ripped
out of your home and not being able to speak with him and visit
him,'' said one of Ms. Rodriguez's lawyers, Howard Seife. ``It was
devastating.''

JUDGE TELLS ISLANDERS TO HONOR ARENA PACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINEOLA, N.Y. _ A state judge late Thursday afternoon told the
New York Islanders to honor their contract with Nassau County and
to play all their exhibition and home games at the Nassau County
Coliseum, despite a contention by the team's owners that the
Uniondale arena was unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   The court order was obtained in state Supreme Court here at the
direction of Nassau County Executive Thomas Gulotta, after the
failure of six-and-a-half hours of talks to resolve the dispute
between officials of the Islanders and SMG, a management group that
operates the 26-year-old arena for the county.
</P>
<P>
   John Zuccotti, a lawyer for the Islanders who took part in the
negotiations, said the team would abide by any ruling made by state
Supreme Court Justice Burton Joseph, even though the Islanders
still believed the arena to be unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a decision that will now have to be made by the
judge,'' Zuccotti said. The judge scheduled a hearing on the matter
for next Wednesday, two days before the Islanders' preseason
opener.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders have said that the 21-ton scoreboard hanging above
center ice is held aloft by an unsafe hoist. A week ago, the team's
owners went to court seeking $10 million in damages and saying that
because SMG had failed to correct the problem, their lease with the
county was no longer valid. They said they were looking at other
municipalities for a place to play and that the first preseason
exhibition game would be played in Lake Placid.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both Gulotta and SMG president Wes Westley insisted after
Thursday's talks stalled that the hoist and the rest of the arena
were safe and that the Islanders were using the issue as a ruse to
obtain financial gains at the expense of Nassau County residents
and Islander fans.
</P>
<P>
   Gulotta said that 1 percent of Thursday's discussions with the
Islanders involved the safety issue and that 99 percent dealt with
ways the Islanders could ``obtain a bigger share of the financial
pie.''
</P>
<P>
   Gulotta said that those discussions included plans for a new
arena, the conversion of the old coliseum into a convention center
and the construction of a new hotel. The talks also covered the
hockey team's possible share of profits from concessions and
parking fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was on the table, but they were greedy,'' Gulotta
said. ``I am determined not to let the Islanders hold a gun to the
heads of Long Island taxpayers and fans for financial gain. They
have a contract and I plan to hold them to that contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Zuccotti said that the talks collapsed because the safety issue
was not resolved. He suggested that a way around the issue might be
an independent safety inspection by the National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   The league has been monitoring the situation, but did not want
to get involved before Thursday's meeting. The league said Thursday
that it would step in at least to the extent of inspecting the
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last few days we were told by the county and SMG that
we could inspect the building,'' Bill Daly, the senior vice
president of legal affairs for the league, said in a statement.
``We are in the process of finalizing the hiring of the engineers
and we have advised SMG and the county that we will begin
inspecting next Tuesday or Wednesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Gulotta said that the Islanders, who have a 15-year contract
with the county, were seeking to reduce that to three years, with
the option to leave Long Island at the end of those three years if
the team is failing to make a profit. David Seldin, the president
of the Islanders, has said that the team is already losing $11
million a year because the coliseum is in such a state of bad
repair that it discourages fans from attending games.
</P>
<P>
   The New York state Legislature has already approved $40 million
for a new Nassau Coliseum that could cost more than $200 million,
and the owners of the Islanders are seeking more public funding.
</P>
<P>
   Gulotta said he remained available to continue efforts to
resolve the dispute, but he said it was now up the Islanders to
provide the county with a sign of good faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question they want a bigger piece of the pie, and
for that they claim they are willing to forfeit the season and hurt
the fans and the taxpayers of this county,'' Gulotta said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Well, when it reaches the point where you are a pig
at the trough, it is just too much. At that point you draw the
line. And very frankly, Nassau County is not about to provide
welfare for the rich.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
A racing team on a winning streak can be a superstitious lot.
Keeping the proper chemistry is important to Kenny Brack, the
Swedish driver who is on the verge of winning the Indy Racing
League championship for the A.J. Foyt team.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brack, who lives in Houston so he can be close to his team owner
and mentor, has won an IRL-record three consecutive races.
</P>
<P>
   After his first victory at Charlotte, N.C., in July, Brack
treated the team to dinner at Miss Saigon Cafe, a Vietnamese
restaurant in Rice Village, near Brack's home.
</P>
<P>
   But Foyt was unable to attend the dinner. Brack took the team
back to the restaurant last week to celebrate win No. 3 at Atlanta,
but Foyt didn't go.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't invited,'' Brack said. ``Only the people who went to
the first one can go now.''
</P>
<P>
   Being the team owner and a racing legend didn't matter, and Foyt
understood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him no way I was going,'' Foyt said. ``We can't change
the routine now. That would be bad luck.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been all good luck for Foyt and Brack over the past two
months, when things started to jell and Brack became the man to
beat in the IRL. Brack, who will claim a $1 million bonus if he
wins the IRL title, can make it four victories in a row Sunday at
Texas Motor Speedway in the Lone Star 500.
</P>
<P>
   Few people would have thought that was possible nine months ago.
Foyt knew what people in auto racing would think when he decided he
wanted to end his relationship with Davey Hamilton and hire Brack,
32, to drive the Power Team Oldsmobile.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton was a steady performer who finished as the runner-up in
the Indy Racing League championship in 1997 _ a close battle with
Tony Stewart that came down to the final race of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Brack was from Europe and new to oval-track racing. He was
remembered mostly for being involved in the pace-lap crash at the
1997 Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew when I hired Kenny everybody would think I was an
idiot,'' Foyt said. ``They thought I was out of my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   No one questions Foyt's sanity now. Quite the contrary, the
Houston racing legend looks like a genius by hiring the man who is
the hottest driver on the circuit. Brack is just happy to be part
of a competitive team.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first win, I told the team this was a special moment
for me and I wanted to make this a habit,'' Brack said. ``I didn't
know they were going to take me seriously. It has been fantastic.
Things look very encouraging (for the championship), but we have
two more races to go and we'll have to see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Brack's biggest challengers at TMS will be teammate Billy
Boat, who won there in June. At that time, it looked as if Boat was
the Foyt driver who was headed for a great season, but Boat
suffered a fractured pelvis in the next race at New Hampshire and
missed two races.
</P>
<P>
   When the Foyt team arrived in Charlotte, things looked grim.
Boat was recuperating, and Brack had not proved Foyt had made the
right decision to hire him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had to get our act together,'' Foyt said. ``We had a
meeting to talk about it, and all the guys pulled together.''
</P>
<P>
   Brack won an exciting race at Charlotte, but no one was ready to
call him a title contender. Then came a win at Pikes Peak, followed
by the win at Atlanta two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the harder things got, the more we put into it,''
Brack said. ``Like the saying, `The going gets tough and the tough
get going.' That's what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Brack had proved he could be the winning driver Foyt thought he
would be when he hired him before the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny has come on strong,'' Foyt said. ``Once he's out there
in a race, he runs hard and he stays with it all day. That's kind
of the way I was.''
</P>
<P>
   As a driver, Foyt was willing to take chances and aggressively
go for broke, which is one of the characteristics he saw in Brack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw things I liked in him last year, but I knew he needed
someone to settle him down a little,'' Foyt said. ``I like getting
young guys so I can teach them what they need to know. I felt he
just needed to be with someone who could help him understand what
it takes to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity to win is why Brack wanted to join the Foyt
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew if I signed with A.J. I would have the equipment I
needed to win races,'' Brack said. ``I didn't want better equipment
than everyone else. I just wanted equal equipment. I knew I could
win if I was on equal footing.''
</P>
<P>
   Having an even playing field is something Brack didn't see when
he was a test driver in Formula One.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Formula One is the biggest thing in Europe, and
that's what I grew up wanting to do,'' Brack said. ``I was a test
driver for the Williams team in 1995 and Arrows in 1996. But I
didn't like what I saw in F1. Unless you are on one of the top
teams, you have no chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to win races. I didn't want to be a back-marker my
whole career. It was a big controversy when I left. People thought
I was crazy, but I've always gone my own way in life and not
worried about what people thought. Finally, I said, `To hell with
this.' I packed my bag and didn't look back.''
</P>
<P>
   Brack's first big opportunity came when he made the field for
the 1997 Indy 500, but the chance to show his skills never made it
to the green flag. On a cold and wet day at the Brickyard, Brack
was involved in a crash on turn 4 of the parade lap.
</P>
<P>
   All three drivers on the fifth row _ Brack, Stephan Gregoire and
Alfonso Giaffone came together and mangled their cars, ending their
day in embarrassing fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``For sure, that was the low point of my career,'' Brack said.
``I think it took some time for people to give me a chance after
that. The worst thing about it was that I wasn't the one who
started the accident but I was the one blamed for it. I was just in
the wrong place at the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   Foyt said he had seen enough strange crashes over the years to
know not to blame a driver over one incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never paid any attention to it, especially since my cars
weren't involved,'' Foyt said. ``When something like that happens,
you can get 10 different answers about who did what.''
</P>
<P>
   Brack didn't let the disappointment affect his performance the
rest of the season. He finished fifth at Charlotte and New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``In racing, you have to expect some bad times and you have to
deal with it,'' Brack said. ``The Indy deal didn't make or break
me, but I knew I needed to show some people what I could do. I
always have believed that how you deal with hard times shows where
you are going to go in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Foyt liked what he saw in Brack during the 1997 season and began
thinking about putting Brack in the Power Team car. Hamilton had
done everything expected of him except win. So Foyt wanted a driver
who might be more aggressive on the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Power Team folks were against it at first,'' Foyt said.
``They liked Davey, and they wanted to keep him. But I told them I
was going to do it with or without them.''
</P>
<P>
   Power Team decided to stick with Foyt, who knew he had work to
do to make Brack a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny had to learn to bide his time in a race,'' Foyt said.
``What I've tried to teach him is to use that extra push when you
have to use it and not to burn up the engine. When it's time to let
it go, he has that little something extra to get it done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt Kenny could have won Indy this year if we hadn't messed
things up in the pits. My boys are young, and they're going to make
some mistakes, but I would rather have them young and hungry and
teach them how to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Foyt has taught Brack, it's working. With two races to
go in the 1998 season, Brack has a 23-point lead over Hamilton
(282-259) and a 25-point lead over Stewart. But 50 points are
available for each race, so the championship is a long way from
decided.
</P>
<P>
   Brack sees his situation as a dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider myself much of a points scorer,'' Brack said.
``I want to do everything possible to win, not just accumulate
points. If you win races, the points will take care of itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting in third in Atlanta after the last caution flag.
I was behind Stewart and (Scott) Sharp. I could have said, OK,
maybe I will just take it easy here and get the points, but I'm
just not that kind of driver. Winning is what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's why Foyt wanted Brack as one of his drivers. Brack
thinks he owes a lot to Foyt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a very good relationship with A.J.,'' Brack said.
``He's a perfectionist and wants all his people to do their best.
He's a winner. If you make a mistake, it's OK as long as he knows
you are doing your best.''

AGGIES LOOK TO REVIVE ANEMIC OFFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ The players doing the running, passing
and catching at Texas A&AMP;M have not changed since last season. But
the level of offensive production has slipped to depths uncharted
in 10 seasons under coach R.C. Slocum.
</P>
<P>
   With only two games under their belts, the 17th-ranked Aggies
(1-1) cite circumstances more than systemic failures to explain an
offense that has seen its statistics drop by more than two yards
per play and two touchdowns per game from 1997 averages.
</P>
<P>
   At their current pace of 3.5 yards per play, the Aggies would
finish as the first A&AMP;M team since 1987 to average fewer than 5
yards per snap. Although no one wearing maroon expects this power
outage to last, Slocum admitted he is anxious for a breakout game
from an offense that ranks last in the Big 12 and 102nd among 112
teams in Division I-A. He would love to see one tomorrow against
Southern Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were averaging 400 yards a game, I'd still be concerned
about our offense,'' said Slocum, whose unit falls well short of
that figure, at 241 yards per contest. ``But there are some reasons
it's like that. We've played one game in the rain and one against
Florida State. If you change those two things, we wouldn't be
having this conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably not. Opening the season with a 23-14 loss to the
11th-ranked Seminoles, who led the nation in total defense in 1997,
``will skew our rushing stats all year,'' in Slocum's estimation.
A&AMP;M followed with a rain-soaked, 28-7 win over Louisiana Tech that
saw the Aggies concentrate on ball control rather than big plays.
</P>
<P>
   Still, minor glitches continue to bother first-year offensive
coordinator Steve Kragthorpe. A&AMP;M has fumbled nine times, losing
three. Receivers dropped five passes against Louisiana Tech.
Quarterback Branndon Stewart has underthrown open receivers,
dropping his completion percentage to 51.1 after connecting at a
56.6 rate last season.
</P>
<P>
   Slowed by nagging injuries, tailbacks Dante Hall (back spasms)
and Sirr Parker (hamstring) have run tentatively while combining
for 126 yards on 40 carries (3.2 per attempt). Neither has found
the end zone. The duo combined for 1,773 yards and 19 touchdowns
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not executing plays that well right now,'' Kragthorpe
said. ``We've got three new offensive linemen and there's got to be
some jelling with those guys before we take off. That's starting to
happen, but we're not where we want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Among players, frustration is evident. Concern is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plays are there but we're not taking advantage of them.
That's what's frustrating,'' said tight end Dan Campbell. ``I
haven't lost any confidence in this offense. Pretty soon, we'll put
up some yards and we'll score some points.''
</P>
<P>
   An immediate turnaround may be difficult. Although 0-1, Southern
Mississippi is coming off a 9-3 season and employs a gambling,
unpredictable defensive scheme. The Golden Eagles rarely line up in
the same spot on consecutive plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, this will be as big a challenge as we have all
year in terms of getting lined up right and executing our
offense,'' Slocum said. ``We're going to have some bad plays. But
we'll have some big plays, too.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Aggies' offense lacks, at this point, is consistency.
That won't happen, Slocum said, until the offensive line performs
better as a unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``With three new guys up front, it's not unreasonable to think
we wouldn't be polished this early,'' Slocum said.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, Slocum sees no reason to reach for the panic
button. He simply hopes the offensive shine returns soon,
preferably against Southern Mississippi.

 MULTI-USE SPEECH  
 FAMOUS FASHION

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The party was for Dr. Neal Nathanson, director of the
Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, and
Dr. Peter Piot, director of UNAIDS, a United Nations unit.
</P>
<P>
   The word from the American Foundation for AIDS Research was that
it would be the last party at the town house of one of its
founders, Dr. Mathilde Krim. Dr. Krim, who has lived in the Upper
East Side house in Manhattan for 38 years, is moving to an
apartment, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It lends itself to socializing here,'' she said, but she
decided to sell after her husband, the entertainment lawyer Arthur
Krim, died in 1995. She said that because of confidentiality
agreements in the sale documents, she could not name the buyer or
discuss the price.
</P>
<P>
   The new apartment will be smaller, but that will not stop her.
``I can give parties in other places,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rock and Slurp
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the new Times Square, even the venerable Howard
Johnson's draws a trendy crowd. On Wednesday, actor Chris Noth,
soccer star Alexi Lalas and dozens of other fans of the rock band
Hootie and the Blowfish packed the orange vinyl banquettes, ate
fried clams and slurped milkshakes after a performance by the group
at Roseland.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Howard Johnson's. In the words of the band's lead
singer, Darius Rucker, ``It gives the party a down-home feel.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Howard Johnson regulars were bewildered. Evan
Warmington, who served his first drink there when Richard Nixon was
president, assessed things as he squirted a dollop of fake whipped
cream onto a coffee shake. ``I do like Hootie's music,'' he said,
``but I must say, I've never seen a crowd order this many
milkshakes. At most parties people tend to order cocktails.''
</P>
<P>
   Rucker, holding a shot glass of tequila in one hand and a beer
in the other, talked about performing at a fund-raiser for
President Clinton last month in East Hampton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must have played for over two hours, he said. ``Clinton's
still the man.'' As for censure, resignation, impeachment and
Monica Lewinsky, he said, ``It's a shame we even have to be
discussing it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Multi-use Speech
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mike Wallace, a correspondent on the CBS News
magazine ``60 Minutes,'' agreed to give a speech after he receives
an honorary degree at a ceremony marking the opening of the new
School of Journalism, Media and Information Studies at Queens
College next month. (The school will also award a degree
posthumously to Richard Clurman, the longtime chief of
correspondents for Time magazine.)
</P>
<P>
   The title of Wallace's speech will be ``The Press: Credible or
Incredible?''
</P>
<P>
   It sounds so timely, but timeless is a better word.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a speech I've been making for 20 years,'' Wallace
said. ``It's the all-purpose title. It was Watergate coverage, I
remember. It was Vietnam coverage. It was civil rights coverage. It
is Clinton coverage. One size fits all.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Famous Fashion
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you are young and you used to date somebody
famous, you can be a clothes designer. Shoshanna Lowenstein, the
former girlfriend of Jerry Seinfeld, all but upstaged Marc Jacobs,
the designer of Louis Vuitton's new ready-to-wear collection, at
the opening of Vuitton's new New York store in SoHo on Tuesday _
and her first runway show was not until Wednesday, at Gen-Art.
</P>
<P>
   But there was Ms. Lowenstein at Vuitton, wearing a tightly laced
black eyelet bustier that would not have looked out of place on the
cover of a romance novel. Of the clothes in her line she said,
``They are for people of any age who want to be comfortable and a
little daring.''

IS SKIP AWAY WORN DOWN OR ON STRIDE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At Belmont Park, where Skip Away will face three
other millionaires in the Woodward Stakes on Saturday, they wonder
if the leading candidate for Horse of the Year is about to hit the
wall.
</P>
<P>
   One possible answer: If he is, I feel sorry for the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Another: It's wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   And another: Could be.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away's latest effort, his eighth straight victory, putting
him within $800,000 of Cigar's career earnings record, gave his
rivals in the Free House, Gentlemen and Coronado's Quest camps
reason for optimism.
</P>
<P>
   As a 1-20 favorite in the Iselin Handicap at Monmouth (N.J.)
Park on Aug. 30, Skip Away lost the lead in mid-stretch and had to
fight back to win by a nose over blown-up allowance winner Stormin
Fever. After a long season that's taken him to six states, after
four seasons of uninterrupted racing and training, is the
5-year-old vulnerable to a fresh horse like Free House, an old
class horse like Gentlemen or an ambitious 3-year-old like
Coronado's Quest?
</P>
<P>
   Those three and the English import Running Stag are Skip Away's
challengers in the $500,000, 1[-mile Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, I'd like to think he's taking a step back,'' said
Gentlemen's trainer, Richard Mandella. ``But I think he was giving
18 pounds to that horse (Stormin Fever), and they did run
two-fifths (of a second) off the track record.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still won the race. He looked beat at the eighth pole and
he came back on like a real champion. So I'm going in more worried
that he's not slipping.''
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away trainer Sonny Hine said the gunmetal-gray horse is
feeling good after a couple of ``hang-dog'' days in the New York
humidity, but he thinks this looms as his toughest race.
</P>
<P>
   The Woodward is the first major race of the season to pit a
3-year-old against elders. Coronado's Quest, to be ridden by Pat
Day, replacing injured Mike Smith, carries 121 pounds under
weight-for-age conditions; everybody else gets 126.
</P>
<P>
   A win by Coronado's Quest could sew up the 3-year-old
championship. A win by Free House could give him a late shot at
Horse of the Year; he'd have to beat Skip Away again in the Oct. 10
Jockey Club Gold Cup or the Nov. 7 Breeders' Cup Classic. A win by
Gentlemen would be a terrific last hurrah for the West Coast's
leading handicap horse of 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
   But a win by Skip Away would solidify his reputation as the
toughest horse of the decade. If you're betting on the wall, don't
take a short price.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; What's that worth? &LR; : Sonny Hine is amused by the requests he
receives from Skip Away fans.
</P>
<P>
   A letter writer from Holland asked for a clipping from the
horse's mane. A visitor to the barn brought a plastic bag and
wanted a piece of the horse's, you know, droppings.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said she has manure from a lot of great horses,'' Hine
said. ``I bet she has some trophy room.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; At the fair: &LR;  Three-year-olds are in the Fairplex Park
spotlight, dim though it may be, as the middle weekend of Los
Angeles County Fair racing begins.
</P>
<P>
   In today's Derby Trial, English-bred Dog Watch, with Jose
Valdivia Jr. riding, tries to give owner Gary Biszantz and trainer
Mike Puype their second stakes win of the short Fairplex season,
the pair having teamed up to win the E.B. Johnson on Sunday with
Argentina-bred Fontal.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's CTBA Marian Stakes for California-bred 3-year-old
fillies drew a field of eight.
</P>
<P>
   Those 1 1/16-mile races, worth $50,000 apiece, are part of a
Fairplex schedule that features at least one stakes every afternoon
for 18 straight days.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; They know the way: &LR;  The top jockeys take vacations during the
L.A. County Fair, or follow their big horses to major races back
East, leaving young or second-rung riders to battle for the title
in Pomona.
</P>
<P>
   The past five Fairplex champions are in action this year: Corey
Black, David Flores, Martin Pedroza, Valdivia and Victor Espinoza.
</P>
<P>
   The five-eighths-mile track's tight turns demand a special kind
of rider. Pedroza remembers when it was a half-mile track.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked me when I started if I would have any trouble
here,'' Pedroza said. ``I said, `I can ride any kind of track.' But
when I saw this little track, I said, `Damn!'
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to know how to race-ride. Riders like myself, Flores,
Espinoza and Fernando (Valenzuela) know how to make these turns.
Sometimes you win races just on that.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Foolish pride? &LR; : Horseplayers, even the atheists among them,
believe there's a God of Racing with the power to humble those who
think they've got the game figured out. Handicapper and workouts
analyst Bruno De Julio had better hope the God of Racing didn't
read his remarks in Sunday's Daily Racing Form.
</P>
<P>
   After beating a star-studded field in a season-long Del Mar
handicapping contest presented by a Las Vegas hotel, De Julio was
quoted by reporter John Kelly as saying, ``I've mastered the art of
picking winners.''
</P>
<P>
   De Julio also credited his success to a knack for money
management and a steady personal life.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for him, De Julio denies using the words ``mastered
the art'' and says he was only responding to a question about
whether his handicapping style was particularly suited to Del Mar.
</P>
<P>
   Such repentance may be all that will save him from a plague of
locusts and losing tickets.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is not just the Clinton presidency that hangs in
the balance in these fevered Washington days. Before the eyes of
the nation, Congress itself is on trial.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans still tell pollsters that they yearn for the
sordid story of President Clinton's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky to go away. Yet in an all-day meeting Thursday, a sharply
partisan House Judiciary Committee battled inconclusively over the
release of thousands more pages of documents from the Whitewater
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, as well as the release of the
videotape of Clinton's testimony before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's quarrelsome session served as a prologue to the most
extraordinary of congressional duties _ impeachment. In the
Federalist papers, Alexander Hamilton called impeachment ``a method
of national inquest in the conduct of public men,'' and the
Founders wrestled with who should have the awesome power to sit in
judgment on impeachments. They rejected the judiciary as too small
and possibly too subject to corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Yet could Hamilton have ever have pondered what a ``national
inquest'' might turn into in this new age of round-the-clock cable
talk shows and the Internet? Could he have forseen that the House
and Senate would be examining the most private, intimate actions of
a public man?
</P>
<P>
   These are the uncomfortable circumstances that Congress now has
to deal with, in an atmosphere made even more poisonous and
hysterical by the fact that the personal life of anyone in the
House and Senate these past few days seems to have become fair game
in the press.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, Judiciary Committee officials said they were
studying the 1974 Watergate inquiry as a model. It proved that the
nation could survive the disruption of impeachment proceedings,
even though Richard Nixon resigned before he could be voted out of
office. And it created national folk heroes like Sam Ervin, who ran
the Senate Watergate Committee, and Barbara Jordan, the freshman
congresswoman whose eloquence captivated the nation when she said
``today I am an inquisitor and hyperbole would not be fictional and
would not overstate the solemness that I feel right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Watergate is a flawed model, in part because Watergate
itself changed Congress, journalism and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress of 1974 was one in which the leaders of opposition
parties could play golf together. It was not the highly partisan
Congress of Thursday where each side nurses grudges and looks for
payback for scandals stretching from Watergate to Iran-contra, for
the forced resignation of Speaker Jim Wright, under an ethical
cloud, or the reprimand of Speaker Newt Gingrich on ethics charges.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was the Watergate inquiry taking place in an environment
where the presumption was that everything would somehow leak to the
press. The report of the Watergate special prosecutor Leon Jaworski
remains under seal to this day in the National Archives. But
Thursday some lawmakers say they have rushed to make everything
Starr assembled about Clinton public because they saw how much of
the Whitewater independent counsel's investigation found its way
into the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had shown they could keep from leaking stuff from the
grand jury I might have had a different position,'' said Rep.
Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, who favors the fullest release of the
materials before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In this charged atmosphere, two sharply different approaches
have already emerged as the House moves ahead with a process that
is at once quasi-judicial and at once political.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are playing for the court of public opinion,
acting like the entire nation is the grand jury. ``Impeachment is
intended to be a public process,'' said Rep. Christopher Cox,
R-Calif. ``It should not be more secret than a court proceeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are viewing the House itself as the grand jury and
fighting to protect the rights of the president until and unless
impeachment _ the equivalent of indictment _ takes place. ``The
normal procedure is that unless there's a damn good reason, you
don't release grand jury material,'' said Rep. Jerrold Nadler,
D-N.Y., who serves on the House Judiciary Committee, as he worried
about the precedent being set by the House.
</P>
<P>
   Politics too underlies the position of both parties, with a
national election just seven weeks away and Republicans and
Democrats alike aware that an impeachment inquiry could affect the
balance of power for a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton's job approval ratings in polls still remains
confoundingly high, Republicans believe that a constant drumbeat of
revelations about the president's behavior with Ms. Lewinsky in the
Oval Office and attempts to cover the affair up will bring his
ratings down as the midterm election approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats know that to avoid a total rout, they have to turn the
spotlight away from the president and stop the scandal from
subsuming their attempts to talk about issues.
</P>
<P>
   A difficulty for all involved is that while Starr has raised
serious constitutional questions about perjury and obstruction of
justice, this coverup is all about sex, not about a burglary
against a political party or using the CIA to hinder an
investigation by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Inglis, R-S.C., a member of the Judiciary Committee,
says this distinction should not matter. ``It's all with the
coverup,'' he said. ``Same as with Richard Nixon.''
</P>
<P>
   But to decide such fundamental questions as whether Clinton did
commit perjury in his grand jury deposition, lawmakers may very
well have to ponder the president's attitudes toward sex and
re-examine in graphic detail what transpired between him and Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Picking his words carefully, Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., a
member of the Judiciary Committee, said, ``There are very sensitive
matters involved in this episode that no one wants to discuss in
public. It's very awkward. And I think we have to show dignity in
the way we conduct these proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   But who can even imagine public hearings on these matters? Who
would ask the questions? Who would want to question Ms. Lewinsky?
Could anyone emerge as a hero? And what kind of dignity and privacy
would any member of Congress retain if this inquiry establishes the
rule that any politician's sex life is fair game?
</P>
<P>
   No wonder that the only area of agreement between House
Republicans and Democrats Thursday was the announcement by the two
re-election committee chairmen that thay would not finance
candidates this fall who make purely personal attacks on their
opponents.

WOULD GILLICK USURP LASORDA'S POWER?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kevin Malone's interest in hiring former Baltimore
boss Pat Gillick as a Los Angeles Dodgers scout and adviser would
appear to limit the future role of former interim general manager
Tom Lasorda, now a senior vice president.
</P>
<P>
   But Malone, who completes his first week as Dodgers GM today,
said Lasorda will remain an important member of the club's
decision-making process and that his role as senior vice president
would not change if Gillick is added.
</P>
<P>
   Gillick has disputed reports that he officially stepped down
Wednesday as Orioles general manager, but it is only a matter of
time. His contract, however, does not expire until Nov. 26. Because
of Gillick's status, the Dodgers cannot make an offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still under contract, so I really can't discuss it, but
the way I see it, Pat would stay on the East Coast and Tommy would
be here locally,'' Malone said. ``He (Gillick) would be more like a
major-league scout. There would not be a problem of stepping on
each other's toes. My relationship with Pat is very special. He
does so many things well.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone, who will accompany the team this weekend to San
Francisco for the final trip of the year, shares his general
manager's box at Dodger Stadium with Lasorda.
</P>
<P>
   Malone and Lasorda, who replaced the fired Fred Claire on June
22, have spoken about Malone's need to put his stamp on reshaping
the organization. ``He understands the situation,'' Malone said.
Lasorda maintains he will do whatever is asked to help the team.
</P>
<P>
   Malone also said Gillick, who led the Orioles to a wild-card
berth in 1996 and an AL East title last season, will receive many
offers from other clubs once the season is over.
</P>
<P>
   Gillick is a Southern California native who went to USC and was
considered for the Dodgers GM position in 1987 after Al Campanis
was fired. That job went to Claire.
</P>
<P>
   But despite three years in Baltimore, Gillick's family remains
in Toronto, where he built the Blue Jays into back-to-back World
Series champions in 1992-93.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't discussed anything with Kevin at all even though
there have been rumors otherwise,'' Gillick said. ``I haven't made
a decision with respect to leaving Baltimore. Whatever transpires,
I've always tried to conduct myself in a professional manner. While
I'm with the O's, I'm going to do everything possible to help this
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw rebounds: Closer Jeff Shaw, who blew four saves during a
six-game stretch in the final week of August, saved his sixth
straight Wednesday night despite allowing three singles in the
ninth inning to the Colorado Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tense ninth for Dodgers starter Brian Bohanon, who
pitched eight innings for his first victory in five starts. Shaw
twice allowed late-inning homers to cost Bohanon victories during
the closer's slump.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, last year's National League Pitcher of the Month for
September, has converted 20 of 21 save opportunities during the
past two Septembers.!end! &QL;

CLINTON'S TROUBLES SCUTTLE STRAW POLL  
 NEW HAMPSHIRE: OTHER STRAW POLLS GO ON, AND ON  
 SOUTH CAROLINA: TRACK GETS SLIPPERY FOR SUPPOSED SHOO-IN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When 3,000 members of the Christian Coalition gather this
weekend in Washington for their annual national conference, they
will find that one major event on the schedule _ an election 2000
presidential straw poll _ has been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Conference planners initially figured the poll would provide the
coalition with an opportunity to spark interest in the gathering
and provide a lift for pro-family White House wannabes,
particularly Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., who has strong ties to
leaders of the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   But after Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's report was
published, according to coalition officials, members of the
coalition board had second thoughts and the beauty contest was
scrapped lest it detract from coalition's efforts to reap maximum
political hay from President Clinton's troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Was there also some concern, perhaps, that Ashcroft might lose
or show poorly?
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' one coalition insider insists. ``Heads would have
rolled if we'd had a poll and enough of John's supporters couldn't
be hauled in to guarantee he'd win. The problem was that the effort
to guarantee that result would have been distracting and gotten us
`off message,' especially since people who favor other candidates
wouldn't have taken it lying down.''
</P>
<P>
   The election 2000 straw poll will probably be scheduled for a
later date, the coalition insider said, adding:
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole focus now has to be election 1998 and the terrific
opportunity we've been handed to use the next six weeks to promote
the pro-family issue and pro-family candidates. Bill Clinton's
deplorably bad behavior has really put all that front and center
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Straw Polls Go On, and On
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of election 2000 polls . . .
</P>
<P>
   In the run-up to each presidential election, WMUR, the best
known of New Hampshire's television stations, periodically polls
Democratic and Republican voters to determine which White House
wannabes they would like to see nominated in the Granite State's
first-in-the-nation primaries. As polls go, these surveys tend to
cover fairly small samples of voters and thus have fairly large
margins of error.
</P>
<P>
   But given New Hampshire's prominence in the presidential picking
procedure, they nevertheless are followed closely by political
junkies, who understand and always keep in mind that this early in
the game, name recognition and the number of visits to New
Hampshire can often loom large in the results.
</P>
<P>
   Such caveats duly proffered, here are the results from the the
latest WMUR survey, which was conducted last Wednesday and
Thursday, covered 203 likely Democratic and 217 likely Republican
voters, and has a plus-or-minus margin of error of 6 percent for
Democrats and 6.9 percent for Republicans:
</P>
<P>
   Democrats (with percentage of support won): Vice President Al
Gore, 41; former former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, 14; Sen.
John Kerry of Massachusetts, 10; Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri,
10; Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, 7; Sen. Paul Wellstone of
Minnesota, 1; others, 2, and undecided, 15.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans: Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, 29; former Gov. Lamar
Alexander of Tennessee, 13; former Vice President Dan Quayle, 9;
Steve Forbes, the publisher, 9; Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, 6; Sen.
Robert Smith of New Hampshire, 5; Sen. John McCain of Arizona, 4;
Patrick J. Buchanan, the commentator, 4; House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, 3; Ashcroft, 2; Gary Bauer, head of the Family Research
Council, 2; others, 1, and undecided, 14.
</P>
<P>
   Any significant movement here from earlier polls?
</P>
<P>
   Not much, except that in the last WMUR poll, conducted in late
June, Bradley got less than 1 percent of the vote. Since then,
however, he has been moving around the country some and talking a
bit more about a possible run in 2000. And he is scheduled to visit
New Hampshire next week for a Democratic fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Track Gets Slippery For Supposed Shoo-In
</P>
<P>
   For months, the political presumption in South Carolina was that
Gov. David Beasley would easily be re-elected. All he had to do win
a second term, the reasoning went, was ride the strong
Christian-right Republican tide that has been sweeping across the
state throughout the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But lately some voices of doubt have been raised about a Beasley
sweep.
</P>
<P>
   The doubt comes from a sense that the governor's Democratic
opponent, Jim Hodges, the former minority leader in the South
Carolina House, is picking up momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The governor still leads Hodges by 15 points or so in most
independent polls. But at least one Democratic polltaker now has
the race close to a toss-up after finding the governor well in the
lead in all earlier surveys. Perhaps more important, some leading
Republicans in the state have begun openly worrying about slippage
by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   The governor says there is no erosion in his campaign. ``Nothing
has changed,'' insisted his campaign manager, Tony Denny.
</P>
<P>
   But the other day when a fellow Republican, state Sen. David
Thomas of Greenville, called a news conference to criticize a
tax-cutting initiative proposed by Hodges, he expressed concern
about erosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you think I'm out here?'' he said. ``I know how serious
it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican legislator, state Rep. Dan Cooper of
Williamston, said he had been out talking to voters and ``not many
want to vote for Governor Beasley.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodges recently opened a major television attack on Beasley,
hammering him hard on what is probably the hottest issue in the
state: South Carolina's last-place ranking in education test
scores.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, Hodges contends, has done nothing to improve
schools. Further, Hodges argues that the governor has tried to rid
the state of one lucrative source of education financing, video
poker, and has refused to push for another source that would be
even more lucrative, the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   The Hodges ads are paid for in good part with money contributed
by gambling interests, particularly the video poker industry.
</P>
<P>
   Beasley senses political opportunity here in a state where the
Christian right is perhaps the most powerful political force. His
new ads, which have replaced defensive ads that boasted of his
education programs, aggressively assert that ``organized'' gambling
has Hodges in its pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Another hot issue is also dogging the governor. A couple of
years ago, he suggested that the Confederate flag should no longer
be flown over the South Carolina Capitol, a suggestion that
continues to rankle many residents of the state where the Civil War
started.
</P>
<P>
   But the governor still has some important things going for him,
not the least being incumbency. And Wednesday he began working the
Clinton-Lewinsky issue, demanding the president's resignation on
the grounds that he has lost ``moral authority'' and ``respect.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, say some worried Republicans, incumbency may be the
factor that sees the governor through.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a tough race,'' state Sen. Arthur Ravenel Jr. of
Charleston told The Greenville News the other day. ``But it's tough
to beat an incumbent governor. I can't remember that happening, and
I'm 71 years old.''

7-UP PREVIEWS SUPER BOWL AD CAMPAIGN FOR ITS BOTTLERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLANO, Texas _ Seeking a fresher, younger image for the 7-Up
soft drink, Dr Pepper/Seven Up Inc. unveiled a series of new
television commercials Thursday that will begin during the Super
Bowl in January.
</P>
<P>
   The new commercials, which come as 7-Up continues to lose market
share to competitors like Sprite, ask ``Are u an un?'' and show
teen-agers in various situations where an entity called the ``Anti
Refreshment Syndicate'' is trying to stop them from drinking 7-Up.
People who are uns are ``unique, confident and self-assured,'' said
John Clarke, the chief advertising officer at Dr Pepper/Seven Up, a
unit of Cadbury Schweppes PLC.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials, prepared by Young &AMP; Rubicam, were screened
Thursday at the company's annual bottlers' meeting in Plano, and
drew a mixed response from the bottlers. Many seemed more enchanted
with three 15-second ``teaser'' spots that will be run in early
January. ``I liked the teasers better,'' said Fred Ester, a bottler
from Mason, Texas. In the spots, a man's face appears at the bottom
of a popcorn bucket, sending the bucket's owners shrieking from a
movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke said the commercials would run during the Super Bowl at
halftime and during two post-game shows. The teasers will be shown
on Fox, on the Fox MTV and UPN channels, as well as Comedy Central,
reflecting the company's desire to stimulate interest in 7-Up among
the 12-to-24-year-old demographic groups, who generally drink the
most soda.

   WASHINGTON _ Following is a statement from President Clinton's
personal lawyer, David Kendall, responding to efforts by the House
Judiciary Committee to release videotaped testimony by Clinton, as
provided Thursday by the White House:
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the president's grand jury deposition on Aug. 17, 1998,
the Office of Independent Counsel insisted that it had to videotape
his testimony because one or more grand jurors purportedly would
not be able to attend on that date. I offered to have the testimony
occur on Aug. 18 _ a date on which the grand jury was sitting _ but
the OIC stated that all the grand jurors could not be present on
that date either. I asked the OIC to agree to discard the videotape
after showing it to any grand jurors who missed the testimony. The
OIC refused to do so, despite the fact that a full and complete
stenographic transcript of the president's testimony (the normal
means of recording grand jury testimony) would remain available. I
do not know whether any grand jurors were in fact absent on Aug.
17. I do not know if the OIC videotaped the testimony of any other
witness to show to absent grand jurors.
</P>
<P>
   The only purpose of preserving this videotape after any absent
grand jurors viewed it was to insure its public release and
embarrass the president.

WORST CENSUS UNDERCOUNT FOUND IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A new study by a Democratic research group shows
that the three worst undercounts in the 1990 census occurred in
congressional districts in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis of estimates provided by the Census Bureau
indicates that the 1990 census failed to count an estimated 40,245
people _ the largest undercount of the country's 435 congressional
districts _ in the South Bronx district represented by Jose
Serrano.
</P>
<P>
   Serrano's district was followed by the Crown Heights, Brooklyn,
district represented by Major Owens, where an estimated 38,123
people were missed, and the district represented by Charles Rangel
in Harlem, where the Census Bureau failed to count an estimated
35,705 people, according to the study. Each congressional district
was drawn to have a population of about 550,000 people in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The total undercount for New York City, estimated to have been
about 245,000, would not be sufficient to gain the city another
seat in Congress. But the new data highlight the loss, to the
poorest congressional districts, of millions of dollars in federal
and state aid that is tied to population.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis was done by the National Committee for an Effective
Congress, a Democratic organization that provides demographic data
for Democratic candidates. The group's analysts used new estimates
provided by the Census Bureau, which estimated the number of people
missed and the number who were counted twice on all levels, as far
down as individual city blocks. In the past, the Census Bureau had
provided only estimates of overcounts and undercounts for states as
a whole and for cities with populations of more than 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The new data underscored what had previously been surmised: that
the 1990 census tended to miss people living in low-income areas
populated by members of minority groups. ``It's more of the same,''
said Serrano when informed of the new analysis. ``We've known this
for a while _ known that a poor community like mine gets
undercounted in the census.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Owens echoed that, saying: ``It follows a correlation of
poverty, doesn't it? I think the large immigrant population is what
drives up the undercount in my district.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely the analysis indicated that where double-counting
took place, it tended to occur in more affluent white areas. The
district where the largest number of people were counted twice was
that of Rep. Peter King, a Long Island Republican. According to
census data, an estimated 7,448 people were counted twice in King's
Nassau County district.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is a mirror of the problems of an unscientific
census,'' said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, a Manhattan Democrat whose
office distributed the study. ``If you own more than one home
you're more likely to be counted twice. If you don't own any home,
you're likely to be missed.''
</P>
<P>
   The data also indicate that much of the undercount was
concentrated in a few states. Aside from New York City, the 25
congressional districts with the largest numbers of missed people
were all in Arizona, California, Florida, New Jersey and Texas. All
but three of the districts were represented by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The report should add fuel to the raging battle over the Census
Bureau's plans to use statistical sampling to supplement the 2000
Census. Proponents of sampling _ which is loosely similar to a
typical political poll but much more sophisticated _ say it would
help account for those people who are missed by traditional means
of conducting the census.

   ``We have been saying all along the 1990 census was flawed,''
Engel said. ``I believe that statistical sample will go a long way
toward making the 2000 census more accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   The report may also stiffen Republican resolve against sampling
since it shows the extent to which the undercount is concentrated
in Democratic districts.

IS USC FALSELY RAISING EXPECTATIONS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Three weeks into Paul Hackett's first season at
USC, and the Trojans are undefeated and ranked 16th in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   USC is off to its best start in three years _ wasn't this
supposed to be a rebuilding year? _ but few questions have been
answered because of the generous opening schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations are probably already too high following victories
over Purdue and San Diego State, but that's what happens after
years of mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   USC remains a bit of a mystery, full of encouraging signs that
could immediately disappear if the Trojans lose to a quality
opponent. Problem areas, like the offensive line, remain as
unproven today as they were before the season.
</P>
<P>
   Any lingering doubts probably will persist after Saturday, when
the Trojans host perennial Pacific-10 doormat Oregon State. With a
victory over the Beavers, USC could easily be ranked in the top 15
heading into its Sept. 26 encounter with Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we had played Florida State earlier,'' linebacker Chris
Claiborne said. ``Win or lose, at least you get to see where you
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne's not overlooking Oregon State, but he's experienced
enough to realize the difference when you play a marquee opponent,
especially in Tallahassee, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to find out who the leaders are and who's going to
step up in the big games,'' Claiborne said. ``You get to find out
who's going to step up and stand with you.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, USC's players will be thrilled with a 3-0 start,
but they realize the first three games are not going to signal a
return to the glory days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like we've been truly tested,'' offensive lineman
Travis Claridge said. ``We have to wait until we're in a pressure
cooker, when the crowds are loud.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't think the Trojans are ignoring Oregon State. It is the
conference opener, and with few exceptions, players are almost
programmed by Hackett to give comments that will not antagonize an
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess there are doubts every game,'' Claridge said. ``I pray
to God no one is looking past Oregon State.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a tough temptation not to ignore a lesser opponent, but if
there is a silver lining, the Trojans' confidence is as high today
as it's been in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, as of right now, I don't think anybody can beat us
as long as we do our job,'' wide receiver Billy Miller said. ``No
matter who we play. As long as we keep building, we might have
something special.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never really thinking this was a rebuilding year. We
lost a couple games last year by only seven points. It's my senior
year. I think when we came into the season, we had nothing less on
our mind than a national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a slightly loftier goal than Hackett ever mentioned. He
usually stops at going to the Rose Bowl. But all along, Hackett has
tried to slowly build up the Trojans, realizing that Florida State
awaits them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was important to get a good start, which we've
done,'' Hackett said. ``And it's more important to beat Oregon
State, because it's in the conference. After (this week), we go on
the road and go to Florida, which will be something.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to avoid getting caught up in the schedule, Hackett
has stressed to the Trojans that they should worry only about
themselves. Especially when it comes to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have thought we'd be ranked this high at the
beginning of the season, but a lot of teams have lost,'' linebacker
David Gibson said. ``We're probably where we should be, but that
means nothing right now.''
</P>
<P>
   USC's ascent in the national polls has been so rapid that the
Trojans may not even drop out of the rankings if they lose to
Florida State. It's an ironic thought considering USC was not even
ranked in the first preseason polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way people are losing, we're moving up the polls fast. But
we've got a lot to prove still,'' Claiborne said. ``This season,
we're on the road for respect.''
</P>
<P>
   The real danger for the Trojans could be that they read too much
from their Florida State encounter, win or lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing a stronger opponent will give you an edge, but it's
not until the end of the season when you know you've arrived,''
Gibson said.

EDITORIAL: RANCOROUS DIVERSIONS IN CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Sept. 18:
</P>
<P>
   The nonpartisan, dignified review of the Monica Lewinsky case
that was promised by congressional leaders last week has quickly
descended into political acrimony and the pursuit of tangential
matters. The squabbling does not augur well for the hard work that
lies ahead as the House considers whether to initiate impeachment
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee spent Thursday arguing furiously and
inconclusively over whether to make public the videotape of
President Clinton's Aug. 17 grand jury testimony, with the
Democratic minority trying to block or limit release. The
donnybrook was pointless. The public interest requires open access
to Clinton's testimony and other materials related to the core
questions of whether he lied under oath, obstructed justice and
tampered with witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself made the videotape of his grand jury appearance
relevant because of his insistence that he did not commit perjury
in denying that he had sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky. His
assertion there and in the account he gave in the Paula Jones civil
suit is debunked by the evidence presented in Kenneth Starr's
report. But since Clinton has taken a position contrary to the
facts now on record, the American people should have the chance to
see his testimony in its totality so they can assess his candor.
</P>
<P>
   As the political heat in Washington rises, it is disheartening
but not surprising to find the private lives of members of Congress
being publicly examined. Judiciary Committee chairman Henry Hyde
became the third Republican in recent weeks to acknowledge an
extramarital affair when faced with press reports about a liaison.
In the Hyde case, Salon, the Internet journal that disclosed the
affair of 30 years ago, demeaned itself by saying that publication
was justified because ``ugly times call for ugly tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   The Salon report was not cause to call on the FBI to determine
how the journal learned of the affair. But that is what the
Republican leadership did Thursday after accusing the White House
of planting the story in an effort to intimidate lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Clinton team has a record of rummaging through the
private lives of opponents hunting for embarrassing information,
Salon says the White House had nothing to do with the Hyde story.
If Congress wants to look into White House conduct, it has the
means to do so on its own. Bringing in the FBI to investigate
journalistic sources is a misuse of the agency and a clumsy attack
on press freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of impeachment proceedings should be sobering to
both Republicans and Democrats. The American people expect more of
their representatives than partisan bickering and chasing after
reporters' sources.

NBC POISED TO DROP AX ON 300 POSITIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A long-feared ax fell at NBC as the network
announced plans to eliminate as many as 300 jobs, or nearly 5
percent of its 6,500 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at NBC, the most watched television network, blamed
soaring costs. ``Increased competition for programming and talent
has increased our costs on the network side significantly,'' NBC
President Robert Wright said Thursday in a memo to employees. ``We
need to make changes and adapt while we are on top.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC, which has seen its overall viewership slip as cable
television gains popularity, said all divisions will be affected,
but entertainment and news programming departments will see
less-severe cuts. Spokeswoman Cassie Kantor said no figures were
available for NBC's operations in suburban Burbank, where about 900
employees work at the West Coast headquarters and KNBC-TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that the media landscape is changing,'' Kantor
said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe that NBC's rising costs, notably its deal to
pay $13 million per episode of ``ER,'' and flat ad revenues will
slice operating profits this year to a range between $300 million
and $350 million, from last year's estimated $500 million. Its
schedule no longer includes ``Seinfeld'' or pro football, and it is
paying hefty salaries to ``Mad About You'' stars Helen Hunt and
Paul Reiser, and newscasters Tom Brokaw, Katie Couric, Geraldo
Rivera and Jane Pauley.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Hyman of Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum noted NBC is following
the lead of CBS, which has announced plans to cut as many as 300
jobs, and Walt Disney Co.'s ABC, which has cut its development
budget. Hyman said tougher times likely lie ahead for NBC, since
parent General Electric has strict profit targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cuts at NBC have been a long time coming, but they're also
only the beginning,'' he said. ``Their costs are out of control.
The traditional business model no longer works as it once did, so
NBC is going to have to take more dramatic steps, like cost-sharing
with affiliates.''

BOXER MIA ST. JOHN NOT JUST PRETTY FACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Mia St. John and boxing don't go together at first
glance.
</P>
<P>
   Modeling, maybe. Boxing, no.
</P>
<P>
   Which is a problem at the moment: The Calabasas resident's
colleagues have difficulty taking her fighting skills seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shouldn't worry about what anyone thinks,'' said St. John,
who fights B.J. Felter tonight on the undercard of the Oscar De La
Hoya-Julio Cesar Chavez fight. ``But I do. Everyone wants respect
from their peers.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, St. John, now 31 and the mother of two boys, was born
into fighting. Her father and older brother are accomplished
martial artists; she started when she was 6 and has been devoted to
it since. And she's good: She's won multiple amateur tournaments on
the state and national levels. She just happens to be beautiful,
which doesn't hurt when it comes to marketing oneself.
</P>
<P>
   Her looks helped the Cal State Northridge graduate (in
psychology) get through school. She modeled, including a five-year
stint with Playboy Modeling Agency. And it helped her when she made
the decision a year and a half ago to give professional boxing a
try.
</P>
<P>
   She mailed a letter detailing her qualifications and a photo of
herself to Don King and the promoter signed her immediately. She's
now promoted by Bob Arum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not stupid. I know he called me because of my picture,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's up to her to prove she's more than a pretty face.
</P>
<P>
   So far, she's 7-0 (with five knockouts) as a pro. Ultimately,
like any other fighter _ beautiful or not _ she wants to win a
world championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been my dream since I was a child,'' she said. ``When
(the film) Rocky came out, I remember I wanted to be Rocky.
Everyone thought I just had a crush on Sylvester Stallone but I
really wanted to be Rocky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm getting a chance to live out that dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny guys: St. John's presence in a sport dominated by men was
bound to result in quips. Said Arum at a press conference: ``This
is the first time in my six years introducing you (De La Hoya) that
you're not the best looking person on the dais.''
</P>
<P>
   At last: De La Hoya's next fight, assuming he beats Chavez, is
against Ike Quartey on Nov. 21 in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Which is good news to those who have been critical of De La
Hoya's opposition: Quartey, the former WBA welterweight champ, is
the first opponent given a decent chance of beating De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of fight that's going to make me somebody in
boxing,'' De La Hoya said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense, defense: De La Hoya's offensive skills are well
documented. Statistics provided by CompuBox Inc. indicate he's also
a superb defensive fighter.
</P>
<P>
   In the 13 De La Hoya fights CompuBox has tracked, De La Hoya has
connected on 45.5 percent of his punches, compared to his
opponents' 27.9 percent. The average welterweight connects at a
38.7 rate.

DEMOCRATS WANT CLINTON OUT, BUT WON'T SAY IT
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (Analysis) 
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
WASHINGTON _ It is a badly kept secret on Capitol Hill that many
Democratic lawmakers, especially those facing tough elections, want
President Clinton to resign. But they are afraid of the political
risk in saying so.
<TEXT>
<P>
   With new evidence soon to become public in the Clinton scandal,
Demo cratic House members increasingly fear that Clinton may drag
down the party's candidates by hanging onto his job past the Nov. 3
congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Democrats want Clinton's fate resolved quickly.
Clinton's resig nation would accomplish that, while impeachment
hearings, even if the president emerged with his job in tact, would
not.
</P>
<P>
   The anxious Democrats are express ing their concerns to friends,
col leagues and campaign operatives, but apparently not to those
who matter most: The public and the president himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want him to leave,'' a top aide to a senior House
Democrat said this week. The aide said that members of the
president's own party lack the will to suggest he step down, in
part because his approval ratings remain high.
</P>
<P>
   Affecting an Arkansas drawl, the aide imagined Clinton's
reaction if a troupe of Democrats marched to the White House and
urged Clinton to step down: ``I'm at 60 (percent approval rating).
Where are you?''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are ``in a damned if you do, damned if you don't
situation,'' said Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz. ``I've had Democrats
who are my friends tell me personally, the best thing that they
believe would happen to their party is that he would step down.
They could move on and remove him as an issue in the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They hope like heck he leaves on his own volition, but they
don't want to say anything, because they don't want to get tarred
and feathered by the party faithful,'' Salmon said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some Democrats have al ready paid a price for shunning
Clinton. Maryland Gov. Parris Glen denning, a Democrat, was
criticized within the party, especially by Afri can-Americans, for
canceling a pub lic appearance with Clinton last week.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all Democrats want Clinton to resign. But because
so many of the lawmakers remain cir cumspect, it is impossible to
tell just how much support Clinton does have on Capitol Hill.
Experienced political pundits think it's precious little.
</P>
<P>
   ``The silence on behalf of the presi dent from members of
Congress is deafening,'' said John Russonello, a Democratic public
opinion re searcher who worked on Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt's 1988 presi dential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats seem to be scared silent. But even silence can put
them at political risk.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, GOP congres sional candidate Tom Roberg is
using an ad that accuses Rep. David Price, his Democratic opponent,
of being ``silent,'' according to the Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now our president has admitted lying to us,'' the ad says.
``Now is not the time to be silent. Where do you stand, Mr.
Price?''
</P>
<P>
   All 435 House districts are up for election in November, as are
one-third of the Senate seats.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with other presidents, Clinton never enjoyed a close
rela tionship with members of Congress, not even the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Liberals felt he abandoned the par ty's core principals,
including defend ing minorities and the poor. And many of his
moderate brethren, the New Democrats, felt betrayed by Clinton's
actions in initially denying having had ``sexual relations'' with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, then conceding that he
did have a relationship with her.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Clinton's base in the rank and file of the Democratic
Party was never as broad as the public may have assumed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for Democrats in Congress, it has come to this: The worse
the president looks, the worse the presi dent's party looks.
</P>
<P>
   That's why a battle Thursday by House Judiciary Committee Demo
crats to delay release of Clinton's videotaped grand jury testimony
may not have been so much about saving the president as it was
about saving the Democratic Party in the fall. &QL;
