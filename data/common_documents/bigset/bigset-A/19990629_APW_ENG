<HEADLINE> First Lady Accused of Misusing Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A conservative group alleged Tuesday that  
Hillary Rodham Clinton is misusing taxpayer funds for ``personal 
political benefit'' as she explores a campaign for a Senate seat 
from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be seeking appropriate remedies which may include the  
return of the money for the U.S. taxpayer and which would also 
include other types of action to prevent this from happening in the 
future,'' said Larry Klayman, chairman and general counsel for the 
Washington, D.C.-based Judicial Watch. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton said the first lady had followed  
requirements set by the Federal Elections Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``The travel that she made to New York -- whether it was on  
behalf of her role as first lady or for a candidate or a campaign -- 
she was very aware of making sure that she played by the rules put 
in place by the FEC,'' Marsha Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Mrs. Clinton appears at fund-raising events for other  
politicians, they are required to reimburse the federal government 
for part of her travel costs. Her other travel costs have been 
picked up by taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	Klayman said Judicial Watch is preparing a lawsuit alleging  
``the misuse of taxpayer funds for personal political benefit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group has filed repeated lawsuits challenging the Clinton  
camp's fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is to announce creation of a Senate exploratory  
committee in early July. It will allow her to raise money to cover 
campaign-like expenses, including political travel to New York 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides have already said Mrs. Clinton will continue to use  
military aircraft because of security recommendations from the 
Secret Service, but will reimburse the government for her political 
trips. Taxpayers will pay for her Secret Service protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, aides to the prospective Senate candidate put the  
finishing touches on plans for her 13th trip to New York this year 
even as one of her possible Republican Senate opponents, New York 
City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, set off to visit her childhood 
backyard -- Chicago for fund-raising and to attend a Chicago Cubs 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, a devoted Cubs fan, drew attention recently when  
she said she also was a New York Yankees fan. Giuliani is an ardent 
Yankees fan and said he had never seen her at Yankee stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why the mayor had decided to attend a Cubs game while in  
Chicago, political aide Bruce Teitelbaum said: ``It's a great 
ballpark and the mayor is a REAL fan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani also plans a fund-raising event later this summer in  
Arkansas, where Mrs. Clinton was first lady before moving to the 
White House.

<HEADLINE> GOP, Democrats Agree On Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans and the Clinton administration  
found themselves on the same side of a dispute over a national 
ballistic-missile defense today, with GOP leaders welcoming belated 
administration support for a long-standing GOP priority. 
</P>
<P>
	``We usher in a new era of American security,'' House Speaker  
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said at a Capitol-steps rally held to 
showcase a bill to commit the United States to deployment of such a 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Democrats once belittled the project, begun by  
President Reagan in the early 1980s, as ``Star Wars,'' Clinton and 
most congressional Democrats did an about-face earlier this year -- 
partly in response to revised estimates of nuclear missile 
capability, particularly on the part of North Korea and Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert and other Republican leaders stood alongside a huge map  
suggesting that a North Korean ballistic missile, similar to one 
tested last year, could nearly reach Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might be aimed at Chicago and hit St. Louis, but surely  
they have that capability,'' said Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., long an 
outspoken supporter of a national missile defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert likened the legislation to President Kennedy's 1960  
pledge to put Americans on the moon. And Senate Majority Leader 
Trent Lott, R-Miss., suggested the measure was one of the most 
significant bills to pass Congress in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott called the current lack of a defense against incoming  
ballistic missiles ``our Achilles' heel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation commits the United States to deployment of a  
missile defense against limited ballistic missile attack once it is 
technologically possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who vetoed similar legislation in the past, said he  
would sign it. However, congressional leaders delayed sending it to 
him until after the conflict in Kosovo died down. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally on the Capitol steps, under a broiling midday sun,  
came a day after the administration's top arms-control official 
said the escalating long-range missile capability of North Korea 
and Iran were partly responsible for a change in the 
administration's attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cold war disciplines are gone. Technology is more widely  
available,'' John Holum, acting undersecretary of state for arms 
control and international security affairs, told a Senate 
confirmation hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Congress passed that bill in May, two developments have  
occurred on the missile-defense front: 
</P>
<P>
	--Russian President Boris Yeltsin agreed, for the first time, to  
consider reopening the landmark 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty 
to consider easing that prohibition against either American or 
Russian nationwide ballistic missile defense systems. 
</P>
<P>
	--After six straight failures, a $3.8 billion experimental  
missile defense system scored its first hit in a test at the White 
Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, shooting down an incoming test 
rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	Holum, in testimony Monday before the Senate Foreign Relations  
Committee, voiced strong support for deploying a missile defense 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a 1998 report by a panel headed by former Defense  
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld had ``a profound impact'' on Clinton 
administration policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rumsfeld panel concluded that North Korea and Iran could  
develop long-range missiles within five years and probably are 
secretly doing so. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if a missile defense is outlawed by the 1972 ABM treaty,  
national interest dictates that the United States move ahead in 
planning for such a system anyway, Holum said, echoing views of 
Republican members of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat of a nuclear attack by a small power ``is clearly  
very prominent'' as an area of concern, far more so than just a few 
years ago, Holum said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In light of new estimates on the ballistic missile threat, in  
particular from North Korea and Iran, national missile defense is 
now closer to becoming another integral part of our strategy 
against proliferation,'' Holum testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Holum appeared at a nomination hearing to be the first person to  
serve in the new post. He had served since 1993 as director of the 
Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, but the agency went out of 
business on April 1 when its functions were merged with the State 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel was expected to approve the nomination, perhaps as  
early as Wednesday, when it also votes on the nomination of Richard 
Holbrooke to be U.N. ambassador.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Drops Threat to Russia Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq has withdrawn a threat to cancel an  
oil contract with Russia's largest petroleum company, Oil Ministry 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has pledged to start developing the West Qurna oil field  
in southern Iraq as soon as it is possible, officials said on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Investment by Russia's state-run Lukoil in Iraq would violate  
the U.N. sanctions imposed on the country since Baghdad's forces 
invaded Kuwait in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraqi Oil Minister Amer Mohammed Rashid told parliament on June  
21 that he had given Lukoil, and the Chinese National Petroleum 
Company, a deadline of ``a few weeks'' to start developing the 
fields they contracted to exploit in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat seemed to upset Russia because last week Iraq sent a  
high-ranking delegation to Moscow to soften the impact of its 
warning. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraqi officials did not say when and how Russia would develop  
the Qurna field, which has an estimated 10 billion barrels of oil. 
</P>
<P>
	They said they had obtained similar promises to start work from  
the Chinese firm, whose executives are currently on a visit to 
Iraq. China is contracted to develop the Ahdab field in southern 
Iraq, which contains an estimated 1 billion barrels. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not clear why Lukoil and the Chinese company agreed to  
develop the fields when they knew such investment would violate 
U.N. sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Plan Spending, Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Still operating in a tight-money mindset, a  
House subcommittee voted Tuesday to give President Clinton 
one-fourth of what he wanted to buy new parkland and two-thirds of 
his request for two major cultural programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the position of the House,'' said House Appropriations  
Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla., as a subcommittee approved 
$14.1 billion for federal land and arts programs next year, $1.1 
billion less than Clinton requested. 
</P>
<P>
	But a day after the White House projected $1 trillion extra in  
budget surpluses than were foreseen five months ago, Republican tax 
writers were all but rubbing their hands with glee. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he favors using  
all of the $333 billion extra in non-Social Security surpluses that 
the White House now projects over the next decade for tax cuts, not 
higher spending. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill 
Archer, R-Texas, agreed, saying the 10-year tax-cutting bill he 
plans to write next month could climb from $778 billion to more 
than $1 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we should say, `Oh, goodie! We have more  
money''' to spend, Lott told reporters. Rather, he said, the extra 
money ``makes it a lot easier and more justifiable'' for Congress 
to pass a tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's spending cuts and tax-cut talk underlined GOP  
determination to use the growing surplus projections for their own 
priorities -- tax reductions -- and not Clinton's plans for domestic 
initiatives. The moves could serve as an opening gambit for budget 
talks that might occur this year or as a clear statement of 
principles for Republicans already planning for the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's activity also illustrated that lawmakers are feeling  
their way through the politics of an era undreamt of even two years 
ago -- huge projected money surpluses stretching to the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said that despite  
higher surplus projections, he is not ready to raise spending 
limits set in the 1997 budget-balancing deal that even many 
Republicans say are too tight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does the expression `When hell freezes over' mean anything to  
you?'' he said when asked when he would agree to use the new 
surpluses for higher spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet across the Capitol, Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman  
Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said he was ready to do just that. He told 
reporters that with the new surplus projections, it is time for 
congressional leaders to negotiate new and higher spending limits 
with the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the time that old agreement was made, they didn't see $1  
trillion ahead of us,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also disagreement over whether Clinton's announcement  
Monday of a bigger projected surplus, and his plans to use the 
money for Social Security, Medicare and other domestic programs, 
augured a possible budget deal that could include tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see that,'' Lott told reporters. ``The president came  
to town, threw some ideas over a wall, and hightailed it to New 
York'' for political fund-raising events. 
</P>
<P>
	But Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., was  
optimistic. ``We have an excellent opportunity to do a lot of 
things,'' Domenici said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Clinton's surplus projections, as expected, would be  
closely tracked by Congressional Budget Office estimates due 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The CBO, which Congress uses to write bills, will project a  
fiscal 2000 surplus of $10 billion to $15 billion, Domenici said, 
excluding the vast Social Security surpluses that have created 
overall budget surpluses last year and this year. The White House 
projected a $5 billion figure. 
</P>
<P>
	He said over the next decade, CBO's non-Social Security surplus  
would be $300 billion to $350 billion higher than was thought, 
mirroring the administration's $333 billion figure. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House land and cultural programs bill, Clinton's touted  
``lands legacy'' program was cut from close to $800 million to 
about $200 million. The budgets of the national endowments for the 
arts and the humanities were held at $98 million and $111 million, 
well below the $150 million Clinton wanted for each. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would increase spending for national park maintenance  
and Indian Health Service programs. It also would provide less than 
Clinton wanted for protecting Florida's Everglades and for the 
first time would require state contributions to a federal program 
that helps poor people winterize their homes.

<HEADLINE> Gore Raises $18M, Bradley $11M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore raised more than $18 million in the  
first half of 1999, but his sole rival for the Democratic 
presidential nomination is closing the gap, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading Republican candidate, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, has  
raised millions more than the Democratic vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore will report a fund-raising total of $18.2 million to $18.5  
million at the close of the second quarter Wednesday, deputy 
campaign chairman Marla Romash said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This demonstrates the strength of Al Gore's support throughout  
the country,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	After raising twice as much as former New Jersey Sen. Bill  
Bradley in the first three months of the year, Gore watched the 
second-quarter margin close. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley will report about $11 million raised this year,  
according to campaign officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. Nearly $7 million of that total was raised in the second 
reporting period, compared to about $9 million for Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Romash said Gore will break the second-quarter fund-raising  
total set by Bob Dole in 1995. But so will Bush, whose 
second-quarter fund raising could be twice as much as Gore's $9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``That shows there are still a lot of people out there who would  
like to see a horse race,'' said Stephen Hess of the Brookings 
Institute, a Washington think tank. ``While Gore seems to want to 
give the impression that we can skip the preliminaries and go right 
to the general election, it's not that simple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is far ahead of Bradley in polls of Democratic voters. The  
latest CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll gave Gore a 3-1 lead over Bradley. 
Gore held a nearly 50-percentage point lead in another poll. 
</P>
<P>
	``That, to us, is the margin that counts,'' Romash said. ``Al  
Gore never takes anything for granted and runs every race as the 
challenger but it's important to note that when you look at who 
Democratic voters are supporting, overwhelmingly it's Al Gore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same poll showed Bush widening his lead over GOP rivals. His  
money machine is also in high gear, with senior Republican 
officials predicting a first-half haul of at least $23 million. The 
officials say the figure could be much higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as aides tried to total the contributions, the Texas  
governor kept amassing more. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush expected to take in $4.2 million during a three-day  
campaign trip through California that began Tuesday. During his 
first fund-raiser of the trip, Bush picked up $480,000 -- $180,000 
more than his campaign had anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	He is virtually drying up the pool of Republican cash, causing  
his rivals to struggle to stay afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, will report that he has raised $1.6  
million this year, including just $600,000 in the last three 
months. Spokesman Todd Harris said Kasich has transferred $1.4 
million from his House campaign account to his presidential 
campaign. He has $1.7 million left in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody is going to emerge as the obvious alternative to  
George Bush, but you can't get to that point without having money 
in the bank to keep your doors open and get your message out,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other campaigns may be raising more money, but are running up a  
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle expects to raise $1 million in  
the second quarter after taking $2.1 million in the first three 
months. Aides say Quayle will carry a debt into the 2000 primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, like Quayle, has cut  
staff and travel plans to make ends meet. He will report raising 
more than $2 million overall, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona Sen. John McCain, chairman of the powerful Senate  
Commerce Committee, is doing better than other non-Bush hopefuls 
but still will report raising less than $5 million. Counting 
transfers from his Senate campaign account, McCain has put $6.1 
million in his bank account. 
</P>
<P>
	Publisher Steve Forbes, former American Red Cross president  
Elizabeth Dole and conservative activist Gary Bauer will be in the 
$2 million to $4 million range, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith, a longshot, will report more than  
$1 million in contributions, spokeswoman Karen Hickey said.

<HEADLINE> General Mills Earnings Up 14 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- General Mills Inc. on Tuesday credited strong  
sales Cheerios, Total and brands fortified with calcium for helping 
boost earnings 14 percent in the fourth quarter and 27 percent for 
the entire fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	For the quarter ended May 30, General Mills earned $104.8  
million, or 67 cents a share, compared with $91.8 million, or 57 
cents a share, for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the quarter rose to $1.60 billion, from $1.55 billion,  
with 2 percentage points of the gain attributed to the 
third-quarter acquisitions of Lloyd's Barbeque Co. and Farmhouse 
Foods. 
</P>
<P>
	For fiscal 1999, General Mills reported earnings of $534.5  
million, or $3.40 per share, compared with $421.8 million, or $2.60 
per share, in fiscal 1998. Sales totaled $6.25 billion, up from 
$6.03 billion the previous year, which included an additional week. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 figures included $32.3 million in after-tax  
restructuring charges and the $130 million cost of acquiring 
Lloyd's and Farmhouse. Fiscal 1998 included $100.2 million in 
after-tax charges related to restructuring the company's North 
American cereal operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The market share of Big G cereals increased to 25.6 percent in  
pounds sold and to 31.2 percent in dollar sales over the year while 
pound volume in the entire cereal industry declined 1 percent, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoplait and Colombo yogurt also performed well, General Mills  
reported.

	Protesters Demand Milosevic Resign  
</P>
<P>
	CACAK, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A crowd of 10,000 demonstrators rallied  
today near Belgrade to demand the resignation of President Slobodan 
Milosevic in the first public demonstration against the Yugoslav 
leader since the end of the NATO air campaign. One opposition 
leader after another stepped to the podium in the town of Cacak and 
urged Milosevic to step down. The demonstration was called by 
Yugoslavia's main pro-democracy coalition, The Alliance for Change. 
It was seen as a first test of whether Serbia's fragmented 
opposition can exploit public discontent with Milosevic's rule to 
press for reforms.

	Clinton Proposes Medicare Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Older or disabled Americans would pay $24 a  
month to take advantage of a $1,000-a-year prescription drug 
benefit that is a centerpiece of President Clinton's long-awaited 
proposal to bolster Medicare. The new benefit, if approved by 
Congress, would be available as an option for those 65 and older 
and the disabled beginning in 2002. Coverage would start with the 
first dollar of prescription costs, with no deductible. The 
government would pay half the first $2,000 of drug costs in a year. 
Any drug costs above $2,000 in any given year would have to be paid 
entirely by the beneficiary.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans and the Clinton administration

administration support for a long-standing GOP priority. Although 
Democrats once belittled the project, begun by President Reagan in 
the early 1980s, as ``Star Wars,'' Clinton and most congressional 
Democrats did an about-face earlier this year -- partly in response 
to revised estimates of nuclear missile capability, particularly on 
the part of North Korea and Iran.

<HEADLINE> FedEx Eyes Home Delivery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                            *GEOF BECKER   	
</P>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- If the shipping part were as easy as the  
clicking part, online shopping could be a thing to behold. 
</P>
<P>
	University of Pittsburgh English lecturer Jeff Oaks knows all  
about it. He had a computer shipped by Federal Express and was 
forced to drive to FedEx's office in the Pittsburgh warehouse 
district to pick it up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spent three days trying to figure when I could go down and  
pick it up,'' Oaks said. Why don't they deliver the boxes at night, 
``when regular people are at home,'' he wondered. 
</P>
<P>
	And Stephanie Riso has boxes delivered by United Parcel Service  
brought to her at work rather than risk the dreaded little sticky 
note on her front door with instructions on how to reschedule a 
delivery. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's annoying because you have to think about it,'' Riso said.  
</P>
<P>
	But as e-commerce continues to boom -- $18 billion in online  
sales are forecast for this year by Forrester Research Inc. -- the 
pressure on delivery companies to provide greater choice and 
convenience is growing. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, consumers have neither but that may soon change.  
</P>
<P>
	Two companies, the U.S. Postal Service and UPS, dominate the  
home-delivery market. UPS delivered 55 percent of packages during 
the 1998 holiday season, followed by the Postal Service with 36 
percent, according to the Redwood City, Calif.-based Zona Research. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavyweight FDX Corp., the parent company of Federal Express,  
hasn't pushed hard to jump into the fray, preferring to focus on 
the more profitable areas of extremely time-sensitive deliveries 
and those that require careful computer tracking. 
</P>
<P>
	The growth in electronic commerce has not, however, escaped the  
Memphis, Tenn.-based company's eye. 
</P>
<P>
	Later this summer, RPS, the trucking company FDX acquired in  
January 1998, will begin home deliveries in the Pittsburgh area. 
RPS, which is based in Pittsburgh, gets most of its revenue from 
delivering boxes from business to business but adding the 
home-delivery market seems to be a natural fit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's looking at a service that's not as information- or  
time-intensive as most Federal Express shipments are,'' said FDX 
spokeswoman Shirlee Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	If the experiment goes well, FDX plans to roll out the service  
nationally next spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Airborne Express also plans to enter the home delivery market,  
but has opted to hire the Postal Service to make the final 
drop-off. Airborne is taking advantage of new federal rules 
allowing the Postal Service to extend large discounts to bulk rate 
mailers who presort by zip code and deliver parcels directly to 
postal sorting centers. 
</P>
<P>
	Airborne will offer its new service in July, working with six to  
10 of its top shippers in a few cities at first. Airborne 
spokeswoman Camille Pitre said the company won't disclose where the 
service will begin but expects to expand the service within four to 
six weeks of the startup. 
</P>
<P>
	The question is what benefits might come from these upcoming  
shipping wars. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good result is that the consumer and the company shipping  
things is grateful because there are more options than ever 
before,'' said Ken Dunavant, marketing and sales director at 
Express Logistics, a shipping consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	RPS, which toyed with home deliveries before being acquired by  
FDX but abandoned the practice as unprofitable, is hoping to cover 
the basics in its experiment: what's the weight of the average 
package, will the company's routing technology help offset the cost 
of driving a ways to drop off one package rather than stopping at 
an office building and unloading 50 packages. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the main reason that shipping companies have steered  
clear of home deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not claiming we can ship to every residential address in  
the United States next year, but we think if we can come up with a 
good service to offer we can find a niche. We feel there is plenty 
of room in this market for another competitor,'' RPS spokeswoman 
Betsy Momich said. 
</P>
<P>
	UPS is underwhelmed by the incursion.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our take on it is really, simply this: RPS has historically  
attempted to cherry-pick business deliveries while shunning 
residential,'' UPS spokesman Malcolm Berkley said. ``Now it 
professes to have suddenly discovered e-commerce, thinking there 
may be a market for residential deliveries. We're pretty sure we 
know how to make things work, so competition is not an issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Let the battle begin.

<HEADLINE> NYSE Agrees To Oversee Floor Brokers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The New York Stock Exchange failed to enforce  
laws prohibiting brokers on its trading floor from making trades 
that profited them personally, federal regulators said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission, in announcing the  
allegations, also said the NYSE agreed to a settlement of the 
charges in which it admitted no wrongdoing, but agreed to improve 
its oversight and surveillance of floor brokers. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE, the world's largest stock exchange, isn't subject to  
any administrative censure or civil fines under the settlement with 
the SEC, a point stressed by NYSE officials during a Tuesday 
afternoon press conference in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been one of the most difficult challenges we have  
faced,'' said Richard Grasso, chairman of the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public holds this institution to a higher standard, and  
appropriately so. Anytime you hear about an infraction by one, five 
or eight individuals, that's one, five or eight too many,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC said the exchange failed to detect and stop illegal  
trading by floor brokers from 1993 to 1998, noting that the NYSE 
suspended routine independent surveillance for extensive periods, 
including a two-year stretch between 1995 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe we made a resource allocation that was  
appropriate,'' said Edward Kwalwasser, NYSE group executive vice 
president for regulatory matters, defending the NYSE's decision to 
ease surveillance during those periods. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the settlement, the NYSE has agreed to step up its  
oversight, at a cost of about $2 million, Grasso said. 
</P>
<P>
	In February 1998, the SEC and federal criminal prosecutors  
charged two owners of brokerage firm Oakford Corp. and eight NYSE 
floor brokers with conspiring to illegally book personal trades. 
The scheme allegedly netted $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
	They were charged with violating a law designed to prevent  
insider trading by brokers who have access to front-line 
information by being on the floor of the exchange. It was the first 
time federal prosecutors and the SEC pressed charges against anyone 
for making such personal trades. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwalwasser said those charged in the case ``were falsifying  
books and records, and were doing on-floor trading on these books 
and records. The SEC never could have alleged that we at the 
exchange could have condoned any of these activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC's action Tuesday was part of an effort to strengthen  
investor confidence in the fairness of U.S. stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the SEC fined 28 brokerages more than $26 million  
for alleged price-fixing on the Nasdaq Stock Market, closing a 
5-year-old case in which big Wall Street firms were accused of 
cheating investors out of billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's action ``underscores that self-regulatory  
organizations such as the New York Stock Exchange must vigilantly 
enforce the federal securities laws and their own rules,'' SEC 
Enforcement Director Richard Walker said in a statement.

	``Hot Rod Guitar -- The Danny Gatton Anthology'' (Rhino) -- Danny  
Gatton 

</P>
<P>
	The photo on the back of the CD booklet in this anthology  
perfectly captures the accompanying music. It shows Danny Gatton 
playing the guitar, his face in sharp focus, his right hand a blur. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hot Rod Guitar'' is a two-CD set showcasing a sadly obscure  
virtuoso. Gatton's musical vocabulary was encyclopedic, as the 27 
selections here attest. He played jazz, rockabilly, country and the 
blues with breathtaking speed and ease, but such versatility worked 
against him in the marketplace, where he never found a commercial 
niche. 
</P>
<P>
	Gatton spent much of his career relegated to playing bars in  
Washington, D.C. He was 44 before he signed a major-label contract 
and had only a small but devoted following when he committed 
suicide at 49 in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Gatton was no showboat; sometimes, in fact, you wish he would  
hog the spotlight more. On ``Red Label,'' for example, he hangs 
back for the first three minutes before taking a solo that sends 
the tune soaring. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of a stylistic focus makes ``Hot Rod Guitar'' a bit  
scattershot, but there are plenty of performances to intimidate and 
inspire any fledgling guitarist. As Richard Harrington wrote in a 
terrific 1991 article included in the CD booklet, ``Danny Gatton 
can play anybody's music. No one can play his.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The opening bars of ``Harlem Nocturne,'' a 1975 recording,  
quickly establish Gatton's rare and commanding talent. 
``Gearheads,'' ``Notchca Blues'' and a closing live medley are 
likewise dazzling, and it's hard to believe it all comes from the 
same fingers. Most of the set is devoted to instrumentals, and 
that's for the best, because Gatton's talent was beyond words.

	``Loud, Fast &AMP; Out Of Control -- The Wild Sounds Of '50s Rock''  
(Rhino) -- Various Artists 

</P>
<P>
	There was a time when all of rock 'n' roll was regarded with the  
sort of dread now reserved for Marilyn Manson. It's hard to believe 
today, with rock songs being used to sell pickup trucks and tennis 
shoes, but in the 1950s, the genre was considered downright 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	These songs show why. They're raw, brash, noisy, hilarious and  
just plain dumb fun. Rhino compiled 104 tunes from the '50s on four 
CDs, and most of the music is filled with a primal energy found 
today in rap but almost nowhere else on the pop charts. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhino excludes tame doo-wop and prom-rock tunes to focus on the  
revolution '50s rockers wrought. These are the songs loved by 
greasers who carried switchblades, not by the ``Happy Days'' crowd, 
and sound bites from hand-wringing adults bemoaning the popularity 
of the new music provide context for the tunes. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to include such monster hits as ``Jailhouse Rock,''  
``Johnny B. Goode'' and ``Good Golly, Miss Molly'' is questionable, 
because 40 years of heavy exposure has reduced them to lovable 
chestnuts. They sound out of place alongside such tunes as Wanda 
Jackson's politically incorrect ``Fujiyama Mama,'' and The 
Phantom's breathless ``Love Me'' is too outrageous for radio even 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	But in sum, this time capsule re-creates a musical era with  
bracing accuracy. These songs were a cultural watershed, and 
Western Civilization hasn't been the same since. We should be 
grateful.

	``The Ballad of Baby Doe,'' opera in two acts by Douglas Moore &AMP;  
John Latouche (Deutsche Grammophon 2-CD set) -- Beverly Sills, 
Walter Cassel, Frances Bible. New York City Opera Orchestra &AMP; 
Chorus conducted by Emerson Buckley 

</P>
<P>
	Few rereleases of opera recordings have been as eagerly awaited  
as this 1959 classic, which makes its first appearance on CD to 
mark both the anniversary of the recording and the 70th birthday of 
its star, soprano Beverly Sills. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Ballad of Baby Doe'' is one of the sturdiest and most  
appealing of all American operas. Moore's score is tuneful, 
colorful and easily accessible. And Latouche's libretto, like many 
grander operas before it, effectively sets a touching personal 
drama against a vivid historical backdrop. It helps that they took 
their story from real life, embellishing on the saga of Colorado 
silver miner Horace Tabor, who rose overnight to fabulous wealth, 
compromised a political career for love and then saw his fortune 
disappear with the rise of the gold standard. 
</P>
<P>
	Sills, in the title role as the second Mrs. Tabor, is a  
revelation. The performance captures her in her absolute prime, 
before she became a superstar and an institution. There's 
incredible freshness, warmth and poignancy to her portrayal of the 
gold-digger who turns out to have a heart of gold. And she gets to 
sing Moore's loveliest music -- the pensive Willow Song, the letter 
scene, and, above all, her final aria in which she promises the 
dying Horace she will remain true beyond the grave. In real life, 
Tabor's widow kept vigil at his defunct Matchless Mine for more 
than 30 years until her own death from exposure to the cold. 
</P>
<P>
	There are fine performances, too, by baritone Walter Cassel as  
Tabor and mezzo Frances Bible as Augusta Tabor, the discarded first 
wife who is a more complex and sympathetic character than that 
designation usually implies.

	``Il Trittico,'' three one-act operas by Giacomo Puccini (EMI  
Classics 3-CD set) -- Roberto Alagna, Angela Gheorghiu, Carlo 
Guelfi, Maria Guleghina, Neil Shicoff, Cristina Gallardo-Domas, 
Jose Van Dam and Felicity Palmer. London Symphony Orchestra and 
Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by Antonio Pappano 

</P>
<P>
	The husband-and-wife team of soprano Angela Gheorghiu and tenor  
Roberto Alagna get top billing here, but it turns out to be more an 
alphabetical quirk than a reflection of their importance to the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
	Their recent recording of another Puccini work, ``La Rondine,''  
also conducted by Antonio Pappano, was a big hit, so it's natural 
that EMI would want to capitalize on their momentum. 
</P>
<P>
	But of the three one-act operas that Puccini bound together in a  
triptych, they appear not at all in one (``Suor Angelica''), 
fleetingly in another (``Il Tabarro'') and in supporting, roles in 
the third (``Gianni Schicchi''). 
</P>
<P>
	Without their glamour to sustain the three-CD set, we are left  
with a workmanlike but unremarkable series of performances of works 
that have been recorded more memorably by others. In the grisly 
``Tabarro,'' soprano Maria Guleghina is the standout as a 
sympathetic Giorgetta, the unfaithful but conflicted wife of the 
bargeman Michele. He is played by baritone Carlo Guelfi, who sings 
strongly, as does tenor Neil Shicoff as Luigi, her doomed lover. 
</P>
<P>
	The second piece, the fragile ``Suor Angelica,'' rests squarely  
on the capable shoulders of soprano Cristina Gallardo-Domas in the 
title role of the nun who kills herself after learning her 
illegitimate son has died, but then is saved from damnation through 
a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
	In the sunny comedy that ends the triptych, ``Gianni Schicchi,''  
baritone Jose Van Dam hams it up gleefully in the title role of the 
con artist who outfoxes his greedy clients. Gheorghiu gets to sing 
the triptych's most famous moment, the brief aria ``O mio babbino 
caro,'' and she does it very prettily indeed.

	``Bellezza Vocale,'' opera duets with Hei-Kyung Hong and  
Jennifer Larmore (Teldec) -- Munich Radio Orchestra conducted by 
Jesus Lopez Cobos 

</P>
<P>
	This is one of the more attractive in the spate of recent  
gimmick albums pairing two or more famous singers in excerpts from 
familiar repertory. (Think of the Three Tenors, or its flip-side, 
No Tenors Allowed, featuring baritone Thomas Hampson and bass 
Samuel Ramey.) 
</P>
<P>
	Soprano Hei-Kyung Hong and mezzo Jennifer Larmore are both  
estimable artists in their own right. Here they blend their voices 
and artistry to make the whole considerably more than the sum of 
its parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong is the real surprise, here, displaying a range of color,  
vocal dynamics and emotional power exceeding what she has been able 
to exhibit in the opera house, where she has specialized in lyric 
roles. She probably would never sing ``Norma'' in performance, and 
certainly not ``Madame Butterfly,'' but listening to her in 
excerpts makes one a believer. And the unforced purity of her tone 
is ravishing in the Presentation of the Rose scene from Richard 
Strauss' ``Der Rosenkavalier.''

	``On the 6'' (WORK) -- Jennifer Lopez  

</P>
<P>
	The combination of an actor and a song hasn't always been  
successful (remember ``Star Trek'' and ``Proud Mary''?) but it 
looks like there isn't anything Jennifer Lopez can't do. 
</P>
<P>
	Her new CD, ``On the 6,'' showcases a good voice and some great  
tracks. Her first single, ``If You Had My Love,'' is already on the 
charts. Others, like ``Waiting for Tonight'' and ``Open Off My 
Love'' are just begging to hit club playlists. 
</P>
<P>
	While somewhat overproduced musically, the CD blends hip-hop and  
Latin sounds and Lopez sings in English and Spanish. One of the 
tracks is a duet in Spanish with Latin superstar Marc Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
	Other famous names on the project include producers Rodney  
Jerkins, Sean ``Puffy'' Combs, and Emilio Estefan. 
</P>
<P>
	The ballads are weaker than the uptempo songs. Lopez has a good  
voice but it sounds thinner on the slow tracks, as if she's trying 
too hard. On the faster songs, it sounds like she's forgetting to 
try and is just getting carried away by the beat and her own 
enthusiasm.

	Holden said a law is needed to help rid the industry of abuses  
that have tarnished its image and protect fighters from people 
eager to take advantage of their youth, inexperience and sometimes 
lack of education. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a few bad seeds out there that give all of us a bad  
reputation,'' the promoter from Tulsa, Okla., told a House Commerce 
subcommittee. ``The image really does give you a tendency to duck 
your head.''

	Basketball and football draw their rookies from among athletes

even have a high school diploma,'' he said.

	Often, he said, ``They're going in and negotiating their  
contracts with no attorney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The congressional attention comes as a federal grand jury in  
Newark, N.J., investigates whether the International Boxing 
Federation sold rankings and arranged fights for kickbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The IBF and another sanctioning group, the World Boxing  
Association, were not represented at the hearing, but a third 
organization that sets rules and rankings, the World Boxing 
Council, testified in support of legislation written by Sen. John 
McCain, R-Ariz. and sponsored in the House by Rep. Mike Oxley, 
R-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxley said the goal was to ``weed out corruption in boxing'' by  
requiring promoters and organizers of major boxing events to 
disclose more financial information and to inform state boxing 
commissions of charges, costs and fees they take out of boxers' 
purses. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, under the bill no boxing contract could extend  
longer than a year, making it more difficult to obligate fighters 
to long-term deals in exchange for a shot at a world title. Also, 
no contract could require a fighter to hire a manager associated 
with the promoter. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregory Sirb, boxing commissioner for Pennsylvania and president  
of the Association of Boxing Commissioners, said changes being 
pushed by McCain and Oxley ``will ultimately elevate professional 
boxing to the level that other major sports in this country 
currently enjoy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation is named after Muhammad Ali, who appeared before  
a Senate committee this year to lend his support. 
</P>
<P>
	A version of the bill passed the Senate last year, but time ran  
out without action by the House. This year's version is awaiting 
action by the full Senate and just beginning its process in the 
House with a hearing before a House Commerce subcommittee.

<HEADLINE> Cubans Swim to U.S. Soil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Six Cubans jumped from a 14-foot  
rowboat about 150 yards from shore in a desperate attempt to reach 
the United States on Tuesday, but only two made it to land, dodging 
Coast Guard and police boats. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to keep the Cubans from reaching shore were loudly  
protested afterward by hundreds of people, who accused the Coast 
Guard of brutality and insensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very dark day not just for Miami but for the  
country,'' said Miami Mayor Joe Carollo. 
</P>
<P>
	Under U.S. policy, Cubans who reach American shores are allowed  
to stay and eventually get work permits, but those found at sea -- 
even a few yards offshore -- are usually returned to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd gathered on the beach and cheered the six refugees  
Tuesday afternoon as they frantically changed directions each time 
one of the four boats neared. 
</P>
<P>
	The scene in Surfside, a small community north of Miami Beach,  
unfolded on live television as Coast Guard officers attempted to 
block the Cubans from getting to shore. 
</P>
<P>
	As one man reached shore, and then a second, some people cursed  
and screamed at police and the Coast Guard while offering words of 
support to the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the Cubans who made it on the beach was quickly  
surrounded by several police officers. As the officers were about 
to grab him, he darted and then dove forward, landing face down in 
the sand. He was immediately handcuffed as waves receded past his 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	The four others were taken into custody by the Coast Guard,  
which used water hoses on the boat occupants to try and push them 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't understand this,'' witness Enrique Pollack told  
WTVJ-TV. ``I remember the images of people trying to cross the 
Berlin Wall and we're acting like Gestapo or the Stasi, keeping 
them from coming to freedom. They've been suffering for 40 years. 
Enough is enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About an hour later, protesters gathered outside the Coast Guard  
station in Miami Beach, waving Cuban flags and yelling ``You almost 
killed them'' and ``Free them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 1,000 protesters shut down a causeway to Miami  
Beach in the midst of rush hour, marching across with Cuban flags 
and signs saying ``Free Cuba.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several Cuban exile groups Tuesday night called for  
demonstrations and sought the immediate release of all six 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	A Coast Guard spokesman said the agency will investigate how it  
dealt with the Cuban refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Coast Guard is very concerned about the safety of people  
at sea, and we also have the role of enforcing United States law,'' 
said Lt. Ron Labrec.

<HEADLINE> CMGI Buying Compaq's AltaVista </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Internet investment company CMGI Inc. intends to  
create a Web powerhouse to rival the likes of Yahoo! and Excite 
with its $2.5 billion purchase of Compaq Computer Corp.'s AltaVista 
Web destination. 
</P>
<P>
	But CMGI has its work cut out for it. By agreeing Tuesday to buy  
a controlling stake in AltaVista, the Andover, Mass., company aims 
to attract far more visitors to the site, a persistent laggard in 
popularity, in part by creating links to its own array of Web 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
	While known as an aggressive manager of promising Web  
businesses, many of CMGI's Web ventures themselves are relatively 
obscure. Some analysts wondered whether the new backers would 
sustain a higher level of advertising for the AltaVista brand, 
which is less well-known than archrivals that are ingrained in the 
public consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're playing catchup,'' said Barry Jaruzelski, a partner  
with the Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton management consulting firm. ``It's 
not like everyone is going to sit idly by and let them take market 
share from them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, investors applauded the deal, particularly given CMGI's  
plans to sell AltaVista stock to the public and exploit the 
investment community's powerful appetite for Internet-related 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	CMGI's stock shot up 13 percent or $12.62 1/2 a share at $110.31 1/4  
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. pushing the value of the deal up from 
its original $2.3 billion. On the New York Stock Exchange, shares 
of Compaq rose 5 percent, up $1.06. 1/4 at $23.37 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	CMGI, which is buying a controlling 83 percent stake in  
AltaVista from Compaq, plans to use it as a hub to lead surfers to 
other corners of its online empire, including stakes in 
lesser-known properties such as Ancestry.com, CarParts.com, 
Furniture.com and Raging Bull, a financial investment forum. 
</P>
<P>
	AltaVista, in addition to its widely used search engine, offers  
news, stock quotes and shopping services and took in about $40 
million in revenue last year. But it ranked only No. 15 among 
networks of Web sites last month, with 9.5 million visitors, 
according to the Media Metrix research firm. Yahoo!, the most 
popular, drew 31.1 million visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say a key reason is that Compaq, since it acquired  
AltaVista as part of its $9 billion purchase of Digital Equipment 
Corp. last year, failed to spend enough money to advertise the site 
as more than just a search tool for finding other sites on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The vast majority of visitors to AltaVista are just using it to  
search elsewhere, said Mark Mooradian, an industry analyst with the 
Jupiter Communications research firm. That means Web visitors don't 
spend a lot of time checking out AltaVista's other services and, 
importantly from a revenue standpoint, paid advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
	To help popularize the site, CMGI and Compaq plan to each  
contribute $50 million to promote it. Analysts said that was an 
important first step, considering that Compaq spent only about $1 
million last year for AltaVista ads. An advertising campaign broke 
on Monday as Compaq unveiled new services for AltaVista. 
</P>
<P>
	But they cautioned there's only so much room at the top for  
comprehensive Web destinations offering a range of services. 
Yahoo!, Excite and Netscape and others already are firmly 
entrenched. Despite heavy promotions of its Go Network destination, 
Walt Disney Co. is having a difficult time in challenging the most 
popular rival sites, Mooradian noted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm less interested in how much AltaVista is going to try to  
beat these other guys at their own game,'' he said, ``and more 
interested in how they can rebrand themselves into a different type 
of service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One important opportunity is for CMGI to offer the AltaVista  
technology as a search tool for other Web sites, now that AltaVista 
is no longer controlled by Compaq, a potential Internet rival. 
</P>
<P>
	CMGI officials also said they hoped to build on AltaVista's  
strong presence in overseas markets, where it is ranked No. 2 as a 
Web-search engine. 
</P>
<P>
	For its part Compaq, the world's second-largest computer maker,  
hopes to sell more machines to CMGI's Internet companies to host 
their Web sites and conduct online transactions. The companies also 
will team up to create custom-tailored Web sites for Compaq's 
business customers. 
</P>
<P>
	CMGI intends to spin off AltaVista in an initial public stock  
sale at a date soon to be set, CMGI chief executive David Wetherell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	CMGI is paying 19 million of its common shares as well as  
preferred shares equivalent to 1.8 million common shares. In 
addition, CMGI is paying Compaq another $220 million over three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	CMGI plans to keep AltaVista's 475 employees in Palo Alto,  
Calif. Rod Schrock will remain on to run AltaVista.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Proposes Medicare Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Promising better Medicare benefits to match  
scientific advances, President Clinton today proposed free 
preventive health services plus a $1,000-a-year prescription drug 
benefit for older and disabled Americans -- at the cost of a monthly 
$24 premium. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a drug benefit our seniors can afford at a price  
America can afford,'' Clinton said, announcing the second half of 
his long-awaited proposal to bolster Medicare for the baby boomers' 
coming retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	The new drug benefit, if approved by Congress, would be  
available as an option for those 65 and older and for the disabled 
beginning in 2002. It would cost the government $118 billion over 
10 years, administration officials estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	The president had already outlined plans to use billions in  
budget surplus dollars to secure the health program's solvency. 
But, he said today, ``securing Medicare is not enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``To modernize Medicare, my plan will also create a much better  
match between the benefits of modern science and the benefits 
offered by Medicare. It will provide for more preventive care and 
help our seniors afford prescription drugs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coverage would start with the first dollar of prescription  
costs, with no deductible. The government would pay half the first 
$2,000 of drug costs in a year. Any drug costs above $2,000 in any 
given year would have to be paid entirely by the beneficiary. 
</P>
<P>
	The monthly premium would rise gradually to $44 and the $2,000  
cap would rise to $5,000 by 2008. In that year, a beneficiary would 
pay $528 to have the government pay for up to $2,500 worth of 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of that premium increase would account for inflation, the  
White House said, adding that the peak $44 fee is still one-half to 
one-third the typical cost of private drug coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare recipients already are paying a $45.50 monthly premium  
to cover doctor's office visits. 
</P>
<P>
	Beneficiaries with annual incomes below $11,000 per individual  
or $17,000 per couple would pay no premium or cost-sharing for drug 
coverage up to the annual caps. Other low-income Medicare 
recipients would get help paying the premium. 
</P>
<P>
	In other areas, Clinton asked beneficiaries to contribute more  
from their own pockets, including a new 20 percent co-payment for 
the cost of clinical lab tests and inflation indexing of the 
deductible for doctor's office visits and other outpatient 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The outpatient deductible is currently $100 annually. It would  
likely rise by $2 to $3 a year along with prices, administration 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beneficiaries who choose to join private managed care health  
plans that participate in Medicare, however, would pay lower 
monthly premiums if those plans can provide care for less money. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, co-payments and deductibles for preventive medical care,  
such as mammograms, prostate cancer screenings and diabetes 
management, would be eliminated for all Medicare beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes no sense for Medicare to put up roadblocks to these  
screenings and then turn around and pick up the hospital bills that 
screenings might have avoided,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare payments to health care providers, including hospitals  
would be curbed under the president's plan, contributing, more than 
$30 billion in savings over the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and Senate Majority Leader  
Trent Lott, R-Miss., issued a joint statement today praising 
Clinton's effort to provide better drug coverage for retirees but 
questioned the need to give government subsidies for all 39 million 
elderly and disabled Medicare beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	About two-thirds of those 65 and older already have some drug  
coverage -- through benefits offered by former employers, private 
insurance policies they purchase on their own, or HMOs that 
participate in Medicare. Many Republicans favor more limited help 
for those who most need it. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we search for a bipartisan solution to expand access to  
affordable prescription drugs, we should be careful not to force 
those who already have prescription drug coverage to accept a 
government-run plan that costs more and provides fewer choices,'' 
the Republican leaders said in their statement. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the administration released new predictions of  
federal government surpluses -- $1.1 trillion more than expected -- 
that Clinton said would make it easier to avert a cash shortage 
likely to face the health insurance program for the elderly and 
disabled in 2015. 
</P>
<P>
	The president proposed using $794 billion of those surpluses for  
Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Other savings, he said, will come from changes in the way  
Medicare does business with health care providers -- for example, 
replacing complex government payment formulas with competitive 
bidding for some products and services such as medical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear whether the president's plan can win the public  
and industry support he will need to get politically perilous 
Medicare changes through a Congress already nervous about the 2000 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Association of Retired Persons, the nation's  
largest organization of older adults, supports the concept of a new 
Medicare prescription drug benefit. But senior AARP lobbyist 
Patricia Smith said among outstanding concerns is how much Medicare 
clients will be asked to pay out of pocket. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will Medicare beneficiaries judge this to be affordable? I  
think the only way we're going to find out is through the political 
process,'' said Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, drug makers are worried about how the government will  
decide which drugs to cover at what prices. And other health care 
providers, including hospitals and HMOs, worry that Medicare money 
to pay for drugs will be squeezed from their own budgets even as 
they struggle to adjust to payment cuts Congress approved two years 
ago to help balance the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the main challenges the Clinton administration faced in  
trying to design a Medicare drug benefit was to make it fit 
Medicare's budget, while also making it a better deal for senior 
citizens than private supplemental insurance known as Medigap that 
many buy now. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug coverage accounts for about $90 a month of premiums charged  
for most Medigap policies, which generally cover 50 percent of 
prescription costs after a $250 deductible is reached. Annual caps 
on Medigap drug coverage vary up to a maximum of $3,000.

<HEADLINE> P. Morris Retail Incentive Halted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Cigarette market leader Philip Morris  
has been ordered to stop an incentive program for stores that 
competitors contend unfairly squeezed their brands from visible 
displays to the bottom shelf. 
</P>
<P>
	The preliminary injunction was issued Tuesday by U.S. District  
Court Judge Frank Bullock Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue was Philip Morris' ``Retail Leaders'' program. Three  
other cigarette companies claim the program forces retailers to 
relegate their brands to the back shelves or display spots on or 
near the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The injunction was issued until a trial can be held on a lawsuit  
filed by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Lorillard Tobacco Co. and Brown 
and Williamson Tobacco Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the judge's order will help preserve retail  
competition while the case moves forward to trial,'' R.J. Reynolds 
spokesman John Singleton said. ``The case ultimately will go to 
trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock said in his order that the lawsuit involved all  
cigarette sales in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris had 53 percent of retail cigarette sales in the  
nation, Bullock said, roughly twice the share of the nearest 
competitor, R.J. Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past two years, some 6 million adult smokers -- 14 percent  
of the smoking population -- have switched brands. Store displays 
are important ways for cigarette companies to capture switchers, 
the judge said in his ruling.

<P>
	``The competition for switchers and occasional use purchasers  
occurs primarily in so-called pack outlets, which are comprised of 
convenience stores and gas stations, where approximately 60 percent 
of all cigarettes are sold,'' Bullock said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales to switchers occur largely because of ads and product  
displays on the back bar shelf behind the sales counter, the 
opinion said, and companies that don't have that space can't 
compete adequately. 
</P>
<P>
	Lorillard attorney Jim Williams said he expects the trial to  
begin in eight to 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly means we've got more of a level playing field  
while we prepare to go to trial,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris contended the dispute didn't belong in court and  
that its competitors were sore because Philip Morris made a crafty 
business decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris' top trade marketing executive testified at a  
hearing earlier this month that his company would face 
``administrative chaos'' if Bullock ordered ``Retail Leaders'' 
dismantled. 
</P>
<P>
	An injunction would compel Philip Morris to send sales  
representatives to 80,000 retail outlets nationwide that have 
signed ``Retail Leaders'' contracts, vice president of trade 
marketing Barry Hopkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the outlets represent just 37.5 percent of Philip Morris'  
213,000 accounts, they account for 58 percent of the company's 
cigarette sales volume, he said. The company has placed more than 
50,000 cigarette displays at a cost in the tens of millions of 
dollars, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock said the company hadn't presented ``any evidence that it  
will be significantly harmed by the issuance of an injunction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're disappointed that the court entered an order calling for  
even limited changes to one level of the Retail Leaders program,'' 
Philip Morris spokesman Mike Pfeil said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to believe that in the final analysis, Philip  
Morris' Retail Leaders program will be found to be completely 
lawful.''

<HEADLINE> Global Warming Rate May Be Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The rate of global warming and sea level rise  
may be slightly higher than predicted during the next century based 
on new information gathered by the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change, says a climate scientist who analyzed the 
preliminary data. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings are likely to add to the controversy over the  
impact of heat-trapping pollution in the atmosphere and to what 
extent it will affect climate and sea levels worldwide in the 
decades to come. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom M.L. Wigley, a National Center for Atmospheric Research  
scientist, said Tuesday that his new estimates of warming are based 
on new emission scenarios developed by the IPCC, the group of 
scientists, organized by the United Nations, that has been studying 
climate change. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the group estimated human releases of heat-trapping  
``greenhouse gases'' would increase the mean global surface 
temperatures 1.4 to 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the next 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wigley, in a report released by the Pew Center on Global  
Climate Change, said the IPCC's latest estimates on the impact of 
sulfur dioxide releases suggest the mean warming of the globe's 
surface will be slightly higher, 2.3 to 7.3 degrees Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated sea level rise also would be higher, from a mean  
global range of 5 to 37 inches to a range of 7 to 39 inches, Wigley 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The new estimates are primarily based on a finding of  
significantly lower levels of sulfur dioxide emissions than 
previously assumed, Wigley said. Sulfate particles cool the 
atmosphere, mitigating the impact of the greenhouse gases, mainly 
carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels. Sulfur emissions are 
dropping because of the push to reduce acid rain and other surface 
air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new research suggests the likelihood of slightly larger  
changes in temperature and sea level rise than projected in the 
most recent IPCC assessment,'' said Eileen Claussen, executive 
director of the Pew Center on Climate Change. 
</P>
<P>
	While the report reflects only Wigley's analysis of the  
preliminary IPCC data, Claussen said the analysis has been 
subjected to ``extensive peer review'' by a range of prominent 
climate scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	Wigley, a leading scientists on climate change, formerly was  
director of climatic research at the University of East Anglia, 
Great Britain. He now is a senior scientist at the National Center 
for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Oppenheimer, an Environmental Defense Fund climate  
scientist, said Wigley's findings are significant because some 
skeptics of climate change contend there has been a steady downward 
trend in projections of how much warming will occur. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, the IPCC predicted a warming of 3.6 to 9.9 degrees  
Fahrenheit, but produced lower figures in 1992 and a gain in 1995, 
said Oppenheimer. He said the decline was used by some climate 
change skeptics to suggest there may be little or no problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Wigley's analysis ``is a reminder that the supposed downward  
trend is a figment of people's imagination,'' said Oppenheimer, who 
was not involved in the Pew Center study. 
</P>
<P>
	But climate change skeptic John Christy, a professor of  
atmospheric science at the University of Alabama-Huntsville, said 
the impact of sulfates is still not well enough known and only 
``one component of a very complicated system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an interesting notion that this particular single  
component might have been overestimated before. But there are 
larger questions. For example, in the last 20 years, why has the 
troposphere not warmed and even the surface temperatures are not 
warming at the alarming rates'' projected, Christy said in a 
telephone interview.

</P>
<P>
	STOCKTON, Calif. (AP) -- Samdach Vira Bhante, a Cambodian monk  
who attained the highest spiritual status in Buddhism and advised 
leaders of Cambodia and India, died Saturday. He was 110. 
</P>
<P>
	Bhante served as a spiritual adviser to Cambodia's King Norodom  
Sihanouk and kept watch at the deathbed of India's first prime 
minister, Jawaharalal Nehru. 
</P>
<P>
	Sihanouk sent Bhante to see how schools were run in the United  
States and invited him often to meditations and conferences around 
the world. But the monk kept a simple lifestyle, giving up his 
possessions, cigarettes and alcohol and eating mostly fruits and 
vegetables, never past noon. 
</P>
<P>
	Bhante came to the United States for a quiet life of meditation  
with his relatives, most of whom arrived here as refugees from the 
war in Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
	He was called on to conduct the spiritual cleansing at a  
Stockton school after a1989 massacre that left five children dead. 
He also was asked to build a temple for the city's growing 
Cambodian community -- estimated at more than 16,000.

</P>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Allan Carr, the writer-producer who  
brought the teeny-bopping play ``Grease'' to the big screen and won 
a 1984 Tony award for producing the Broadway hit ``La Cage aux 
Folles,'' died Monday. He was 62. 
</P>
<P>
	``Grease'' earned Carr several awards, including producer of the  
year from the national Association of Theatre Owners and two 
People's Choice awards for best movie and most popular film. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1969, he co-produced his first film, the coming-of-age comedy  
``The First Time,'' starring Jacqueline Bisset. 
</P>
<P>
	The next year, he co-produced the comedy ``C.C. and Company,''  
starring former quarterback Joe Namath as a motorcyclist who 
battles a biker gang that menaces a fashion journalist played by 
Ann-Margret. 
</P>
<P>
	After the success of ``Grease,'' Carr co-produced the 1980  
musical ``Can't Stop the Music,'' which starred the disco band The 
Village People. Carr returned to Rydell High in 1982 with the 
critically panned ``Grease 2,'' starring Michelle Pfieffer. 
</P>
<P>
	He continued producing stage shows while making movies, and in  
1984 won a Tony Award for producing that year's best musical, ``La 
Cage aux Folles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That same year, the producer made his last two films, the spy  
comedy ``Cloak and Dagger'' and sex farce ``Where the Boys Are 
'84.''

<P>
	YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) -- Catholicos Garegin I, the leader of the  
Armenian Apostolic Church, died Tuesday of larynx cancer. He was 
66. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this summer, the Armenian church canceled a trip by Pope  
John Paul II to Armenia because of the Catholicos' failing health. 
The Vatican had scheduled a July papal visit to Armenia as part of 
John Paul's efforts to improve relations with other Christian 
denominations. 
</P>
<P>
	Garegin studied at a seminary in Beirut, Lebanon, where he later  
became director. He became a deacon in 1949 and took a vow of 
celibacy in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	He studied in the theology department at Oxford University in  
1957-58, and in the 1970s he led church dioceses in the United 
States, Iran and India. 
</P>
<P>
	He took the name Garegin after an earlier Armenian spiritual  
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Garegin was elected Catholicos in April 1995, succeeding Vazgen  
I, who had held the post for 40 years.

Observer in the 1950s and 1960s, died Sunday. She was 93. 
</P>
<P>
	Garrison was asked to head the food section in 1953. She stayed  
in the job until 1966, then wrote a regular column until 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Famous for her recipes for pound cake, fruit cake, fudge,  
biscuits, orange marmalade and maple-walnut bars, Garrison 
published several small cookbooks before a larger volume, ``It's 
Not Gourmet -- It's Better,'' came out in 1978.

	CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- Michael Hooker, a chancellor at the  
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and hailed as a 
visionary who wanted to use technology to change education, died 
Tuesday of cancer. He was 53. 
</P>
<P>
	Hooker rose through the ranks of academia, from a teaching post  
at Harvard to the presidency of Vermont's Bennington College at age 
37. After three years at the helm of the University of 
Massachusetts, he returned to Chapel Hill as the eighth chancellor 
of the nation's oldest public university. 
</P>
<P>
	An expert on medical ethics, Hooker wrote written scholarly  
articles on applied ethics in business and the ethics of biological 
warfare. He chaired a biotechnology advisory panel for the

</P>
<P>
	Lee co-starred in 13 of the 21 RKO films popularized by the  
comedy team of Bert Wheeler and Robert Woolsey. She made 28 films 
in her lifetime, the last of those being ``Repent at Leisure'' in 
1941. Two years prior, she appeared with Ball in ``Twelve Crowded

	LA JOLLA, Calif. (AP) -- Keith F. Lister, a publisher credited  
with expanding the San Diego Daily Transcript into a venerable 
business and financial newspaper, died Saturday. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	The former banker bought the Daily Transcript in 1972 and worked  
to shape the paper into a local version of the Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	Lister sold the Transcript in 1986 but was publisher for seven  
more years. 
</P>
<P>
	He ventured into publishing after retiring at 55 from his first  
career in banking. He had founded Lister Investment Co. and went on

	HENDERSONVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Marshall Wayne, an Olympic diver  
whose gold and silver medals in the 1936 Games in Berlin, died June 
16. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	His sister, Dever Antes, said Wayne spoke with Hitler after he

<HEADLINE>  World Cup Surpasses Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The early success of the Women's World Cup has caught even its  
chief organizer off guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Marla Messing, president of the organizing committee for the  
three-week tournament, said Tuesday the tournament already 
surpassed many of her expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have always believed in the potential of this tournament to  
be very successful, a breakthrough event for women's sports,'' 
Messing said during a conference call. ``But we are frankly in awe 
of what has happened so far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What has happened so far is:  
</P>
<P>
	--More than 570,000 tickets sold for the tournament.  
</P>
<P>
	--An average of 65,000 fans at each of the three U.S. games.  
</P>
<P>
	--Average attendance at doubleheaders not involving the U.S. team  
of more than 21,000, more than 11 of what the 30 major league 
baseball teams currently average. 
</P>
<P>
	--Strong television ratings, particularly on ESPN and ESPN2.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a demonstration that the tournament as a whole is  
being embraced by the fans, not just the U.S. team,'' Messing said. 
She called attendance at the non-U.S. games ``our greatest 
achievement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overall ticket sales are at 570,000, far beyond early  
projections, and Messing said 600,000 is a possibility if the 
American team advances further. On Tuesday, organizers made 
available nearly 14,000 more seats at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium in 
Landover, Md., for Thursday's quarterfinals. The United States 
plays Germany and Brazil faces Nigeria in that doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally, the stadium was downsized to 41,000 seats. But  
ticket demand has exceeded that figure after the U.S. team clinched 
a spot in the quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the other venues, Wednesday's quarterfinals -- Norway vs.  
Sweden and Russia vs. China -- has sold 18,000 seats in San Jose, 
Calif. Sunday's semifinal at Foxboro, Mass., has sold 22,000. The 
semifinal at Stanford, Calif., where the Americans would play if 
they advance, has sold more than 40,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The final at the Rose Bowl on July 10 has sold more than 60,000.  
Capacity is 86,773 for soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN's audience for last Thursday's U.S.-Nigeria game drew a  
1.85 rating, the second-highest soccer match on the network, behind 
the men's World Cup semifinal last year between Brazil and the 
Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Sunday's U.S.-North Korea game on ESPN2 got a 1.96 rating,  
the highest for any soccer match on ESPN2 and the fifth 
most-watched event on the network. 
</P>
<P>
	Messing was asked about complaints made by the Russians and  
Chinese concerning travel. Should China make the final, it will 
have traversed the continent four times. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult to put on a World Cup in the U.S. because the  
country so big, with the (four) different time zones,'' she said. 
``We did the schedule before we knew where any team would fall in 
the draw'' except for the United States. ``FIFA gave us some 
guidelines. We met those. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reality of hosting the World Cup in the United States is  
the travel will be so much more.''

<HEADLINE> SBC-Ameritech Merger Plan Gets OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators said Tuesday they are  
prepared to approve a merger between SBC Communications and 
Ameritech Corp., provided the two stick to a set of conditions they 
proposed to the government. 
</P>
<P>
	A merger of the two corporations would form the nation's largest  
local phone company. The proposed conditions are intended to ease 
misgivings of the Federal Communications Commission, which wants to 
ensure healthy competition in local markets after such mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed guidelines, SBC-Ameritech would enter 30 new  
markets within 30 months to compete with established local phone 
companies. It also would establish a separate subsidiary to provide 
advanced telecommunications services such as high-speed Internet 
access. At least 10 percent of its upgraded services would go 
toward low-income regions, according to the conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Failure to meet the conditions could mean stiff penalties. Just  
for failing to meet the new market deadline, the companies could 
face a $40 million-a-market fine, up to a $1.2 billion cap. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC staff has yet to see a formal written proposal, said  
Robert Atkinson, deputy chief of the commission's Common Carrier 
Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	``But based on extraordinarily lengthy discussions and meetings  
(with the two companies), if there are no surprises in this 
document when we get it, ... then I can fully support the 
package,'' Atkinson said. He said that means he would recommend the 
merger's approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the FCC receives a formal report, the conditions will be  
open for public comment and, ultimately, a vote by the full 
commission. Atkinson said he does not know how soon that will be. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Chairman William Kennard said in a statement that he is  
``encouraged by SBC and Ameritech's commitment to open their 
markets to competition and their agreement to suffer stiff 
penalties if they do not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Atkinson expressed confidence the new company will meet all  
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't expect them to pay anything,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	SBC Chairman Edward E. Whitacre Jr. said the proposed merger  
conditions ``puts consumers first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ameritech Chairman Richard C. Notebaert also noted his  
satisfaction with the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our companies have gone through an unprecedented and  
exhaustive level of review,'' he said in a statement. ``The net 
result is a set of conditions that are reasonable and fair for 
consumers, for competitors and for the companies.''

<HEADLINE>  Cyclist Cleared for Tour de France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Richard Virenque, the most prominent rider banned  
from the Tour de France because of drug accusations, was cleared 
Tuesday to compete in cycling's showcase race. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Cycling Union, the world governing body,  
ordered Tour de France organizers to readmit the French rider. 
</P>
<P>
	``We only have one reaction, and that's joy -- joy that Richard  
can take part in a race that he loves, that he loves 
passionately,'' said Gilbert Collard, Virenque's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Virenque was among the riders barred earlier this month. But the  
cycling body cited a technical error as the reason for the 
reversal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tour de France starts this weekend. Also banned from riding  
by the organizers are the entire TVM and Vini Caldirola squads. 
Virenque rides for the Italian Polti team. 
</P>
<P>
	When the ban was announced, race director Jean-Marie Leblanc  
said Virenque was ``not welcome'' because ``his presence would be 
incompatible with the image of the Tour, and the one we want to 
preserve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Virenque immediately said he would appeal. He and Leblanc gave  
evidence to the UCI disciplinary commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The world body stressed its decision ``should be considered as  
being purely technical and based on strict respect for 
regulations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The UCI ``is nevertheless pleased to see the principles of  
uncompromising professional and sporting ethics adopted by the Tour 
de France organizers in its rules, which are in no way put in doubt 
for the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Virenque was part of the Festina squad, which was at the center  
of the drug controversy that overshadowed last year's race. 
</P>
<P>
	While several of his former Festina colleagues admitted using  
drugs, Virenque denies knowingly taking banned substances. 
</P>
<P>
	French authorities have placed Virenque and former teammates  
Laurent Roux and Philippe Gaumont under investigation, a step away 
from a formal charge. Roux and Gaumont were also barred from the 
race.

<HEADLINE> Carreras Must Pay For No Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) -- Jose Carreras must pay damages to a  
German concert agent for canceling a performance last year, a judge 
ruled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said the tenor did not provide an adequate reason for  
not showing up for the July 18 performance, and must reimburse 
Matthias Hoffmann. No amount was immediately set. 
</P>
<P>
	The William Morris Agency, which handles Carreras in the United  
States, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffmann has organized concerts in Germany for Carreras, Luciano  
Pavarotti and Placido Domingo, among others. But the stars largely 
avoided coming to Germany after Hoffmann came under investigation 
in 1998 for tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffmann was charged with funneling huge sums of money for the  
stars and himself to fake companies set up outside Germany. He was 
convicted in December of failing to pay taxes on $9 million and 
sentenced to nearly six years in prison. He is free pending appeal.

<HEADLINE> Wimbledon Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- A British judge is ditching his court  
room for Centre Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Patrick Hooton was to preside in a four-day sexual  
indecency case starting Monday. But he postponed the trial until 
December because he had tickets for Wimbledon on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some months ago, I arranged to take this Friday off and start  
four weeks holiday immediately afterwards,'' the judge told 
startled lawyers at Winchester Crown Court. ``I won't be doing 
anything this Friday apart from sitting in Wimbledon watching the 
tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless I can send the jury out first thing on Thursday morning  
I can't start this trial. It would not be right on the outside 
chance to make everyone feel that they have to rush it. 
</P>
<P>
	Hooton said ordinarily he would have taken the time out of his  
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it's the tickets to Wimbledon,'' he said. ``I am never  
likely to get the chance of them again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While not objecting to the move, defense lawyer Robert Conway  
still had something of a gripe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wimbledon is in fact on my doorstep,'' Conway said. ``But I  
can't get tickets.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FERGIE SIGHTING:* Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, showed  
up at Wimbledon on Tuesday but her name was not on the list of 
royal guests. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was not here officially as a guest of the club today,'' an  
All England club spokesman said. ``She was a guest of a private 
member.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said Fergie was a guest of Mark McCormack, head of  
IMG, the American sports marketing company. 
</P>
<P>
	The duchess arrived in a chauffeur-driven car outside the gate  
reserved for corporate guests. Asked which match she had come to 
see, she said only, ``Tennis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But she didn't see any tennis. With rain still falling, she left  
just after 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Also spotted at Wimbledon were Hollywood actor Michael Douglas  
and his latest companion, 29-year-old Welsh actress Catherine Zeta 
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
                            	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LONE RESULT:* There may not have been any play at Wimbledon on  
Tuesday. But there was one result. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Humphries of the United States and Romania's Catalina  
Cristea retired from the mixed doubles because the American has a 
hamstring injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The result was that Zimbabwean brother and sister Wayne and Cara  
Black advanced to the third round on a 6-2, 4-6, 4-2 scoreline. The 
game was held over from Monday and should have been finished 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *JELENA VS. STEFFI:* Australian 16-year-old sensation Jelena  
Dokic has been practicing with seven-time Wimbledon champion Steffi 
Graf. The two could meet in Saturday's final. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been hitting and helping each other out to warm up  
each other,'' Dokic said. ``She is a great player and a real pro.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In practice she gives me tips on what I should work on and  
things to do. And I have to say she's one of the best players I 
have spoken to and met.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And a final between the two?  
</P>
<P>
	``It will be tough ... but I'm not worried about that,'' Dokic  
said. ``I have a lot of matches here to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MUSCLES EVERYONE:* Mary Pierce has admitted using the  
muscle-building supplement Creatine. But after losing her 
fourth-round match Monday to Jelena Dokic, she was in no mood to 
talk about it any more. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether Creatine had helped her game, the American-raised  
French player turned toward a Wimbledon official and said, ``I 
think we can go into (questions in) French.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the reporter repeated the question, Pierce insisted: ``Can  
we go into French, please.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The British press has focused on Pierce's new muscular build and  
her use of the supplements.

<HEADLINE>  World Cup Surpasses Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The early success of the Women's World Cup has caught even its  
chief organizer off guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Marla Messing, president of the organizing committee for the  
three-week tournament, said Tuesday the tournament already 
surpassed many of her expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have always believed in the potential of this tournament to  
be very successful, a breakthrough event for women's sports,'' 
Messing said during a conference call. ``But we are frankly in awe 
of what has happened so far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What has happened so far is:  
</P>
<P>
	--More than 570,000 tickets sold for the tournament.  
</P>
<P>
	--An average of 65,000 fans at each of the three U.S. games.  
</P>
<P>
	--Average attendance at doubleheaders not involving the U.S. team  
of more than 21,000, more than 11 of what the 30 major league 
baseball teams currently average. 
</P>
<P>
	--Strong television ratings, particularly on ESPN and ESPN2.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a demonstration that the tournament as a whole is  
being embraced by the fans, not just the U.S. team,'' Messing said. 
She called attendance at the non-U.S. games ``our greatest 
achievement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overall ticket sales are at 570,000, far beyond early  
projections, and Messing said 600,000 is a possibility if the 
American team advances further. On Tuesday, organizers made 
available nearly 14,000 more seats at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium in 
Landover, Md., for Thursday's quarterfinals. The United States 
plays Germany and Brazil faces Nigeria in that doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally, the stadium was downsized to 41,000 seats. But

a spot in the quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the other venues, Wednesday's quarterfinals -- Norway vs.  
Sweden and Russia vs. China -- has sold 18,000 seats in San Jose, 
Calif. Sunday's semifinal at Foxboro, Mass., has sold 22,000. The 
semifinal at Stanford, Calif., where the Americans would play if 
they advance, has sold more than 40,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The final at the Rose Bowl on July 10 has sold more than 60,000.  
Capacity is 86,773 for soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN's audience for last Thursday's U.S.-Nigeria game drew a  
1.85 rating, the second-highest soccer match on the network, behind 
the men's World Cup semifinal last year between Brazil and the 
Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Sunday's U.S.-North Korea game on ESPN2 got a 1.96 rating,  
the highest for any soccer match on ESPN2 and the fifth 
most-watched event on the network. 
</P>

Chinese concerning travel. Should China make the final, it will 
have traversed the continent four times.

<HEADLINE> Astronomers Oppose Prison's Light </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Vt. (AP) -- Voters on Tuesday decided the fate of a  
prison project that some astronomers say will pollute the sky with 
light and spoil the view of the heavens from an 80-year-old 
observatory. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the mother of observatories for amateur telescoping,''  
said Maryann Arrien, president of Springfield Telescope Makers, 
which maintains the hilltop observatory three miles from the 
proposed 350-bed state prison. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for accepting the prison, Springfield would get  
about $7 million in community improvements. Supporters said the 
town, which is in southeastern Vermont on the New Hampshire line 
and has a population of about 10,000, needs the help and the 160 
jobs the prison would bring. 
</P>
<P>
	The observatory is a national landmark known as Stellafane --  
Latin for ``Shrine to the Stars.'' It is the site of a conference 
that attracts more than 2,000 amateur astronomers every summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Arrien's group collected 700 signatures on a petition  
against the prison. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials said the prison lights would not ruin star  
viewing and noted there are small towns that are closer to the 
observatory than the prison would be. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Arrien said she fears the prison's lights would have a much  
greater effect because they would stay on all night, while lights 
from the towns usually go off.

	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Another rainy day at Wimbledon,  
another opportunity to ask: Why not a retractable roof? 
</P>
<P>
	The answer: No.  
</P>
<P>
	It's not a question of technology. It's mostly tradition and the  
English patience with bad weather that keeps it from happening, 
says Paul McNamee, director of the Australian Open and a two-time 
Wimbledon doubles champion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australian Open's venue, Melbourne Park, includes one  
stadium with a retractable roof and another under construction. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Wimbledon, I don't think turf management was the issue,''  
McNamee said. ``I think protecting the tradition of Centre Court 
was the uppermost motive ... but you have to think about the 
spectators as well in a very competitive environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although this year's first week at Wimbledon was sunny and  
nearly rain-free, half of Monday's matches were washed out and 
Tuesday's play was entirely rained out. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty days have been completely washed out in Wimbledon's  
history, with the last three tournaments among the wettest in 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Wimbledon had a chance to add a retractable roof when the new  
Court 1 was opened in 1997. But the old attitude remains: It's an 
outdoor tournament and it will stay that way -- rain or no rain. 
</P>
<P>
	``The easiest solution would have been to build Court 1 with a  
roof,'' McNamee said. ``That would have guaranteed play would have 
gone on at all times ... and I think the concern then was that 
Court 1 was more value for money than Centre (Court).'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNamee is shocked that Wimbledon -- already faced with the  
demands of television -- can get away with washouts when it comes to 
the fans, considering 30,000-40,000 fans queue daily, and pay 
dearly, to see tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Interestingly, the public here will still sit in the rain and  
have a good time,'' he said. ``But it could be better than that. In 
Australia we could not get away with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wimbledon is still able to get away with it, but I doubt if  
that can happen forever because the public are so well looked after 
at other events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wimbledon officials argue against a dome or retractable roof,  
saying that the results would be unfair to those who play without 
cover; that an all-grass court could not survive two week's play 
under a roof, retractable or not; that one court with a roof would 
not solve the problems of 17 other courts left in the rain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rain is tedious for everyone, and we understand and share the  
frustrations of fans during a rain delay,'' said Christopher 
Gorringe, chief executive of the All England Club. 
</P>
<P>
	``Putting roofs on Centre or No. 1 Court ... merely creates  
difficulties in other areas ... deciding which matches should be 
played indoors and whether those players who play indoors receive 
an unfair advantage over those who do not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of all, the English appear to take the rain in stride.  
</P>
<P>
	``Fans come to Wimbledon because they still want to see the  
world's finest tennis players in action outdoors, on grass and 
across all 18 courts,'' Gorringe said.

<HEADLINE> Gay Ambassador Sworn In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's usually a private, low-keyed affair when  
an ambassador is sworn in. The pattern was broken Tuesday as James 
Hormel became ambassador to Luxembourg before a raucous gathering 
of supporters assembled in the State Department's main reception 
room. 
</P>
<P>
	``What an incredible privilege it is to be standing before you  
today,'' Hormel, who is homosexual, told the gathering of several 
hundred. Many were from San Francisco who stood with him during his 
tortuous 20-month journey from nomination to swearing in. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was there, along with  
Sens. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. 
Television cameras lined the rear of the majestic eighth-floor room 
at the State Department. Normal procedure on such occasions is to 
bar the press altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason for the hoopla, of course, was that Hormel is the  
first openly gay ambassador. Uncertainty had shrouded Hormel's 
appointment almost from the day he was nominated because of 
opposition from a relatively small group of senators. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton broke the impasse three weeks ago when he made  
Hormel a ``recess appointment'' -- a method to circumvent the normal 
Senate confirmation process. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department normally shies away from partisanship, but  
the whiff of politics was in the air as Albright joined Hormel, a 
longtime Democratic activist, for the festivities and spoke on his 
behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	Gay rights have been a high-profile theme for the Democrats as  
campaigning for next year's election picks up steam. Vice President 
Al Gore visited a gay and lesbian center during a campaign visit to 
California last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Traditional Values Coalition, a church lobby that opposed  
the nomination, said in a statement that the swearing in of Hormel 
marks ``the beginning of the Gore campaign's efforts to woo the 
homosexual vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coalition members demonstrated in protest outside the State  
Department as the ceremony was taking place. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., among Senate opponents of Hormel,  
argued that Hormel is more concerned about a ``gay agenda'' than 
about representing U.S. interests. Hormel has promised to avoid gay 
politics while on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of those glorious days when the nice guy finishes  
first,'' Albright told the gathering. ``Neither race, nor creed, 
nor gender nor sexual orientation should be relevant to the 
selection of ambassadors for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Kennedy: ``There was never any honorable question about his  
(Hormel's) qualifications to be ambassador.'' The opposition to him 
was ``irresponsible and unacceptable,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bigotry based on sexual orientation,'' Kennedy added, ``is  
wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Feinstein, noting that Hormel's appointment cleared the Senate  
Foreign Relations Committee by 16-2, said he would have been 
approved by an overwhelming majority had the Senate voted as a 
whole. By tradition, even one senator can prevent a vote on a 
nomination because of a personal grievance. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Jim's appointment, I think we open a door,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hormel, an heir to the Hormel Meat Co. fortune, has been a  
generous contributor to Democratic candidates and the party. Since 
1997, he has given $132,000 to the Democratic National Committee, 
$25,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and 
$15,000 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	He also has given $10,000 to the Human Rights Campaign, a gay  
and lesbian political action committee. The campaign's political 
action committee contributed $803,125 to federal candidates during 
the last election, with $711,400, or 89 percent, going to 
Democrats.

<HEADLINE> Prisoner Killed in Attempted Escape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, N.C. (AP) -- A rapist and accused killer was fatally  
gunned down by corrections officers after trying to dash from a 
prison work crew. Two other inmates also were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Bem Kayin Holloway, 22, of Raleigh, was shot in the back Monday  
afternoon by two guards who fired 19 times with a rifle, shotgun 
and handgun, said Charles Hill, superintendent of maximum-security 
Odom Correctional Institution in Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Inmates Wesley Eugene Turner, 22, and Bennie Culver Joyner Jr.,  
23, were wounded in the leg and shoulder. Turner was in critical 
condition today and Joyner was in stable condition. Both men had 
been convicted of second-degree murder 
</P>
<P>
	The three inmates were among 16 prisoners pulling weeds in a  
cotton field when they suddenly stood up and began running, 
McQuillan said. The three men dropped to the ground after 
correction officers fired a volley of gunfire but then stood and 
fled across a road toward some underbrush, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers shot and killed Holloway and wounded the other two  
prisoners just as they entered the underbrush. One officer chased 
the prisoners across the field on horseback before dismounting and 
firing. 
</P>
<P>
	Holloway was serving a term of 76 to 95 years for the rape,  
robbery and attempted murder of a teacher at her Wake County home 
in May 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was facing first-degree murder charges in the killings  
of a Lumberton convenience store clerk and a 32-year-old Wilmington 
woman, Peggy Carr. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope to God he was scared,'' Carr's mother, Penny Carr  
Britton of Toledo, Ohio, said Monday after learning of Holloway's 
death. ``Maybe justice is better paid this way than it would have 
been after a trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The State Bureau of Investigation is investigating the  
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	McQuillan defended the department's decision to put Holloway on  
a work detail, adding all the prisoners in the group were under 
heavy guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is hard labor out in the fields,'' she said. ``This is  
not like a perk to be out working in the hot sun, pulling weeds 
under armed supervision.''

<HEADLINE> Devalued Peso Worries Venezuela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- The government's move to further devalue  
the Colombian peso created worries Tuesday in neighboring 
Venezuela, whose economy is also in distress and whose exports to 
this Andean nation are now expected to further diminish. 
</P>
<P>
	The Venezuelan ambassador, Fernando Gerbasi, said trade between  
the neighbors was already at its worst moment in memory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Commerce between the two countries has diminished a lot this  
year, by nearly 40 percent, and the devaluation will surely further 
lower Venezuelan exports to Colombia, which have dropped 52.8 
percent,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the trend continues, said Gerbasi, bilateral trade will drop  
to $1.5 billion this year from $2.5 billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Sunday, Colombia's central bank announced it was lifting by  
9 percent the threshold at which it allows the peso to float freely 
before intervening in foreign exchange markets to support it by 
selling dollars. It was the second time since President Andres 
Pastrana took office in August that the central Bank of the 
Republic had encouraged such a devaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	The peso closed at 1,733 to the dollar on Tuesday, up 0.6  
percent from 1,743 the previous day, but currency traders said they 
expected it to begin losing ground against the U.S. currency in 
coming days. Traders said the peso's current strength was fleeting, 
attributing it to a government decree limiting the amount of 
dollars Colombian financial institutions can keep on hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Bank of the Republic sold $285 million trying to  
shore up the peso, which has lost 11 percent against the dollar 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In Venezuela, where the bolivar is considered to be about 40  
percent overvalued against the greenback, hopes for recovery from a 
deep recession have been pegged to the performance of non-oil 
exports. So the Colombian devaluation move was bad news. 
</P>
<P>
	``Venezuela should think about a devaluation of the bolivar to  
lessen the heavy blow that the devaluation of the Colombian 
currency will represent for the export sector,'' said Juan Beiner, 
vice president of the Venezuelan Association of Exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia is Venezuela's No. 2 trading partner after the United  
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts expect Venezuela's economy to contract some 4 percent  
to 8 percent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, this country's economy shrank 4.8 percent in the  
first two quarters compared with the same period of 1998, the 
steepest decline since quarterly measures have been taken, 
according to Colombia's federal Planning Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Pastrana's government last week announced it would create a $631  
million credit line to restructure debt in the non-financial 
private sector, while the official export bank Bancoldex would make 
$287 million in credit available to exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the weekend, Pastrana also announced a so far vague plan to  
trim government bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts think additional, radical measures will be  
required if Colombia is to rebound from three straight quarters of 
negative growth and an unemployment rate of nearly 20 percent, its 
worst economic crisis since the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a permanent solution,'' David Chon, chief Latin  
America strategist for Bear Stearns, said of the latest measures. 
``Colombia has to get back on the growth path.''

<HEADLINE> No Bond in Alleged Revenge Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKLIN, Ind. (AP) -- A man who police said told them he took  
revenge against his wife by purposely fathering her child and then 
killing the infant was under a suicide watch in jail on murder 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	A police department chaplain said even he was shaken by his  
visit Monday with Ronald Lee Shanabarger, who is charged with 
murdering his 7-month old son, Tyler, by suffocating him in plastic 
wrap. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Randy Maynard said Shanabarger was depressed,  
complaining about life in jail and all the things he had lost: his 
job, his house, his money, his wife, his friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `And you lost Tyler too,''' Maynard said. ```Oh yeah,  
I lost the boy too.' That was it for me. He said the wrong thing. I 
was out of there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shanabarger is being held without bond until his trial,  
scheduled for Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	At a court hearing Monday, Shanabarger, wearing a brown flak  
jacket over a jail jumpsuit, mumbled brief answers to a judge's 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he had money to hire his own attorney, Shanabarger  
said, ``I don't know. I'd have to check with my wife.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge suggested help was unlikely to come from Amy  
Shanabarger, and assigned public defender Richard Tandy to 
represent Shanabarger. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was with him for a minute and a half and I really don't know  
enough about him to say anything yet,'' said Tandy, who planned to 
meet with his client to begin discussing a defense. Police said he 
confessed three times to Tyler's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanabarger, 30, told police he planned the crime to exact  
punishment on his wife, who had refused to cut short a cruise 
vacation after his father passed away in October 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 22, just hours after the funeral of his son, Shanabarger  
confessed to his wife that he had smothered their son in his crib 
three nights earlier, investigators said. A coroner had ruled the 
infant died from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	The day after the funeral, Shanabarger allegedly told police in  
this suburban Indianapolis community that he suffocated Tyler with 
plastic wrap and that he dreamed up the crime after his father's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	Lights were out and the shades were drawn at the Shanabarger  
home Monday. Mrs. Shanabarger is staying with her parents, and her 
father said he does not want her to give interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanabarger could get the death penalty if convicted.  
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you have anybody murdered, it's troubling,''  
prosecutor Lance Hamner said. ``When it's a child, it's compounded 
even further. In this case, it's just so bizarre, it's hard to 
really comprehend the facts.''

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- A state-run electric company intends  
to resume building a power line through Venezuela's rain forest 
despite protests from environmentalists and indigenous tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction in Canaima National Park, home to the world's  
highest waterfall, will resume in July after being paralyzed for 
months by opposition, Edelca president Oswaldo Artiles told a 
congressional hearing Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the project, which will bring electricity to  
Brazil's northwest Amazon region, contend that cutting a 300-mile 
swath through the pristine jungle would be an environmental 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	Canaima National Park is home to Angel Falls and flat-topped  
mountains that inspired Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic adventure

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Six armed men held up a military vehicle near  
the presidential residence Tuesday, making off with the 
presidential guard payroll. Two officers were killed and one was 
wounded in a shootout, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	City police said the holdup occurred about a block from the  
presidential residence of Los Pinos. 
</P>
<P>
	A small group of army officers had withdrawn the payroll cash  
from a nearby bank branch and were on their way to the barracks 
when the gunmen, following in two civilian vehicles, intercepted 
them at a red light and started shooting. The officers shot back.

	PALENQUE, Mexico (AP) -- Mexican officials have recovered more  
than 10,000 archaeological artifacts that had been looted over the 
past year, the director of the National Institute of Anthropology 
and History said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The director, Teresa Franco y Gonzalez, said the pieces had been  
seized by the federal attorney general's office or turned over by 
foreign agencies to Mexican consulates and embassies abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that more than 10,000 objects from different cultures  
have been recovered says that there is a real pillage in various 
archaeological zones of the country,'' she said.

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Leftist rebels blasted a hole in a  
prison wall and freed seven jailed comrades, spiriting them away in 
a taxi and on motorcycles waiting 100 yards away, authorities said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 250 rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia,  
or FARC, attacked the prison overnight in Palmira, a town just 
outside the western city of Cali with a strong guerrilla presence. 
</P>
<P>
	A cameraman captured the explosions and the escape on video,  
which showed prison guards managing to prevent the escape of many 
more inmates.

	They're eager to work with the president, would like to see the  
details and intend to study them closely. 
</P>
<P>
	In Congress-speak, that type of rhetoric is often tantamount to  
a death sentence. But in this case -- 18 months before elections in 
which Republicans will be defending narrow congressional majorities 
-- it may well turn out to be the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
	``We share the president's concern that no senior citizen should  
be forced to choose between putting food on the table and paying 
the bills or buying prescription drugs,'' House Speaker Dennis 
Hastert and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said in a politely 
worded joint statement. 
</P>
<P>
	And yet, they added, ``we should be careful not to force those  
who already have prescription drug coverage to accept a 
government-run plan that costs more and provides fewer choices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two Texas Republicans were blunter, after noting that about  
two-thirds of all retirees already have prescription coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	It makes ``absolutely no sense'' to substitute taxpayer-funded  
insurance for those seniors, said Sen. Phil Gramm. 
</P>
<P>
	And Majority Leader Dick Armey said, ``It's been the tradition  
in the president's party to do one size fits all. If you have 31 
percent of people with a problem, you ought to put together a 31 
percent solution, not a 100 percent solution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert and Lott talked of searching for a ``bipartisan  
solution,'' and Armey, too, said compromise was possible with the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are all but certain to produce an alternative to  
Clinton's proposal, as part of a plan to extend the life of the 
overall Medicare program as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, speaking of the president, Armey added he was ``a little  
bit concerned he's now trying to advance a partisan effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suspicion of Clinton and his motives is rampant among  
Republicans, a concern that is deepened by their own abysmal record 
in high-profile showdowns with the White House. These include the 
twin government shutdowns in the winter of 1995, which helped 
resurrect a president still reeling from the 1994 midterm 
elections, as well as the historic impeachment battle, which also 
cost the Republicans at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	In between, Clinton has signed many of the bills that  
Republicans wanted: welfare overhaul, a broad-based tax cut and the 
1997 balanced budget deal among them. And he has maneuvered to 
claim credit for their legislation in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor is there any doubting the political appeal for the sort of  
expansion Clinton proposed. A poll taken for the Republican 
National Committee earlier this year found support of roughly 70 
percent for drug coverage under Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not the sort of thing Republicans will want to fight in a  
presidential election year in which they are struggling to hold 
onto their slender House majority, or protect a flock of vulnerable 
Senate first-termers. 
</P>
<P>
	Seniors will be a key voting bloc in next year's elections, and  
while they helped elect Clinton in 1992 and 1996, they favored 
Republicans in the midterm elections of 1994 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican alternative is likely to begin with drug coverage  
for low-income seniors on Medicare. That proposal was raised during 
deliberations of a national Medicare commission earlier this year, 
but died when none of the administration's appointees would support 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the GOP is likely to resurrect it, along with other  
assistance, perhaps in the form of tax breaks for seniors whose 
MediGap policies provide pharmaceutical coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Politically, that would give the GOP an alternative to the  
president's broader, more costly plan, and on terrain more 
comfortable for Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	It would also blunt any Democratic effort to run a replay of  
their periodic campaign that alleges the GOP opposed Medicare at 
its creation, and has been trying to kill it since.

<HEADLINE> Tests For Babies in Embryo Mix-Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge has ordered tests to see if two  
6-month-old boys --one white and one black, and born to the same 
woman in a laboratory mistake -- need to spend more time together 
even though they now live with their genetic parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Fasano is seeking greater visitation, saying the babies  
born to her need to stay close to one another. The parents of the 
black baby say she's asking for too much. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they are together, they play together and reach for each  
other's hand,'' Mrs. Fasano said outside court Monday. ``They love 
each other. They have a very special bond.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Diane Lebedeff on Monday ordered both sides to arrange  
psychological examinations for the babies so she can determine what 
impact being apart or together might have on them. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the judge ordered that the boys continue to  
visit each other. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute resulted from a mistake in a Manhattan fertility  
clinic where Mrs. Fasano and Deborah Perry-Rogers had stored their 
test tube-fertilized eggs. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 24, 1998, both women went to the clinic to have the  
embryos implanted in their uteruses. A doctor mistakenly put some 
of Mrs. Perry-Rogers' embryos into a catheter that was used to 
implant Mrs. Fasano's embryos, a state Health Department report 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Perry-Rogers, who is black, received her own fertilized  
eggs and did not become pregnant. But Mrs. Fasano, who is white, 
received Mrs. Perry-Rogers' embryos along with her own and became 
pregnant with the two boys, who were born Dec. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Fasano and her husband, Richard, agreed to relinquish  
custody of the black boy, Joseph, after tests proved that Mrs. 
Perry-Rogers and her husband, Robert Rogers, are his genetic 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fasanos, of Staten Island, were in court Monday to complain  
that the Rogerses, of Teaneck, N.J., reneged on an agreement about 
visitation and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rogerses' lawyer, Rudolph Silas, said the visitation part of  
the agreement that separated the babies is unreasonable and 
one-sided. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his clients believe there should be liberal and frequent  
visitation between the infants, but he said there should be a more 
equitable agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fasanos' lawyer, Ivan Tantleff, said his clients would not  
have given up custody of Joseph had they believed the Rogerses 
would not honor all terms of the visitation agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Silas also said Mrs. Fasano should not treat the agreement as  
giving her license to call herself Joseph's mother despite the fact 
that she gave birth to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's an invitation to psychological harm'' for the child, he  
said.

<HEADLINE> McDonald's Agrees To Pay $4 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- McDonald's Corp. has agreed to pay a $4  
million fine to the government for not reporting injuries suffered 
by children at some of its restaurant playgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Product Safety Commission, which was announcing the  
settlement today, said McDonald's violated a 1995 requirement 
requiring the company to report defective playground equipment to 
the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm determined that companies making commitments to CPSC keep  
them,'' CPSC Chairwoman Ann Brown said in an interview Monday. 
``Now children can go to McDonald's playgrounds and know that they 
will be able to play safely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the commission, McDonald's did not report injuries  
resulting from its ``Big Mac Climber'' playground toy -- a large 
metal platform resembling a hamburger. A hole in the middle of the 
toy allows kids to climb up and down a ladder inside. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission said 400 children were injured while on the  
climbers, with 20 sustaining concussions or skull fractures and 80 
suffering from broken bones. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the injuries occurred during the 1970s and 1980s. The  
company has since removed the climber from its playground 
facilities, the CPSC said. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's spokesman Chuck Eberling stressed that the agreement  
involves a piece of equipment that ``was totally out of our 
restaurants by the mid-90s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The dispute relates to reporting certain injuries on the  
playland equipment, and the dispute revolves around the 
bureaucratic reporting requirements of that,'' Eberling said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the injuries were ``by and large'' minor. ``There were  
some broken bones and scrapes and bruises,'' he said. ``There were 
no deaths or dramatic injuries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Brown still expressed concern about the company failing for  
the second time to tell the commission about an unsafe piece of 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the restaurant chain agreed to finance a $5 million  
safety campaign, overseen by the CPSC, after the commission cited 
the company for failing to report injuries to children who played 
on the ``Tug-N-Turn'' merry-go-round rides. 
</P>
<P>
	In signing that settlement, McDonald's denied that it had a  
statutory reporting obligation because it was not a manufacturer, 
distributor or retailer of Tug-N-Turns. But the company, based in 
Oak Brook, Ill., agreed to report to the CPSC any information about 
playground equipment with defects that could create a hazard. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new agreement with the CPSC, McDonald's has additional  
reporting and safety guidelines it must follow, including making 
sure that any obsolete playground equipment be removed, according 
to the commission.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Up on Weather News / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures soared early today on  
the Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts for blistering heat 
across the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans led the rally as investors eyed predictions  
from private forecasters and the National Weather Service for 
temperatures into 100 degrees across the Plains and Midwest over 
the Fourth of July holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures may be particularly vulnerable, since much of the  
crop is entering the crucial pollination stage that requires plenty 
of moisture and milder weather. Failed pollination could reduce 
yield size and ultimately lead to a much smaller harvest than the 
government is estimating. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures advanced on the strength of corn and soybeans and  
on continued harvesting delays in winter wheat growing regions that 
come as a result of heavy rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for September delivery rose 2 1/4 cents to $2.68 a bushel;  
September corn rose 3 1/2 cents to $2.17 3/4 a bushel; September oats 
rose 1 3/4 cents to $1.15 1/2 a bushel; November soybeans rose 6 1/4 cents 
to $4.61 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,  
while feeder cattle and pork futures retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle rose .05 cent to 62.15 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell .30 cent to 75.62 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs fell 2 cents to 46.32 cents a pound; August pork bellies fell 
1.57 cents to 39.40 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> N. Dakota Cropland Still Too Wet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOTTINEAU, N.D. (AP) -- At a time when the crops should be  
growing tall under the summer sun, three-fourths of the farmland in 
Bottineau County is still too wet and muddy to even plant. 
</P>
<P>
	About 80 miles east, the little towns of Minnewaukan and Churchs  
Ferry are thinking about picking up their buildings and moving to 
escape from rising Devils Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby, the little towns of Minnewaukan and Churchs Ferry are  
thinking about picking up their buildings and moving to escape from 
rising Devils Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need three-buckle overshoes to get into the fields,'' said  
Stan Romsos, who has raised grain for 43 years on his 2,900 acres 
of Bottineau County, just south of the Canadian border. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, after 10 months of torrential rain and heavy  
snowfall, he is looking for something else to do. The county has 
gotten 8 to 15 inches of rain since May 1. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, about 3.2 million acres of North Dakota cropland -- 16  
percent of the state -- are too wet for planting this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Devils Lake has risen about 24 feet in seven years -- about 2 1/2  
feet just in the past 12 months -- because it sits in a closed basin 
with nowhere for its water to drain. And with the general flatness 
of the prairie, rising water spreads out quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Once eight miles from Minnewaukan, Devils Lake now laps at the  
town's edges. Repairs to the town's sewer and water systems and 
streets are running into the millions of dollars. Basements get 
wet, and on a windy day waves lap the corner of the high school 
football field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, everything is an option,'' Minnewaukan Mayor Mike  
Every said. ``There are no dumb ideas. We're really either one big 
rainfall away or one bad winter away from a disaster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Every said that saving the city of 350 people will mean either  
building a dike -- which won't solve the problems of fixing the 
streets, basements and sewers -- or picking up the buildings and 
moving the town. 
</P>
<P>
	Town officials haven't surveyed any sites yet, but one  
possibility is on higher ground a few miles to the west. 
</P>
<P>
	Raising the dike that protects the 100 residents of Churchs  
Ferry, about 20 miles north of Minnewaukan, would keep the water at 
bay but wouldn't protect nearby U.S. Highway 2, Mayor William 
Bartle said. Taking other roads out of town would all mean long 
detours. 
</P>
<P>
	Churchs Ferry may have to join with Minnewaukan or some other  
town in forming a new community, the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
	The city of Devils Lake sits right next to its namesake lake and  
already has had to move several hundred lakeside houses to drier 
ground. The city of 8,000 has built its dikes higher several times 
over the past four years, and two major highways into town also 
have been raised several times. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of Minnewaukan and Churchs Ferry had been counting on  
the Army Corps of Engineers to drain water from Devils Lake, 
possibly by digging an outlet to a nearby river. 
</P>
<P>
	But the corps said that would be too expensive, at $103 million.  
It proposes to wait until the lake rises an additional 6 feet, when 
the benefits would be greater. 
</P>
<P>
	Byron Lannoye farms seven miles from Churchs Ferry, on the same  
land his father and grandfather farmed. He remembers in the late 
1980s and early '90s when a chain of lakes around his farm dried 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember thinking it would take years to fill these lakes  
up,'' he said. ``Then, we got 6 inches in an hour in 1992 and that 
was the start of it. We've been basically flood-prone ever since.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It may all be part of a long-term weather cycle, said Leon  
Osborne, director of the University of North Dakota's Regional 
Weather Information Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be another year, another two years, it could be much  
longer'' for the wet conditions to ease, he said. ``What this 
points toward -- it tells us how very little we know.''

<HEADLINE> Candiotti Back With the Indians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Look who floated back into town with the  
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Knuckleballer Tom Candiotti, who played for some horrific  
Cleveland teams from 1986-91 before being traded, was signed to a 
major league contract for the remainder of the season on Tuesday by 
the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	The 41-year-old Candiotti, released by the Oakland Athletics on  
June 16 after posting a 3-5 record and 6.35 ERA, will initially be 
used out of the bullpen as the Indians' long reliever. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be able to come back here and pitch for this team is really  
like a dream come true,'' said Candiotti, who posted a 72-65 record 
in his first stint with the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	When Candiotti last pitched for the Indians, the club played in  
dilapidated Cleveland Stadium and in his five-plus years here, the 
team never won more than 86 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little different here than when I left,'' he said  
standing in the dugout before the game and looking out at beautiful 
Jacobs Field for the first time as a member of the home team. ``As 
bad as some of the teams were, I always loved this place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Indians scheduled to play a day-night doubleheader  
Saturday against Kansas City, the team had been considering adding 
a 13th pitcher to its staff for the last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Candiotti's addition gives the Indians a pitcher who can start,  
work in long relief and makes the opposition have to adjust after 
facing Cleveland's hard-throwing relievers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives you a bit of a different look, a change of pace,''  
said Indians manager Mike Hargrove, who indicated Candiotti could 
start one of Saturday's games. ``We brought Candy in here because 
he has been an effective major league pitcher and we think he's 
still has some gas in the tank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of Candiotti's best starts this season came at Cleveland on  
April 22. He allowed three hits over seven innings to get the win, 
but has struggled most of the year mainly because of a knee 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a few days after beating the Indians, Candiotti faced  
Cleveland in Oakland but was forced to leave in the first inning 
when he couldn't land on his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
	He is now taking anti-inflammatory medication and said the two  
weeks off since being released has helped his knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Candiotti had hoped for another chance to pitch for a contender,  
but never imagined it would be the Indians, who have the best 
record in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice,'' he said. ``I'm sure I'm not going out on a limb  
saying that this is probably the best team I've ever pitched for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Candiotti, 150-163 in 16 major league seasons, was traded by the  
Indians on June 27, 1991, with outfielder Turner Ward to Toronto 
for pitcher Denis Boucher, outfielders Glenallen Hill and Mark 
Whiten -- also back with the Indians -- and a player to be named. 
</P>
<P>
	He made 19 starts with the Blue Jays before leaving after the  
season as a free agent and signing with the Dodgers, who he stayed 
with until 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	All along the way, he always traveled with a large catcher's  
glove in his bag, designed specially for knuckleballers. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the first thing (catcher) Sandy Alomar said to me,''  
Candiotti said. ``'You have that big glove?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar, scheduled to come off the disabled list soon, caught  
Candiotti for two seasons and joked that when Candiotti was traded 
to Toronto, he was the happiest guy in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not coming off the DL,'' Alomar said. ``When he left the  
first time, I said, 'Candy, I love you. I loved having you on the 
team and I'm glad you're going to a contender. But I'd rather not 
catch you ever again.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Tries To Deny Clinton Credit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Standing by a huge map showing Chicago almost  
within range of North Korean missiles, Republicans sought Tuesday 
to remind Americans that legislation for a missile defense shield 
started as a GOP initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	With President Clinton expected to sign the bill shortly,  
Republican leaders gathered outside the Capitol to credit President 
Reagan with getting the project moving in the early 1980s with his 
idea of arraying missiles to shoot down incoming ballistic 
missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We usher in a new era of American security,'' House Speaker  
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said about the program Democrats once 
derided as ``Star Wars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., called the lack of a  
defense against ballistic missiles ``our Achilles' heel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And ardent missile-defense advocate Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa.,  
likened the moment to President Kennedy's vow to put an American on 
the moon within a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would commit the nation to field a system against a  
limited missile attack as soon as ``technologically possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton vetoed a 1995 defense bill containing similar language.  
</P>
<P>
	The turn in Democratic sentiment followed upward revisions in  
estimates of nuclear missile capability of both North Korea and 
Iran and reports of Chinese espionage at U.S. nuclear weapons 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
	As a prop, the Republicans used an oversized map of the United  
States showing ``range'' lines depicting distances from North 
Korea. The most distant one, about 6,200 miles, crossed the country 
just west of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might be aimed at Chicago and hit St. Louis, but surely  
they have that capability,'' Weldon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Koreans tested a multistage ballistic missile last  
year, and U.S. intelligence officials have suggested they may soon 
test a more advanced one. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress approved the legislation on May 21, but leaders of the  
Republican majority held up the paperwork until the dispute in the 
Balkans calmed down. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's ceremony, to send the bill formally on its way to the  
White House, had been scheduled, then delayed, on two previous 
occasions. 
</P>
<P>
	With Clinton getting much of the press corps' attention Tuesday  
because of his domestic-policy proposals to overhaul Medicare, GOP 
leaders wanted to keep him from also seizing the spotlight on what 
has long been a top Republican defense agenda item. 
</P>
<P>
	Enactment of the missile-defense bill ``grants closure to a  
struggle of many of us in Congress,'' said Sen. Strom Thurmond, 
R-S.C. He called it a ``long fight'' that vindicated Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., was the only Democrat to show  
up. He noted that the legislation ``achieved a broad bipartisan 
consensus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration dropped its veto threat after Congress  
included a Democratic amendment that any anti-missile system would 
not interfere with arms-control negotiations with Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian President Boris Yeltsin agreed for the first time this  
month to renegotiate the landmark 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile 
treaty to permit a limited national ballistic missile defense 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Also contributing to progress on the program: After six straight  
failures, a $3.8 billion experimental missile defense system scored 
its first hit in a test two weeks ago and shot down an incoming 
test rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon has spent more than $40 billion on research into  
and testing of various anti-missile systems since Reagan described 
his ``Strategic Defense Initiative'' in 1983. However, this will be 
the first time the United States would be formally committed to 
developing such a national system. 
</P>
<P>
	While Reagan envisioned satellites with anti-missiles and  
lasers, the current proposed systems are far more modest. They are 
intended to deal with limited attacks such as might be launched by 
small nuclear nations like North Korea rather than the massive 
assaults by thousands of missiles that might have characterized a 
Soviet attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration plans to wait until next June before  
committing to a deployment decision.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Missile Defense System Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Revised estimates of nuclear missile  
capability, particularly of North Korea and Iran, add new urgency 
to development of a national missile defense system, the Clinton 
administration's top arms-control official said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cold war disciplines are gone. Technology is more widely  
available,'' John Holum, acting undersecretary of state for arms 
control and international security affairs, told a Senate 
confirmation hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republican leaders were to rally on the steps of the  
Capitol today to applaud President Clinton's signing of a 
GOP-sponsored bill committing the United States to a national 
ballistic missile defense against limited attack, as might be 
launched by a small nuclear power. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Congress passed that bill in May, two developments have  
occurred on the missile-defense front: 
</P>
<P>
	--Russian President Boris Yeltsin agreed, for the first time, to  
consider reopening the landmark 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty 
to consider easing that prohibition against either American or 
Russian nationwide ballistic missile defense systems. 
</P>
<P>
	--After six straight failures, a $3.8 billion experimental  
missile defense system scored its first hit in a test at the White 
Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, shooting down an incoming test 
rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	Holum, in testimony Monday before the Senate Foreign Relations  
Committee, voiced strong support for deploying a missile defense 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a 1998 report by a panel headed by former Defense  
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld had ``a profound impact'' on Clinton 
administration policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rumsfeld panel concluded that North Korea and Iran could  
develop long-range missiles within five years and probably are 
secretly doing so. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if a missile defense is outlawed by the 1972 ABM treaty,  
national interest dictates that the United States move ahead in 
planning for such a system anyway, Holum said, echoing views of 
Republican members of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat of a nuclear attack by a small power ``is clearly  
very prominent'' as an area of concern, far more so than just a few 
years ago, Holum said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton vetoed an earlier bill committing the nation  
to a missile-defense system. But in a compromise with congressional 
Republicans, he agreed this year to support similar legislation, 
the bill he signed. 
</P>
<P>
	``In light of new estimates on the ballistic missile threat, in  
particular from North Korea and Iran, national missile defense is 
now closer to becoming another integral part of our strategy 
against proliferation,'' Holum testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Holum appeared at a nomination hearing to be the first person to  
serve in the new post. He had served since 1993 as director of the 
Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, but the agency went out of 
business on April 1 when its functions were merged with the State 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel was expected to approve the nomination, perhaps as  
early as Wednesday, when it also votes on the nomination of Richard 
Holbrooke to be U.N. ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration says it will make decisions on details of a  
missile defense system next June. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than blindly follow the ABM restrictions, Holum said, ``I  
believe our missile defense should be geared toward threat.''

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Shows Off High-Speed Train </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amtrak gave reporters and a group of VIPs a  
look at the new high-speed ``Acela'' train Tuesday, and it was 
clear from the first glimpse that it's unlike the ironhorses of 
old. 
</P>
<P>
	Even at rest, sitting in a railroad yard just two miles from the  
Capitol, the turquoise-and-silver, eight-car train set looked like 
some elongated bullet a giant Lone Ranger might have fired. 
Instead, Acela will streak between Boston, New York and Washington 
starting late this year at up to 150 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Up in the engineer's quarters, the greasy steam gauges have been  
replaced with Nintendo-style joysticks and color, computer-animated 
displays with a speedometer that goes up to 160 mph, 5 mph below 
the train's design speed. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in the passenger cars, there are electronic seat markers,  
power outlets at every seat and bright, roomy bathrooms that will 
allow diaper changes at faster than double the highway speed limit. 
The cafe cars will have beer on tap. 
</P>
<P>
	The first public viewing of the train, as well as the  
anticipation that the Northeast Corridor service will prompt calls 
for similar trains in the Southeast, Gulf Coast, Midwest and West, 
put Amtrak's chairman in the mood to boast. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're railroading, and we're going to be high-speeding all  
across America,'' said Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, the 
Republican who heads Amtrak's board of directors. ``When you look 
at this train, it says there's a new dawn a-comin.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The train that was on display, numbered ``F 2001,'' is the  
second set completed by its manufacturer, the Bombardier-Alstom 
consortium. The first set is being tested in Pueblo, Colo., where 
it has hit 140 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The second train has been undergoing stationary testing in  
Philadelphia. Although its interior needs finishing, the train was 
brought down to Washington for the dedication of a new high-speed 
rail maintenance facility. The train will soon begin high-speed 
runs outside Princeton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	The first Acela train will begin passenger service in November  
or December. All 20 sets on order will enter service by late next 
summer. In the fall of 2000, Amtrak will reconfigure its entire 
Northeast Corridor schedule, allowing it to run its new trains at 
their intended speed. 
</P>
<P>
	That will reduce the trip between New York and Washington from  
three hours to 2 1/2 hours, and the longer run from New York to Boston 
from 4 1/2 hours to as little as three hours. At those trip times, 
Amtrak figures it can compete with airline shuttles when comparing 
the time it takes to get from the center of one city to another. 
</P>
<P>
	The fare is expected to run about $140 a trip, a little more  
expensive than the current service but about $60 less than the 
walkup fare for a similar shuttle flight. Businesses will also be 
offered group discounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``This new train service will establish a higher standard for  
intercity travel,'' said Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, 
who attended the unveiling with several legislative supporters, 
including Sens. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., 
and Rep. Bob Franks, R-N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's appearance in Washington was the latest in a series of  
events Amtrak is staging to build public interest in the new train 
service. In March, it unveiled the Acela name and distributed 
pictures and a computer animation of the new trains during a gala 
production in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Late this summer or in early fall it plans to show off the new  
train in action in Colorado. The date of the first passenger trip 
has yet to be set.

<HEADLINE> Convicted Killer At Large in Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A convicted killer with a history of  
violence toward police spent his second night in East Texas swamps 
after escaping from what is supposed to be the state's tightest 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 300 searchers on horseback, in boats, using dogs and in  
helicopters hunted a rugged 10-square-mile area on Monday looking 
for Clifford Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said that at about 3 a.m. today, a helicopter using  
heat-seeking sensors helped spot the inmate in chest-deep water 
about 3 miles north of the prison and within the prime search area. 
</P>
<P>
	But the helicopter couldn't land because of the terrain and was  
unable to remain in area long because it was running low on fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 33, whose convictions include a murder in Dallas and  
attempted murder for shooting at a Dallas police officer, fled on 
Sunday from the high security section of the prison system's 
Estelle Unit, about 12 miles northeast of Huntsville. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a good guy,'' prison spokesman Larry Fitzgerald  
said Monday. ``He has a history of being combative and assaultive 
toward officers. We consider him to be extremely dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roadblocks went up several miles from the prison and corrections  
guards lined the main roads in hopes of catching a glimpse of Jones 
if he emerged from the brush. 
</P>
<P>
	The prison shares property with the Ellis Unit, where last  
Thanksgiving seven condemned killers broke out of death row. One of 
those escapees, Martin Gurule, was found a week later, dead in a 
creek, and an autopsy showed he had drowned. The other six 
surrendered after guards opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
	While being escorted to a recreation area on Sunday, Jones  
slipped one hand out of his handcuffs and threatened to kill a 
female guard with the restraint, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-6, 180-pound Jones scaled a 25-foot chain-link fence  
to the roof of the yard, then fell to another fence that covers a 
walkway and jumped 8 feet to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	He reached a 12-foot fence equipped with sensing devices and  
climbed over it. The sensors alerted another guard, who fired at 
him with a tear gas shell. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones then climbed a 16-foot camera tower to jump over a second  
12-foot fence covered with four coils of razor wire. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, a guard who patrols the perimeter of the prison spotted  
him and fired at him twice but missed. Jones kept running toward a 
creek bottom and took off his clothes and shoes, apparently to foil 
tracking dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fatal flaw in this incident was the inmate being able to  
get out of that handcuff, and we just need to figure out how that 
occurred,'' said Gary Johnson, the prison system's director. 
</P>
<P>
	Prison officials said they assumed Jones was still unclothed.  
</P>
<P>
	The only sign of him Monday was the evident disturbance of  
poison ivy growing on a tree about three miles north of the Estelle 
Unit. Dogs led authorities to the spot and officials believe Jones 
spent the night in the tree, Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daytime temperatures were in the 90s.  
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, work crews welded fencing over the gap where Jones  
broke free and strung razor wire around eight television camera 
towers, including the one he climbed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones had been serving a 20-year prison term since July 1987.  
While in prison, he was sentenced to an additional six years for 
assaulting a guard.

<HEADLINE> House Hikes Veterans' Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation that would authorize  
cost-of-living increases for veterans' disability benefits and 
expand a variety of other programs for veterans was passed by the 
House on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would authorize the increases in payments for both  
veterans and for survivors of some disabled veterans. About 2.3 
million veterans received disability compensation last month, and 
the Department of Veterans Affairs expects to spend more than $18 
billion on such benefits this fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation passed 424-0 with warm praise from both  
Republicans and Democrats, and no criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and Republicans ``worked closely together on the  
development of this measure, which includes provisions of bills 
introduced by members from both sides of the aisle,'' said Rep. Bob 
Filner, D-Calif. ``This is the way the legislative process ought to 
work, and the real winners are America's veterans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Add a form of lung cancer -- bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma -- to  
the list of service-connect diseases eligible for benefits. This 
type of cancer is not associated with tobacco use. 
</P>
<P>
	--Authorize survivors' benefit payments to spouses of prisoners  
of war who were completely disabled when they died because of 
service-related injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	--Restore eligibility for certain benefits -- medical care,  
education and housing loans -- to surviving spouses who have 
remarried and whose subsequent marriage has ended. 
</P>
<P>
	--Authorize a $65 million loan from the U.S. Treasury to begin  
construction of a memorial to World War II veterans and schedule 
groundbreaking for Veterans Day 2000. The bill also would expand 
the American Battle Monuments Commission's authority to raise money 
for the memorial. About $57 million in private money has been 
pledged. 
</P>
<P>
	``Veterans of World War II are passing on at the astonishing  
rate of 1,000 a day,'' said Rep. Bob Stump, R-Ariz. ``We must 
complete this World War II monument as soon as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Grant permanent eligibility for housing loans to national  
reservists and National Guard members who have served a minimum of 
six years. 
</P>
<P>
	--Authorize $100 million over five years for the Labor Department  
to run a program to help homeless veterans find work. 
</P>
<P>
	--Direct the VA Department to obligate money and begin planning  
to buy four new national cemeteries for veterans and to begin a 
comprehensive study of burial space needs. 
</P>
<P>
	The House also passed by voice vote a bill offering technical,  
financial and other help to businesses owned by veterans. It would 
create a National Veterans Business Development Center and direct 
the Small Business Administration to beef up its veterans program. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would authorize economic injury disaster loans to  
reservists, members of the National Guard and military retirees who 
own small businesses but are called to active military service. 
</P>
<P>
	A third bill, also passed by voice vote, commemorates the 100th  
anniversary of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bills are H.R. 2280, H.J. Res. 34 and H.R. 1568

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A jet that was taking off with 185 passengers  
came within 200 feet of an arriving cargo plane that took an 
improper turn onto the runway, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sunday night incident at Kennedy International Airport  
happened shortly before 10 p.m. as the Boeing 757 Icelandair jet

	The Air France cargo jumbo jet landed on a parallel runway and  
was told to hold while the Icelandair plane departed, FAA 
spokeswoman Arlene Salac said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the cargo plane pulled onto a taxiway that put it  
directly in front of the departing plane, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're investigating to determine what happened, what actions  
the controller and the pilot took, if there was a procedural 
problem,'' Salac said.

<HEADLINE> Hatch Says He'd Be Better Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Orrin Hatch is explaining his late entry  
into the race for the Republican presidential nomination as looking 
at the rest of the field and finding it wanting. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I didn't think I would make a better president, I wouldn't  
get into it,'' Hatch, R-Utah, said on CNN's ``Crossfire'' show 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch dismissed criticism that his late entry in the race could  
split votes within the party and damage Republican chances at 
taking the Oval Office in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It isn't important that we do what's best for the Republican  
party,'' he said. ``It's important that we do what's best for 
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he also declined to offer any specific criticism of rival  
GOP candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like all of them, and I support all of them. They're all  
good people and they're all friends of mine,'' Hatch said. ``If I 
didn't think I could do better, I wouldn't have come in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged that the party's presumptive favorite, Texas  
Gov. George W. Bush, is running very strongly now but added that 
Bush's campaign could falter -- leaving a place for a strong Hatch 
candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did say that it is Bush's to lose and that he's going to  
have to handle it right,'' Hatch said. ``If he slips, there's going 
to have to be someone there to pick up the gauntlet and run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Bush, Hatch refused to make opposition to abortion on  
demand a litmus test in picking Supreme Court nominees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think any single issue should keep anyone from  
serving,'' Hatch said. ``If all you're interested in is abortion, 
you can get some wild person on there who is not interested in 
anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch, 65, is in his fourth Senate term. He is considered  
virtually unbeatable for a fifth term and has indicated he intends 
to run for re-election regardless the outcome of his presidential 
bid.

<HEADLINE> How Would Medicare Benefits Work? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Medicare prescription drug benefit  
President Clinton proposed Tuesday would work much like drug 
coverage many Americans get through private health plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has yet to fill in some details. White House  
officials said, however, that under Clinton's plan, the government 
would contract with the same type of private pharmaceutical benefit 
management companies that many commercial insurers use. 
</P>
<P>
	These companies administer health plans' drug benefits, usually  
providing consumers with prescription cards that can be presented 
for discounts at pharmacies and often also offering alternative 
prescription-by-mail services. 
</P>
<P>
	The benefit management companies also negotiate discounts with  
drugmakers for the bulk drug purchases health plans make. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug companies have raised fears that a single purchaser as  
large as Medicare -- which serves 39 million elderly and disabled 
Americans -- would have such market leverage that it would have the 
effect of imposing national drug-price controls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any plan which begins the process of imposing direct, or even  
indirect, government control over drug prices eventually will slow 
the pace of medical research,'' warned Carl B. Feldbaum, president 
of the Biotechnology Industry Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said Medicare would attempt to avoid  
distorting the marketplace by using private benefit managers to 
negotiate drug discounts only on a regional and local basis, rather 
than nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is simply at the local and regional level allowing the  
Medicare program to get the same discounts for their beneficiaries 
that every other insurance provider can,'' said Clinton's chief 
economic adviser, Gene Sperling. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, the administration estimates that negotiated  
discounts could save Medicare beneficiaries 10 percent to 15 
percent on their drug costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Many private health plans also save money by limiting the types  
of drugs consumers can get -- requiring the use of generics whenever 
possible, for example -- or restricting access to some particularly 
expensive and popular drugs, such as the impotency pill Viagra. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans lawmakers have raised concerns that the government  
might have too much say over what the drugs retirees can get under 
Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will the government decide what drugs seniors can use and  
which ones they cannot?,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, 
R-Ill., and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., in a joint 
statement 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials have offered reassurances.  
</P>
<P>
	``We would require that every therapeutic class (of drug) be  
covered,'' said Sperling. 
</P>
<P>
	Participation in the Medicare drug benefit would be optional --  
people who felt they could get a better deal from a private 
insurance policy or retiree health benefits from a former employer 
could forgo it. Clinton is pledging financial incentives to 
encourage employers to keep offering drug benefits to their 
retirees. 
</P>
<P>
	But administration officials estimated that 31 million people  
would opt for the Medicare plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The new benefit would be available starting in 2002 for a

<HEADLINE> Gov't Reaches Deal on Y2K Lawsuits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Putting aside politics to confront what many  
fear could be an economic disaster, Congress and the White House 
agreed Tuesday on legislation that would put restraints on lawsuits 
arising from Year 2000 computer problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Both President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore were involved  
in the sometimes-hectic negotiations to find a compromise and avoid 
a presidential veto of a bill that was avidly sought by the 
high-tech industry, an important financial backer of the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody is naive about the politics,'' said Sen. Ron Wyden,  
D-Ore., who with Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., acted as liaison 
between congressional Republicans and the White House. He said Gore 
was ``very heavily involved in the substance'' of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodd said he talked to Clinton in Connecticut Monday and was  
again on the phone with him about 1:30 a.m. Tuesday to discuss 
progress in the negotiations. Clinton wanted a bill, he said, but 
insisted on consumer protections. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, strongly backed by the business community, would try  
to head off predatory lawsuits resulting from Y2K computer 
breakdowns by giving companies 90 days to fix computer systems 
before lawsuits can be filed and encouraging out-of-court 
mediation. 
</P>
<P>
	It would also limit punitive damages for small businesses and  
make it harder to file class-action lawsuits. In one of the last 
points to be resolved, the two sides agreed to increase the 
monetary threshold for class-action lawsuits from $1 million to $10 
million before a case can be moved to federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	The final compromise also added some consumer protection  
language to provisions ensuring that in most cases a defendant is 
liable only for that proportion of the damage he causes. The 
consumer-oriented language ensures, for example, that consumers can 
get full benefit when in cases of bad faith. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., an opponent of the legislation,  
called it ``a closed-door deal that will hurt consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joan Claybrook of the consumer group Public Citizen also struck  
out at what she called the ``shocking about-face'' of the White 
House. ``Come Jan. 1, mom and pop businesses and consumers all over 
the country will not forgive the White House for stripping their 
rights to hold reckless corporations accountable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the deal, White House Chief of Staff John Podesta wrote in  
a letter to Dodd, he was prepared to recommend that the president 
sign the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters hope to get House and Senate approval of the  
compromise this week, so they can send it to the president before 
Congress leaves for its July 4 recess. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the chief Senate sponsor, said that  
late Monday, with negotiations going poorly, he didn't think an 
agreement was possible. ``But there was a realization on both sides 
that this is so critical to American business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations began at the end of last week after lawmakers  
withdrew a threat to send the president a bill he was sure to veto. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said that a flood of lawsuits resulting from computers  
not updated to read the year 2000 date could have a ``crippling 
effect on our economy,'' with some estimates of $1 trillion in 
civil action. 
</P>
<P>
	Business groups and the high-tech industry pushed hard for the  
House-passed bill that would have gone further in clamping down on 
lawsuits and protecting both big and small companies from legal 
harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's Senate bill, after extensive negotiations involving  
Dodd, Wyden and other Senate Democrats, added more protections for 
consumers, but the administration said it still didn't go far 
enough to protect the legal rights of people to be compensated for 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas J. Donohue, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's president and  
CEO, said that even with the concessions to the White House, the 
compromise was a ``watershed achievement for business and the 
American economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Millions of small businesses, communities, hospitals and  
high-tech entrepreneurs can now focus on fixing any remaining Y2K 
problems instead of worrying about a group of trial lawyers looking 
to get rich off Y2K.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Both Republicans and Democrats have put politics behind them  
to work together on a solution to a potential global technology 
crisis,'' said National Association of Manufacturers president 
Jerry Jasinowski.

<HEADLINE> Jury Awards Cowboys' CB $22.5 Mil. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- A jury awarded former Texas Tech  
quarterback Zebbie Lethridge $22.5 million Tuesday in his lawsuit 
against Dillard's department store and a security guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors in the 364th District Court made the decision in a 1995  
incident in which Lethridge and two friends were accused of 
stealing a pair of earrings from a Dillard's store. Lethridge, who 
starred for four years at Texas Tech, is now a cornerback with the 
Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	After Lethridge, 24, was found innocent of the charge in Lubbock  
Municipal Court, he filed a civil suit saying Dillard's and 
security guard Tom Robison accused him of shoplifting only because 
he is black. 
</P>
<P>
	Lethridge declined to comment on a possible appeal or how he'd  
spend the money. He said he views his victory as ``a statement to 
the whole world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This shows that a young black man can get justice in  
Lubbock,'' Lethridge said. ``I had embarrassment and an empty 
feeling inside of me for all these years, and I appreciate what the 
jurors did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers for Dillard's said they will appeal the  
decision.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks rallied for a second straight  
session, surprising Wall Street with its momentum a day ahead of 
the Federal Reserve's interest rate announcement. The Dow Jones 
industrial average closed up 160.20 at 10,815.35, extending 
Monday's 102.59-point gain. Volume was light throughout the 
session, magnifying price swings and suggesting that the rally, 
while broad-based, lacked conviction. Other market indicators were 
also higher, although their gains lagged behind the Dow. The Nasdaq

	Fed Expected To Up Interest Rates  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve will nudge interest rates  
up Wednesday for the first time in more than two years, according 
to the widely held view in financial markets. Then the real 
guessing game begins: How many more rate hikes will the central 
bank order to slow the red-hot U.S. economy to a more sustainable 
pace? While analysts disagree on how high the central bank will 
need to boost borrowing costs for millions of American consumers 
and businesses to slow economic activity, they are virtually 
certain the Fed will start the process tomorrow.

	Consumer Confidence at 30-Year High  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Consumer confidence rose in June to its highest  
level in more than 30 years, signaling even stronger economic 
growth ahead, the Conference Board reported today. The rise in the 
index to 138.4 in June from a revised 137.7 in May was the eighth 
consecutive monthly increase and was well above analysts' 
expectations. There was also news that sales of new homes fell 5.1 
percent in May -- twice as much analysts had expected. The decline 
reported by the Commerce Department is largely attributed to rising 
mortgage rates.

	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- General Mills Inc. today credited strong  
sales of Cheerios, Total and brands fortified with calcium for 
helping boost earnings 14 percent in the fourth quarter and 27 
percent for the entire fiscal year. For the quarter ended May 30, 
General Mills earned $104.8 million, or 67 cents a share. Sales for 
the quarter rose to $1.60 billion, with 2 percentage points of the 
gain attributed to the third-quarter acquisitions of Lloyd's 
Barbeque Co. and Farmhouse Foods. General Mills stock gained 1/2 to 
79 1/4 today.

	TOKYO (AP) -- Toyota Motor Corp. will commercialize a  
pollution-free fuel cell electric vehicle in 2003, aiming to become 
the first to put such a vehicle on the market, Toyota chairman 
Hiroshi Okuda was quoted as saying today. The new vehicle will be 
mass-produced starting in 2003, Okuda was quoted as telling 
reporters by Kyodo News service. Toyota is apparently seeking to 
set a global standard for fuel cell vehicles by putting the vehicle 
on the market before the German-U.S. automaker DaimlerChrysler AG, 
which plans to market one by 2004, Kyodo reported.

announced today that Freeman J. Thomas, the head of VW's California 
design studio, would become the head of future product design. 
Thomas, 41, was one of the co-designers of the new Beetle, along 
with J Mays, who's now the head of design for Ford Motor Co. Thomas 
will work on future products and help the company decide where it 
should take its Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep car and truck lines, said 
John Herlitz, DaimlerChrysler's vice president for product design.

the merger of the two banks earlier this month. His departure, 
which takes effect tomorrow, will be on ``amicable terms,'' 
Deutsche Bank said today. Newman said he was stepping aside because 
he ``concluded that the role originally envisioned for me will not 
be necessary.'' After the merger, it was planned for Newman to sit 
on the Deutsche Bank board. But a published report over the weekend 
said Deutsche Bank decided to drop Newman because he did not 
provide sufficient information about illegal money transfers at 
Bankers Trust from 1994-96.

``Retail Leaders'' program forces retailers to relegate their 
brands to the back shelves or display spots on or near the floor. 
The preliminary injunction by U.S. District Court Judge Frank

<HEADLINE> Closed Buick Plant's Future Unclear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLINT, Mich. (AP) -- As the last two Buick LeSabres rolled off  
the line Tuesday at Buick City Assembly Center, more than 1,000 
jobs ended. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors officials said they have not determined what will  
become of the site of the aging assembly plant after it is torn 
down, but Flint Mayor Woodrow Stanley is clinging to the hope GM 
will build something new at the complex. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley announced a proposal nine weeks ago to try to persuade  
GM to construct another facility. He said he will not release 
details of the incentive package until he can arrange a meeting 
with GM executives. The package is worth at least $400 million, 
Stanley has said. 
</P>
<P>
	If GM decides not to use the property, local economic  
development leaders say the site should be turned into an 
industrial park, The Flint Journal reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that it's an excellent opportunity for industrial  
use,'' said Todd Brian, president of the Flint-Genesee Economic 
Growth Alliance, the county's lead economic development agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The city's application for a federal empowerment zone noted that  
GM had agreed to donate Buick City property to the Growth Alliance. 
But the city's attempt to secure the zone, which would have brought 
$100 million in federal aid, failed this year. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be at least a couple of years before the site is ready  
for reuse. GM must first clear it of any contamination and remove 
buildings deemed unsuitable for use. 
</P>
<P>
	Demolition of about 4 million square feet of floor space will  
start in early 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's Powertrain Group will still operate an engine plant and  
component operations on the city's north side. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,100 workers affected by the closing were placed on  
protected status, waiting to be picked up by other plants. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really your home,'' said Dale Bingley, 52, who spent  
12 years working in Buick City. He had transferred there from the 
former Fisher 1 assembly plant, which had also closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It brings back bad memories,'' Bingley said.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: `South Park' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Canadians are denounced and degraded. Jewish mothers are  
portrayed as uber-kvetchers. Parents are all stupid and teachers 
all sadly misanthropic. And Saddam Hussein -- well, he's having hot 
sex with ... Satan. 
</P>
<P>
	The new comedy is here, and it's carrying a message: Offend  
absolutely everyone, and no one can complain that they've been 
wronged. 
</P>
<P>
	``South Park,'' the moronic yet disturbingly addictive blend of  
``Peanuts'' and ``Beavis and Butt-head'' that won viewers' inner 
delinquents on Comedy Central, is making its first big-screen 
foray. 
</P>
<P>
	And, wonder of wonders, if you get past the fact that it's  
juvenile and utterly profane, ``South Park: Bigger, Longer and 
Uncut'' is both smart and wildly funny -- far better than 
``Baseketball,'' the previous cinematic ``effort'' of Trey Parker 
and Matt Stone. 
</P>
<P>
	A little background for the uninitiated: ``South Park'' debuted  
on TV in 1997, chronicling the lives of four dysfunctional kids 
with Charlie Brown heads and thick parkas who live in a Colorado 
mountain town. 
</P>
<P>
	There is Stan, who throws up whenever he talks to Wendy, the  
girl he loves; Kyle, who's constantly being picked on for being 
Jewish; Eric Cartman, who's overweight -- ``big-boned,'' he insists 
-- and favors Cheesy Poofs and dirty jokes; and Kenny, whose words 
you can't understand and who dies horribly in each episode. 
</P>
<P>
	Together they wend their way through life, dealing with bad  
school lunches, telling toilet jokes and battling the occasional 
giant mechanical Barbra Streisand or bigfoot-type creature with 
Patrick Duffy's face for a foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Not exactly family supper-table fare. It was controversial from  
the get-go. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie debut is just as offensive, but it's also crack social  
commentary and a wonderful piece of theater of the absurd that 
plunders the cultural mosaic, citing everything from the Viewmaster 
to ``The Diary of Anne Frank'' to MGM blockbuster musicals of the 
1930s. 
</P>
<P>
	The premise: A profane Canadian comedy team called Terrance and  
Phillip comes out with a movie about flatulence. The kids go to see 
it and learn to swear, then spread their newfound knowledge around 
town. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents are outraged, especially Kyle's mother. She helps form a  
group called ``Mothers Against Canada'' and urges President Clinton 
to arrest Terrance and Phillip, who are lured to America by an 
appearance on ``Conan O'Brien'' (voiced by Brent Spiner of ``Star 
Trek: The Next Generation''). 
</P>
<P>
	This leads to war -- with Canada. Alanis Morrisette albums are  
burned en masse. Bryan Adams is denounced. Terrance and Phillip are 
sentenced to execution. The Canadian army attacks -- with chainsaws. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Kenny dies horribly and goes to hell, where he learns  
that Satan, together with his sidekick Saddam, are plotting to take 
over the world. It's up to the South Park boys to stop Satan and 
save their ``quiet little redneck mountain town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone will like this movie. Yes, it's a cartoon, but it's  
hardly for kids. And it's easy to be offended by, well, all the 
offensive subject matter. Yet woven within the muck are some 
worthwhile themes. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie is virtually a musical, with the animated characters  
breaking into song at every turn. And the songs are actually good, 
in an MGM '30s kind of way: catchy and memorable even as they 
lampoon traditional musical comedies. Satan sings longingly of 
living on Earth; the boys vamp about ``The Resistance'' and sing 
about their admiration for Olympic medalist Brian Boitano 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond that, ``South Park,'' like all good anarchy comedy,  
actually has a plot -- and a point. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes jabs at racism (an all-black platoon, led by the  
cafeteria cook ``Chef'' -- voiced by Isaac Hayes -- is sent into 
battle first as cannon fodder). It skewers government quick-fixes 
(executing Terrance and Phillip to make a statement about the link 
between popular culture and profanity). It even takes on war 
culture, offering fake Movietone newsreels and showing Canadians 
being rounded up and shipped to internment camps. 
</P>
<P>
	It even introduces a V-chip implant that shocks a child whenever  
he swears; the foul-mouthed Cartman, of course, is the guinea pig. 
``I'm sorry -- I can't help myself,'' he quips. ``That movie has 
warped my fragile little mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, no one is truly likable and few are admirable, and  
viewers are free to have fun with absolutely no attachment to 
anything. The ``South Park'' movie is certainly not cinema for the 
ages, but it's laugh-out-loud funny -- and rated very, very R. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker directed the Paramount Pictures-Warner Bros. movie and  
co-wrote it with Stone and Pam Brady.

<HEADLINE> Drunken Driver Gets 49 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- A man got 49 years in prison for killing a  
pregnant woman and her daughter in a drunken driving accident as he 
was headed to jail for driving drunk. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Wayne Branch, 33, was sentenced on Monday for the 1997  
crash that killed Stefanie Brown Kuehl and 6-month-old Zadie. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Branch has utter contempt for the laws of society. This is  
every mother and father's worst nightmare, and I'm afraid for 
society when Mr. Branch is released in about 15 years,'' Judge 
Chris Craft said, referring to when Branch could become eligible 
for parole. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge added: ``He has shown absolutely no remorse, and I  
believe when he's out, he'll start drinking and driving again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Branch was on his way to serve a weekend sentence at the county  
penal farm when his vehicle slammed into the side of Mrs. Kuehl's 
car. His blood-alcohol level was 0.22, more than twice the legal 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Branch was convicted in April of aggravated vehicular homicide  
involving alcohol and driving on a revoked license. He has two 
prior drunken driving convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I'm not perfect, but I hope everyone can forgive me for  
the accident because it was not intentional,'' he said at his

	Clinton: Let U.S. Pay for Drugs  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, calling for the biggest  
expansion in Medicare's history, proposed today that the federal 
government help older Americans pay for prescription drugs. ``In a 
nation bursting with prosperity,'' Clinton said, ``no senior should 
have to choose between buying food and buying medicine, but we know 
that happens.'' He wants Medicare to pay up to $1,000 a year 
initially in return for a monthly fee of $24. The maximum federal 
payment for drugs would climb to $2,500 by 2008 as the monthly 
patient fee rises to $44.

	CACAK, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serbs upset with President Slobodan  
Milosevic staged a sprawling opposition rally Tuesday, with 10,000 
protesters demanding a new Yugoslav government. The rally in the 
central Serbian town of Cacak was organized by Yugoslavia's main 
pro-democracy coalition, the Alliance for Change. ``Resignation! 
Resignation!'' the crowd chanted. Discontent has grown throughout 
Serbia since Milosevic gave in to NATO demands and pulled Serb 
troops and police out of Kosovo.

Edwin Sabillon's grandmother in Honduras told The Associated Press 
the boy's father is dead. Speaking about her grandson, Paula

The measure was approved 1,633 to 1,564, a margin of only 69 votes. 
Supporters said the town in southeastern Vermont has a population 
of about 10,000, needs the help and the 160 jobs the prison would

<HEADLINE> Russia Ends Ruble Trade Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia has scrapped a special currency trading  
session that was designed to keep the exchange rate of the ruble 
stable, but a top official said the move wouldn't drastically 
affect the rate because other controls remain in place. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank eliminated a special currency-trading session  
that was limited to importers and exporters, joining it with the 
regular trading session. The move announced today came after the 
International Monetary Fund said it would not grant Russia a new 
$4.5 billion loan unless the special session was scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
	The restricted trading session, introduced in the wake of  
Russia's financial meltdown last August, had helped prop up the 
ruble and boost the hard currency reserves of the Central Bank, 
which could buy dollars at a low rate during these special 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the system goes against the policies of the IMF, which  
said Russia must abandon it and enact other reforms if it wants the 
loan, which would largely go to pay off older debts to the IMF. 
</P>
<P>
	Mikhail Zadornov, the presidential envoy to the IMF and other  
international institutions, said he didn't expect the unification 
of the two sessions to have a significant impact on the ruble's 
exchange rate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Central Bank has sufficiently large reserves'' to protect  
the ruble from a plunge, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruble tended to be stronger at the special sessions because  
exporters are required to convert a large share of their foreign 
currency revenue into rubles. That meant they had to buy rubles at 
the special session. 
</P>
<P>
	In the general open-market trading, there is little interest in  
buying rubles, while there is heavy buying of strong Western 
currencies, such as the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Zadornov said the Russian government is not planning any  
immediate lifting of other foreign currency controls after the 
unification. 
</P>
<P>
	``The foreign exchange policy of the government and the central  
bank remains dominant because it has been shown to be the correct 
one,'' Zadornov said at a news conference today. 
</P>
<P>
	Changes to a rule aimed at halting capital flight through  
restrictions on importers, for example, will be made quite slowly, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The outflow (of hard currency) is still a concern, so there  
won't be any sharp changes in the law,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the State Statistics Committee announced that  
Russia's gross domestic product dropped 3 percent in the first 
quarter of this year from the same period in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The estimate pegged first quarter GDP at 774 billion rubles ($31  
billion), said a committee spokeswoman, Olga Kolesnikova. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's GDP fell 4.6 percent last year and the government  
forecasts a 2.5 percent decline this year.

<HEADLINE> Marv Albert Rehired by NBC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Marv Albert is back where he started on network  
television, returning to NBC less than two years after he was fired 
for pleading guilty in a sex case. 
</P>
<P>
	And not everyone remembered him Tuesday, when he made his first  
trip to NBC headquarters since the scandal. A security guard 
stopped him and asked for identification. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert, who once again will announce NBA games for the network,  
called his return ``kind of a euphoria -- a nice, weird feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just so happy to be back. ... There will be plenty of  
national exposures and I'm very satisfied to come home,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert won't return to his former role as the network's top  
play-by-play man for NBA games, but will complement its existing 
broadcast teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert, who agreed to a multiyear deal, will work about 15  
regular-season NBA games and the first four weekends of the 
playoffs. He will also be involved in boxing telecasts during the 
2000 Olympics and hockey in the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC sports chairman Dick Ebersol made it known shortly after  
firing Albert in September 1997 that he was interested in bringing 
him back. Reports that Fox was close to signing Albert for its NFL 
games prompted Ebersol to work quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was actually reading that Marv was in discussions with Fox  
and it told me that this was the opportunity to move or we wouldn't 
be able to do this for three or four years,'' Ebersol said. ``I 
realized I'd better react immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox executive producer Ed Goren understood Albert's decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``On the one hand, we were looking forward to Marv being part of  
the NFL on Fox, but I'm thrilled that Marv will be back on NBC 
where he belongs,'' Goren said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert began his national comeback this season when he was hired  
by Turner Sports in February to work NBA games. 
</P>
<P>
	He will make his return to NBC, where he worked from 1977-1997,  
before the end of the year -- probably on a studio show or NBC's 
first NBA telecast on Christmas Day. He will also continue with a 
full slate of some 25 regular-season games and a handful of 
postseason games on Turner. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert also resigned from Madison Square Garden network shortly  
after being fired by NBC, but was brought back on board with MSG 
one year ago as the anchor of ``MSG Sports Desk'' and as the radio 
play-by-play voice for half of the New York Knicks games. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert's Turner debut came on TNT's broadcast of the Los Angeles  
Lakers game at Phoenix on April 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's better for me to look ahead than look back,'' Albert  
said. ``Everything's gone in the right direction in the past 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His last NBA national telecast for NBC was the finals in 1997.  
He also worked the NFL playoffs later that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault charges in  
September 1997 after being accused of biting his lover's back in a 
hotel room during a sexual encounter.

<HEADLINE> NBA Draft Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lamar Odom retained his title as the Offical  
Enigma of the NBA Draft when he failed to show for Tuesday's 
meet-the-media session. 
</P>
<P>
	Considered the most talented player available, Odom has seen his  
stock fall by skipping scheduled workouts and saying he had second 
thoughts about entering the draft. Any chance of his returning for 
a sophomore year at Rhode Island was dashed, however, because he 
had already signed with an agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Another top prospect Wally Szczerbiak, whose value has risen  
because of his strong workouts, said it was time Odom showed some 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a great kid. I don't understand what's going on,'' said  
Szczerbiak, who once played on an AAU team with Odom. ``You'd think 
two days before the draft there would be something on his 
whereabouts, what he's doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He probably has a lot of people pulling him in all kinds of  
different directions, like a rubber band. It's a tough situation, 
but at the same time, he's a grown man now, and he's got to make 
these decisions and show up for the things he's supposed to show up 
for. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is no high school, this is no joke here, this is the NBA  
draft. It doesn't get any bigger than that. You can't be playing 
games with NBA general managers and NBA coaches, especially with 
the lucrative career he's about to embark on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An NBA spokesman said Odom missed the interview session because  
of a delayed flight. Odom arrived in town later Tuesday and was 
scheduled to attend Wednesday's draft at the MCI Center. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *COREY HITS THE GAS:* Corey Maggette, entering the draft after  
his freshman year at Duke, said he was surprised by all the 
psychological tests he was asked to perform during his workouts 
with various teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Bulls, that's a prime example, you have a three-hour  
test,'' Maggette said. ``They ask you strange questions like: It's 
a yellow light, would you run it or would you stop? It was a fun 
experience, but it was also a little headache as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And what does Maggette do when he sees the light change?  
</P>
<P>
	``It depends,'' he said, laughing. ``I'd probably run the yellow  
light.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MR. MONTENEGRO:* Aleksander Radojevic, a 7-foot-3 center from  
Montenegro, figures to be picked in the middle of the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	He has played the past two seasons at Barton County (Kan.)  
Community College, and hasn't returned home for fear of being 
drafted into the Yugoslav Army. 
</P>
<P>
	Radojevic planned to attend Ohio State next season but was  
declared ineligible by the NCAA because he once accepted $13,000 to 
play professionally in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I gave it to my family,'' he said of the money. ``It was only  
so my family could survive. I needed to do something. That's a lot 
of money. They spent it on food, mostly on groceries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Radojevic, 22, worked out for 17 of the league's 29 teams.  
</P>
<P>
	He plans to move his family out of Yugoslavia with the money he  
will earn in the NBA. One of his siblings is a twin brother, 
Zelimar, who is a foot shorter and has never played basketball. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BARON HIS THOUGHTS:* While many of the projected top picks were  
trying to play it cool as they arrived in town, UCLA guard Baron 
Davis made no pretense of his draft-eve jitters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm real nervous, man,'' Davis said, shaking his head. ``I'm  
not showing it, but I'm nervous. I'm nervous inside. It's hard for 
me to sleep at night. It's like nonstop butterflies. It's a lot of 
anticipating. Everybody's anticipating what's going to happen, and 
nobody knows.''

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'Summer of Sam' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Theater owners, check those IDs. ``Summer of Sam,'' Spike Lee's  
riff on the 1970s serial killer Son of Sam, is an R-rated invasion 
of sex, drugs and violence. It's as relentless as ``Boogie 
Nights,'' but its spirit, strangely, feels closer to ``Jaws.'' It's 
essentially an old-fashioned scare movie, with a human killer 
instead of a shark. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, of course, isn't Steven Spielberg. For better and for  
worse, he's not that commercial-minded. At 2 hours and 20 minutes, 
``Summer of Sam'' has the structure and ambition of a major film, 
but it works best as entertainment. Otherwise, what you get is 
structure and ambition. 
</P>
<P>
	Enough time has passed to make the film's setting, New York City  
of the '70s, seem as distinctive and as far away as Paris of the 
'20s. On the verge of bankruptcy, it was the city of ``Taxi 
Driver,'' not ``Seinfeld.'' It was a city going mad, personified on 
film by Robert De Niro's Travis Bickle and in real life by a pudgy 
loner named David Berkowitz, aka, Son of Sam. 
</P>
<P>
	In the extra-hot summer of '77, New Yorkers were terrified by  
this wily killer who gunned down women with long, dark hair and 
wrote articulate letters to tabloid columnist Jimmy Breslin. With 
the police seemingly no match for Sam, women began wearing blonde 
wigs and restaurant-goers stayed home. Even Breslin, who appears as 
himself in ``Summer of Sam,'' hurried his daughter out of town. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Lee's ``Do the Right Thing,'' the new film is the story of  
a neighborhood in heat. The director bases ``Summer of Sam'' in an 
Italian community in the Bronx where friends, police and a few 
mobsters drive themselves crazy trying to solve the crime. Sooner 
or later everyone's a suspect, from an unpopular local priest to 
New York Yankees slugger Reggie Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	John Leguizamo stars as a typical Lee anti-hero: a confused  
young man trying to ``do the right thing.'' He's a hairdresser 
named Vinny who cheats helplessly on his wife, Dionna (Mira 
Sorvino), and also betrays his best friend, Ritchie (Adrien Brody), 
a spike-haired punk high on the list of murder suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	The art of any good scare film is knowing how to use the  
monster. ``Summer of Sam'' is never more interesting than when you 
see these people obsessing about Sam, or when you see Sam himself 
(Michael Badalucco), smashing his head against his apartment walls, 
hallucinating about his neighbor's black Labrador, which he 
believes sends him orders to kill. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee is smart enough not to give Sam too much screen time, but he  
ends up giving him too little. There are long stretches where you 
forget about him entirely and the movie falls back on Italians 
using four-letter words. The characters aren't strong enough on 
their own. They're like most characters in scary movies, defined by 
what frightens them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Summer of Sam'' has a different look for Lee. The cast is  
mostly white and the cinematography doesn't have the usual splashy 
colors. It's muted, brownish, as if the whole city were a light 
bulb about to burn out. The script, by Lee, Victor Colicchio and 
Michael Imperioli, is tighter than those for other Lee movies, but 
it's still too long and too broad. Lee has always been a better 
image-maker than storyteller. 
</P>
<P>
	But he always constructs at least a few great scenes. There's  
Vinny and Dionna dancing to Marvin Gaye in an empty disco and Vinny 
pleading with Dionna not to leave him. And for a few minutes, in a 
montage set to The Who's ``Baba O'Riley,'' Lee lives up to his 
idol, Martin Scorsese. You need a brutal eye to see the violence of 
Sam in both the guitar swings of Pete Townshend and the home run 
swings of Reggie Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	A Touchstone Pictures release, ``Summer of Sam'' was produced by  
Spike Lee and John Kilik. The film is rated R.

<HEADLINE> BET Plans New Black-Created Movies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In a Beverly Hills hotel, in front of an  
attentive audience, Whoopi Goldberg, Hispanic network executive 
Nely Galan and others were lamenting television's snub of 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Few programs feature black, Hispanic or Asian characters; there  
is scant ethnic representation among the people who create series 
or decide which ones to air, and the situation isn't improving, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The same day, at the same time, at a downtown studio 10 miles  
away, a bustling TV movie set showed how different things could be. 
From the make-up artist to the grips to the director to the stars, 
this was a black-dominated production. 
</P>
<P>
	Not, of course, by accident: ``Incognito,'' a thriller, is one  
of an ambitious series of 10 movies drawn from the Arabesque line 
of black romance novels and produced by cable channel Black 
Entertainment Television. 
</P>
<P>
	The BET movies represent, quite simply, rare opportunities for  
black artists, producers and technicians and an unprecedented 
chance for viewers to see black men and women presented as 
nonstereotypical characters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see all of these people buzzing around, and for the first  
time African-American talent is not only green-lighting a project 
but also overseeing it from script to final edit. That is 
absolutely phenomenal,'' said Robert L. Johnson, chairman of the 
network's parent company, BET Holdings Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it bodes well for what can happen when we bring our  
creative talent along with managerial talent and capital to this 
entertainment opportunity,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	BET Holdings, which purchased Arabesque in 1998, is not acting  
selflessly, of course: Johnson expects that his channel's 
investment in original movies will enhance BET's value for its 
cable carriers and attract more advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt one way to do that was to produce movies that spoke to  
the black middle-class experience and dealt with themes that are 
not usually on television. So there's romance, suspense, mysteries 
involving attractive black men and women,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fare may be essentially lightweight, drawn from the same  
kind of breathless stories familiar to readers of white romance 
novels, but it represents a serious breakthrough on several fronts. 
</P>
<P>
	The heroes and heroines are journalists and computer software  
magnates, articulate and affluent, not junkie moms and gang 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	In researching ``Intimate Betrayal,'' writer-director Diane  
Wynter easily found real-world examples of black female journalists 
and black-run computer firms. ``But if you went by what you saw on 
television, they would be nonexistent,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The characters and stories aren't filtered through the prism of  
black-white conflict, as is often the case when Hollywood pays 
attention to blacks. Instead, the BET dramas allow blacks to stand 
as individuals without white definition. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're quite focused on the African-American characters  
themselves, and the challenges they face that are quite personal,'' 
said Njeri Karago, the BET executive in charge of production for 
the Arabesque series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to be crying race on these particular ones. We  
want to look at the people, their backgrounds and their human 
qualities, their triumphs and challenges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The romance alone is revolutionary.  
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood is ``so afraid that if you do black sexuality or black  
romance that somehow it's a taboo subject, so they stay away from 
it,'' Johnson said. ``Every once in a while it pops up in 'Soul 
Food' or 'Waiting to Exhale' or 'How Stella Got Her Groove Back,' 
but no one does it consistently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Incognito'' stars Allison Dean as an insurance company  
executive who witnesses a murder and has to rely on a bodyguard 
(Richard T. Jones) for protection from the killer. Think of the 
Whitney Houston film ``Bodyguard'' and you have the idea. Filmmaker 
Julie Dash (``Daughters of the Dust'') is directing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Intimate Betrayal,'' featuring Monica Calhoun and Khalil Kain  
in the tale of a magazine reporter trying to solve the murder of 
her brother, a software designer, is the second film in the series 
that begins this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Campanella II is executive producer of the project, which is  
tightly budgeted at $850,000 per film and running with the 
efficiency of a military operation: The movies are on three-week 
shooting schedules and are being filmed back to back. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the size of the paychecks may be, there are other  
advantages. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here's Roy, a Columbia business school graduate, an  
experienced filmmaker, sitting out here in Hollywood and nobody was 
giving this guy an opportunity,' said Johnson. ``Now he's out there 
doing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He and Campanella see the Arabesque project as the platform for  
theatrical film production, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun, who gained notice with the 1988 film ``Bagdad Cafe,''  
also is getting much-deserved work and exposure, said Wynter. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has tremendous acting ability, is beautiful, well-spoken  
and gifted. She should be a major movie star, but there's only so 
much room for African-American movie stars. Yet if you look at the 
mainstream actresses, a new one is unveiled every year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The films are being produced at a time when broadcast TV is  
increasingly white: Few network shows on the fall schedule feature 
minority characters, which has prompted the NAACP and other groups 
to form a coalition to protest the exclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	The burden of creating and showing alternative fare is falling  
to channels like BET. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way we're going to tell middle-class genre stories is  
if black people take it on themselves to tell them,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Director Wynter is especially enthusiastic about the chance to  
present appealing images to black girls and women. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is so sad is that quite often black women are portrayed  
very negatively or not at all,'' she said. ``And that's 
heartbreaking, especially when there's a growing middle class and 
we watch television and spend money like everyone else. But somehow 
we're not considered sex symbols or role models.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``How can you have a dream if you don't see an image of that  
dream? And when the dream is already a reality and then you turn on 
your television set and it's working against reality, that's a 
dreadful thing.''

<HEADLINE> Scheme Alleged in Fatal Joyride </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT STEWART, Ga. (AP) -- An Army helicopter pilot conspired with  
another pilot and a sergeant to take their wives on a joyride in 
the Bahamas that ended with a crash and the wives' deaths, a 
prosecutor said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a case involving a complex scheme of deception to get  
those wives on the plane,'' Capt. Ian Corey said in his opening 
statement Tuesday at the trial of Chief Warrant Officer Daniel 
Riddell. 
</P>
<P>
	Riddell faces charges of conspiracy and wrongful appropriation  
of an aircraft. A judge said he would rule later on another charge, 
dereliction of duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Riddell's attorney asked the judge to dismiss all the charges,  
saying the evidence is woefully inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted on all charges, Riddell could receive a maximum 9 1/2  
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges stem from the July 6 crash of a $6.6 million UH-60  
Blackhawk on Grand Exuma Island, killing the wives of Riddell and 
Chief Warrant Officer Dave Guido. 
</P>
<P>
	Guido was convicted earlier this month of conspiracy, wrongful  
appropriation of an aircraft and violation of a lawful general 
regulation. He was sentenced to a reprimand, plus fines and 
forfeited pay totaling $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Sgt. William Westgate is scheduled to be court-martialed on July  
8. He is charged with conspiracy and willful dereliction of duty.

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The as-yet-unfinished Staples Center, a  
20,000-seat downtown arena, will host the Grammy Awards in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The new center has nearly four times the capacity of the nearby  
Shrine Auditorium, which hosted the 41st annual Grammys in February 
following their three-year New York run. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Richard Riordan was to make the official announcement  
today outside the center, along with Michael Greene, president of 
the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, which 
organizes the awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Riordan had lobbied heavily to keep the Grammys in Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's where they belong,'' Ashleigh Adams, a Riordan  
spokeswoman, said Monday. ``We're the entertainment capital of the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $350 million Staples Center, adjacent to the Convention  
Center, is to open in October. Home to the Los Angeles Lakers, 
Clippers and Kings, the new Staples Center also will be used for 
the 2000 Democratic National Convention.

<HEADLINE> Penny-Stock Tycoon Pays $100M Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Robert E. Brennan -- a former penny-stock  
tycoon, philanthropist and race course owner -- has avoided a trial 
on state stock fraud charges by agreeing to pay $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan, who became nationally known in the 1980s from  
television commercials for his First Jersey Securities Inc., also 
accepted a lifetime ban on participating in the securities industry 
in New Jersey, according to court papers filed Monday. The federal 
Securities and Exchange Commission already had banned him from the 
securities industry anywhere in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan denied wrongdoing, but consented to a finding that he  
used his influence at two brokerages to make ``unreasonably 
excessive profits'' in low-cost stocks in which he held an 
undisclosed interest. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no indication how much, if any, of the settlement the  
bankrupt financier will ever pay. A bankruptcy court trustee is 
trying to recover millions of dollars that authorities believe 
Brennan fraudulently transferred to friends, relatives and trusts 
in the United States, Gibraltar and Nevis, a Caribbean island. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan, who lives in Juno Beach, Fla., once gave millions to  
charities including New Jersey's Seton Hall University, where he 
was chairman of the governing Board of Regents. 
</P>
<P>
	He once controlled two race tracks and had a stable of  
thoroughbred racing horses. With an eye on his legal entanglements, 
he called his stable ``Due Process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his commercials for First Jersey Securities, he stepped from  
a helicopter and told investors to ``come grow with us.'' The 
company has been inactive since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, a federal judge in New York ruled that Brennan cheated  
First Jersey investors and ordered him to pay what is now more than 
$78 million to the SEC. The judgment drove him to bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
	In the state's 1995 lawsuit that led to the new agreement,  
authorities charged that after closing First Jersey, Brennan 
secretly controlled two now-shuttered brokerages, Hibbard Brown and 
L.C. Wegard &AMP; Co. Inc., which pushed stocks he controlled onto 
unwitting investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The state accused Brennan, six others and the brokerages of  
making $300 million in illegal profits at the expense of investors 
from 1988 to 1995 by using illegal ``boiler room'' sales tactics 
and manipulating the prices of the low-cost securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement was reached last week as opening statements were  
to begin in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the defendants had recently settled charges against  
them and agreed to testify against Brennan.

<HEADLINE> Rain Washes Out Play at Wimbledon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Singing in the rain since she couldn't  
play in it, Alexandra Stevenson didn't let a dreary day intrude on 
her dreamy Wimbledon debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Showers washed out play completely Tuesday for the first time in  
two years, and the 30th time in 113 years, giving Jim Courier 
another 24 hours to figure out how to avoid being beaten by 
Britain's Tim Henman. 
</P>
<P>
	Courier and Henman struck a few balls, none in anger, between  
cloudbursts, then retreated to the lounge for an afternoon of 
backgammon and video games -- though not with each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't sit down and have dinner, but they did say  
hello,'' said David Felgate, Henman's coach. ``It's a small locker 
room, and there are 16 guys in it. There's no running away from 
each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henman led two sets to one, and 4-3 with Courier to serve in the  
fourth set of a match that began Monday and will resume, weather 
permitting, Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson, an effervescent 18-year-old who is into the fourth  
round as a newly turned pro, showed off her singing talents for the 
BBC with a show tune while she waited in vain to play fellow 
American Lisa Raymond. 
</P>
<P>
	Steffi Graf also remained on hold, two games from victory at  
6-2, 4-2 against Belgian qualifier Kim Clijsters. 
</P>
<P>
	So far the only players to reach the quarterfinals are Andre  
Agassi and Gustavo Kuerten, who will play each other on the men's 
side, and defending champion Jana Novotna and Lindsay Davenport, 
who will meet on the women's side. 
</P>
<P>
	The backup in the schedule means a lot of tennis will have to be  
crammed into a short span the rest of the week. If the fourth round 
can be completed Wednesday -- and the weather forecast is not 
encouraging -- then the quarterfinals likely would be held for both 
draws on Thursday, instead of being broken up as usual over two 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	That would result in the men's and women's semifinals being held  
Friday, followed by the women's final Saturday and the men's final 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Toss in the doubles and mixed doubles, and the endurance of the  
players will be sorely tested. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans waited through rain for seven hours with hopes of seeing  
some tennis, only to be told their optimism wouldn't be rewarded. 
Beer and dutchees, the British version of hot dogs, were big 
sellers as the fans turned to the giant screen or small portable 
televisions to watch old matches. 
</P>
<P>
	There were highlights of the 5-hour, 12-minute match -- the  
longest in Wimbledon history -- between Pancho Gonzales and Charlie 
Pasarell 30 years ago. Pasarell won the first set in that 
pre-tiebreak era, 24-22. Gonzales won the fifth set 11-9, and that 
just got him into the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	Then they showed the women's final from the same year, a victory  
by Britain's Ann Jones over Billie Jean King. Both players looked 
as if they'd be wiped away by any of the top 50 players today. 
</P>
<P>
	And, on this day when fillers were needed desperately by the  
BBC, there was a replay of the serving duel between Pete Sampras 
and Goran Ivanisevic from last year's final. 
</P>
<P>
	Inevitably, there was talk of a retractable roof that has not,  
and may never, be built at the All England Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology is not the issue, even if the surface is grass.  
Tradition and the English patience with the weather keeps it from 
happening, said Paul McNamee, director of the Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``But you have to think about the spectators as well in a very  
competitive environment,'' said McNamee, whose Grand Slam event on 
hardcourts has one stadium with a retractable roof and another 
under construction. 
</P>
<P>
	``The easiest solution would have been to build Court 1 with a  
roof,'' McNamee said, referring to the Wimbledon stadium that 
opened in 1997. ``That would have guaranteed play would have gone 
on at all times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNamee said he was shocked that Wimbledon -- faced with the  
demands of television -- could get away with washouts and not anger 
30,000 to 40,000 fans who queue up, camp out, and pay dearly to see 
tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Interestingly, the public here will still sit in the rain and  
have a good time,'' he said. ``In Australia we could not get away 
with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Gorringe, chief executive of the All England Club,  
acknowledged that the rain is tedious and frustrating for the fans 
and players, but he said a roof is not the answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Putting roofs on Centre or No. 1 Court,'' he said, ``merely  
creates difficulties in other areas ... deciding which matches 
should be played indoors and whether those players who play indoors 
receive an unfair advantage over those who do not. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fans come to Wimbledon because they still want to see the  
world's finest tennis players in action outdoors, on grass, and 
across all 18 courts.''

<HEADLINE> Police Search Trains For Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARLINGEN, Texas (AP) -- Law officers and railroad police are  
stopping trains and searching boxcars in a Wild West-style manhunt 
for Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, the tattooed ex-convict wanted in 
eight slayings along the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Union Pacific police officers regularly inspect trains and yards  
along the railway's routes in 23 states to catch people trying to 
ride the rails. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the search for Resendez-Ramirez, who is believed to  
travel the country by hopping trains, the railroad officers are 
teaming up with the FBI, the Border Patrol and other law 
enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to checking cars stopped in rail yards, they stop  
trains if necessary when a tip is received, Union Pacific spokesman 
Mark Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said the last time Union Pacific was involved in a major  
manhunt may have been more than 100 years ago, during the days of 
train robbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only one I can think of is the manhunt for Jesse James,''  
Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	In most cases, agents walk alongside trains, allowing dogs to  
sniff each car. If a dog signals that something is wrong, the 
agents will open a car for a search. 
</P>
<P>
	People have been known to hide inside fertilizer cars and amid  
foul-smelling industrial waste. But the dogs rarely miss a car 
where people are hiding, said John Brinning, the agent in charge of 
the Border Patrol station at Harlingen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Border Patrol pulls 500 illegal riders off trains each month  
in Harlingen, Brinning said. Across its territory, Union Pacific 
last year removed a total of 97,000 trespassers. That includes 
ordinary trespassers as well as people hopping rides on freights. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said the railroad is catching more train hoppers since the  
search started for Resendez-Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had several times when a suspect kind of answering the  
description was located out there in the freight yards, and it's 
usually just a transient,'' Brinning said. 
</P>
<P>
	Railroad police for Fort Worth-based Burlington Northern Santa  
Fe Corp. also are working with the Border Patrol to search trains. 
</P>
<P>
	Resendez-Ramirez has been charged with two murders in Illinois  
and is suspected in five killings in Texas and a 1997 slaying in 
Kentucky. The victims were all killed in homes near railroad 
tracks. Most were bludgeoned. Fingerprints link Resendez-Ramirez to 
at least some of the killings.

<HEADLINE> Frenchman Tests Positive for Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- A member of France's World Cup soccer champion  
team, Christophe Dugarry, tested positive for the anabolic steroid 
Nandrolene, though he denied on Wednesday taking the drug or any 
other banned substance. 
</P>
<P>
	Dugarry's Olympique Marseille team confirmed that the  
27-year-old failed a drug test after a French league match against 
Lyon on April 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am going to defend myself,'' Dugarry said. ``I have been  
tested more than 20 times in my career, including twice during the 
World Cup,'' he said. ``I have always been against cheating and 
always shown my disgust of doping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, four French players have been suspended for six  
months for taking Nandrolone, a drug with the purpose of helping 
muscle development and reducing fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest French star to be linked with drugs, Dugarry scored  
France's first World Cup goal last year, against South Africa, and 
went on to play in the final against Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	His combative style has involved him in controversy.  
</P>
<P>
	In his most recent match for France, Dugarry was sent off  
against Andorra, and drew a five-match suspension for his role in a 
brawl after a UEFA Cup match against Bologna.

<HEADLINE> Men Nabbed for Stealing 'Star Wars' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MENOMONIE, Wis. (AP) -- Three young men who stole a copy of the  
new Star Wars movie from a theater were ordered Tuesday to spend 
five days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important you have a taste of being confined,'' Dunn  
County Circuit Judge Rod Smeltzer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Phillips, 22, and brothers Mark Stearns, 22, and Matthew  
Stearns, 25, turned themselves in to police a few days after 
stealing ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' from the 
State Theater last month. 
</P>
<P>
	All pleaded guilty to misdemeanor theft.  
</P>
<P>
	The film was ruined, but what was recovered was returned to 20th  
Century Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the film unraveled and the mess was stuffed into a  
car. The men then tried to wash their fingerprints off the film in 
a bathtub, and finally cut it up and stuffed it into three garbage 
bags and a garbage can. 
</P>
<P>
	The film's value on the black market had been estimated to be  
more than $60,000.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Finance Hearings Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Campaign finance legislation that died in the  
House last year has a better chance of passing Congress this year, 
its sponsor contended before a House committee Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., said the odds improved for his bill  
after campaign finance legislation passed by the House died in the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's do not repeat the same sequence we had in the last  
Congress,'' Hutchinson told the House Administration Committee. 
``Let's do something different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I do believe there is a majority in this Congress to pass  
campaign reform,'' he said, ``but it should be something that can 
pass the Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least one committee member sounded skeptical.  
</P>
<P>
	``How is it that a bill that can't pass the House is something  
that we should hang our hats on?'' asked Rep. Chaka Fattah, D-Pa. 
``That's a little bit like saying we could win the Super Bowl if we 
could just get out of the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson commented at the second in a series of hearings on  
more than two dozen pending proposals for changes in the way 
political campaigns are financed. Republican leaders have promised 
to schedule a floor vote in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates of reform contend that won't give the Senate enough  
time to act. To that end, Democrats are trying to force a vote 
before then but remained as of Tuesday more than a dozen votes 
short of the 218 needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson's bill would ban ``soft money'' -- unlimited,  
unregulated donations that are supposed to be used only for 
political party activities -- at the federal level only. It also 
would require new disclosures for independent groups running issue 
ads and increase contribution limits according to inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The House rejected it last year on a 221-147 vote.  
</P>
<P>
	The bill that passed last year, 252-179, had the support of a  
majority of the Senate, but not the 60 votes needed to get it to 
the floor for consideration. Hutchinson doubted the additional 
votes would materialize this year. The Republicans hold a Senate 
majority of 55-45. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't think they're there,'' he said. ``We have to  
present something to the Senate that can acquire the additional 
votes rather than repeat the same steps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., co-sponsored the House-passed  
bill, which would eliminate ``soft money'' at both federal and 
state levels, regulate issue advertisements and expand disclosure 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Shays, who shared the witness table with Hutchinson, said he  
believes his bill could pass the Senate this year. But if it did 
not, Shays promised to work on behalf of the campaign finance bill 
that makes it through the House. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have a corrupt campaign system. I don't think it  
just looks corrupt. It is corrupt, and it's getting worse,'' Shays 
said. ``It is absolutely essential to get a good campaign bill to 
the Senate as soon as possible.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft To Donate $25 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. has announced plans to  
donate a further $25 million of funds recovered through its 
crackdown on software piracy. 
</P>
<P>
	The money will be donated to a variety of nonprofit  
organizations to provide access to technology for disadvantaged 
communities, and to promote creativity and entrepreneurship in 
science and technology, according to a news release issued today. 
</P>
<P>
	The donations -- at least $5 million a year for the next five  
years -- will be based on settlement recoveries and jury awards 
resulting from efforts by the software giant to crack down on 
software piracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we continue to confront a serious piracy problem,  
especially on a criminal scale, we think it's appropriate that 
Microsoft redirect monies recouped from these illegal activities 
into programs that will spread the benefits of technology more 
broadly,'' said Brad Smith, general counsel of the company's 
worldwide sales and support division who is overseeing the 
anti-piracy efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft first launched its Giving Campaign in the United  
States in 1983 and last year expanded it abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 6,000 people in Europe have been trained, with more  
than 90 percent of the graduates securing well-paid employment in 
the technology industry, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	The software industry lost nearly $11 billion to piracy last  
year, according to a study by Business Software Alliance released 
June 16.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Thai Lawmaker Faces Deportation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A onetime member of Thailand's Parliament  
pleaded guilty Tuesday to conspiring to smuggle marijuana into the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanong Siriprechapong, who had spent 3 1/2 years in federal prison  
awaiting trial, was given credit for time served and released for 
deportation. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court Judge Vaughn R. Walker dropped all other  
charges against Thanong. The nearly decade-long case was fraught 
with delays brought on by negotiations between the United States 
and Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
	On hearing the judge's decision, Thanong, 47, smiled and hugged  
his lawyers and interpreter. Thanong's attorneys expressed 
satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least now he gets to go home,'' attorney Bill Osterhoudt  
said. ``He suffered hugely by his incarceration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutor Sandy Teters would not comment.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, the former parliamentarian was indicted for smuggling  
four tons of marijuana into the United States, for conspiring to 
smuggle in 15 more tons and for leading a crime organization that 
smuggled marijuana aboard freight ships between 1973 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanong is the first Thai citizen ever to be extradited to the  
United States. He was a member of the Thai Parliament from 1983 to 
1986 and from 1992 to 1994.

<HEADLINE>  U.S. Faces Win or Else in World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	After outscoring opponents 13-1 in the first round of the  
Women's World Cup, the U.S. team might have reason to feel 
comfortable. It shouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the real challenge begins.  
</P>
<P>
	The Americans play Germany in the quarterfinals Thursday at  
Landover, Md. The Germans are, by far, the most formidable team the 
United States has faced in the tournament. Brazil plays Nigeria in 
the second half of the doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, it's defending champion Norway playing Sweden and  
China taking on Russia at San Jose, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what the World Cup is all about,'' U.S. midfielder  
Julie Foudy said. ``You win these games or you're out. This is what 
this team thrives on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It had better. A loss now not only would spoil what has been a  
nationwide celebration of the American women, it could send ticket 
sales crashing for the semifinals and final. It also could 
eliminate the United States from the 2000 Olympics, although that 
is a long shot; the Americans would have to be the biggest loser 
among the quarterfinalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, no one on the U.S. side is contemplating defeat.  
Germany is without captain Martina Voss, who has a torn leg muscle. 
The U.S. squad is 8-3-1 against Germany, which finished second in 
the '95 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Their most recent meeting was a 4-2 U.S. victory in Chicago last  
June, but three days before that, the teams tied 1-1 in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Germans are a very skilled, disciplined team,''  
U.S. star Mia Hamm said. ``They have a lot of good players. They 
won't be uncomfortable playing us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Tony DiCicco notes the German women play like their  
countrymen, which isn't bad: The German men have won three World 
Cups. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you think of Germany, the first thing that always comes  
to mind is their discipline,'' he said. ``It's the same with their 
men's team. They are tough, they never give up and they work 
relentlessly for 90 minutes. You can never count them out of a 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even without Voss, Germany still has midfielder Bettina  
Wiegmann. She creates much of the offense and is complemented by 
finishers Inka Grings and Brigit Prinz up front. Prinz has been 
especially dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, they are not going to encounter the type of teams they  
have encountered so far in the tournament,'' Italy coach Carlo 
Facchin said of the Americans. ``I think if the U.S. can raise the 
level of the match and the speed, it will win the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans are well rested. Michelle Akers and Kate Sobrero,  
both starters, have not played since the first half of the second 
game, against Nigeria. They should be fresh. Hamm, Tiffeny Milbrett 
and Cindy Parlow up front and Foudy in midfield also got breathers 
in the opening round. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Germany-United States match could be tight  
defensively, don't look for Brazil-Nigeria to be a stingy affair. 
Both love to show their offensive flair, and the game could turn on 
Brazil having a superior defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigeria coach Ismaila Mabo thinks his team is destined to meet  
the United States again in the semifinals, where it will avenge the 
7-1 defeat in Chicago. Brazil coach Wilson de Oliveira also said he 
expects his team to be in Stanford Stadium on July 4 to play the 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Jose doubleheader features the two teams that have  
looked every bit as good as the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese, winners against the Americans twice this year,  
would seem to have the only mismatch, because Russia is a newcomer 
to this level and advanced from the weakest group. Norway, despite 
injuries, has displayed offensive flair and balance. But this might 
be the best team Sweden has taken to a World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The winners of Wednesday's quarters meet in the semifinals in  
Foxboro, Mass., on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Russia Ends Ruble Trade Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia has scrapped a special currency trading  
session that was designed to keep the exchange rate of the ruble 
stable, but a top official said the move wouldn't drastically 
affect the rate because other controls remain in place. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank eliminated a special currency-trading session  
that was limited to importers and exporters, joining it with the 
regular trading session. The move announced today came after the 
International Monetary Fund said it would not grant Russia a new 
$4.5 billion loan unless the special session was scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
	The restricted trading session, introduced in the wake of  
Russia's financial meltdown last August, had helped prop up the 
ruble and boost the hard currency reserves of the Central Bank, 
which could buy dollars at a low rate during these special 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the system goes against the policies of the IMF, which  
said Russia must abandon it and enact other reforms if it wants the 
loan, which would largely go to pay off older debts to the IMF. 
</P>
<P>
	Mikhail Zadornov, the presidential envoy to the IMF and other  
international institutions, said he didn't expect the unification 
of the two sessions to have a significant impact on the ruble's 
exchange rate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Central Bank has sufficiently large reserves'' to protect  
the ruble from a plunge, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruble tended to be stronger at the special sessions because  
exporters are required to convert a large share of their foreign 
currency revenue into rubles. That meant they had to buy rubles at 
the special session. 
</P>
<P>
	In the general open-market trading, there is little interest in  
buying rubles, while there is heavy buying of strong Western 
currencies, such as the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Zadornov said the Russian government is not planning any  
immediate lifting of other foreign currency controls after the 
unification. 
</P>
<P>
	``The foreign exchange policy of the government and the central  
bank remains dominant because it has been shown to be the correct 
one,'' Zadornov said at a news conference today. 
</P>
<P>
	Changes to a rule aimed at halting capital flight through  
restrictions on importers, for example, will be made quite slowly, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The outflow (of hard currency) is still a concern, so there  
won't be any sharp changes in the law,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the State Statistics Committee announced that  
Russia's gross domestic product dropped 3 percent in the first 
quarter of this year from the same period in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The estimate pegged first quarter GDP at 774 billion rubles ($31  
billion), said a committee spokeswoman, Olga Kolesnikova. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's GDP fell 4.6 percent last year and the government  
forecasts a 2.5 percent decline this year.

<HEADLINE> Wall St. Challenge: Complacency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the midst of a mighty bull market, one of the  
biggest challenges facing any mutual-fund investor is to resist 
complacency. 
</P>
<P>
	There are plenty of prudent commentators around who keep warning  
against the dangers of an everything-is-fine-and-always-will-be 
mentality as you decide where to put your savings. 
</P>
<P>
	Your ears hear these admonitions. But cautionary words can't  
make much of a lasting impression when they diverge so drastically 
from the experience people have been having for so long. 
</P>
<P>
	At the halfway point of 1999, most stock funds are on track to  
post their fifth consecutive year of two-digit gains. Over the past 
15 years, according to calculations by Lipper Inc., the average 
stock fund has climbed at a rate of 15 percent a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as you tell yourself that this kind of thing can't continue  
forever, a rising market takes on the appearance of normal routine. 
Ah well, you may conjecture, maybe the bull market will slow down 
and everybody will have to ``settle'' for 8 percent or 10 percent 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't begin to cover all the possible outcomes. No matter  
what the past record and the present picture look like, and no 
matter what some expert or computer model predicts, the future for 
investments like stocks is always uncertain and unpredictable. 
</P>
<P>
	For a glimpse of the complacency that threatens every investor,  
take a look at the results of a survey of 700 investors nearing or 
just starting retirement, which was commissioned by the Forum For 
Investor Advice, an association of fund groups sold primarily 
through brokers. 
</P>
<P>
	Only about one in 10 of the respondents said they were very  
worried about outliving their assets, a sharp decline in the stock 
market, a major increase in inflation, or trouble affording the 
cost of a good nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that only 11 percent of recent retirees that we  
surveyed are seriously concerned about outliving their financial 
resources, and only 8 percent are concerned about a bear market in 
stocks, is really very surprising,'' said Barbara Levin, the 
organization's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can only assume that, despite the numerous warnings about  
the cost of a comfortable retirement, the unprecedented bull market 
in stocks and the excellent economy we have been experiencing has 
lulled them into a false sense of security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The point of all this is not to spread gloom, but to encourage  
looking at things realistically. There is every reason to hope that 
prosperity will continue to flourish on both Wall Street and Main 
Street for a long time to come. 
</P>
<P>
	But to plan well for your future, it makes sense to consider  
other what-ifs. In your study of a mutual fund, let's suppose you 
are looking at a graph that shows how much a hypothetical $10,000 
investment in 1970 would have grown to today. 
</P>
<P>
	This illustration, known in the industry as a ``mountain''  
chart, may look very impressive, and serve as a kind of 
advertisement for the idea of long-term investing. But it is of 
only limited value in planning for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	You can't buy a single dollar of that past performance. It has  
come and gone forever. You certainly don't want to base the 
planning for your financial future on the assumption that the exact 
same results will accrue in the next 10, or 20, or 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	If you are making financial projections based on an assumed rate  
of return from your investments, don't just plug in 10 percent or 
15 percent for stocks and let it go at that. Run the same exercise 
using 5 percent, and maybe even 0 percent or a minus number. 
</P>
<P>
	Can such a thing really happen? Unlikely as it may seem today,  
recall that after the Dow Jones industrial average reached 1,000 
for the first time in the booming 1960s, it spent 14 years 
struggling to rise past that point. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, whatever average annual return awaits you, consider that  
you will probably have to ride out some shocks along the way. 
People who bought stocks or stock funds for the long haul in late 
summer 1987 were making what turned out to be a very sound 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
	But before they could see any payoff, they had to ride out a  
drop of 30 percent to 40 percent in the October crash of that year.

<HEADLINE> Children's Broadcasting Changes Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Children's Broadcasting Corp. has become  
Intelefilm, reflecting the change in its core business from 
children's radio programming to production of television 
commercials. 
</P>
<P>
	``The name expresses our core business, 'intelligent television  
filmmaking,' while hinting at the coming digital age,'' said 
Christopher Dahl, president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Since selling its radio stations last year for $72.5 million,  
Dahl said the company has -- through acquisitions and startups -- 
become the largest U.S. company and only public company in the 
business of producing television commercials. 
</P>
<P>
	Intelefilm plans to continue acquiring production companies and  
related businesses, Dahl said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The company got involved in the television commercial business  
with the purchase of a 27 percent interest in Harmony Holdings 
Inc., a Los Angeles-based producer of television commercials. It 
now has a 52 percent controlling interest in Harmony. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies operating under the Intelefilm umbrella include The  
End and Chelsea Pictures, each with facilities in New York and Los 
Angeles; The End, London; Curious Pictures, with studios in New 
York and San Francisco, and Populux, New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Dahl also announced company plans to open a Minneapolis-based  
production office to help support local commercial production. 
</P>
<P>
	Children's Broadcasting formerly operated as Aahs World Radio, a  
syndicated radio network with broadcasts reaching about 40 percent 
of the nation. The stations owned by the company were sold last 
year and the programming was dropped as the company battled ABC 
Radio Networks Inc. and the Walt Disney Co. in court, accusing them 
of stealing ideas and starting a competing children's radio 
network. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury awarded CBC $20 million last September following a  
four-week trial in federal court in St. Paul, but in January U.S. 
District Judge Donald Alsop overturned the jury award. CBC's appeal 
of Alsop's ruling is pending.

<HEADLINE> W.Va. Mine Fire Still Burning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- Crews trying to put out a fire burning  
1,000 feet down in one of the nation's largest underground coal 
mines are turning to techniques usually used to battle oil and gas 
well blazes. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire was reported June 22 at Consolidation Coal's Loveridge  
mine in Fairview, about 60 miles south of Pittsburgh. A crew of 10 
was working underground at the time, but all exited safely. It has 
been idle since May, when most of the work force was laid off. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of bore holes being drilled by an oilfield service  
company will be used to pump in a special kind of concrete that is 
expected to stick to the mine walls. The hope is that the concrete 
will close all openings and starve the fire of oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're using all the techniques we know of, and we're trying to  
adapt some from other industries,'' said J. Davitt McAteer, 
assistant U.S. labor secretary for mine safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The mine has an estimated 15 miles of underground tunnels and  
contains highly volatile coal that produces large quantities of 
explosive methane gas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody has any idea how big this fire is or where it is  
exactly,'' Roger Powell, an inspector for the state Office of 
Miners' Health Safety and Training, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The mine has been operating since 1956. Based on 1997 production  
of 4.8 million tons of coal, it was the 14th-largest underground 
mine in the country.

<HEADLINE> Convicted Killer Captured In Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A killer who broke out of the state's  
most secure prison and fled nearly naked into the surrounding 
snake- and alligator-infested swamps was captured Tuesday, two days 
later, hiding in a tree. 
</P>
<P>
	Clifford Jones, 33, was wearing only boxer shorts and offered no  
resistance.	   Warden Rick Thaler said his only noticeable injuries were 
scratches and numerous insect bites. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, serving 26 years for murder, the attempted murder of a  
Dallas police officer and assaulting a guard, had been the object 
of an intensive manhunt since he fled Sunday from the Estelle 
Unit's high-security section, for the state's most troublesome and 
violent convicts. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent two days and two nights dodging some 300 law  
enforcement officers using tracking dogs, horses, boats and 
helicopters. He never made it off the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked pretty good,'' said Sgt. Alton Wyatt, one of the  
officers who caught Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was trying to survive nearly naked and shoeless in a  
heavily wooded and swampy area populated by alligators, wild pigs 
and every poisonous snake known to North America. 
</P>
<P>
	A guard on the perimeter of a search area about three miles from  
the prison spotted movement in a tree Tuesday afternoon and saw the 
inmate, prison spokesman Glen Castlebury said. The guard summoned 
help from another officer, and they ordered Jones to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	He complied, and was slapped in handcuffs, Castlebury said.  
</P>
<P>
	Once at the prison, Jones was charged with escape. Jones, whom  
officials described as belligerent, then was taken to prison near 
Wichita Falls. 
</P>
<P>
	A state helicopter with infrared gear had spotted the fugitive  
about 3 a.m. Tuesday but couldn't hover long because it was low on 
fuel. The sighting, however, focused the hunt for Jones.

<HEADLINE> Job Security Tops Boeing Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- Boeing Co. and its largest union began  
contract talks Tuesday confident they can reach agreement without 
another strike. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace  
Workers, which represents some 49,000 Boeing workers, has struck 
Boeing in the two of the last three negotiations: for 69 days in 
1996 and for 48 days in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both sides are being very positive. They have a few problems  
which I think they are both willing to negotiate and come to a 
mutual agreement,'' said Dave Richardson, an analyst at Aviation 
Data Service, a Wichita-based aviation research company. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last time, there was a lot of animosity on both sides,'' he  
said. ``The new management at Boeing is more approachable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing cannot afford to have another strike with today's  
competition from Airbus, Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiators presented a positive joint front at a news  
conference Tuesday at union headquarters in Wichita. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief union negotiator Dick Schneider said negotiators are  
farther ahead now than they have ever been since 1989 at the start 
of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing negotiator Jerry Calhoun agreed, telling reporters the  
company and union have been working on a positive relationship for 
the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``These negotiations really aren't just about contract language.  
They are about people -- real people, their lives and the families 
that go with those members and our employees,'' Calhoun said. ``And 
these negotiations have to be about people for us to succeed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Job security will be the biggest issue on the table in  
negotiations that began Tuesday with union officials handing their 
contract proposal to the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``Job security is primary. The company is in a downsizing mode  
at this current time,'' Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing plans to reduce its 231,000 work force companywide to  
about 205,000 workers by the end of this year. Employment was down 
this month to 214,200 workers, Boeing spokesman Peter Conte said 
Tuesday. By the end of the year 2000, Boeing plans to reduce its 
work force to between 185,000 and 195,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Schneider said the union aims to preserve existing jobs and, if  
possible, bring back work that Boeing has already subcontracted to 
outside workers. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said outsourcing work to cheaper labor outside the United  
States was not a major issue in the 1999 talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are doing so to compete in the global marketplace,''  
Schneider said. ``They have a tough competitor out there with 
Airbus. We in the union don't live in a vacuum. We recognize that 
terrible and serious problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now that the union has presented its proposal, preliminary  
negotiations are scheduled to start in Seattle between July 6 and 
Aug. 16, with collective bargaining to follow. 
</P>
<P>
	The current 44-month labor agreement expires Sept. 2. That  
contract covers 36,000 workers in the state of Washington, 11,500 
workers in Wichita and 1,800 workers in Portland, Ore.

<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Wayne Fontes said sideline collisions with  
some of his players, not an auto accident, triggered the back 
problems that prompted him to file a claim for disability benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Fontes, questioned on the second day of a trial on his claim,  
told lawyer Robert Humphrey of Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., denied 
that the real source of his injury was a February 1990 car accident 
in which a speeding car hit his vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Fontes said that his back and neck problems really began when  
players coming off the field in 1989 hit him. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hit on the sideline started my body deteriorating,''  
Fontes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fontes said he was hurt in 1989 and again on Nov. 12, 1995, when  
Detroit was at home against Tampa Bay. Two of his defensive players 
hit his shoulders and a third knocked him down as they ran onto the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	Fontes said he was in pain by the time he got home.  
</P>
<P>
	``The next day, it was worse,'' he said. ``I went to see the  
trainer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pain persisted despite physical therapy and treatment by a  
chiropractor and a neurologist. He began wearing a back brace. 
</P>
<P>
	Fontes, who was fired after the 1996 season, said he felt like  
his coaching ability deteriorated as his back pain persisted. 
</P>
<P>
	Fontes filed a claim for disability benefits last year, saying  
he has been unable to resume coaching. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like I wasn't doing the kind of job that I was paid to  
do,'' Fontes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fontes spent 11 years with the Lions, two as an assistant and  
nine as coach, taking over in 1988 when Darryl Rogers was fired. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to think I was an energetic coach. I like to think  
that's why I got this job. I ran around a lot,'' Fontes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The effects of the 1995 injury continued into the next season.  
</P>
<P>
	``I felt that I was losing touch with my players,'' he said. ``I  
don't think I was doing as good a job as I could. I delegated more 
authority to my assistant coaches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the regular Monday player injury meeting, his assistants  
jokingly listed him on the roster as ``inactive,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As a coach, Fontes said he liked to demonstrate moves to players  
and his assistants. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a hands-on type guy on the practice field and on game  
day,'' he said. ``It was my style.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fontes, 60, played for the New York Jets in 1963-64. He quit  
because of a broken leg.

<HEADLINE>  Candiotti Back With the Indians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Look who floated back into town with the  
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Knuckleballer Tom Candiotti, who played for some horrific  
Cleveland teams from 1986-91 before being traded, was signed to a 
major league contract for the remainder of the season on Tuesday by 
the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	The 41-year-old Candiotti, released by the Oakland Athletics on  
June 16 after posting a 3-5 record and 6.35 ERA, will initially be 
used out of the bullpen as the Indians' long reliever. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be able to come back here and pitch for this team is really  
like a dream come true,'' said Candiotti, who posted a 72-65 record 
in his first stint with the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	When Candiotti last pitched for the Indians, the club played in  
dilapidated Cleveland Stadium and in his five-plus years here, the 
team never won more than 86 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little different here than when I left,'' he said  
standing in the dugout before the game and looking out at beautiful 
Jacobs Field for the first time as a member of the home team. ``As 
bad as some of the teams were, I always loved this place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Indians scheduled to play a day-night doubleheader  
Saturday against Kansas City, the team had been considering adding 
a 13th pitcher to its staff for the last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Candiotti's addition gives the Indians a pitcher who can start,  
work in long relief and makes the opposition have to adjust after 
facing Cleveland's hard-throwing relievers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives you a bit of a different look, a change of pace,''  
said Indians manager Mike Hargrove, who indicated Candiotti could 
start one of Saturday's games. ``We brought Candy in here because 
he has been an effective major league pitcher and we think he's 
still has some gas in the tank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of Candiotti's best starts this season came at Cleveland on  
April 22. He allowed three hits over seven innings to get the win, 
but has struggled most of the year mainly because of a knee 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a few days after beating the Indians, Candiotti faced  
Cleveland in Oakland but was forced to leave in the first inning 
when he couldn't land on his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
	He is now taking anti-inflammatory medication and said the two  
weeks off since being released has helped his knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Candiotti had hoped for another chance to pitch for a contender,  
but never imagined it would be the Indians, who have the best 
record in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice,'' he said. ``I'm sure I'm not going out on a limb  
saying that this is probably the best team I've ever pitched for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Candiotti, 150-163 in 16 major league seasons, was traded by the  
Indians on June 27, 1991, with outfielder Turner Ward to Toronto 
for pitcher Denis Boucher, outfielders Glenallen Hill and Mark 
Whiten -- also back with the Indians -- and a player to be named. 
</P>
<P>
	He made 19 starts with the Blue Jays before leaving after the  
season as a free agent and signing with the Dodgers, who he stayed 
with until 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	All along the way, he always traveled with a large catcher's  
glove in his bag, designed specially for knuckleballers. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the first thing (catcher) Sandy Alomar said to me,''  
Candiotti said. ``'You have that big glove?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar, scheduled to come off the disabled list soon, caught  
Candiotti for two seasons and joked that when Candiotti was traded 
to Toronto, he was the happiest guy in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not coming off the DL,'' Alomar said. ``When he left the  
first time, I said, 'Candy, I love you. I loved having you on the 
team and I'm glad you're going to a contender. But I'd rather not 
catch you ever again.''

<HEADLINE> Man Killed by Ostrich at Farm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINLOCK, Wash. (AP) -- The owner of an exotic animal farm says  
she will not get rid of an ostrich just because it killed her 
father. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred W. Parker, an 81-year-old man with heart trouble, was found  
dead Sunday night in the pen of 400-pound King Tut. Parker suffered 
a fractured neck, and a coroner concluded his bad heart probably 
contributed to the death. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker's daughter said she did not understand why her father,  
who had been left alone over the weekend to feed the ostriches, 
emus, llamas and potbellied pigs on her exotic animal farm, was in 
the pen. 
</P>
<P>
	But she did not blame the ostrich.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have no intentions right now of destroying my ostrich  
because of my father's death,'' Linda Carter said. ``The ostrich 
was protecting his domain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just like any wild animal,'' she said. ``You don't go in  
a bear's pen; you don't go in an ostrich's pen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case has been referred to the prosecutor's office.  
</P>
<P>
	Chief Criminal Deputy Joe Doench said mating season for  
ostriches and males become very aggressive this time of year. Last 
year, King Tut kicked Carter 10 1/2 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter said she has been raising ostriches for more than two  
years and they have been profitable. Ostrich meat sells for $9 a 
pound, she said. Leather hides sell for $500 each and the eyes can 
be sold in Japan for $250 a head. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year, my business has just boomed,'' Carter said.

<HEADLINE> House Rejects Bill Suggesting Prayer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House rejected a resolution calling for a  
national day of prayer and fasting Tuesday, with some members 
saying Congress has no business telling Americans when to pray. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite calls for public repentance, reconciliation and moral  
uplift through prayer, Rep. Helen Chenoweth, R-Idaho, and 
supporters failed to win the two-thirds majority needed to pass the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
	A two-thirds majority is needed when legislation is considered  
under special rules designed to speed passage of non-controversial 
bills through the House. The bill failed on a vote of 275 for to 
140 against. 
</P>
<P>
	A Chenoweth spokesman said she plans to reintroduce the bill  
under regular rules, perhaps as early as Wednesday. ``We failed to 
garner a two-thirds vote, but we did make a strong statement with 
275 votes,'' said spokesman Kyle Key. ``This won't be the end of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chenoweth resolution was the latest in a string of  
religion-related measures debated in the House. Last week, the 
House voted to permit the posting of the Ten Commandments at 
schools and other state-run facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our nation is sick and hurting, and now is the time when all  
Americans of faith must come together and pray for healing and a 
spiritual renewal,'' Chenoweth said. ``If there ever is a time when 
we need almighty God, it is now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She cited several recent events, including the high school  
shooting in Littleton, Colo., in explaining the bill. She said it 
could lead to a turning away from violence and a healing of 
cultural division. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also urged leaders in national, state and local  
governments -- as well as in business -- to call on the people they 
serve to observe ``a day of solemn prayer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Texas, spoke the sharpest words in  
opposition, saying the measure was unconstitutional and morally 
wrong. Congress should not be meddling in people's religious life 
and should not use God to further their political agenda, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any effort by this Congress to inject a notion of ...  
necessary duty upon how, when and whether an American must pray is 
not only blatantly unconstitutional, it offends my deepest 
conviction that the sacredness of one's prayers and belief in God 
is that they are based on free will, not an imposed duty from 
government,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chenoweth accused Edwards of misunderstanding the bill, saying  
it simply recommends prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	The advocacy group Americans United for Separation of Church and  
State also spoke out against the Chenoweth bill Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, the House of Representatives is hopelessly  
adrift,'' said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, the group's executive 
director. ``Our nation faces serious problems, but all the House 
can offer are pious platitudes and meaningless resolutions.''

<HEADLINE> Man Charged With Killing 4 in Ky. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- A man accused of killing his parents and  
two neighbors was being held without bond while police tried to 
determine a motive behind the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Terry Todd Wedding, 27, shot and killed his mother;  
police officer Joey Vincent, also a pastor and Wedding's first 
cousin; and Vincent's wife. He used a baseball bat to bludgeon his 
father to death, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wedding pleaded innocent Monday to four counts of murder and one  
count of theft for allegedly taking $1,200 from his parents' home. 
A preliminary hearing was scheduled July 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Vincent, 29, and his 22-year-old pregnant wife, Amy,  
were killed early Sunday morning in the driveway of their home, 
which is adjacent to the home of Wedding and his parents. The 
Vincents' 3-year-old daughter was found inside unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Wedding killed his parents, Manville Todd Wedding,  
59, and Beverly W. Wedding, 56, late Saturday or early Sunday in an 
open field about a mile from the family home in Depoy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we're working on a motive,'' state police spokesman  
Bryan Pitney said. ``We're trying to nail down anything that may be 
more obvious to those in the community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Richard Morris said Vincent was one of two officers who  
recently used force when taking Wedding into custody for 
psychiatric treatment at a state hospital. Morris declined further 
comment. Pitney also declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	In downtown Greenville, a city of about 4,500 people, flags flew  
at half-staff and large blue ribbons hung in honor of the victims 
from the doors of all the businesses on Main Street, including the 
Harbin Memorial Library. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everyone's just in shock,'' said library employee  
Sandra Galyen. ``You hear something like that about such good 
people and you just don't believe it. You know deep down it's the 
truth but your mind just won't let you believe it.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes Medicare Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Older or disabled Americans would pay $24 a  
month if they want to take advantage of a new $2,000-a-year 
prescription drug benefit that is a centerpiece of President 
Clinton's long-awaited proposal to bolster Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't afford not to introduce prescription drug benefits  
into the Medicare program,'' Donna Shalala, the health and human 
services secretary, said today on ``CBS This Morning.'' ``Drugs are 
increasingly a critical part of health care in this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed drug benefit, Shalala said, ``will have a limit on  
how much the government will pay for, and it will be very carefully 
designed so it doesn't spin out of control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new benefit, which would cover 50 percent of prescription  
drug costs up to the $2,000 annual cap, would be available as an 
option for those 65 and older and the disabled beginning in 2002. 
The monthly premium would rise gradually to $44 and the cap to 
$5,000 by 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of that premium increase would account for inflation, the  
White House said, adding that the peak $44 fee is still one-half to 
one-third the typical cost of private drug coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare recipients already are paying a $45.50 monthly premium  
to cover doctor's office visits. 
</P>
<P>
	Beneficiaries with annual incomes below $11,000 per individual  
or $17,000 per couple would pay no premium for drug coverage, while 
other low-income Medicare recipients would get help paying the 
premium. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans immediately criticized the White House plan to  
provide drug benefits for all 39 million elderly and disabled 
Medicare beneficiaries as an excessive, big-government solution. 
Many favor more limited help for those who most need it. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, also appearing today on ``CBS This  
Morning,'' noted that two-thirds of those 65 and older already have 
some drug coverage -- through benefits offered by former employers, 
private insurance policies they purchase on their own, or HMOs that 
participate in Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't understand why we would want to drive those private  
programs out and substitute a government program for it,'' Gramm 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the administration released new predictions of  
federal government surpluses -- $1.1 trillion more than expected -- 
that Clinton said would make it easier to avert a cash shortage 
likely to face the health insurance program for the elderly and 
disabled in 2015. 
</P>
<P>
	The president proposed using $794 billion of those surpluses for  
Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	But administration officials say tough choices still had to be  
made in putting together the plan. Medicare beneficiaries who 
choose the drug benefits that Clinton will propose, for example, 
would have to pay new out-of-pocket fees. 
</P>
<P>
	``It asks people to pay a modest premium and some cost-sharing  
for a benefit that is far better than they'd get in the private 
sector,'' said top White House economic adviser Gene Sperling. 
</P>
<P>
	Other money for the drug benefit, he said, will come from  
changes in the way Medicare does business with health care 
providers -- for example, occasionally replacing complex government 
payment formulas with competitive bidding. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Republicans, who want to reserve some government  
surpluses for income tax cuts, have been skeptical about how 
Clinton will come up with money to add an expensive new benefit to 
the already cash-strapped Medicare program. 
</P>
<P>
	And it's unclear whether the president's plan can win the public  
and industry support he will need to get politically perilous 
Medicare changes through a Congress already nervous about the 2000 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Association of Retired Persons, the nation's  
largest organization of older adults, supports the concept of a new 
Medicare prescription drug benefit. But senior AARP lobbyist 
Patricia Smith said among outstanding concerns is how much Medicare 
clients will be asked to pay out of pocket. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will Medicare beneficiaries judge this to be affordable? I  
think the only way we're going to find out is through the political 
process,'' said Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, drug makers are worried about how the government will  
decide which drugs to cover at what prices. And other health care 
providers, including hospitals and HMOs, worry that Medicare money 
to pay for drugs will be squeezed from their own budgets even as 
they struggle to adjust to payment cuts Congress approved two years 
ago to help balance the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the main challenges the Clinton administration faced in  
trying to design a Medicare drug benefit was to make it fit 
Medicare's budget, while also making it a better deal for senior 
citizens than private supplemental insurance known as Medigap that 
many buy now. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug coverage accounts for about $90 a month of premiums charged  
for most Medigap policies, which generally cover 50 percent of 
prescription costs after a $250 deductible is reached. Annual caps 
on Medigap drug coverage vary up to a maximum of $3,000.

<HEADLINE>  Marv Albert Rehired by NBC Sports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Marv Albert was rehired by NBC today, less than  
two years after he was fired by the network following his guilty 
plea in a sex case. 
</P>
<P>
	Basketball's best play-by-play announcer signed a multiyear deal  
in which he will handle NBA coverage at NBC as well as Olympic 
boxing and hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC sports chairman Dick Ebersol said today that Albert will do  
play-by-play but will not be part of the network's top team. 
Ebersol did not say who will work with Albert. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just so happy to be back and to be part of the NBC  
situation. ... There will be plenty of national exposures and I'm 
very satisfied to come home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ebersol said one of the factors that sped the process was  
speculation that Albert was close to signing with Fox to do NFL 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realized I'd better act immediately or I wouldn't be able to  
do this for three or four years,'' Ebersol said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert began his national comeback this past season when he was  
hired by Turner Sports to work NBA games. 
</P>
<P>
	He will make his on-air return to NBC, where he worked for 20  
years, before the end of the year -- likely on a studio show or 
NBC's first NBA telecast on Christmas Day. He will also continue 
his Turner duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert will work about 15 regular-season games for NBC and the  
first four weekends of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert was fired by NBC in September 1997 after pleading guilty  
to biting a woman during a sexual encounter in a Virginia hotel 
room. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did what we felt we had to do at the time, but Marv has  
done what he had to do in the interim,'' Ebersol said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also resigned from Madison Square Garden network, but was  
brought back on board at MSG one year ago as the anchor of ``MSG 
Sports Desk'' and as the radio play-by-play voice for half of the 
New York Knicks games. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert's Turner debut came on TNT's broadcast of the Los Angeles  
Lakers game at Phoenix on April 2. He is scheduled to work a full 
slate of broadcasts next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert's last NBA national telecast for NBC was the NBA Finals  
in 1997.

	IMRALI ISLAND, Turkey (AP) -- A Turkish court sentenced Kurdish  
rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan to death today on charges of treason 
for leading a 15-year fight for Kurdish autonomy in southeast 
Turkey, the semi-official Anatolia news agency reported. The 
decision by the three-judge panel was widely expected. Asked to

clambered up Point 4700, the 15,500-foot peak known by its height 
in meters, and stormed the 13 guerrilla positions on the mountain 
three miles from the Line of Control, the 1972 cease-fire line

Pakistan. The Pakistan-based guerrillas retreated, but then 
launched a counterattack.

warning the violence could produce an ethnically pure Kosovo -- 
which NATO fought its air war to prevent. NATO is hoping the 
attacks against Kosovo's Serbs will subside now that ethnic 
Albanian rebels turned over their weapons to peacekeepers as part 
of the June 21 agreement by the Kosovo Liberation Army to 
demilitarize over 90 days. Under the deal, KLA fighters were to 
have put their weapons into NATO-guarded storage sites and they can

The question is whether Hubbell's answers will be any more useful 
than the first set he gave Starr in 1995 after pleading guilty to 
stealing $400,000 from his law firm and its clients. Hubbell will

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Rebels Give Up Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Members of the Kosovo rebel force  
gathered at NATO-designated assembly points today and began handing 
in weapons under a demilitarization deal with international 
peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition members, meanwhile, ignored police attempts to block  
a protest today to mount the first public rally against Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic since the end of the NATO air 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Velimir Ilic, Cacak's mayor, worked his way through an adoring  
crowd of 10,000 and onto the podium to loud cheers. 
</P>
<P>
	A small explosion near the platform briefly interrupted the  
rally 60 miles southwest of Belgrade, smashing the windshield of 
car and splitting its bumper. As jeers rose from the crowd, Ilic 
urged calm. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, Patriarch Pavle, Serbia's top religious leader, made  
a surprise visit to a seminary in the southern town of Prizren to 
persuade elderly Serbs holed up there to remain in the province 
despite continued looting and torching of Serb homes. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO hopes its control in the southern province will be  
strengthened by the handover of weapons by the Kosovo Liberation 
Army, part of a June 21 demilitarization agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, the ethnic Albanian fighters must put their  
weapons into NATO-guarded storage sites and carry them only in 
designated assembly areas. They are also to vacate their military 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
	By this morning, 3,735 KLA fighters had assembled, believed to  
be one-quarter of the total force, said Lt. Col. Louis Garneau, a 
spokesman for the NATO-led peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	He said 124 of them officially demobilized, but it appeared that  
an unspecified number of fighters took off their uniforms and left. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the KLA also collected 576 weapons, a small  
percentage of the total number believed to be in their hands. They 
have another 30 days to deliver the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The demilitarization measures are taking place at 40 designated  
arms collection points and 45 personnel assembly areas across 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you are beginning to see is the reintroduction of former  
UCK members into the mainstream of Kosovo's society,'' Garneau 
said, using the Albanian-language initials of the rebel army. 
</P>
<P>
	British Lt. Gen. Mike Jackson, commander of the peacekeeping  
force, and Agim Ceku, the KLA's chief of staff, were scheduled to 
meet later today to discuss the demilitarization process. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Wesley Clark, the supreme NATO commander in Europe, said  
KLA commanders were cooperating well. But the test, he said, would 
be whether individual soldiers honor the handover or pursue their 
own vendettas. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with Albanian state television, Ceku said the  
disarmament agreement ``is a sign that the Kosovo Liberation Army 
has become a decisive factor in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The KLA plans to transform itself into a political movement in  
advance of elections for a transitional government in the province 
following the end of the 78-day war and the return of some 860,000 
ethnic Albanians expelled since NATO bombings began March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb clerics were appealing to Western leaders to curb repirsal  
attacks by ethnic Albanians against Kosovo Serbs, warning the 
violence could produce an ethnically pure Kosovo -- which NATO 
fought its air war to prevent. 
</P>
<P>
	But church leaders were also urging Serbs to remain in the  
province. 
</P>
<P>
	During his visit to Prizren, Patriarch Pavle reiterated the  
church's call on Milosevic to step down. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made a strong appeal to him (Milosevic) to leave power  
in the best interest of his people and that a government for 
national salvation be formed,'' Pavle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about damage done to monasteries and churches in Kosovo,  
Pavle, apparently referring to Serb victims of ethnic Albanian 
revenge killings, said, ``I feel the same way a family father feels 
when his children are killed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the seminary, people were asking for the patriarch's advice  
what to do, and he replied: ``Don't leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pavle traveled in a convoy of cars heavily guarded by Norwegian  
soldiers. One of them was sitting in Pavle's car for extra 
protection. Despite the passed deadline to take off uniforms, a KLA 
military policeman stood guard near the seminary. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO is hoping that the attacks against Serbs will subside now  
that ethnic Albanian rebels have turned over their weapons to 
peacekeepers as part of the agreement by the KLA to demilitarize 
over 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
	German peacekeepers, meanwhile, imposed a 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.  
curfew on Kosovo's second-largest city, Prizren. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was aimed at clamping down on arson attacks on Serb and  
Gypsy property by ethnic Albanians seeking revenge for the horrors 
of the Serb crackdown, which ended when Milosevic accepted an 
international peace agreement on June 12. 
</P>
<P>
	In an attempt to restore a semblance of order, U.N. envoy Sergio  
Vieira de Mello named a judicial panel of four local and three 
international officials to appoint judges to deal with about 200 
people arrested in Kosovo since the peacekeepers' arrival this 
month.

<HEADLINE>  CART Race in Cleveland Goes to IRL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- A fight over money has driven CART off the  
track in Cleveland. The IRL is taking its place. 
</P>
<P>
	Championship Auto Racing Teams said Tuesday it has dropped the  
Cleveland Grand Prix from its 2000 schedule, even as race 
organizers said their preference was to go with the upstart, less 
expensive Indy Racing League. 
</P>
<P>
	Bud Stanner, president of IMG Motorsports, which had directed  
the Medic Drug-sponsored Cleveland GP since 1993, said a three-year 
agreement will bring IRL drivers to a 1.2-mile flat oval at Burke 
Lakefront Airport, with the first race on July 9, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland will become a stop on the IRL's 12-race circuit.  
</P>
<P>
	``We received a letter in May from CART stating its board  
decided not to renew our sanction,'' Stanner said. But he said IMG 
Motorsports is happy to switch to the IRL. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most importantly, their economic philosophy will allow us to  
offer even more affordable ticket prices and sponsorship pricing,'' 
Stanner said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said IMG Motorsports opened negotiations with CART in July  
1997 about continuing the race beyond 2000. But he said CART's fee 
jumped from $1.6 million to more than $2 million, which Stanner 
said was ``way beyond reason for any good business decision to be 
made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stanner said the final offer from CART was $1.9 million for a  
2000 race in Cleveland. He said terms of the IRL deal that closed 
Friday will not be disclosed under a confidentiality agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Craig, CART chairman and chief executive officer, said  
CART has signed a three-year extension agreement with the Mid-Ohio 
Sports Car Course in Lexington, about 60 miles north of Columbus, 
through 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	CART had raced at the temporary course in Cleveland since 1982.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was CART's desire to continue racing at Cleveland, and it  
is unfortunate we could not come to an agreement,'' Craig said. 
``The race fans in Cleveland are among the best on our schedule and 
we look forward to having them join us at Mid-Ohio.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The final CART-sanctioned Cleveland GP was run in the rain  
Sunday on the bumpy 2.1-mile, 10-turn course on the downtown 
airport's runways and taxiways. 
</P>
<P>
	IRL team owner A.J. Foyt, a four-time Indy 500 champion, said  
the airport's flat surface isn't much of a concern. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've run a lot of flat ovals over the years. I'm quite sure  
they'll adapt to it pretty quick. When we get here we'll set the 
cars up like we do when we go to Milwaukee. I don't see a 
problem,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The city of Cleveland also announced a separate five-year deal  
with IMG Motorsports on Tuesday to put together a race each summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Michael R. White said he is aware of racing fans' concerns  
that the 4-year-old IRL might not have of the same quality of 
competition as CART. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly IMG and IRL are going to have to show professionally  
that they can provide the fans in this region a quality package 
with quality drivers and a quality experience,'' White said. 
</P>
<P>
	White said the city's pact with IMG Motorsports ``demonstrates  
our show of affirmation for this style of racing in Cleveland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now that a deal has been struck between IMG Motorsports and the  
IRL, White said the city can move ahead with asking the Federal 
Aviation Administration for permission to use the airport for 
racing. 
</P>
<P>
	Indianapolis Motor Speedway president Tony George, who heads the  
IRL, said Cleveland will be an important IRL addition. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've tried to add races in key markets around the country,  
and certainly Cleveland is a great racing city,'' George said. 
``There are a lot of open-wheel fans in the state of Ohio, and we 
plan on building from the base that's been laid.''

<HEADLINE> Krause Eyed as NBA Draft Nears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- This NBA draft isn't about Elton Brand's true  
height, Steve Francis' vertical leap, Wally Szczerbiak's jumper or 
Lamar Odom's risk factor. 
</P>
<P>
	It's about Jerry Krause's secret plan to rebuild his dynasty.  
</P>
<P>
	As the clock ticked toward the moment Wednesday night when  
commissioner David Stern will walk to the podium, the general 
manager of the Chicago Bulls had everyone wondering whether he'd 
trade the No. 1 overall pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nerve-racking,'' Francis said. ``It's the last day, and  
you hear so many rumors and so much that's going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just when it seemed the field had been narrowed to Francis or  
Brand as the top overall pick, Odom showed up Tuesday and said it 
was his gut feeling he'd be picked No. 1 by Chicago. Szczerbiak and 
UCLA guard Baron Davis are expected to round out the top five. 
</P>
<P>
	Around the league, the talk was that the Miami Heat were trying  
to move up to get Odom, while the Los Angeles Lakers and Houston 
Rockets were discussing a trade that would send Scottie Pippen to 
Los Angeles for Glen Rice and Robert Horry. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta and Golden State made a deal, the Hawks sending Mookie  
Blaylock and the No. 21 pick to the Warriors for Bimbo Coles, Duane 
Ferrell and the 10th overall pick. 
</P>
<P>
	The order of selection at the top of the draft -- the first five  
being Chicago, Vancouver, Charlotte, the Los Angeles Clippers and 
Toronto -- figured to change in some way by time the draft begins. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a mystery to me, just like every other player is really  
wondering where they're going,'' Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Krause has been talking to numerous teams to explore dozens of  
trade options, and many people around the league expected him to 
deal the No. 1 pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``He holds the key,'' NBA scouting director Marty Blake said.  
``But he's not going to give any hints as to what he's going to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For weeks, the widespread belief was that the secretive Krause  
had his eyes on Szczerbiak, the smooth shooting forward from Miami 
of Ohio. The one rumor that kept popping up had Krause trading the 
No. 1 pick to Toronto, with the Raptors giving up the fifth pick 
and Tracy McGrady. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a very good possibility that we will not make any  
decision on the draft choice until Wednesday afternoon,'' said 
Krause, who is trying to rebuild the Bulls following the breakup of 
the team that won three straight titles from 1996-98. ``We don't 
feel there's an advantage to us to making it sooner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said coach Tim Floyd: ``If somebody knocks Jerry out with a  
trade, then I'm sure we'll have to look at it and go that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such statements were the reason why all the top players had a  
greater air of uncertainty about them than usual on the day before 
the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the comments were downright bold: Brand sounding eager  
to play for Vancouver; Szczerbiak saying he would ``love'' to play 
for the Clippers; Odom saying he had spoken to Krause several 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chicago's in more of a rebuilding stage,'' said Brand, the  
college player of the year, ``They don't have superstar-level 
talent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vancouver has Mike Bibby at the point, Felipe Lopez had a  
stellar year, I think surprised some people. Then you've got 
Shareef Abdur-Rahim and Big Country (Bryant Reeves) down low. I 
think I could fit in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, who left Duke after his sophomore season, is a 6-foot-8  
forward who played center in college and averaged 17.7 points and 
9.8 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis, a 6-3 guard, averaged 17.0 points for Maryland and  
skipped his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, a 6-2 point guard from UCLA, figures to be chosen no  
lower than fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Szczerbiak, a 6-7 forward, should be chosen no lower than fifth.  
</P>
<P>
	Aside from Krause's maneuverings, another big draft uncertainty  
was Odom. 
</P>
<P>
	A 6-10 phenom from Rhode Island who could play three positions  
in the pros, Odom may have hurt his stock by declaring for the 
draft, then trying to pull out. He then missed several workouts 
scheduled by NBA teams. 
</P>
<P>
	He was not on time for Tuesday's media availability session held  
by the NBA. On Monday, he worked out in Providence for the Bulls, 
Raptors, Clippers and Timberwolves. Odom also held an earlier 
workout in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lamar is a great kid. I don't understand what's going on. No  
one does,'' Szczerbiak said. ``He's probably going through a real 
tough time. He's probably very indecisive, probably has a lot of 
people pulling him in all kinds of different directions and he's 
probably like a rubber band about to snap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rounding out the top 10 draft slots are Minnesota, Washington,  
Cleveland, Phoenix and Atlanta, which will likely be choosing among 
Jonathan Bender of Picayune High School in Mississippi, guards 
Jason Terry of Arizona, Richard Hamilton of Connecticut, Andre 
Miller of Utah and William Avery of Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	Lottery teams Cleveland, Toronto and Seattle will choose 11th,  
12th and 13th, and the rest of the first round includes four picks 
for Atlanta (Nos. 10, 17, 20 and 27) and three for Utah (19, 24 and 
28). 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen a draft where more people in the late first  
round were willing to deal their first-round picks,'' Wizards 
general manager Wes Unseld said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's just feeling each other out, throwing a lot of  
stuff against the wall, trying to see what sticks. For me, it's as 
thick as I've seen it. I'm not getting a straight answer from 
anyone. Maybe because nobody has any.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to the Rockets, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, confirmed to The Associated Press that the Lakers had 
approached Houston on Tuesday with the offer of Rice and Horry, a 
trade that would reunite Pippen with coach Phil Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen struggled in his first season with the Rockets and their  
stagnant offense, and Rice never really fit in with the Lakers 
after being acquired at midseason for Eddie Jones and Elden 
Campbell. The trade would seem to be a fit for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's up to Houston whether to do it or not,'' the source said.  
</P>
<P>
	Chicago (Nos. 1 and 16), Toronto (5 and 12), Cleveland (8 and  
11) and Minnesota (6 and 14) have two picks apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas, New Jersey, Sacramento, Milwaukee, Philadelphia,  
Detroit, Orlando and Portland have no first-round picks. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery worked out last week for the New York Knicks, who choose  
15th. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said they were thinking about trading up and doing some  
things, but a lot of teams are,'' Avery said. ``That's why tomorrow 
night's going to be an interesting night.''

<HEADLINE> Voters Pick Prison in Vermont </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Vt. (AP) -- Voters on Tuesday narrowly approved a  
prison project that some astronomers say will pollute the sky with 
light and spoil the view of the heavens from an 80-year-old 
observatory. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure was approved 1,633 to 1,564, a margin of only 69  
votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters said the town, which is in southeastern Vermont on  
the New Hampshire line and has a population of about 10,000, needs 
the help and the 160 jobs the prison would bring. 
</P>
<P>
	But stargazers were upset.  
</P>
<P>
	The observatory is a national landmark known as Stellafane --  
Latin for ``Shrine to the Stars.'' It is the site of a conference 
that attracts more than 2,000 amateur astronomers every summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the mother of observatories for amateur telescoping,''  
said Maryann Arrien, president of Springfield Telescope Makers, 
which maintains the hilltop observatory three miles from the 
proposed 350-bed state prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Arrien's group collected 700 signatures on a petition  
against the prison. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials said the prison lights would not ruin star  
viewing and noted there are small towns that are closer to the 
observatory than the prison would be. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Arrien said she fears the prison's lights would have a much  
greater effect because they would stay on all night, while lights 
from the towns usually go off. 
</P>
<P>
	She wept Tuesday night after hearing the results of the vote.  
</P>
<P>
	``It feels like a death to me,'' Arrien said. ``I feel like  
something is about to be destroyed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Howard Dean said he didn't know enough about the lighting  
of the proposed prison to comment on Stellafane's concerns. He 
welcomed the outcome of the vote, though he said he wished it 
hadn't been so close. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to be enormously positive for the town,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the opponents, Dean said: ``I think it'll turn out that  
their fears are unfounded.''

<HEADLINE> GOP, Democrats Agree On Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans and the Clinton administration  
found themselves on the same side of a dispute over a national 
ballistic-missile defense today, with GOP leaders welcoming belated 
administration support for a long-standing GOP priority. 
</P>
<P>
	``We usher in a new era of American security,'' House Speaker  
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said at a Capitol-steps rally held to 
showcase a bill to commit the United States to deployment of such a 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Democrats once belittled the project, begun by  
President Reagan in the early 1980s, as ``Star Wars,'' Clinton and 
most congressional Democrats did an about-face earlier this year -- 
partly in response to revised estimates of nuclear missile 
capability, particularly on the part of North Korea and Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert and other Republican leaders stood alongside a huge map  
suggesting that a North Korean ballistic missile, similar to one 
tested last year, could nearly reach Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might be aimed at Chicago and hit St. Louis, but surely  
they have that capability,'' said Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., long an 
outspoken supporter of a national missile defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert likened the legislation to President Kennedy's 1960  
pledge to put Americans on the moon. And Senate Majority Leader 
Trent Lott, R-Miss., suggested the measure was one of the most 
significant bills to pass Congress in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott called the current lack of a defense against incoming  
ballistic missiles ``our Achilles' heel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation commits the United States to deployment of a  
missile defense against limited ballistic missile attack once it is 
technologically possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who vetoed similar legislation in the past, said he  
would sign it. However, congressional leaders delayed sending it to 
him until after the conflict in Kosovo died down. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally on the Capitol steps, under a broiling midday sun,  
came a day after the administration's top arms-control official 
said the escalating long-range missile capability of North Korea 
and Iran were partly responsible for a change in the 
administration's attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cold war disciplines are gone. Technology is more widely  
available,'' John Holum, acting undersecretary of state for arms 
control and international security affairs, told a Senate 
confirmation hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Congress passed that bill in May, two developments have  
occurred on the missile-defense front: 
</P>
<P>
	--Russian President Boris Yeltsin agreed, for the first time, to  
consider reopening the landmark 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty 
to consider easing that prohibition against either American or 
Russian nationwide ballistic missile defense systems. 
</P>
<P>
	--After six straight failures, a $3.8 billion experimental  
missile defense system scored its first hit in a test at the White 
Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, shooting down an incoming test 
rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	Holum, in testimony Monday before the Senate Foreign Relations  
Committee, voiced strong support for deploying a missile defense 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a 1998 report by a panel headed by former Defense  
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld had ``a profound impact'' on Clinton 
administration policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rumsfeld panel concluded that North Korea and Iran could  
develop long-range missiles within five years and probably are 
secretly doing so. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if a missile defense is outlawed by the 1972 ABM treaty,  
national interest dictates that the United States move ahead in 
planning for such a system anyway, Holum said, echoing views of 
Republican members of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat of a nuclear attack by a small power ``is clearly  
very prominent'' as an area of concern, far more so than just a few 
years ago, Holum said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In light of new estimates on the ballistic missile threat, in  
particular from North Korea and Iran, national missile defense is 
now closer to becoming another integral part of our strategy 
against proliferation,'' Holum testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Holum appeared at a nomination hearing to be the first person to  
serve in the new post. He had served since 1993 as director of the 
Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, but the agency went out of 
business on April 1 when its functions were merged with the State 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel was expected to approve the nomination, perhaps as  
early as Wednesday, when it also votes on the nomination of Richard 
Holbrooke to be U.N. ambassador.

<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The Great One is having another little one.  
</P>
<P>
	Wayne Gretzky and wife Janet are expecting their fourth child  
early next year, Gretzky's agent confirmed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky reportedly made the announcement at an annual fund

	``He's very excited with the thought of another baby,'' agent  
Michael Barnett said from California. 
</P>
<P>
	The newest Gretzky will be the fourth child for the famous  
couple. Paulina, 11, Ty, 8, and Trevor, 6, were all in the 
spotlight earlier this year when their dad announced his retirement 
from the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the age of the three present children,'' Barnett said,  
``it will be interesting to watch them welcome the new arrival.''

<HEADLINE> 2 Cuban Ballplayers Now Free Agents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The agent for two Cuban players signed by the  
Los Angeles Dodgers claims they were deceived by the team and 
denied a chance to sign with other major league clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	The baseball commissioner's office granted the two minor  
leaguers, Juan Carlos Diaz and Josue Perez, free agency late last 
week. The Dodgers also were fined an undisclosed amount for 
violating major league rules against scouting in Cuba or arranging 
defections. 
</P>
<P>
	A baseball official who asked to remain anonymous said Tuesday  
the fine was ``six figures,'' so at least $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before they left Cuba, the Dodgers promised them that there  
was going to be help to bring their families out and that they 
would get the chance to sign fairly once they got to the 
Dominican,'' agent Gus Dominguez said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``But once they had them signed and in the Dominican, it wasn't  
the same treatment that they received before. Everybody in the 
Dodgers' organization was aware that this was happening. I guess 
the Dodgers feel they're above baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dominguez claimed that, once the players came forth with their  
story, the Dodgers tried to have their visas terminated and told 
them they had to leave the country. He said they are being allowed 
to stay pending a decision by the immigration service on their 
application for visitors' status. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers released a statement saying they would abide by the  
decision made by the commissioner's office. They would not comment 
further. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear whether the Dodgers also violated a U.S. trade  
embargo against U.S. companies conducting business in Cuba. No 
government agency has been in contact with the two players or their 
representatives since they were declared free agents last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba is considered a deep, largely untapped pool of baseball  
talent, but there has been a steady trickle of players defecting to 
the United States, a total of about 30 over the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those in the majors are the New York Yankees' Orlando  
Hernandez, who made a daring escape on a small boat from his 
homeland in 1997; his brother, Livan Hernandez, who had sneaked on 
a flight out of Mexico two years earlier and became the World 
Series MVP for the Florida Marlins; Rey Ordonez of the New York 
Mets; and Rolando Arrojo of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. 
</P>
<P>
	Diaz, a 24-year-old first baseman who was hitting .303 with the  
Dodgers' Double-A team in Vero Beach, had signed for $65,000 in 
1996. Perez, a 21-year-old outfielder who was hitting .279 for the 
Dodgers' Class-A team in Vero Beach, signed for $40,000 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Both contracts were far below the going rate for promising young  
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am grateful to the Dodgers for helping us get out of Cuba,  
but at the same time, there are mixed feelings because we were lied 
to and told to lie to everybody else,'' said Diaz, with Dominguez 
interpreting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were never given a chance to be seen by other teams, the  
way other Cuban players were, and were never given a fair chance to 
sign with any other team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dominguez, who was not representing the two players when they  
signed with the Dodgers, was asked why they waited until recently 
to reveal their allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you live under a regime where something illegal is going  
on every day, you welcome any help that you can get to get out of 
there -- whether it be illegal or not,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``At that time, the only thing they knew was illegal about it  
was getting out of Cuba. They had no idea what the process in 
signing them was until last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dodgers scout Pablo Peguero reportedly visited Cuba and helped  
the two obtain visas to go to the Dominican Republic, where they 
joined the Dodgers' academy. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez, also with Dominguez interpreting, said he felt grateful  
to the Dodgers, but added, ``Just because you have to be grateful 
to somebody one day, it doesn't mean that you have to be a slave 
for the rest of your life to that person.''

<HEADLINE> Wells Fargo Cutting Norwest Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. will cut 1,000 teller jobs  
at its Norwest Bank branches as part of the newly merged bank's 
plan to reduce its workforce. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the jobs will be eliminated through attrition, said  
Wells spokesman Larry Haeg. Between 30 and 40 percent of tellers 
turn over each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells Fargo uses sophisticated staffing models to determine its  
workforce needs in its banks. Norwest did not use such advanced 
models, which sometimes led to overstaffing, said analyst Jay 
Tejera of Ragen MacKenzie in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	The cutback in teller positions is part of San Francisco-based  
Wells Fargo's effort to eliminate about 4,600 jobs since its merger 
with Minneapolis-based Norwest. 
</P>
<P>
	The $32 billion merger was approved in November, creating the  
nation's seventh largest bank with 92,000 employees.

<HEADLINE> CART Race in Cleveland Goes to IRL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- A fight over money has driven CART off the  
track in Cleveland. The IRL is taking its place. 
</P>
<P>
	Championship Auto Racing Teams said Tuesday it has dropped the  
Cleveland Grand Prix from its 2000 schedule, even as race 
organizers said their preference was to go with the upstart, less 
expensive Indy Racing League. 
</P>
<P>
	Bud Stanner, president of IMG Motorsports, which had directed  
the Medic Drug-sponsored Cleveland GP since 1993, said a three-year 
agreement will bring IRL drivers to a 1.2-mile flat oval at Burke 
Lakefront Airport, with the first race on July 9, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland will become a stop on the IRL's 12-race circuit.  
</P>
<P>
	``We received a letter in May from CART stating its board  
decided not to renew our sanction,'' Stanner said. But he said IMG 
Motorsports is happy to switch to the IRL. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most importantly, their economic philosophy will allow us to  
offer even more affordable ticket prices and sponsorship pricing,'' 
Stanner said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said IMG Motorsports opened negotiations with CART in July  
1997 about continuing the race beyond 2000. But he said CART's fee 
jumped from $1.6 million to more than $2 million, which Stanner 
said was ``way beyond reason for any good business decision to be 
made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stanner said the final offer from CART was $1.9 million for a  
2000 race in Cleveland. He said terms of the IRL deal that closed 
Friday will not be disclosed under a confidentiality agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Craig, CART chairman and chief executive officer, said  
CART has signed a three-year extension agreement with the Mid-Ohio 
Sports Car Course in Lexington, about 60 miles north of Columbus, 
through 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	CART had raced at the temporary course in Cleveland since 1982.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was CART's desire to continue racing at Cleveland, and it  
is unfortunate we could not come to an agreement,'' Craig said. 
``The race fans in Cleveland are among the best on our schedule and 
we look forward to having them join us at Mid-Ohio.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The final CART-sanctioned Cleveland GP was run in the rain  
Sunday on the bumpy 2.1-mile, 10-turn course on the downtown 
airport's runways and taxiways. 
</P>
<P>
	IRL team owner A.J. Foyt, a four-time Indy 500 champion, said  
the airport's flat surface isn't much of a concern. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've run a lot of flat ovals over the years. I'm quite sure  
they'll adapt to it pretty quick. When we get here we'll set the 
cars up like we do when we go to Milwaukee. I don't see a 
problem,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The city of Cleveland also announced a separate five-year deal  
with IMG Motorsports on Tuesday to put together a race each summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Michael R. White said he is aware of racing fans' concerns  
that the 4-year-old IRL might not have of the same quality of 
competition as CART. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly IMG and IRL are going to have to show professionally  
that they can provide the fans in this region a quality package 
with quality drivers and a quality experience,'' White said. 
</P>
<P>
	White said the city's pact with IMG Motorsports ``demonstrates  
our show of affirmation for this style of racing in Cleveland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now that a deal has been struck between IMG Motorsports and the  
IRL, White said the city can move ahead with asking the Federal 
Aviation Administration for permission to use the airport for 
racing. 
</P>
<P>
	Indianapolis Motor Speedway president Tony George, who heads the  
IRL, said Cleveland will be an important IRL addition. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've tried to add races in key markets around the country,  
and certainly Cleveland is a great racing city,'' George said. 
``There are a lot of open-wheel fans in the state of Ohio, and we 
plan on building from the base that's been laid.''

<HEADLINE> Elizabeth Dole Urges Web Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELLEVUE, Wash. (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole didn't ask Bill Gates to  
whip out his checkbook, but she did enlist the software mogul's 
help in shielding school children from X-rated fare on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole brought her presidential campaign to Washington's  
high-tech corridor Monday, pledging her help in expanding the 
industry and urging the techies and Congress to help parents shield 
their kids from cyberporn. 
</P>
<P>
	She met for an hour with the billionaire  
businessman-philanthropist who heads Microsoft Corp., emerging to 
give him kudos for developing a pornography filter for computers. 
She wants a similar device on every library and school computer 
terminal. 
</P>
<P>
	She called on Congress to withhold some federal dollars from  
schools and libraries that fail to install such screens. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole added a ``family values'' spin to her budding  
campaign, discussing the porn-in-cyberspace issue, gun control and 
efforts to combat cynicism among voters and nastiness among 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole, former American Red Cross director and Cabinet  
secretary in the Reagan and Bush administrations, said she's not 
intimidated by the juggernaut of the early Republican front-runner 
for the White House nomination, Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush makes his initial foray into Washington state next week,  
with events planned in Spokane and Seattle on July 8. 
</P>
<P>
	``No. No. This is early!'' Mrs. Dole said when asked about the  
conventional wisdom that Bush appears to have a lock on the GOP 
nomination. ``I stay focused and I'm not distracted (by such 
reports). ... 
</P>
<P>
	``Stay tuned. We're going to win this. We are going strong. In  
all the polls I've seen, I've been running a very strong second to 
George Bush.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same pundits who have anointed Bush also called his father,  
former President George Bush, a sure bet for re-election in the 
days after the Gulf War and said President Clinton definitely would 
have to resign after the Monica Lewinsky scandal, she said. Neither 
prediction came true. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole raised $50,000 at a private fund-raising breakfast in  
Seattle. Her speech wowed the audience, said GOP consultant Brett 
Bader, who hasn't taken sides in the Republican primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Later she traveled to Microsoft headquarters in nearby Redmond.  
She said she complimented Gates for developing software to screen 
X-rated material from children's computers, as other companies also 
have done. They also discussed the future of the information age 
and technology, her proposal to make research and development tax 
credits permanent, and pending legislation to provide limited Y2K 
immunity for some entities, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Flanked by young mothers and children at the Bellevue library,  
Mrs. Dole proposed broadening federal legislation on Internet 
pornography screening. She said she sent letters to House and 
Senate Republican leaders asking them to extend the screening 
requirement to all computers in public schools and libraries, not 
just those computers designated for kids.

<HEADLINE> Idaho Congresswoman To Marry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- U.S. Rep. Helen Chenoweth, a staunch  
opponent of federal control of land and resources in the West, is 
planning to marry a leader of the Sagebrush Rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
	No date was set for a wedding with Wayne Hage of Tonopah, Nev.  
</P>
<P>
	``Helen's really excited, being engaged,'' campaign spokesman  
Graham Paterson said late Monday. ``It's for certain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chenoweth, 61, has earned a national reputation for her ardent  
stance against federal control of land and has been an eminent 
spokeswoman for the Sagebrush Rebellion and its supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Hage, 62, of Tonopah, the philosophical leader of the Sagebrush  
Rebellion, maintains that state and federal laws dating back to 
1866 gave ranchers control over land in the West long before the 
national forests were created and federal grazing laws were passed. 
</P>
<P>
	Hage sued the U.S. Forest Service in 1991 after rangers  
confiscated and sold 108 head of his cattle. He had been charged 
with repeated grazing law violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Chenoweth, who campaigned on family values and first won office  
after the disclosure of an opponent's illicit affair, admitted in 
1998 that she had a six-year affair with a married man in the 
1980s, after her divorce from her first husband. 
</P>
<P>
	She said that at the time she was a private citizen and single,  
a situation markedly different from that of President Clinton, 
whose resignation she sought over the Monica Lewinsky affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Chenoweth and her first husband, Nick Chenoweth, had a son and a  
daughter.

<HEADLINE> Wall St. Challenge: Complacency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the midst of a mighty bull market, one of the  
biggest challenges facing any mutual-fund investor is to resist 
complacency. 
</P>
<P>
	There are plenty of prudent commentators around who keep warning  
against the dangers of an everything-is-fine-and-always-will-be 
mentality as you decide where to put your savings. 
</P>
<P>
	Your ears hear these admonitions. But cautionary words can't  
make much of a lasting impression when they diverge so drastically 
from the experience people have been having for so long. 
</P>
<P>
	At the halfway point of 1999, most stock funds are on track to  
post their fifth consecutive year of two-digit gains. Over the past 
15 years, according to calculations by Lipper Inc., the average 
stock fund has climbed at a rate of 15 percent a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as you tell yourself that this kind of thing can't continue  
forever, a rising market takes on the appearance of normal routine. 
Ah well, you may conjecture, maybe the bull market will slow down 
and everybody will have to ``settle'' for 8 percent or 10 percent 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't begin to cover all the possible outcomes. No matter  
what the past record and the present picture look like, and no 
matter what some expert or computer model predicts, the future for 
investments like stocks is always uncertain and unpredictable. 
</P>
<P>
	For a glimpse of the complacency that threatens every investor,  
take a look at the results of a survey of 700 investors nearing or 
just starting retirement, which was commissioned by the Forum For 
Investor Advice, an association of fund groups sold primarily 
through brokers. 
</P>
<P>
	Only about one in 10 of the respondents said they were very  
worried about outliving their assets, a sharp decline in the stock 
market, a major increase in inflation, or trouble affording the 
cost of a good nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that only 11 percent of recent retirees that we  
surveyed are seriously concerned about outliving their financial 
resources, and only 8 percent are concerned about a bear market in 
stocks, is really very surprising,'' said Barbara Levin, the 
organization's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can only assume that, despite the numerous warnings about  
the cost of a comfortable retirement, the unprecedented bull market 
in stocks and the excellent economy we have been experiencing has 
lulled them into a false sense of security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The point of all this is not to spread gloom, but to encourage  
looking at things realistically. There is every reason to hope that 
prosperity will continue to flourish on both Wall Street and Main 
Street for a long time to come. 
</P>
<P>
	But to plan well for your future, it makes sense to consider  
other what-ifs. In your study of a mutual fund, let's suppose you 
are looking at a graph that shows how much a hypothetical $10,000 
investment in 1970 would have grown to today. 
</P>
<P>
	This illustration, known in the industry as a ``mountain''  
chart, may look very impressive, and serve as a kind of 
advertisement for the idea of long-term investing. But it is of 
only limited value in planning for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	You can't buy a single dollar of that past performance. It has  
come and gone forever. You certainly don't want to base the 
planning for your financial future on the assumption that the exact 
same results will accrue in the next 10, or 20, or 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	If you are making financial projections based on an assumed rate  
of return from your investments, don't just plug in 10 percent or 
15 percent for stocks and let it go at that. Run the same exercise 
using 5 percent, and maybe even 0 percent or a minus number. 
</P>
<P>
	Can such a thing really happen? Unlikely as it may seem today,  
recall that after the Dow Jones industrial average reached 1,000 
for the first time in the booming 1960s, it spent 14 years 
struggling to rise past that point. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, whatever average annual return awaits you, consider that  
you will probably have to ride out some shocks along the way. 
People who bought stocks or stock funds for the long haul in late 
summer 1987 were making what turned out to be a very sound 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
	But before they could see any payoff, they had to ride out a  
drop of 30 percent to 40 percent in the October crash of that year.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft, Intel Target Big Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Leaders of Microsoft Corp. and Intel  
Corp. are getting the word out that computers using their 
technology are ready to perform the heavy-duty chores demanded by 
big business. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint announcement from the biggest personal computer  
software company and biggest chipmaker is expected Wednesday. It is 
designed to respond to challenges to their dominance by the upstart 
Linux operating system, and delays in the release of Microsoft's 
Windows 2000 business software and Intel's newest Merced chip for 
business computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now there are some big competitors,'' said Matt Sargent,  
a senior analyst at ZD Infobeads in La Jolla, Calif. ``These 
companies are saying, 'We're still here, and we're pouring 
resources into this business area.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	At the annual Workstation Leadership Forum in Burlingame,  
Calif., Microsoft chief executive Bill Gates and Intel CEO Craig 
Barrett are scheduled to speak together Wednesday morning, 
outlining their joint commitment to leadership and innovation in 
the global workstation market. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll also be unveiling some of they ways their team work --  
Microsoft's software and Intel's chips -- are helping businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Robert Mondavi Winery is using their systems to  
make digital maps and analyze data about where in their orchards to 
plant what types of vines. And Sony Pictures Imageworks is using 
the combined technologies for their new digitally animated movie 
``Stuart Little,'' based on the classic E.B. White book. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint announcement comes at a time when both companies are  
struggling to get products out. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel's Merced chip is now promised for mid-2000, along with  
Microsoft's Windows 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Erbschloe, vice president of research at Computer  
Economics in Carlsbad, Calif., said the announcements seem like an 
effort to convince consumers and analysts that ``neither one of 
these companies are going to jump ahead of each other, 
product-wise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They are trying not just to reiterate what they've said in the  
past, but to show that they are still strong and committed,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Erbschloe said the growing popularity of Linux, a well-regarded  
version of the Unix operating system used by businesses to run 
computer networks and Internet sites, is also shaking up Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel has endorsed Linux, buying a multimillion-dollar stake in  
VA Research, a Mountain View, Calif.-based maker of business 
computers that run on Linux, earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel's workstation products division general manager, Anand  
Chandrasekher, said Tuesday that Intel's continued commitment to 
Microsoft doesn't undermine Intel's relationship with Linux users. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our task is to enable all operating systems to work best on  
Intel architecture,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Mead To Cut 200 Jobs at Maine Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RUMFORD, Maine (AP) -- Mead Corp. plans to cut about 200 jobs at  
its paper mill here as it sheds unprofitable product lines and 
focuses on the more lucrative coated paper market, company 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rod Jamison, president of Local 900 of the United Paperworkers  
International Union said he expects about 150 union-covered workers 
and 50 salaried workers to lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,200 workers will remain when the cuts are completed, the  
Dayton, Ohio-based company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Salaried employees will receive severance packages based on  
their wages and years of service, as well as outplacement services, 
said company spokesman Doug Draper. 
</P>
<P>
	The union will seek to negotiate its own severance package for  
its workers, Jamison said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mead Chairman Jerry Tatar said the four machines being shut down  
in Rumford are too old to keep up in the competitive uncoated paper 
market, which is being hurt by competition from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Production of security papers -- used to make checks, deposit  
certificates and other banking documents -- will be shifted to 
Mead's operations in Chillicothe, Ohio, Draper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Draper said the cuts are part of a refocus on coated paper  
products, which are used in glossy magazines, textbooks and 
catalogs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coated paper is the high end of the business,'' he said.  
``Coated paper and high value specialty papers tend to be the most 
profitable part of the paper industry.''

<HEADLINE> Hawks Trade Blaylock to Warriors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Mookie Blaylock, who ran the Atlanta offense for  
seven years, was traded to the Golden State Warriors in a 
three-player deal Tuesday night that allowed the Hawks to move up 
to the 10th position in the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks sent one of their four first-round picks, No. 21  
overall, to the Warriors for the higher pick as well as guard Bimbo 
Coles and forward Duane Ferrell. 
</P>
<P>
	The aging Hawks are revamping their team after being swept out  
of the playoffs in the second round by the younger, quicker New 
York Knicks. They looked to move Blaylock, a two-time member of the 
NBA's all-defensive team who took most of the blame for Atlanta's 
stagnant offense this season. 
</P>
<P>
	After trading Blaylock, the Hawks might look to take advantage  
of a draft deep in point guards. Maryland's Steve Francis, Utah's 
Andre Miller and UCLA's Baron Davis are among the players who 
figure to go early Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``This gives us an opportunity to move up significantly to a  
part of the draft where we feel we can get a high-quality player,'' 
general manager Pete Babcock said during a hastily called news 
conference. ``The top 10 was what we were trying to get. We got to 
the fringe of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blaylock had been an integral part of the Hawks since he was  
acquired from New Jersey in 1992 for Rumeal Robinson. He led the 
league in steals in 1996-97 and 1997-98, joining Alvin Robertson 
and Magic Johnson as the only players to pull off that feat in 
consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Blaylock took a step back this year after the  
lockout ended, shooting only 37.9 percent from the field and 
averaging just 5.8 assists per game. Both figures were the worst 
since his rookie season with the Nets in 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
	As the point guard, Blaylock took much of the blame for a Hawks  
offense that averaged 86.3 points per game, beating only the woeful 
Chicago Bulls. More telling, they averaged less than 16 assists per 
game, by far the lowest figure in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to look at the good years more than one situation,''  
Hawks coach Lenny Wilkens said. ``It was not totally his fault.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, 31, averaged 9.5 points and 4.6 assists for the Warriors,  
starting 32 of 48 games. The Hawks have another veteran point guard 
in Anthony Johnson, but the strength of that position in the draft 
provides a chance to land someone with more long-term potential. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis, Davis and Miller are likely to be selected before No.  
10, but the Hawks might be able to get Jason Terry of Arizona, 
Chris Herren of Fresno State, Vonteego Cummings of Pittsburgh or 
William Avery of Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrell played in only eight games last season because of  
tendinitis in his left knee. The 34-year-old forward played at 
Georgia Tech and spent his first six NBA seasons with the Hawks, 
averaging a career-high 12.7 points in 1991-92. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past two seasons, however, he has managed just 1.7  
points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks still have four first-round picks, which makes it  
likely they will try to work out another deal before the draft. 
However, team president Stan Kasten said it was unlikely the team 
would be able to move higher than No. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	If nothing else, Atlanta will probably trade away one or two  
picks to avoid a glut of young players requiring guaranteed 
three-year contracts next season.

<HEADLINE> Judi Dench Returns To Broadway Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Judi Dench will return to the Broadway hit  
``Amy's View'' on July 6 to complete the final two weeks of the 
play's run. 
</P>
<P>
	Dench left the David Hare drama after the June 22 performance to  
be with her husband, actor Michael Williams, in London. Williams is 
seriously ill with a lung infection. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amy's View'' is a hot ticket, with only rear mezzanine seats  
available before the show ends its limited engagement on July 18. 
But with Dench absent, many were opting for refunds or exchanging 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Only about a quarter of the 1,096-seat Ethel Barrymore Theater  
was filled over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Dench won a best-actress Tony Award for her  
portrayal of a stage actress named Esme Allen. In March, she won an 
Academy Award for playing Queen Elizabeth I in the romantic comedy 
``Shakespeare in Love.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Makes Fund-Raising Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton made a quick fund-raising trip  
to New York City and took in a Broadway play. First lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton, edging ever closer to a bid for Senate from New 
York, took the opportunity to scope out real estate. 
</P>
<P>
	In between, the president challenged Republican lawmakers Monday  
to use projected budget surpluses to shore up the retirement system 
before they enacted tax cuts and urged them to revisit gun control 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton and daughter Chelsea accompanied the president  
aboard Air Force One to New York and had been expected to attend a 
benefit performance of ``The Iceman Cometh'' with Clinton. But the 
two broke off to look at real estate in the city and its suburbs, 
administration officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the special matinee of the Eugene O'Neill classic, which  
drew some 1,000 Democratic contributors, Clinton entered from the 
rear of the stage to thank the cast, greeting star Kevin Spacey 
with a bear hug. He said the tale of besotten souls living on lies 
they tell to themselves gave him and the audience ``too much to 
think about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turning to domestic issues, Clinton urged GOP lawmakers to  
address public concern over violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still hoping that members of the other party will decide  
they really are the candidates of law and order and will join us 
... passing sensible restrictions to keep guns out of the wrong 
hands,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a $400,000 Democratic fund-raising luncheon in suburban  
Westport, Conn., Clinton noted that his affluent audience would 
benefit from an across-the-board tax cut, but urged his listeners 
to think about the future of such government programs as Medicare 
and Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of you would be better off, in the short run, being at a  
Republican fund-raiser,'' Clinton said, but added: ``There's 
something to be said about looking to the long run, as well as the 
short run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before returning to Washington, Clinton had dinner with more  
than three-dozen New York executives to discuss his plans for a 
presidential library, a $125 million project he intends to build in 
Little Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	Aboard Air Force One returning to Washington, President Clinton  
said he had been ``worried sick'' in recent weeks about the 
progress of the peace process in Northern Ireland. But he said: 
``Today I had a good feeling about it. The price of its coming 
apart is greater than the cost of it going forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether Mrs. Clinton had any success finding a house in  
the New York area, Clinton shook his head and smiled. ``Im not the 
spokesperson for that operation,'' the president said.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Wine Now More Palatable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- The Frenchman shakes his head in disbelief  
when the waiter at a five-star hotel restaurant suggests he try a 
new local wine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came to Egypt to experience something different, not to live  
the same way I do at home,'' Francois Galland laments, staring at 
the bottle of red wine. 
</P>
<P>
	Not so long ago, the very thought of a Frenchman comparing  
Egyptian wine to that back home would have been laughable. But in 
recent months, Egypt has gone from offering one bad, state-owned 
vintage to serving up more-than-palatable bottles from two 
privately managed wineries. Competition has done wonders for wine 
lovers here. 
</P>
<P>
	Egyptian wine making goes back to at least 2700 B.C., when  
scenes of wine making appear on tomb walls. In those days, five 
kinds of wine -- all probably made in the Nile Delta -- were 
traditionally taken along into the afterlife. 
</P>
<P>
	Until a few months ago, though, Egypt's modern wine industry  
possessed only one name, Gianaclis, a state-owned winery producing 
a dubious beverage, satirically nicknamed ``Chateau Migraine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nationalized in the early 1960s, Gianaclis' wines deteriorated  
after the death of its Greek wine master about a dozen years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The company still exists. But in March, as part of the  
government's privatization drive, it was bought by Al-Ahram 
Beverages Co., which last year also bought Stella beer from the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	And the government gave permission for a new winery, Gouna  
Beverage Co. The introduction of its Obelisque reds and whites was 
delayed from January until April because of administrative 
problems, which many people saw as an attempt by an Islamic society 
to impede local wine production. 
</P>
<P>
	``We encountered many problems when we wanted to set up in  
Egypt, but the wine market is an untapped jewel that is worth the 
trouble,'' said Youssef Hammad, Gouna's sales and marketing 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Keefer, director of public relations at Al-Ahram  
Beverages, says the company has brought in French wine consultants 
with experience in making wines in desert countries, such as the 
vineyards of King Hassan of Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Ahram estimates only 30 percent of the wine and beer it  
produces is consumed in tourist outlets. That leaves 
``Western-educated, returning-to-Egypt, cosmopolitan'' Egyptians as 
their main market, Keefer said. 
</P>
<P>
	With a retail price of 18 Egyptian pounds a bottle, or about  
$5.25, Gianaclis wine is one-third the cost of imported wines. A 
bottle of Obelisque's Pharaoh Red or Alexandria White sells for 25 
pounds, about $7.25. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to get back the alienated wine consumers, who have  
been lost because of price increases and quality drop,'' said 
Keefer, who adds his company isn't worried by competition from 
Gouna because they fell Egypt's wine market is undersupplied. 
</P>
<P>
	Gouna beverages hopes to introduce a rose to its Obelisque range  
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	While Al-Ahram uses domestic grapes from the Gianaclis  
vineyards, Gouna imports grape juice to make its wine. It would 
take at least a decade for a new vineyard to produce grapes for 
wine. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Gouna's juice came from Sicily, where the grapes are  
crushed and the juice concentrated, raising the sugar content, 
which helps preserve aroma. The mixture is then flown in 
refrigerated containers to the winery at the Gouna resort on the 
Red Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Once in the winery, the fermentation process, which ultimately  
determines the quality of the wine, is placed under the expertise 
of French oenologist Jean-Baptiste Soula. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I arrived here, none of my employees had ever drunk wine  
or worked in a winery before,'' Soula said. 
</P>
<P>
	The wine would certainly be better if it were made from fresh  
grapes, but the product is reasonable in quality and makes a good 
table wine, Soula promises. 
</P>
<P>
	With the current process, Gouna is aiming to produce 1 million  
bottles of red, white and rose a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our focus is on quality rather than quantity. The ... price  
shows that our wine is targeted towards tourists and the large 
expatriate community living in Egypt,'' said Hammad, Gouna's sales 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the Egyptian elite can afford wine, most Egyptians are  
battling an increasingly high cost of living, particularly after 
the slump in tourism revenues following the 1997 massacre of 
tourists at Luxor by Islamic radicals. 
</P>
<P>
	Though many Muslims frown on wine, others are less strict.  
Gianaclis' best-known product is Omar Khayyam Cabernet, named after 
the wine-loving Persian poet.

<HEADLINE> Omnicare Announces Job Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COVINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Pharmacy giant Omnicare Inc. said Tuesday  
it will eliminate about 1,700 jobs, nearly 15 percent of its 
workforce, as part of a plan to streamline operations following 
years of robust growth through acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	The restructuring is expected to generate annualized pretax  
savings of $46 million by late next year, said the Covington-based 
company, which is a leading provider of pharmacy services to 
nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The consolidation is meant to enhance efficiency, improve  
productivity and standardize operations, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said its pharmacies will be reconfigured through  
consolidations, relocations, the closing of about 20 sites and the 
creation of nine new ones. Once the changes are completed, Omnicare 
will have 140 pharmacy units, 23 global contract research sites and 
two software development and marketing operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Omnicare President Joel F. Gemunder said the streamlining is the  
result of the company's rapid growth in recent years. The company's 
revenue nearly doubled during 1998 to $1.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The company recently warned that its second-quarter profits  
would be lower than expected because of changes in the Medicare 
reimbursement system. 
</P>
<P>
	``To gain maximum benefit from our acquisition program and to  
respond to recent changes in the health care industry, we have 
identified synergies which make it possible to generate greater 
economies of scale through the standardization of practices and 
procedures, and to geographically position our operating 
organization for cost-efficient delivery of enhanced customer 
service,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The restructuring will eliminate about 1,700 full- and part-time  
jobs from the company's 11,500-member work force during the next 18 
months. When possible, the company said, it will use normal 
attrition and transfers to other locations. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the productivity and consolidation initiative is a very  
positive move for most employees, and for the company as a whole, 
we know this will bring about significant change,'' Gemunder said. 
``Our work force is a key factor in Omnicare's success and we will 
work to make the changes as smooth as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Omnicare is a leading geriatric pharmaceutical care company,  
serving about 617,000 residents in more than 8,600 long-term care 
facilities in 43 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Omnicare's stock closed Tuesday at $12.93 3/4, up 68 3/4 cents, or 6  
percent, on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> CART Drops Cleveland GP for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Championship Auto Racing Teams dropped the  
Cleveland Grand Prix from its schedule next year because of a 
financial dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	CART has raced at Burke Lakefront Airport's temporary course in  
Cleveland since 1982. The series, sponsored by FedEx, reportedly 
was seeking $2 million for next year's race. The fee was $1.5 
million for this year's race, which was run in the rain Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was CART's desire to continue racing at Cleveland, and it  
is unfortunate we could not come to an agreement,'' said Andrew 
Craig, CART chairman and chief executive officer. ``The race fans 
in Cleveland are among the best on our schedule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The promoter for the Cleveland Grand Prix is negotiating with  
the Indy Racing League, CART's rival, about coming to Cleveland 
next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	In another move, CART signed an extension with the Mid-Ohio  
Sports Car Course in Lexington, about 60 miles north of Columbus, 
through 2003.

<HEADLINE> McDonald's Agrees To Pay $4 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- McDonald's Corp. has agreed to pay a $4  
million fine to the government for not reporting injuries suffered 
by children at some of its restaurant playgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Product Safety Commission, which was announcing the  
settlement today, said McDonald's violated a 1995 requirement 
requiring the company to report defective playground equipment to 
the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm determined that companies making commitments to CPSC keep  
them,'' CPSC Chairwoman Ann Brown said in an interview Monday. 
``Now children can go to McDonald's playgrounds and know that they 
will be able to play safely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the commission, McDonald's did not report injuries  
resulting from its ``Big Mac Climber'' playground toy -- a large 
metal platform resembling a hamburger. A hole in the middle of the 
toy allows kids to climb up and down a ladder inside. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission said 400 children were injured while on the  
climbers, with 20 sustaining concussions or skull fractures and 80 
suffering from broken bones. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the injuries occurred during the 1970s and 1980s. The  
company has since removed the climber from its playground 
facilities, the CPSC said. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's spokesman Chuck Eberling stressed that the agreement  
involves a piece of equipment that ``was totally out of our 
restaurants by the mid-90s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The dispute relates to reporting certain injuries on the  
playland equipment, and the dispute revolves around the 
bureaucratic reporting requirements of that,'' Eberling said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the injuries were ``by and large'' minor. ``There were  
some broken bones and scrapes and bruises,'' he said. ``There were 
no deaths or dramatic injuries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Brown still expressed concern about the company failing for  
the second time to tell the commission about an unsafe piece of 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the restaurant chain agreed to finance a $5 million  
safety campaign, overseen by the CPSC, after the commission cited 
the company for failing to report injuries to children who played 
on the ``Tug-N-Turn'' merry-go-round rides. 
</P>
<P>
	In signing that settlement, McDonald's denied that it had a  
statutory reporting obligation because it was not a manufacturer, 
distributor or retailer of Tug-N-Turns. But the company, based in 
Oak Brook, Ill., agreed to report to the CPSC any information about 
playground equipment with defects that could create a hazard. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new agreement with the CPSC, McDonald's has additional  
reporting and safety guidelines it must follow, including making 
sure that any obsolete playground equipment be removed, according 
to the commission.

<HEADLINE> Hackers Attack Army's Internet Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Computer hackers apparently used a  
well-publicized software flaw to vandalize the U.S. Army's main 
Internet site for as long as nine hours before anyone noticed. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was the latest in a string of electronic attacks  
launched recently against high-profile federal government Web 
sites, including those run by the White House, the Senate and the 
FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army said it replaced the altered page at the www.army.mil  
site early Monday and said no internal systems were otherwise 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were no security breaches,'' Army spokesman Jim Stueve  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Administrators believe the hackers hit between 8 p.m. Sunday and  
5 a.m. Monday. Stueve said the site was repaired within one hour. 
</P>
<P>
	The vandalized page announced that the attack ``has a purpose  
... to settle rumors'' about the demise of the loosely organized 
hacker group that also claimed responsibility for a similar attack 
on the White House site last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Another message hidden within the altered page's computer code  
urged people who saw it to ``trust very few people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The attack comes just months after Deputy Defense Secretary John  
Hamre announced stepped-up internal security procedures to protect 
against hackers, but Monday's electronic break-in apparently took 
advantage of a flaw in commercial, off-the-shelf software. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army's computers use popular Internet software from Allaire  
Corp. of Cambridge, Mass., which warned customers in an e-mail 
security bulletin as recently as May 19 to remove sample programs 
and computer code installed by default into a particular directory 
created by its software. 
</P>
<P>
	It also urged customers to completely remove the vulnerable  
directory, but a security notice currently on the Army's Web site 
indicates that directory still exists on its computers and remains 
actively used. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Cold Fusion'' flaw drew widespread attention among  
computer security experts, especially after hackers distributed 
step-by-step instructions on exploiting the software problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army said only that it was investigating the attack. The  
FBI, which normally investigates electronic assaults against 
government systems, said the matter had been turned over to the 
appropriate authorities but declined to say whether it was involved 
in the probe. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack comes in the wake of several others on prominent  
government Internet sites, including those of the White House, FBI 
and Senate earlier this year. Military pages have long been 
favorites of hackers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're always the target,'' said Keith Rhodes, a director in  
the information management division of the General Accounting 
Office, the investigative branch of Congress. ``It's almost like a 
rite of passage. You have to bust a (military) site to have any 
credibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, experts told the House Science Committee's  
technology panel that managers at many federal agencies fail to 
consider computer security adequately and have too few employees 
with sufficient training. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes, who was among those testifying last week, said Monday  
that the Defense Department's computer-security expertise is 
uneven. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're the best and the worst in computer security,'' Rhodes  
said. ``They've got some real pros, some of the best in the 
business. But the DOD is huge ... and some of the areas in the 
Department of Defense don't have very good security.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	Chart-topping actress-turned-singer Jennifer Lopez will sing  
live during the Women's World Cup closing event at Pasadena's Rose 
Bowl on July 10th. 
</P>
<P>
	To accommodate the expanded Closing Ceremonies, the start of the  
third-place match has been moved back 15 minutes to 10:15 a.m. PDT. 
Lopez will sing in between the third-place match and the final 
match at 12:30 p.m. The final match begins at 12:50 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Women's World Cup will conclude with an exciting Closing  
Ceremonies featuring one of the hottest female stars today,'' said 
World Cup organizing director Marla Messing. ``Jennifer Lopez 
exemplifies the spirit of the Women's World Cup, and we are 
thrilled to have her be a part of this history-making event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez is already making history on her own. Last week the  
single's debut single ``If You Had My Love'' was the first to claim 
the No. 1 slot on the Hot 100, Hot 100 single sales, and R&AMP;B 
singles sales charts simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, ``If You Had My Love'' became only the second song  
in Hot 100 singles history to be both No. 1 and the greatest gainer 
in both sales and airplay. The song's video has been among the top 
five in airplay on MTV since May 17, and Lopez's first Latin 
single, her duet with Marc Anthony, ``No Me Ames'' soared to No. 1 
on last week's Hot Latin Tracks chart. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NO TV FOR NORWAY:* The Norwegian team wasn't happy when they  
turned on their televisions Sunday from their San Jose hotel room. 
The hotel didn't have ESPN2 and they couldn't watch the United 
States-North Korea match. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway's coach Per-Mathias Hogmo was not pleased that he could  
not scout one of the other favorites in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to find another place to watch the game,'' he said. ``I  
watched around the corner at a sports bar with my (coaching staff). 
</P>
<P>
	Hogmo blamed FIFA for not being more careful when choosing  
accommodations for the teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe FIFA should check to see if hotels have ESPN2  
beforehand,'' said Hogmo. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Medalen, the team captain, was also critical of FIFA.  
</P>
<P>
	``It would be good to relax and watch game, but FIFA does not  
want us to,'' he said. ``It's strange that we can't watch (the 
games) from our rooms.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ROLE MODEL:* United States goalkeeper Briana Scurry hopes she  
will be a role model and inspire more black children to take up 
soccer. Scurry is the only African-American starter on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Soccer is mainly a white suburban sport in the U.S. and Scurry  
said she only played soccer because her family moved from 
Minneapolis to a predominantly white suburb when she was young. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Scurry hopes she can inspire more black children to take up  
the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely see the day when we get to that, when more  
African-American kids will be playing,'' she said. ``Everything 
begins with a single step. For example, my nieces and nephews back 
in Minnesota saw me play and that made them want to try it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scurry is sure that the future of soccer in the United States  
lies beyond white suburban families. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I'm a pioneer now,'' Scurry said. ``But after I'm old  
and retired, I know we'll see a lot more African-American players 
out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *INJURED:* Sweden's title hopes were dampened with the injury to  
Hanna Ljungberg. 
</P>
<P>
	The midfielder who scored two goals in an earlier victory over  
Australia, left in the sixth minute of a 2-0 win Saturday over 
Ghana with a right knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Ljungberg hasn't officially been listed as ``out'' for  
Wednesday's match against Norway, but isn't expected to play. 
</P>
<P>
	She was diagnosed with a ligament sprain with a possible tear.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RATINGS:* The Women's World Cup's television ratings are doing  
fine. The opening match of the United States vs. Denmark received a 
1.7 rating on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN's audience for last Thursday's U.S.-Nigeria game drew a  
1.85 rating and was seen in 1.4 million homes. It was the 
second-highest rated soccer match on the network, behind the men's 
World Cup semifinal last year between Brazil and the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Sunday's United States-North Korea game on ESPN2 got a 1.96  
rating and was seen in 1.3 million homes. It was the highest rating 
for any soccer match on ESPN2 and the fifth most-watched event on 
the network. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the tournament ratings are a .82 on ESPN and .51 on  
ESPN2. One cable ratings point equals 766,000 homes on ESPN and 
644,000 homes on ESPN2.

<HEADLINE> Baylor's Jennings Named Top Player </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Baylor pitcher and designated hitter Jason  
Jennings won the Rotary Smith Award on Monday night as college 
baseball's player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander was 13-2 with a 2.58 ERA for the Bears this  
past season with 172 strikeouts in 146.2 innings. He was also the 
team's designated hitter, batting .386 with 17 homers and 69 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rotary Smith Award is voted upon by the College Sports  
Information Directors of America. 
</P>
<P>
	The other two finalists were Nebraska first baseman Ken Harvey  
and Rice left-hander Mario Ramos. Harvey led the NCAA with a .478 
batting average, and he also had 23 homers and 86 RBIs. Ramos led 
the Owls to the College World Series with a 13-3 record and a 2.51 
ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	The award caps a season of accolades for Jennings. He won the  
Dick Howser Award, voted on by members of the National Collegiate 
Baseball Writers Association and was named player of the year by 
both Collegiate Baseball magazine and Baseball America. Jennings 
also was the Big 12 player of the year, a first-team All-America 
and a first-team Academic All-America. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Rockies selected Jennings with the 16th pick  
overall pick in the amateur draft on June 2. He made his 
professional debut Saturday, pitching four no-hit innings for 
Portland of the Northwest League. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennings pitched one-hit shutouts against Missouri and Northeast  
Louisiana in the NCAA regionals that Baylor hosted. 
</P>
<P>
	The award, given since 1988, is named for R.E. ``Bob'' Smith,  
who helped bring major league baseball to Houston. Past winners 
include Andy Benes, Ben McDonald, Mark Kotsay and Kris Benson. 
</P>
<P>
	Money raised from the Smith Award banquet benefits the Rotary  
Charities, the Karl Young College League summer baseball program 
and Texas Children's Hospital.

<HEADLINE> Rockets Reject Olajuwon Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The Houston Rockets discussed trading Hakeem  
Olajuwon to the Toronto Raptors but ruled out a deal, coach Rudy 
Tomjanovich said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any deal involving Hakeem Olajuwon would be very hard for me  
to make. ... I have an emotional attachment to him and that's the 
way it is,'' Tomjanovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Houston Chronicle and Toronto Sun reported today that the  
teams were discussing a trade for the star center. The deal 
reportedly involved two other players and two first-round draft 
picks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I approached Houston and inquired about his availability, but  
they said no,'' Raptors general manager Glen Grunwald said today 
from Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources close to the talks said discussions started about two  
weeks ago, the Chronicle reported. Negotiations became more serious 
Sunday and Monday, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 36-year-old center is Houston's most-celebrated athlete,  
ranking with Nolan Ryan and Earl Campbell. In his 15 years with the 
Rockets, he led the team to NBA championships in 1994 and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The thought of sending Olajuwon elsewhere was unthinkable to  
many in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``No. No. No. Not now. Not ever,'' Houston Chronicle columnist  
Fran Blinebury wrote today. ``If you trade Hakeem, you end the 
dream, the fantasy, that has been his truly remarkable 15-year NBA 
career and our ride to the most wonderful places with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By dealing Olajuwon, Houston would have started a rebuilding  
process following consecutive first-round playoff losses. 
</P>
<P>
	A deal for Olajuwon would have a bearing on Charles Barkley. He  
is considering retirement and said he wanted to return only if he 
thought the Rockets were title contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal reportedly would have involved Kevin Willis, who played  
two seasons with the Rockets before he was traded to Toronto last 
June for Roy Rogers and two first-round draft picks. Willis, 36, 
averaged 12 points and 8.3 rebounds last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports said Houston also would have gotten swingman Doug  
Christie, 29, who played 3 1/2 seasons for the Lakers and Knicks 
before spending the last three seasons in Toronto.

<HEADLINE> Bankers Trust CEO Quits Steps Aside </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Bankers Trust Corp. chief executive  
Frank Newman will resign from Deutsche Bank AG this week, following 
the merger of the two banks earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	His departure, which takes effect Wednesday, will be on  
``amicable terms,'' Deutsche Bank said in a statement on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Newman said he was stepping aside because he ``concluded that  
the role originally envisioned for me will not be necessary.'' 
After the merger, it was planned for Newman to sit on the Deutsche 
Bank board. 
</P>
<P>
	But, according to a German magazine report over the weekend,  
Deutsche Bank decided to drop Newman because he did not provide 
sufficient information about illegal money transfers at Bankers 
Trust from 1994-96. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Bankers Trust agreed to pay $63.5 million in fines to  
settle charges that it unlawfully diverted millions of dollars from 
unclaimed customer accounts into its own coffers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Der Spiegel report, released Saturday, said that Newman  
negotiated his resignation last week with Deutsche Bank Chief Rolf 
E. Breuer. It said the Bankers Trust executive had sought a 
severance package worth $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Bank would not comment on the report.  
</P>
<P>
	Newman's departure comes a week after the resignation of Richard  
H. Daniel, chief financial officer at Bankers Trust. He led the 
investigation of the illegal funds transfer. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Bank said Daniel resigned ``to pursue other  
interests.'' A source close to the situation, speaking on condition 
of anonymity, said he had been fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Bank had said in a federal filing that it may fire  
Bankers Trust executives for failing to act appropriately in 
investigating an illegal funds transfer. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger in early June of Germany's biggest bank and Bankers  
Trust, the eighth largest bank in the United States, creates the 
world's largest commercial financial institution with assets of 
about 1.55 trillion German marks ($820 billion), as of March 31, 
and a workforce of some 95,000.

<HEADLINE> Loeb Joining CBS Marketwatch.com </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS MarketWatch.com has signed up the veteran  
business journalist Marshall Loeb as a daily columnist, luring him 
away from the post of editor of the Columbia Journalism Review. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the latest coup for up-and-coming Web sites who have been  
recruiting prominent members of the journalism community. Earlier 
this month Lou Dobbs resigned as CNN's top business news executive 
to work at a Web site focusing on outer space, and former Newsweek 
business editor Mark Vamos is moving to SmartMoney.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Loeb said in an interview Tuesday that he weighed the decision  
to leave traditional media carefully before making the move to CBS 
MarketWatch.com, which has emerged as a leading provider of 
financial news and information on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Naturally I gave considerable thought to it, but I'm always  
stimulated by working with something new, and online journalism is 
certainly on the cutting edge and rapidly changing. I'm very happy 
to have this new opportunity,'' Loeb said. 
</P>
<P>
	Loeb started his career in journalism nearly 50 years ago for  
the former United Press news agency in Frankfurt. He rose through 
the ranks at the Time Inc. family of magazines, becoming the 
business editor of Time magazine, then editor of Money magazine and 
then Fortune. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past three years he has served as editor of the highly  
respected Columbia Journalism Review, and this year he was a juror

	Beginning in August, Loeb will write a daily column for CBS  
MarketWatch.com focusing on personal finance, the stock market and 
the economy. He will also begin writing a biweekly column on

	Loeb said his decision to make the dive into the world of the  
Internet should not be interpreted as a sign of no confidence in 
traditional media outlets such as newspapers and magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course we will always want and need and have print. And  
yes, magazines are here to stay as are newspapers and wire

<HEADLINE> Missouri Court Defines Oral Sex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A strip club where two dancers  
performed simulated oral sex with dollar bills violated state 
liquor regulations barring lewd acts, Missouri's Supreme Court 
ruled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-member court unanimously rejected arguments that the  
meaning of simulated ``oral copulation'' in the regulation is too 
vague. The court said the term is commonly understood to mean oral 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
	A lower-court judge had previously ruled that since ``oral  
copulation'' does not appear in the dictionary, the regulation was 
unenforceable. 
</P>
<P>
	The case stems from a 10-day suspension issued against the  
Mercedes Club in 1993 after two undercover officers reported the 
violations at the Springfield establishment.

<HEADLINE> Russia Ends Ruble Trade Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia met a major requirement for badly needed  
foreign loans Tuesday by scrapping a dual system of currency 
exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
	A top official also said that a formal outline of the  
government's economic policy -- which will largely determine whether 
Moscow would get additional foreign loans -- could be signed next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Monetary Fund has agreed to lend Russia $4.5  
billion, provided the state implements certain economic reforms. 
Moscow needs the new IMF loans to make payments on old ones falling 
due this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the IMF-recommended reforms have been approved. On  
Tuesday, the government moved on two more -- pulling licenses from 
four insolvent banks and canceling a second daily currency trading 
session set up to restrict the ruble's convertibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The special trading session, limited to exporters and importers,  
was introduced in the wake of the country's financial meltdown last 
August. It helped prop up the value of the ruble and boost hard 
currency reserves by offering the Central Bank the opportunity to 
buy dollars at a lower rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The dual-rate system goes against the policies of the IMF, which  
instead favors unrestricted currency trading. Economists said the 
move could cause a new drop in the value of the ruble, whose fate 
now hinges on the government's ability to secure new loans, limit 
capital flight and soak up excess rubles by issuing new bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's chief liaison with international lenders, ex-Finance  
Minister Mikhail Zadornov, met with an IMF team on Tuesday. He said 
the IMF appeared pleased with Russia's performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can say that the overall tone of the negotiations is very  
constructive,'' Interfax quoted Zadornov as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Cabinet and Central Bank plan sign an outline of their  
economic plans, which will likely influence the IMF's decision on 
whether to give Russia more money, Zadornov said. The document may 
be issued next week, he said.

	TOKYO (AP) -- Toyota Motor Corp. will commercialize a  
pollution-free fuel cell electric vehicle in 2003, aiming to become 
the first to put such a vehicle on the market, Toyota chairman 
Hiroshi Okuda was quoted as saying Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The new vehicle will be mass-produced starting in 2003, Okuda  
was quoted as telling reporters by Kyodo News service.

	Toyota is apparently seeking to set a global standard for fuel

German-U.S. automaker DaimlerChrysler AG, which plans to market one 
by 2004, Kyodo reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The fuel cell electric vehicle utilizes an electrochemical  
reaction between hydrogen and oxygen within the fuel cells, rather 
than through the combustion of fossil fuels. Toyota has set up a 
division to develop fuel cell technologies.

<HEADLINE> 'Sleeping Beauty' Ballet Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A production of ``Sleeping Beauty'' that was  
close to the 1890 original opened the Kirov Ballet's two-week 
season at the Metropolitan Opera House. And it is beautiful -- 
cleanly directed, elegantly costumed and splendidly danced. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday night's audience didn't seem to mind that ``The Sleeping  
Beauty'' now lasts four hours and contains a lot of mime, or that 
there were more people on stage than in any other contemporary 
``Sleeping Beauty'' production -- 135, with 72 in the Act 1 garland 
dance. 
</P>
<P>
	But even with lots of people on stage, like the fairies in the  
christening scene who each had a large entourage, the placement of 
dancers was clear, not muddled. 
</P>
<P>
	Svetlana Zakharova radiantly danced the title role, Princess  
Aurora. The exemplary Igor Zelensky danced Prince Desire and 
Veronica Part was the Lilac Fairy. 
</P>
<P>
	The final act always has lots of character dances. This  
production is unusually charming, with more fairy-tale characters 
like Cinderella and Tom Thumb, as well as the expected 
Puss-in-Boots, Bluebird and Little Red Riding Hood. The final 
tableau includes cupids, gods and goddesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Dance notations of ``The Sleeping Beauty'' were made at the  
beginning of this century, recording Marius Petipa's choreography. 
When the Kirov's ballet master emigrated from Russia, he took those 
notations with him. He used them for Sergei Diaghilev's mounting of 
the ballet in 1921, upon which The British Royal Ballet bases its 
version. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kirov mounted its first revival based on the memories of  
dancers who had been in it. 
</P>
<P>
	The dance notations for ``The Sleeping Beauty'' are now in the  
Harvard University Library. Photos of each scene, set and costume 
designs, a scale model of Act 2 and some original costumes were in 
St. Petersburg, Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Makhar Vaziev, director of the Kirov Ballet, worked two years to  
translate the notations. The new production had its premiere April 
30 in St. Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
	The sets were effective Monday night but not sumptuous. A cobweb  
scrim in front of the court, which had been sleeping for 100 years, 
was a nice touch. Costumes for the most part were gorgeous. In 
1890, ``The Sleeping Beauty'' was the most expensive production 
ever for the ballet company. 
</P>
<P>
	Gianandrea Noseda conducted the 70-piece Kirov Orchestra in the  
Tchaikovsky music, beginning the overture with a banging of cymbals 
and much noisy percussion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kirov, making its first New York appearance in four years,  
is presenting four programs.

<HEADLINE> Senate Agrees to 4-Day HMO Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate, breaking a deadlock, agreed  
Tuesday to take up ``patients' rights'' legislation that would set 
new controls on HMOs and other managed health care plans when 
lawmakers return from the July 4th holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, after holding a popular farm bill hostage to the  
patients rights measure for a week, relished their successful use 
of the Senate's parliamentary rules to win the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great victory for the 160 million Americans who are  
today demanding that Congress fix the problem in managed care,'' 
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue is incredibly popular with Americans, most of them in  
health maintenance organizations and other managed care plans. 
Polls show that even people who have not have bad experiences with 
HMOs fear that the care they may need some day will be denied by an 
insurance company looking to save money. 
</P>
<P>
	The tone was congenial on the Senate floor as Senate Majority  
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., announced the agreement, belying the 
occasionally nasty fight that brought Senate business to a halt for 
a week. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many senators on both sides who would prefer to do  
this another way,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Senate rules, a minority of senators can hold up action if  
they are willing to stick together, and the 45 Democrats held tough 
since early last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got this agreement because of Democratic unity,'' said Sen.  
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans repeatedly accused Democrats of not caring about  
farmers who would benefit from the agriculture spending bill. They 
also accused Democrats of wanting to use HMOs as an issue in next 
year's elections rather than have a real debate over them now. 
</P>
<P>
	For their part, Democrats said the GOP was afraid to take tough  
votes on a wide range of differences over how much the government 
should regulate HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to avoid similar parliamentary standoffs in the future,  
Lott said he and Daschle will try to change Senate rules that now 
allow members to offer amendments on spending bills that have 
nothing to with the issues that the bills address. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement reached Tuesday, a four-day HMO debate will  
begin July 12, after the Senate returns from its recess. There are 
limits on how much time may be used debating each amendment, 
guaranteeing votes on a number of Democratic proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides, meanwhile, agreed to resume work this week on a  
series of spending bills, including the farm measure. The Senate 
also plans to take up some nominations this week, including that of 
Lawrence Summers to be Treasury secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and Republicans each have legislation they call a  
``patients' bill of rights,'' but the measures differ considerably 
in scope and detail. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans repeatedly offered Democrats the chance to vote yes  
or no on each package as a whole, but Democrats insisted on 
separate votes on several specific points. 
</P>
<P>
	Many provisions of the GOP bill would benefit only the some 48  
million Americans who are in federally regulated, self-insured 
health plans -- generally those offered by large companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats would give patients the right to sue their HMO if they  
are harmed by its decisions on treatment. Democrats also want to 
explicitly give doctors, rather than insurance companies, the right 
to decide what care is medically necessary.

<HEADLINE> P. Morris Retail Incentive Halted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO (AP) -- A federal judge Tuesday told Philip Morris  
Inc. to stop using a retail incentive program that competitors 
contend unfairly squeezed their cigarette brands from store counter 
displays. 
</P>
<P>
	Three rival cigarette companies claim that Philip Morris'  
``Retail Leaders'' program forces retailers to relegate their 
brands to the back shelves or display spots on or near the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The preliminary injunction by U.S. District Court Judge Frank  
Bullock Jr. was issued until a lawsuit filed by R.J. Reynolds 
Tobacco Co., Lorillard Tobacco Co. and Brown and Williamson Tobacco 
Corp. can be heard. 
</P>
<P>
	R.J. Reynolds spokesman John Singleton said his company was  
pleased with the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the judge's order will help preserve retail  
competition while the case moves forward to trial,'' Singleton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris spokesman Mike Pfeil called the injunction  
``disappointing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to believe that in the final analysis, Philip  
Morris' Retail Leaders program will be found to be completely 
lawful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock said in his order that the lawsuit involved all  
cigarette sales in the United States, of which Philip Morris 
``enjoys a significant market share advantage over its 
competitors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris had 53 percent of retail cigarette sales in the  
nation, Bullock said, roughly twice the share of the nearest 
competitor, Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past two years, some 6 million adult smokers -- 14 percent  
of the smoking population -- have switched brands. Store displays 
are important ways for cigarette companies to capture switchers, 
the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The competition for switchers and occasional use purchasers  
occurs primarily in so-called pack outlets, which are comprised of 
convenience stores and gas stations, where approximately 60 percent 
of all cigarettes are sold,'' Bullock said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales to those who switch brands occur largely because of ads  
and product displays on the back bar shelf behind the sales 
counter, the opinion said; companies that don't have that space 
can't compete adequately. 
</P>
<P>
	Lorillard attorney Jim Williams said he expects the trial to  
begin in 8 to 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly means we've got more of a level playing field  
while we prepare to go to trial,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris contended the dispute didn't belong in court and  
that its competitors were sore because Philip Morris made a crafty 
business decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris' top trade marketing executive testified at a  
hearing earlier this month that his company would face 
``administrative chaos'' if Bullock ordered ``Retail Leaders'' 
dismantled. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Hopkins, vice president of trade marketing, said an  
injunction would compel Philip Morris to send sales representatives 
to 80,000 retail outlets nationwide that have signed ``Retail 
Leaders'' contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	He said while the outlets represent just 37.5 percent of Philip  
Morris' 213,000 accounts, they account for 58 percent of the 
company's cigarette sales volume. The company has placed more than 
50,000 cigarette displays at a cost in the tens of millions of 
dollars, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock said the company hadn't presented ``any evidence that it  
will be significantly harmed by the issuance of an injunction.''

<HEADLINE> Treasury Nominee Discusses Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States could butt heads with the  
European Union over trade restrictions on genetically modified 
foods, President Clinton's nominee for deputy treasury secretary 
told lawmakers Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Europeans have an absolute fear, unfounded by any  
scientific basis, of accepting these products,'' Stuart Eizenstat 
said at a Senate Finance Committee hearing on his nomination. 
``They are talking about a moratorium'' on imports of genetically 
modified foods. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is, to my mind, the single greatest trade threat that we  
face systemically with the European Union,'' said Eizenstat, now a 
top economic affairs aide at the State Department who had served as 
President Carter's chief domestic policy adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	Eizenstat said ``almost 100 percent of our agricultural exports  
in the next five years will either be genetically modified or be 
combined with bulk commodities that are genetically modified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, European Union environment ministers agreed to  
tighten rules on trading and selling new genetically modified seeds 
in the 15-nation trading bloc, but rejected a French moratorium on 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure calls for stricter labeling and monitoring of seeds,  
such as corn, soy and rice, and is subject to approval by the 
European Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman met in France Tuesday with  
French Agriculture Minister Jean Glavany in an effort to head off a 
trade dispute over genetically modified crops. French and U.S. 
agriculture officials will work to iron out their differences over 
the next two months, Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has complained about European heel-dragging in  
approving U.S. foods that have been genetically manipulated to make 
them more resistant to diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	In Europe, such genetic manipulation is seen as a health hazard.  
Newspapers in Britain have called them ``Frankenstein Foods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States would like to see the Europeans ``develop the  
kind of FDA process that we have to ensure the European public that 
these biotech products are completely safe,'' Eizenstat said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Senate approves his nomination, Eizenstat would assume  
Treasury's No. 2 post, succeeding Lawrence Summers who has been 
nominated to replace Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. Rubin 
announced his resignation last month. Summers' nomination is 
pending Senate approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Several members of the Finance Committee enthusiastically  
supported Eizenstat's nomination. Committee Chairman William Roth, 
R-Del., said he hopes his panel will soon vote on the nomination, 
as well as that of two other Treasury nominees: Lewis Sachs as 
assistant secretary for financial markets and Jeffrey Rush Jr. as 
inspector general. All three nominations also must be approved by 
the Senate 
</P>
<P>
	Eizenstat was questioned on a wide range of domestic and  
international policy issues, including the global financial crisis, 
the nation's record low personal savings rate, Social Security and 
Medicare reform, tax cuts and trade. He stuck to the 
administration's stance on all these matters.

<HEADLINE> Padres To Option Newhan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The San Diego Padres plan to option second  
baseman David Newhan to Class AAA Las Vegas on Tuesday and purchase 
the contract of former All-Star Carlos Baerga. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres signed Baerga to a minor league contract on June 5  
and assigned him to Las Vegas of the Pacific Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga was playing for Cincinnati's Triple-A club in  
Indianapolis, but was released by the Reds on June 4 so he could 
sign with San Diego. Baerga's contract calls for him to be promoted 
to the majors by a certain date or he can again seek free agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga began his professional career in the Padres' organization  
in 1986. He was traded to Cleveland with catcher Sandy Alomar and 
outfielder Chris James for outfielder Joe Carter on Dec. 6, 1989. 
He was traded from the Indians to the New York Mets on July 29, 
1996.

<HEADLINE> Gov't OKs Isotope Export to Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government conditionally approved a  
license Tuesday for the export of highly enriched weapons-grade 
uranium to Canada for use in medical isotopes for cancer treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The uranium will be used by Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. in its  
research reactors for making uranium ``targets'' for use in the 
isotopes. About 285 pounds of weapons-grade uranium will be 
exported over five years under the license. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's export license requires that  
Canada assure the United States that it will move toward the use of 
low-enriched uranium in the future and discontinue the medical use 
of weapons-grade uranium. 
</P>
<P>
	Low-enriched uranium currently is unavailable for use as medical  
isotopes. To help phase out weapons-grade uranium, the Canadian 
suppliers and reactor operators have opened discussions with the 
Energy Department to develop a low-enriched uranium supply. 
</P>
<P>
	Transnuclear Inc., an agent for Atomic Energy of Canada,  
obtained the NRC license. 
</P>
<P>
	It was opposed by the Nuclear Control Institute, a  
Washington-based anti-proliferation advocacy group. It objected to 
the plans for medical use of weapons-grade uranium without 
assurance of an eventual shift to low-enriched uranium. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Leventhal, the group's president, said Tuesday the  
restrictions set by the NRC and a promise to phase out the use of 
weapons-grade uranium with a clear timetable was ``a victory for 
nonproliferation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that under the NRC license, the Canadian companies and  
the U.S. Energy Department will have to submit yearly status 
reports on progress toward developing a low-enriched uranium 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard Spector, director of the Office of Arms Control and  
Nonproliferation at the Energy Department, had urged approval of 
the export license. 
</P>

	``The continued and uninterrupted supply of this isotope is  
critical, as the isotope has a short half-life and cannot be 
stocked,'' Spector wrote the Nuclear Control Institute's Leventhal 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Leventhal said Tuesday, ``This is both a victory for nuclear  
nonproliferation and an accommodation of the need to ensure an 
uninterrupted supply of vital medical isotopes for the treatment of 
cancer.''

<HEADLINE> Missouri Executes Convicted Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POTOSI, Mo. (AP) -- A man convicted in the 1985 slaying of an  
elderly man whose bound and beaten body was found stuffed in a 
freezer was executed by injection early Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Walls, 33, was pronounced dead at 12:08 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry for the victim's family,'' he said before the drugs  
were injected. ``I love my family and will miss them. I hold 
nothing on anybody over this. Goodbye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walls was convicted of killing 88-year-old Fred Harmon after  
walking away from a halfway house where he was serving a burglary 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	He and two men he met at the halfway house -- Tommy Thomas and  
Terry Wilson -- went to the victim's home to rob him. Harmon was 
bound with neckties, dragged to the kitchen and shoved into a 
freezer. The men shut the lid and piled a TV, a chair and other 
heavy objects on top. 
</P>
<P>
	They took $100 and Harmon's car and took off for California,  
where they were eventually arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy determined that Harmon died of head injuries,  
suffocation and hypothermia. 
</P>
<P>
	Walls said he was interested only in stealing money and Harmon's  
car. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal was never to kill this man,'' he said. ``I told them,  
`Don't do it. Leave him alone.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, 33, was convicted of second-degree murder and is serving  
a life term in prison. Thomas, 31, is serving a life sentence after 
pleading guilty to first-degree murder, robbery and burglary.

<HEADLINE> NBA, News Shows Top TV Ratings / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Summer reruns sent network viewership sliding  
last week, with the NBA championship and newsmagazines dominating 
the ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	Basketball and news shows accounted for 12 of the top 20 shows  
in Nielsen Media Research's weekly rankings. ABC and CBS each had 
three of the top-rated newsmagazines. 
</P>
<P>
	Three games of the NBA championship series between the San  
Antonio Spurs and New York Knicks were the three highest-rated 
shows of the week. But the five-game NBA showcase had its lowest 
ratings in 18 years, a whopping 40 percent below last year's finals 
with Michael Jordan's swan song. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC won the week with a 7.2 rating and 14 share. CBS had a 6.9  
rating and 13 share, ABC had a 5.7 rating and 11 share and Fox was 
at 4.2 and 8. Among the emerging networks, the WB had a 2.3 rating 
and 4 share, UPN had a 1.4 rating and 3 share, and Pax TV was at 
0.8 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the domination of reruns, the week's ratings proved  
viewers won't be drawn to something just because it's new. ABC's 
Saturday game show, ``The Big Moment,'' was the lowest-rated 
program on any of the big four networks. UPN's premiere of a 
Canadian series, ``Power Play,'' also fell flat: It was the 
network's lowest-rated program last week. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' won the evening news competition with a  
6.6 rating and 16 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' had a 6.5 
rating and 15 share, while the ``CBS Evening News'' was at 5.8 and 
14. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of June 21-27, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: ``NBA Finals, Game 3: San Antonio at New York,'' NBC, 
12.1; ``NBA Finals, Game 4: San Antonio at New York,'' NBC, 12.0; 
``NBA Finals, Game 5: San Antonio at New York,'' NBC, 11.0; 
``Dateline NBC-Tuesday,'' NBC, 9.5; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 9.2; 
``Frasier,'' NBC, 9.0; ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' CBS, 8.9; 
``Friends,'' NBC, 8.9; ``CBS Wednesday Movie: Now and Then,'' CBS, 
8.8; ``20/20-Sunday,'' ABC, 8.5.

<HEADLINE> Pork, Sgar Down; Copper at 6-Wk High  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Pork futures prices fell sharply for a second day on the New  
York Mercantile Exchange in continued reaction Tuesday to a 
government report that showed hog herds remain large. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, sugar futures also tumbled, while copper  
futures rose to their highest level in six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork futures fell as producers in Iowa and other major  
hog-producing states rushed hogs to slaughter in a bid to lock in 
prices that seemed destined to go lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Agriculture Department's quarterly report on the size  
of the nation's hog herd showed an unexpected increase in June, to 
60.54 million head from 59.89 million in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had expected the herd to fall below March's figure and  
by nearly 1 million head from a year earlier. Producers had been 
expected to have virtually eliminated oversupply by midyear in the 
face of tumbling prices. Pork supplies have soared in the past two 
years because of weaker demand from Asia and a boom in large-scale 
production farms across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Lean hogs for August delivery fell 2 cents to 46.32 cents a  
pound; August pork bellies fell 1.65 cents to 39.32 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar futures tumbled on the Board of Trade of the City of New  
York as heavy Russian buying began to dry up, easing shortages of 
refined white sugar. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian importers who buy sugar today are unlikely to receive  
shipment before an Aug. 1 tariff is imposed on such arrivals. The 
heavy purchases in recent weeks have propped prices despite 
expectations for another bumper harvest from Brazil, the world's 
largest producer, and others. 
</P>
<P>
	October raw sugar fell 0.33 cent to 6.04 cents a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Copper futures continued higher on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange amid hopes that a global supply glut will finally be 
easing. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices have risen sharply over the past few sessions in  
reaction to Broken Hill Proprietary Co.'s decision to shutter its 
American mines in August. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australian company is the world's second-largest copper  
producer, and market participants have fretted for months about 
whether it would take concrete steps to end falling prices. Several 
smaller producers already had moved to limit production, but the 
BHP decision helps remove several hundred thousand tons of copper 
from the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Copper prices have been in a slump as supply exceeds demand,  
partly because of overproduction and partly because of a slowdown 
in construction demand in Asia that came as a result of economic 
turmoil there. Copper is used in wiring and plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
	The London Metal Exchange, meantime, reported supplies in its  
warehouse fell for a third session. Still, some analysts warned the 
price increases could cause Chilean producers to step up 
production, while a mine shuttered in Canada because of a strike 
soon could reopen after labor talks are completed. 
</P>
<P>
	September high-grade copper rose 0.95 cent to 71.60 cents a  
pound.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks rose Wednesday on the back of a  
strong rally on Wall Street. The dollar slipped against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 133.71  
points, or 0.75 percent, to close the morning session at 17,916.50. 
On Tuesday, the average closed up 172.21 points, or 0.98 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.06 yen in midday trading, down 0.28 yen  
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and equal to its late New York level. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei average, which closed at its highest level in more  
than a year Tuesday, rose further on buying from foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tone of the market is still good and we are seeing foreign  
investors, particularly U.S. institutions, continuing to raise 
their weighting of Japanese stocks'' said Garry Evans, a strategist 
at HSBC Securities Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were awaiting the results of Wednesday's U.S. Interest  
rate policy meeting and the release Monday of the Bank of Japan's 
quarterly ``tankan'' survey of business sentiment for hints of the 
market's future direction, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 160.20  
points, or 1.5 percent, to 10,815.35 at Tuesday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 14.25 points, or 1.00 percent, to 1,439.49. 
The TOPIX closed up 7.78 points, or 0.55 percent, on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar came under heavy selling pressure in New York as  
market participants bought the yen, encouraged by positive Japanese 
economic data. 
</P>
<P>
	The Management and Coordination Agency said Tuesday that Japan's  
jobless rate stood at 4.6 percent in May, down from a record 4.9 
percent in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen was also supported by the strong Nikkei finish Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 124.88 yen, down  
from 125.48 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.9050  
percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.805 percent, driving its price 
down to 99.10 yen from 99.95 yen.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Rise for Third Day / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rose for a third straight session on  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 12/32  
point, or $3.75 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, fell to 6.06 percent from 6.09 percent late 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of short-term Treasury securities were between down 1/16  
point and up 1/32 point, while prices of intermediate maturities 
rose between 1/16 point and 5/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate. 
</P>
<P>
	The market's three-session recovery follows a steep decline  
sparked by expectations that interest rates will rise when the 
Federal Reserve meets this week. 
</P>
<P>
	While an increase in the central bank's lending rates may help  
contain inflation by slowing the economy, higher rates would make 
the fixed rate of return on existing bonds less appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 4.83 percent, while  
the discount fell 0.02 percentage point from Monday's auction to 
4.70 percent. Six-month yields rose to 5.12 percent as the discount 
fell 0.02 percentage point from Monday's auction to 4.91 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	One-year yields rose to 5.16 percent, while the discount rose  
0.01 percentage point to 4.90 percent from Monday's auction. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.88 percent from 5.13 percent on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 1/16 to 118 19/32, with the yield 
remaining unchanged at 5.55 percent.

<HEADLINE>  Women's Golf Often Gets Ignored  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The greatest achievement in U.S. Amateur history is often said  
to be Tiger Woods winning three in a row. Never mind that Juli 
Inkster did it 14 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most amazing feats in major championship history is  
Jack Nicklaus winning all four in a span five years, and winning 
the career Grand Slam twice in eight years. A forgotten fact is 
that Mickey Wright won the women's Grand Slam in five years, and 
had captured the four majors at least twice in only six years. 
</P>
<P>
	Compared to the men's tour, the LPGA is often regarded as a  
cheap imitation. 
</P>
<P>
	What Juli Inkster proved Sunday in winning the career Grand Slam  
with an eagle-birdie-birdie finish in the LPGA Championship is that 
women's golf can be just as compelling. 
</P>
<P>
	More than just a major championship, a piece of history was at  
stake with only three holes to play at DuPont Country Club. In a 
three-way tie for the lead, Inkster hit a 5-wood that was every bit 
as important as the 4-wood Corey Pavin hit into the 18th green at 
Shinnecock Hills to win the '95 U.S. Open. At least she made the 
putt, an 18-footer for eagle. 
</P>
<P>
	She stroked an 8-iron within 3 feet for a birdie at No. 17. She  
rose to the occasion by draining a 25-foot birdie putt to complete 
one of the most sensational finishes in a major. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it brings a lot of focus to women's golf,'' Inkster  
said. ``I wish not only for me but for my fellow pros that we get 
the acknowledgment that I think we deserve because we've got a lot 
of exciting golfers. I think it's fun to watch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That can only start to happen when the comparisons to men's golf  
end. 
</P>
<P>
	The women don't hit the ball as far, although Laura Davies  
bombed one drive 292 yards during the LPGA Championship. She is 
used to male pro-am partners wanting to challenge her off the tee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hit a few, and they stop talking,'' Davies said.  
</P>
<P>
	Their wedges don't spin back 20 feet on the green -- that may  
draw as many oohs and aahs as a 360-degree dunk, but it also helped 
Greg Norman lose two majors. 
</P>
<P>
	The galleries aren't nearly as large. During the Titleholders in  
May, there were more marshals than fans on the fifth hole of the 
LPGA International course. 
</P>
<P>
	For every quarter the women make, the men make a dollar. David  
Duval earned $1 million for winning The Players Championship. 
Inkster earned $210,000 for winning the LPGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The women will be on network television six times this year. The  
men get network coverage for every tournament but nine weekends 
during football season. 
</P>
<P>
	But as LPGA commissioner Ty Votaw pointed out, ``Take the NBA  
out of the WNBA and you've got the ABL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The women have been on their own for 50 years, the oldest  
organization in women's sports. The LPGA's total purse has doubled 
from the start of the decade, without the benefit of the massive 
television rights fees that pad the PGA Tour purses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've done it all without any help whatsoever from the male  
counterpart who is perceived to be more successful,'' Votaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	And the LPGA Tour has produced its share of fascinating stories.  
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, it was Se Ri Pak, the 20-year-old rookie from South  
Korea who won two majors and set two scoring records during a 
10-week stretch. The United States won the Solheim Cup behind the 
spicy Dottie Pepper. The emotionless player behind the Titleist hat 
and wraparound shades and winning at a frenetic pace? Karrie Webb. 
</P>
<P>
	And yet, the overnight rating from the Buick Classic, where  
Duffy Waldorf beat Dennis Paulson in a playoff, was 3.1. The LPGA 
Championship, where Inkster had a chance to become the first player 
in 13 years to complete the Grand Slam, got a 1.5. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like we could be just as popular if we were on every  
weekend,'' Nancy Lopez said. ``We have some great players on our 
tour, and some great matches that come right down to the end. They 
always say the ratings aren't good, but it's pretty hard for 
ratings to be good when you're not on but once in a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The du Maurier Classic is next month. Can Inkster, at age 39,  
actually win three major championships in one year? That was the 
talk at the PGA Championship last year, when Mark O'Meara tried to 
become the first player since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win three in one 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	By the way, Pat Bradley won three majors in 1986.  
</P>
<P>
	The slogan of LPGA Tour's national advertising campaign last  
year was, ``Hey, we can play.'' The tone is defensive, as if they 
are begging for attention. 
</P>
<P>
	They deserve it. They can play.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the agriculture spending bill delayed in  
the Senate, Republicans and Democrats intensified the fight for 
farmers' votes Tuesday and accused each other of ignoring rural 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a battle that's certain to gather momentum as the 2000

<P>
	``They may be writing off rural areas but not me,'' declared  
Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., chairman of the National Republican 
Congressional Committee. ``The rural areas are one of the backbones 
of our party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Countered Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., ``Their position is  
laughable. It's the Democrats in Congress that have led the fight 
for family farmers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear that Republicans are trying to market themselves as  
pro-farmer but the record shows they have turned their backs on 
rural America time and time again,'' said John Del Cecato, 
spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight stems from Democrats' decision to block the  
agriculture appropriations measure to push passage of a patients' 
bill of rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats say the delay isn't harming a spending bill set to  
take effect Oct. 1 and point out that conservative Republicans in 
the House delayed the bill before passage to argue for additional 
spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Republicans such as Rep. Jo Ann Emerson say the bill  
should be passed immediately so that House and Senate negotiators 
have time to make changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is critical that senators call off the dogs, quit playing  
politics,'' Emerson, R-Mo., said. ``There is so much stress in our 
farm communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Just when we're starting to make progress. . . we get undercut  
by our own colleagues from agricultural states in the United States 
Senate,'' said Rep. John Thune, R-S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, 31 Republican House members and the Republican  
Governors Association sent separate letters Tuesday to Senate 
Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota, encouraging him to 
push Democrats to pass the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are deeply concerned and frankly surprised by your tactics  
... your obstruction of this bill to promote your own political 
agenda,'' the Republican governors wrote. ``We urge you to abandon 
this careless tactic.''

	Clinton Outlines Medicare Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Urging the biggest expansion in Medicare's  
history, President Clinton proposed today that the government help 
older Americans pay for prescription drugs -- up to $1,000 a year 
initially in return for a $24 monthly charge. Under Clinton's plan, 
the maximum federal payment for drugs would climb to $2,500 by 2008 
as the monthly patient fee gradually rose to $44. GOP leaders 
questioned how the Clinton plan would be financed, whether it would 
fix Medicare's solvency problems and whether cost restrictions 
might hinder medical breakthroughs and drug innovations. Clinton 
said his plan would ensure the solvency of Medicare until 2027.

	Drug Stocks Soar on Medicare Plan  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pharmaceutical stocks soared today as Wall  
Street concluded President Clinton's plan to provide drug coverage 
to Medicare recipients will fail in Congress because it is too 
complex and vague. Although the proposal would increase sales of 
drugs, the drug industry is concerned it could lead to government 
price controls that slice profits. Analysts said the plan leaves 
too many questions unanswered -- much like Clinton's doomed 1994 
health reform plan. Drug stocks have lagged in the past few months 
partly because of concerns about a Medicare drug benefit.

	Protesters Demand Milosevic Resign

<P>
	CACAK, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serb discontent with President Slobodan  
Milosevic and his regime boiled over into a sprawling opposition 
rally Tuesday, as 10,000 chanting protesters demanded a new 
government. The rally in the central Serbian town of Cacak was 
organized by Yugoslavia's main pro-democracy coalition, the 
Alliance for Change. It was seen as a first test of whether 
Serbia's fragmented opposition can exploit discontent with 
Milosevic's rule to press for reforms. ``Resignation! 
Resignation!'' the crowd chanted. Discontent has grown throughout 
Serbia since Milosevic gave in to NATO demands and pulled Serb 
troops and police out of Kosovo.

	Virginia Trash Restrictions Blocked  
</P>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Two state laws to restrict the flow of  
out-of-state garbage into Virginia were blocked by a federal judge 
today after a trash-hauling company challenged their 
constitutionality. Virginia is the nation's second-leading trash 
importer with much of the garbage coming from New York City. The 
trash has generated revenue for some towns but led to complaints 
from Republican Gov. Jim Gilmore and other politicians that the 
state is becoming the nation's dumping ground. As a result, 
legislators passed two laws that would cap landfill growth and ban 
garbage barges from three Virginia rivers. The laws were supposed 
to take effect Thursday.

Telescope Makers maintains the hilltop observatory three miles from 
the proposed 350-bed state prison and is fighting the prison plan. 
In exchange for accepting the prison, Springfield would get about

<HEADLINE> Chinese Cos. Use Stock Market Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- Taking advantage of a record-setting  
stock market surge, two major Chinese state companies and a bank 
announced plans Tuesday to raise millions of dollars with new share 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices on China's two stock markets have soared by more than 50  
percent since mid-May. The rise has been driven largely by calls 
for higher prices by the government, which hopes to use the markets 
to finance economic reform. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcements indicate China is emerging from a drought in  
new share listings. More than 50 companies are awaiting permission 
to list shares, but had been delayed by a 2-year-old slump in share 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Wuhan Iron and Steel Co. said in a prospectus published in  
newspapers that it would raise $160 million, while Huabei 
Expressway Co. said it would raise $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
	State-owned Shanghai Pudong Development Bank said it was  
preparing for an initial public offering but didn't say how much it 
hoped to raise. If the issue is successful, it would be only the 
second time a Chinese bank has been allowed to sell shares to the 
public. All Chinese banks are state-owned. 
</P>
<P>
	Wuhan Iron, one of China's biggest steel makers, said it would  
invest its stock proceeds in new technology. Huabei Expressway, 
which manages highways and ports, said it would use its proceeds to 
buy into another highway-management firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares offered by both companies are meant only for Chinese  
investors. Foreign investors, barred from trading most Chinese 
stocks, are allowed to buy only special foreign-currency shares 
issued by a handful of companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Pudong Development Bank had planned a stock offering for more  
than a year, but that was postponed repeatedly because of low 
prices.

<HEADLINE> Cigarette Co. Ends Colombia Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Philip Morris announced Tuesday that it  
would stop shipping Marlboro cigarettes to Colombia, citing tariffs 
it called arbitrarily high. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colombian government, for its part, accused the tobacco  
giant of declaring a value for the popular cigarette brand 
one-fifth the value in the United States, the country of origin. 
</P>
<P>
	In a news release, Philip Morris Latin America Sales Corporation  
Sucursal Colombia said it could not import cigarettes from the 
United States while they continue to be subject to tariffs ``based 
on inflated values'' that Colombia's customs agency began imposing 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said its decision would not affect other products it  
sells in this Andean nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris said it had won 6 percent of the Colombian market  
since it began selling Marlboro cigarettes in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	It claimed the tariffs set by the customs agency, or DIAN, were  
both illegal in Colombia and violated the GATT international trade 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	DIAN spokesman Henry Guarin said Philip Morris had quietly  
suspended imports a month ago to protest DIAN's insistence on 
valuing a pack of Marlboro cigarettes at $1.27 while the company 
declared a value of 24 cents a pack. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the moment, they are negotiating that price with DIAN to  
see if they can reach a compromise,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Philip Morris spokewoman from the company's headquarters in  
New York said no negotiation was occurring, however, adding that 
the Colombian tariff is set by law. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the Colombian import price of 24 cents per pack, if you add  
operational costs, applicable duties and high excise taxes, this 
has positioned Marlboro at about 96 cents a pack, the most 
expensive cigarette in the Colombian market,'' said Elizabeth Cho. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the higher valuation DIAN would impose, the local Philip  
Morris company could not compete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Philip Morris halts the legal imports, however, Marlboro  
cigarettes are not apt to disappear from Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 70 percent of the Marlboro cigarettes sold in the  
country are contraband, said Guarin. 
</P>
<P>
	Importing contraband cigarettes, typically from the Caribbean  
island of Aruba, is a popular way for Colombian drug traffickers to 
launder money. 
</P>
<P>
	In a series of raids on June 10, Colombian authorities seized  
130,000 packs of contraband Marlboro, according to DIAN.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Raises Campaign Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Publisher Steve Forbes, who spent $37.5  
million of his own money for his first run for the White House, 
wants others to write most of the checks this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Through $1,000-a-plate dinners and ``Dear friend'' letters  
seeking as little as $25, the Republican presidential candidate is 
trying to build a network of contributors to prove his 2000 
campaign ``is bigger than one person'' -- and one person's money. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides say he's already raised $2.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's very important to demonstrate that people are willing to  
invest their time, their resources, their efforts to promote our 
efforts,'' Forbes said in a telephone interview. ``It gives 
credibility to the campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Early estimates from other campaigns indicate Forbes'  
second-quarter fund-raising is competitive with that of other 
Republican hopefuls, except for Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the 
runaway leader with more than $23 million raised so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, who raised only $4.2 million through his whole 1996  
campaign, hopes to collect a total $15 million to $20 million for 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign manager Bill Dal Col described the contributors as  
mostly ``conservative, new people who haven't been involved 
before'' in politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Appealing for donations is a way to build grass-roots support,  
analysts say. People who have invested money in a candidate's 
success are more likely to show up at party caucuses, vote in 
primaries and volunteer their time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the old idea of putting your money where your mouth is,''  
said Herbert Alexander, professor emeritus of political science at 
the University of Southern California. ``If somebody gives money, 
it's a little more of a commitment than just saying, 'I support 
you.''' 
</P>
<P>
	But State University of New York professor Alan Chartock still  
expects Forbes to pay for most of the campaign himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``The downside of asking for money is that he risks obviating  
the rich man syndrome, which holds that people who are rich don't 
owe anybody anything and don't have to steal to get it,'' Chartock 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides say Forbes remains willing to spend whatever is necessary  
from his own pocket. He launched his campaign with $695,000 of his 
own money and negligible fund raising through March. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having resources gives Steve a level playing field versus the  
career politicians,'' Dal Col said. ``They've had years to build up 
networks of contributors and public exposure at taxpayer expense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Forbes contributed $37.5 million of the $41.7 million  
his campaign cost. Forbes said he had to pay his own way that time 
because he started too late to set up an extensive fund-raising 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	As before, Forbes is not taking any federal matching funds for  
his campaign, meaning that he is not bound by the campaign spending 
limits that accompany them. Bush also is looking at whether he 
should forgo the matching funds so he does not have to limit his 
campaign spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes has tapped into a network of well-heeled friends. He  
raised $1 million at a New York City fund-raiser earlier this month 
in the Art Deco grand ballroom of the famed Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. 
Guests dined on bourbon chicken and apple crumb tart and watched 
red, white and blue confetti shoot out of air guns when Forbes 
ascended to the stage. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the millionaire is taking in small  
contributions through mass mailings to conservatives of more modest 
means. He coupled a fund-raising letter with a survey asking 
potential supporters whether change was being blocked by the 
``Clinton-Gore administration's culture of corruption'' or by 
``Republicans in Congress that are too willing to compromise their 
principles.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes Medicare Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Urging the biggest expansion in Medicare's  
history, President Clinton proposed on Tuesday that the government 
help older Americans pay for prescription drugs -- up to $1,000 a 
year initially in return for a $24 monthly patient charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a nation bursting with prosperity,'' Clinton said, ``no  
senior should have to choose between buying food and buying 
medicine, but we know that happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under Clinton's plan, the maximum federal payment for drugs  
would climb to $2,500 by the year 2008 as the monthly patient fee 
rose to $44 in gradual, annual steps. 
</P>
<P>
	The president announced his plan to an East Room audience of  
Democratic and Republican lawmakers, saying he was encouraged by 
the bipartisan turnout. But some Republicans hurried outside to 
raise objections. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., co-chairman of a bipartisan  
commission on Medicare, noted that no benefits would be available 
under Clinton's program until 2002. He also said there was ``a 
fundamental flaw'' because the plan failed to address the needs of 
seniors with huge drug bills. He said Republicans believe that 
``those who are in need should be helped first'' rather than ``a 
little bit of help for everyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While popular in the polls, the president's proposal faces an  
uncertain future as Republicans and Democrats argue about how to 
divide up massive budget surpluses and set the nation's priorities. 
Clinton's plan would be the largest expansion of Medicare since its 
creation 34 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if not enacted this year, Clinton's initiative will set the  
markers for a political brawl in next year's elections. It is a 
potent issue because Medicare touches the lives of 39 million 
Americans, and the elderly show up to vote. Democrats clobbered 
Republicans over Medicare in the 1996 campaign, prompting GOP 
presidential hopeful Bob Dole to complain, ``It's Medi-scare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To save costs, Clinton's plan would impose a new 20 percent  
co-payment for lab tests, which currently are free. Recipients also 
would pay a higher deductible for doctor's office visits and other 
outpatient treatment. The deductible -- currently $100 -- would be 
indexed to inflation, rising about $2 to $3 a year, according to 
administration estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	``The original Medicare law was written at a time when patients'  
lives were more often saved by scalpels than by pharmaceuticals,'' 
Clinton said. ``Many of the drugs we now routinely use to treat 
heart disease, cancer, arthritis, did not even exist in 1965, yet 
Medicare still does not cover prescription drugs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders questioned how the Clinton plan would be financed,  
whether it would fix Medicare's solvency problems and whether cost 
restrictions might hinder medical breakthroughs and drug 
innovations. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said 69 percent of  
seniors already have prescription coverage -- in benefits from 
former employers, from private insurance they buy or from HMOs that 
participate in Medicare. ``It's been the tradition in the 
president's party to do one-size-fits-all,'' Armey said. ``If you 
have 31 percent of people with a problem, you ought to put together 
a 31 per cent solution, not a 100 percent solution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint statement, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and  
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., pledged to seek ``a 
bipartisan solution to expand access to affordable prescription 
drugs.'' Lott expressed interest in providing prescription drugs to 
elderly Americans who ``are poor and cannot afford what they 
need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under Clinton's proposal, the government would pay half of a  
beneficiary's drug costs, from the first prescription filled each 
year, under an annual cap. The limit would be $2,000 beginning in 
2002, split between patients and the Treasury. The cap would grow 
to $5,000 by 2008, with the government paying up to $2,500 for 
drugs in return for patients fees of $528. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug coverage would be voluntary. The drug fee would be in  
addition to the regular Medicare charge -- currently $45.50 a month 
-- for doctor's office visits. However, beneficiaries with annual 
incomes below $11,000 for individuals and $17,000 for couples would 
pay no premium or cost-sharing for drug coverage up to the annual 
cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's plan was advertised as a way to achieve seemingly  
contradictory goals: to expand Medicare to include prescription 
drugs while cutting long-term costs of Medicare and ensuring its 
solvency. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration claimed it would squeeze out $72 billion in  
savings by making Medicare more competitive and efficient and 
curbing payments to health care providers, including hospitals. 
They already have tightened their belts under Medicare savings 
enacted in 1993 and again in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``A significant majority of the savings would be coming from  
hospitals, primarily because hospitals make up 65 percent of the 
Medicare costs anyway,'' said Chris Jennings, a presidential 
adviser on health policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said his plan would ensure the solvency of the Medicare  
trust fund until at least 2027. He proposes dedicating $794 billion 
of expected surpluses to Medicare over 15 years. Of that amount, 
$45.5 billion would be used to pay for the prescription drug 
benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the administration says it would use $64.5 billion  
from savings and $8 billion from cost-sharing changes to pay for 
the drug program.

<HEADLINE> Veterans Affairs Nominee Withdraws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dr. Kenneth Kizer withdrew his name from  
consideration Tuesday for a second term as head of the Veterans 
Affairs hospitals, bowing to pressure from senators of both parties 
because of system cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Kizer, who had been renominated for four more years after his  
current term expires Wednesday, stepped aside ``for personal 
reasons and family matters,'' said his spokeswoman Laurie Tranter. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators of both parties harbored misgivings about Kizer's  
renomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Most recently, Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., placed a hold on the  
renomination because of cutbacks at veterans' hospitals in 
Massachusetts. He was joined in the objection by Massachusetts' 
all-Democratic House delegation, who have complained for months 
about VA cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side of the aisle, Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,  
R-Colo., said he was dissatisfied with Kizer's answers to questions 
about the future of VA facilities at Fort Lyon in Pueblo, Colo. 
Campbell said he relayed the questions from veterans he met at a 
town hall meeting in March. 
</P>
<P>
	In a June 9 letter, Campbell called Kizer's answers ``evasive  
and cursory'' and in conflict with other information he had 
received from Fort Lyon officials.

<HEADLINE> Hawks Trade Blaylock to Warriors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Mookie Blaylock, who ran the Atlanta offense for  
seven years, was traded to the Golden State Warriors in a 
three-player deal Tuesday night that allowed the Hawks to move up 
to the 10th position in the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks sent Blaylock and one of their four first-round picks,  
No. 21 overall, to the Warriors for the higher pick as well as 
guard Bimbo Coles and forward Duane Ferrell. 
</P>
<P>
	The aging Hawks are revamping their team after being swept out  
of the playoffs in the second round by the younger, quicker New 
York Knicks. They looked to move Blaylock, a two-time member of the 
NBA's all-defensive team who took most of the blame for Atlanta's 
stagnant offense this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Blaylock was caught off guard.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was very shocking, especially when you're with a team that  
long and you think you're one of the guys that's going to be around 
and you're going to end your career there,'' he said. ``But that's 
part of the business. I know that's how it goes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By trading Blaylock, the Hawks might be able to take advantage  
of a draft deep in point guards. Maryland's Steve Francis and 
UCLA's Baron Davis are expected to go in the top five Wednesday 
night, but the Hawks might have a chance at Utah's Andre Miller, 
Arizona's Jason Terry or Duke's William Avery. 
</P>
<P>
	``This gives us an opportunity to move up significantly to a  
part of the draft where we feel we can get a high-quality player,'' 
general manager Pete Babcock said during a hastily called news 
conference. ``The top 10 was what we were trying to get. We got to 
the fringe of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blaylock had been an integral part of the Hawks since he was  
acquired from New Jersey in 1992 for Rumeal Robinson. He led the 
league in steals in 1996-97 and 1997-98, joining Alvin Robertson 
and Magic Johnson as the only players to pull off that feat in 
consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Blaylock took a step back this year after the  
lockout ended, shooting only 37.9 percent from the field and 
averaging just 5.8 assists per game. Both figures were the worst 
since his rookie season with the Nets in 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
	The Warriors tried to move up in the draft, hoping to land one  
of the point guards, then traded down when it became apparent they 
couldn't work a deal, general manager Garry St. Jean said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think we exhausted just about every avenue out there to  
move up,'' St. Jean said. ``Even if we were able to move up, we 
felt we would have to wait a while for a guy to develop there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the point guard, Blaylock took much of the blame for a Hawks  
offense that averaged 86.3 points per game, beating only the woeful 
Chicago Bulls. More telling, they averaged less than 16 assists per 
game, by far the lowest figure in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Jean wasn't bothered by those numbers. Blaylock has three  
years left on a contract that will pay him $4.2 million next 
season, $4.8 million in 2000-01 and $5.4 million in 2001-02. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of the best point guards in the league, a very  
dependable point guard, a guy who has been involved in a lot of 
winning,'' the general manager said. ``This guy has plenty left and 
can still play at a pretty high level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks thanked Blaylock for his contributions over the past  
seven years, saying he shouldn't be remembered for one poor season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not totally his fault,'' Hawks coach Lenny Wilkens  
said. ``This could be a whole new lease on life for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, 31, averaged 9.5 points and 4.6 assists for the Warriors,  
starting 32 of 48 games. The Hawks have another veteran point guard 
in Anthony Johnson, but the strength of that position on draft 
night provides a chance to land someone with more long-term 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other promising players are Chris Herren of Fresno  
State and Vonteego Cummings of Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrell played in only eight games last season because of  
tendinitis in his left knee. The 34-year-old forward played at 
Georgia Tech and spent his first six NBA seasons with the Hawks, 
averaging a career-high 12.7 points in 1991-92. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past two seasons, however, he has managed just 1.7  
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles will make about $2.3 million in the final year of his  
contract, while Ferrell is set to make about $1.6 million next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks still have four first-round picks, which makes it a  
near-certainty they will work out another deal before the draft. 
However, team president Stan Kasten said it was unlikely the team 
would be able to move higher than No. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	If nothing else, Atlanta will probably trade away one or two  
picks to avoid a glut of young players requiring guaranteed 
three-year contracts next season.

<HEADLINE>  Honduran Boy Makes 37-Day Trek </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- His mother, brother and grandfather washed away  
by last year's devastating Honduran mudslides, 13-year-old Edwin 
Daniel Sabillion pined for his father, somewhere in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	When Edwin wrote to the man -- whom he's known only from  
snapshots -- his father sent him $200 and told the boy to meet him 
on a street ramp to LaGuardia International Airport on either June 
25, 26 or 27. 
</P>
<P>
	His father said he'd be wearing a white shirt.  
</P>
<P>
	And so Edwin came. For 37 days, he hitchhiked, rode buses and  
sometimes just walked -- all the way from Honduras to Mexico, then 
Texas, Florida and finally New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities were alerted to the teen-ager's odyssey on Sunday,  
when he and a concerned cab driver couldn't locate the father at 
LaGuardia. 
</P>
<P>
	For much of Monday, Edwin remained at a police precinct in the  
Bronx borough, where officers took a liking to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He ate McDonald's and had some Carvel ice cream cake,'' said  
New York Police Capt. Thomas Kelly. ``The cab driver bought him 
some in-line skates, and we got him additional clothes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It seemed the beginning of the end to a truly epic journey, one  
whose roots are firm in tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwin's mother, Angela Enamorado, his 14-year-old brother,  
Alexander, and his grandfather were among the more than 6,000 
Hondurans killed when Hurricane Mitch pummeled Central America late 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	After their deaths in the mudslide that ravaged their village of  
Colonia San Miguel, police said Edwin stayed with friends in the 
nearby village of San Francisco de Yojoa Cortez. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 22, he began his quest. He made his way north through  
Guatemala and Mexico's east coast, entering Texas near Brownsville 
and moving up to Houston before continuing east to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Thinking himself very near New York when he arrived in Miami on  
Saturday, Edwin stopped at a Latin cafeteria for some final help. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came in with a $5 bill and asked for change so he could  
take the bus,'' said Emilio Jose Jimenez, a regular patron who was 
among those who chipped in to buy Edwin a $109 one-way bus ticket 
to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he hadn't slept or eaten much,'' Jimenez said. The boy  
had lost his wallet and his dad's phone number, but ``he was happy 
because he was going to be with his father,'' Jimenez said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Edwin arrived at a bus terminal in upper Manhattan,  
flagged down a livery cab and headed for LaGuardia. 
</P>
<P>
	``They went to a couple of different locations at the airport,  
and the cabbie becomes concerned,'' said the NYPD's Kelly. ``That's 
where we come in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edwin, who does not speak English, has been placed in the care  
of city child care services until his father is found. Mayor 
Rudolph Giuliani has promised help. And police, while not 
commenting directly on the father's immigration status, say it will 
not be an issue in reuniting the pair. 
</P>
<P>
	They've asked the man -- whom they identify as Grevi Sabillion  
Vasquez -- to come forward. Police believe he lives in the nearby 
borough of Queens. 
</P>
<P>
	That means Edwin Sabillion and his father are now just a few  
miles apart.

<HEADLINE> H&AMP;R Block Acquires Accounting Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- H&AMP;R Block Inc. has agreed to buy the  
nation's seventh-largest accounting firm in a deal analysts say 
pushes the company best known for tax preparation closer to 
becoming an elite national financial services firm for midsize 
business clients. 
</P>
<P>
	The $240 million deal for McGladrey &AMP; Pullen LLP of Minneapolis,  
announced Tuesday, makes H&AMP;R Block the sixth-largest accounting 
firm in terms of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the latest purchase by the Kansas City-based company, which  
along with rivals Century Business Services Inc. and American 
Express Co., has been on a buying spree for private accounting 
firms. The three have acquired about 80 privately held firms since 
1997 as they attempt to expand their business services, which range 
from tax preparation to consulting. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the gap between the three rivals and the Big 5  
accounting firms remains considerable, said analyst Alexander Paris 
Jr. of Barrington Research in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Paris said H&AMP;R Block, with annual revenue of $1.6 billion,  
cannot match the strength of multibillion-dollar firms such as 
Andersen Worldwide and PricewaterhouseCoopers, which had more than 
$10 billion in revenue in 1998 -- but that's not the point. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they want to do is build a broad-based financial  
consulting company with these acquisitions, and this is a big step 
in that direction,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Scally, chairman of McGladrey, said he was less interested  
in competing for the business of large, global companies than in 
serving, for example, a manufacturer with sales of $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're together going to build is the leading national  
firm focused on the midsized market,'' he said. ``Our feeling is 
that this is going to be a very unique firm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Including McGladrey &AMP; Pullen, H&AMP;R Block has acquired eight  
accounting firms since May 1998. The other seven previously 
operated under H&AMP;R Block's HRB Business Services division but will 
now be integrated with McGladrey into a unified group known as RSM 
McGladrey Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	RSM McGladrey will be a national accounting, tax and consulting  
practice that will share a single client service philosophy and 
have about 4,000 employees in more than 70 offices nationwide, the 
company said. H&AMP;R Block's individual tax return business will 
remain separate. 
</P>
<P>
	Salomon Smith Barney analyst Michael Millman said putting the  
accounting firms under the H&AMP;R Block umbrella should help attract 
new clients and retain those already using the company's tax 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people know the Block brand. I think it will make it  
easier to generate more business for people that didn't realize 
that they could get their services in the accounting and CPA 
area,'' Millman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Minneapolis-based McGladrey &AMP; Pullen, serving midsized companies  
and tax exempt organizations, reported 1998 revenue of $300 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	H&AMP;R Block is the nation's largest tax-preparation business with  
about 8,880 offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of H&AMP;R Block fell 31 1/4 cents to $49.31 1/4 in trading on the  
New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> World Cup Surpasses Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The early success of the Women's World Cup has caught even its  
chief organizer off guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Marla Messing, president of the organizing committee for the  
three-week tournament, said Tuesday the tournament already 
surpassed many of her expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have always believed in the potential of this tournament to  
be very successful, a breakthrough event for women's sports,'' 
Messing said during a conference call. ``But we are frankly in awe 
of what has happened so far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What has happened so far is:  
</P>
<P>
	--More than 570,000 tickets sold for the tournament.  
</P>
<P>
	--An average of 65,000 fans at each of the three U.S. games.  
</P>
<P>
	--Average attendance at doubleheaders not involving the U.S. team  
of more than 21,000, more than 11 of what the 30 major league 
baseball teams currently average. 
</P>
<P>
	--Strong television ratings, particularly on ESPN and ESPN2.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a demonstration that the tournament as a whole is  
being embraced by the fans, not just the U.S. team,'' Messing said. 
She called attendance at the non-U.S. games ``our greatest 
achievement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overall ticket sales are at 570,000, far beyond early  
projections, and Messing said 600,000 is a possibility if the 
American team advances further. On Tuesday, organizers made 
available nearly 14,000 more seats at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium in 
Landover, Md., for Thursday's quarterfinals. The United States 
plays Germany and Brazil faces Nigeria in that doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally, the stadium was downsized to 41,000 seats. But  
ticket demand has exceeded that figure after the U.S. team clinched 
a spot in the quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the other venues, Wednesday's quarterfinals -- Norway vs.  
Sweden and Russia vs. China -- has sold 18,000 seats in San Jose, 
Calif. Sunday's semifinal at Foxboro, Mass., has sold 22,000. The 
semifinal at Stanford, Calif., where the Americans would play if 
they advance, has sold more than 40,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The final at the Rose Bowl on July 10 has sold more than 60,000.  
Capacity is 86,773 for soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN's audience for last Thursday's U.S.-Nigeria game drew a  
1.85 rating, the second-highest soccer match on the network, behind 
the men's World Cup semifinal last year between Brazil and the 
Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Sunday's U.S.-North Korea game on ESPN2 got a 1.96 rating,  
the highest for any soccer match on ESPN2 and the fifth 
most-watched event on the network. 
</P>
<P>
	Messing was asked about complaints made by the Russians and  
Chinese concerning travel. Should China make the final, it will 
have traversed the continent four times. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult to put on a World Cup in the U.S. because the  
country so big, with the (four) different time zones,'' she said. 
``We did the schedule before we knew where any team would fall in 
the draw'' except for the United States. ``FIFA gave us some 
guidelines. We met those. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reality of hosting the World Cup in the United States is  
the travel will be so much more.''

<HEADLINE> Man Killed by Ostrich at Farm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINLOCK, Wash. (AP) -- The owner of an exotic animal farm says  
she will not get rid of an ostrich just because it killed her 
father. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred W. Parker, an 81-year-old man with heart trouble, was found  
dead Sunday night in the pen of 400-pound King Tut. Parker suffered 
a fractured neck, and a coroner concluded his bad heart probably 
contributed to the death. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker's daughter said she did not understand why her father,  
who had been left alone over the weekend to feed the ostriches, 
emus, llamas and potbellied pigs on her exotic animal farm, was in 
the pen. 
</P>
<P>
	But she did not blame the ostrich.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have no intentions right now of destroying my ostrich  
because of my father's death,'' Linda Carter said. ``The ostrich 
was protecting his domain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just like any wild animal,'' she said. ``You don't go in  
a bear's pen; you don't go in an ostrich's pen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case has been referred to the prosecutor's office.  
</P>
<P>
	Chief Criminal Deputy Joe Doench said mating season for  
ostriches and males become very aggressive this time of year. Last 
year, King Tut kicked Carter 10 1/2 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter said she has been raising ostriches for more than two  
years and they have been profitable. Ostrich meat sells for $9 a 
pound, she said. Leather hides sell for $500 each and the eyes can 
be sold in Japan for $250 a head. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year, my business has just boomed,'' Carter said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Statements on Medicare / Presidential Speech  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of President Clinton's statements about Medicare on  
Tuesday, as transcribed by the Federal Document Clearing House: 
</P>
<P>
	Thank you very much, and good afternoon. I would like to welcome  
all of you to the White House. I appreciate the presence here of 
Secretary Shalala, Secretary Rubin, Deputy Secretary Summers, 
Social Security Commissioner Apfel, OPM Director Janice Lachance. 
</P>
<P>
	I thank all the people on the White House staff who are here who  
worked so hard on this proposal, including our OMB Director Jack 
Lew and Gene Sperling, Bruce Reed, Chris Jennings, and of course 
John Podesta. 
</P>
<P>
	I welcome the leaders of groups representing seniors, the  
disability community and the health care industry. 
</P>
<P>
	I would especially like to welcome the very large delegation of  
members of Congress who are here today. Four of them were here at 
the inception of Medicare: Sen. Kennedy, Congressman Dingell, 
Congresswoman Mink and Congressman Conyers. This must be a 
particularly happy day for them. 
</P>
<P>
	I thank the senators who are here. Sen. Daschle, Sen. Roth, Sen.  
Kennedy, Sen. Conrad, Sen. Baucus, Sen. Dorgan, Sen. Rockefeller 
and Sen. Breaux. 
</P>
<P>
	I thank the members of the House here. There are a large number  
of Democrats here, and I think virtually all the members of the 
leadership: Mr. Gephardt, Mr. Bonior, Congresswoman DeLauro, Mr. 
Frost, Congressman Rangel, Congressman Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	I would like to thank the Republican House members who have  
come: Mr. McCrery, Mr. Whitfield, and Mr. Thomas, especially. 
</P>
<P>
	When Sen. Breaux and Congressman Thomas issued their commission  
report, I said that I would do my best to build on it, that I had 
some concerns about it, but that I thought that there were elements 
in it which deserved support and serious consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	Their presence here today indicates that we can all raise  
concerns about each other's ideas without raising our voices. 
</P>
<P>
	And that if we're really committed to putting our people first,  
we can reach across party lines and other lines to work together. 
</P>
<P>
	And I am very grateful for their presence here and for the  
presence of all the members of Congress here from both parties. It 
augurs well for this announcement today and for the welfare of our 
republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Thank you.  
</P>
<P>
	In just a few days, we will celebrate the last Fourth of July of  
the 20th century -- 223 of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Our government, our country was created based on the ideal that  
we are all created equal; that we should work together to do those 
things that we cannot do on our own; and that we would have a 
permanent mission to form a more perfect union. 
</P>
<P>
	The people who got us started understood that each generation of  
Americans would be called upon to fortify and renew our nation's 
most fundamental commitments -- to always look to the future. 
</P>
<P>
	I believe our generation has begun to meet that sacred duty for  
at the dawn of a new century America is clearly a nation in 
renewal. Our economy is the strongest in decades, perhaps in our 
history. Our nation is the world's leading force for freedom and 
human rights, for peace and security, with our armed forces showing 
once again in Kosovo their skill, their strength and their courage. 
</P>
<P>
	Our social fabric, so recently strained, is on the mend with  
declining rates of welfare, crime, teen pregnancy and drug abuse, 
and 90 percent of our children immunized against serious childhood 
diseases for the first time in our history. 
</P>
<P>
	Our cities once in decline are again vibrant with economic and  
culture life. Even our rutted and congested interstate highways, 
thanks to the commitments of this Congress, are being radically 
repaired and expanded all across America -- I must say probably to 
the exasperation of some of our summer travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	This renewal is basically the consequence of the hard work of  
tens of millions of our fellow citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	It is also, however, clearly the result of new ideas and good  
decisions made here in this city, beginning with the fiscal 
discipline pursued since 1993 -- the reduction in the size of 
government and controlling spending while dramatically increasing 
investments in education, health care, biomedical research, the 
environment and other critical areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The vast budget deficits have been transformed into growing  
budget surpluses, and America is better prepared for the new 
century. But we have to use this same approach of fiscal discipline 
plus greater investment to deal with the great challenge that we 
and all other advance societies face: The aging of our nation. And 
in particular to deal with the challenge of Medicare, to strengthen 
and renew it. 
</P>
<P>
	Today I asked you here so that I could announce the details of  
our plan to secure and modernize Medicare for the 21st century. My 
plan will use competition and the best private sector practices to 
secure Medicare in order to control costs and improve quality, and 
it will devote a significant portion of the budget surplus to keep 
Medicare solvent. 
</P>
<P>
	But securing Medicare is not enough. To modernize Medicare, my  
plan will also create a much better match between the benefits of 
modern science and the benefits offered by Medicare. It will 
provide for more preventive care and help our seniors afford 
prescription drugs. The plan is credible, sensible and fiscally 
responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	It will secure the health of Medicare while improving the health  
of our seniors, and we can achieve it. The stakes are high. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 34 years since it was created, Medicare has eased the  
suffering and extended the lives of tens of millions of older and 
disabled Americans. It has given young families the peace of mind 
of knowing they will not have to mortgage their homes or their 
children's futures to pay for the health care of their parents and 
grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
	It has become so much a part of America, it is almost impossible  
to imagine America life without it. Yet life without Medicare is 
what we actually could get unless we act soon to strengthen this 
vital program. 
</P>
<P>
	With Americans living longer, the number of Medicare  
beneficiaries is growing faster, much faster, than the number of 
workers paying into the system. By the year 2015, the Medicare 
trust fund will be insolvent, just as the baby boom generation 
begins to retire and enter the system and eventually doubling the 
number of Americans who are over 65. 
</P>
<P>
	I've often said that this is a high class problem. It is the  
result of something wonderful -- the fact that we Americans are 
living a lot longer. All Americans are living longer, in no small 
measure because of better health care, much of it received through 
the Medicare program. 
</P>
<P>
	President Johnson said when he signed the Medicare bill in 1965:  
The benefits of this law are as varied and broad as the marbles of 
modern medicine itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet modern medicine has changed tremendously since 1965, while  
Medicare has not fully kept pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The original Medicare law was written at a time when patients'  
lives were more often saved by scalpels than by pharmaceuticals. 
Many of the drugs we now routinely use to treat heart disease, 
cancer, arthritis, did not even exist in 1965, yet Medicare still 
does not cover prescription drugs. Many of the procedures we now 
have to detect diseases early or prevent them from occurring in the 
first place did not exist in 1965. Yet Medicare has not fully 
adapted itself to these new procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the systems and organizations that the private sector  
uses to deliver services contain costs and improve quality, such as 
preferred provider organizations and pharmacy benefit managers, did 
not exist in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet under current law, Medicare cannot make the best use of  
these private sector innovations. Over the last six and a half 
years, we have taken important steps to improve Medicare. When I 
took office, Medicare was scheduled to go broke this year. But we 
took tough actions to contain costs, first in '93 and then with a 
bipartisan balanced budget agreement in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	We have fought hard against waste, fraud and abuse in the  
system, saving tens of billions of dollars. These measures have 
helped to extend the life of the trust fund to 2015. But with the 
elderly population set to double in three decades, with the pace of 
medical science quickening, we must do more to fully secure and 
modernize Medicare for the 21st century. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan I release today secures the fiscal health of Medicare,  
first by providing what every objective expert has said Medicare 
must have if it is to survive: more resources to shore up its 
solvency. 
</P>
<P>
	As I promised in the state of the union address, the plan  
devotes 15 percent of the federal budget over 15 years to Medicare 
-- the federal budget surplus. That is the right way to use this 
portion of the surplus. There are a thousand ways to spend the 
surplus, all of them arguably attractive. But none more important 
than first guaranteeing our existing obligation to secure quality 
health care for our seniors. First things first. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to these new resources, we must use the most modern  
and innovative means to keep Medicare spending in line, while 
rigorously maintaining, indeed improving, quality. 
</P>
<P>
	So the second part of the plan will bring to the traditional  
Medicare program the best practices from the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, doctors who do a superior job of caring for heart  
patients with complex medical conditions will be able to offer 
patients lower co-payments, thus attracting more patients, 
improving more lives, saving their patients and the system money. 
</P>
<P>
	Third, the plan will use the forces of competition to keep costs  
in line by empowering seniors with more and better choices. Seniors 
can choose to save money by choosing lower cost Medicare managed 
care plans under our plan without being forced out of the 
traditional Medicare program by larger than normal premium 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
	And we will make it easier for seniors to shop for coverage  
based on price and quality, because all private plans that choose 
to participate in Medicare will have to offer the same core 
benefits. Consumers shouldn't be forced to compare apples and 
oranges when shopping for their family's health care. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth, we will take action to make sure that Medicare costs do  
not shoot up after 2003 when most of the cost containment measures 
put in place in 1997 are set to expire. And to make sure that 
health care quality does not suffer, my plans includes, among other 
things, a quality assurance fund to be used if cost containment 
measures threaten to erode quality. 
</P>
<P>
	Given the debates we're having now on the consequences of the  
decisions we made in 1997, I think that is a very important thing 
to put in this plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Thank you.  
</P>
<P>
	These steps will secure Medicare for a generation, but we should  
also modernize benefits as well. Over the years, as I said earlier, 
medical care has advanced in ways that Medicare has not. 
</P>
<P>
	We have a duty to see that Medicare offers seniors the best and  
the wisest health care available. Once such rapidly advancing area 
of treatment is preventive screening for cancer, diabetes, 
osteoporosis and other conditions; screenings which if done in time 
can save lives, improve the quality of life and cut health care 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Therefore, my plan will eliminate the deductible and all  
co-payments for all preventive care under Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	It makes no sense for Medicare to put up roadblocks to these  
screenings and then turn around and pick up the hospital bills that 
screenings might have avoided. 
</P>
<P>
	No seniors should ever have to hesitate, as many do today, to  
get the preventive care they need. 
</P>
<P>
	To help cover the cost of these and other crucial benefits and  
strengthen the Medicare part B program, we will ask beneficiaries 
to pay a small part of the cost of other lab tests that are prone 
to overuse, and we will index the part B deductible to inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody would devise a Medicare program today if we were starting  
all over without including a prescription drug benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	There is -- there's a good reason for this.  
</P>
<P>
	We all know that these prescription drugs both save lives and  
improve the quality of life. Yet Medicare currently lacks a drug 
benefit. That is a major problem for millions and millions of 
seniors, and not just those with low incomes. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 15 million Medicare beneficiaries who lack prescription  
drug benefits today, nearly half are middle class Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	And with prescription drug prices rising, fewer and fewer  
retirees are getting drug coverage their former employers' health 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	My plan will offer an affordable prescription drug benefit to  
all Medicare recipients with additional help to those with lower 
incomes paid for largely through the cost savings I have outlined. 
</P>
<P>
	It will cover half of all prescription drug costs up to $5,000 a  
year when fully phased in with no deductible, all for a modest 
premium that will less than -- that will be less than half the price 
of the average private Medigap policy. It's simple. If you choose 
to pay a modest premium, Medicare will pay half of your drug 
prescription costs up to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	This is a drug benefit our seniors can afford at a price America  
can afford. 
</P>
<P>
	Seniors and the disabled will save even more on their  
prescription drugs under my plan because Medicare's private 
contractors will get volume discounts that they could never get on 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
	By relying on private sector managers, I believe that my plan  
will help Medicare beneficiaries and ensure that America continues 
to have the most innovative, research-and-development-oriented 
pharmaceutical industry in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	With the steps I have outlined today, we can make a real  
difference in our people's lives. And I believe the good fortune we 
now enjoy obliges us to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	In a nation bursting with prosperity, no senior should have to  
choose between buying food and buying medicine, but we know that 
happens. 
</P>
<P>
	I'll never forget the first time I ever met two seniors on  
Medicare who looked at me and told me that they were choosing every 
day between food and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	That was almost seven years ago, but it still happens today.  
</P>
<P>
	At a time of soaring surpluses, no seniors should wind up in the  
hospital for skimping on their medication to save money -- but that 
also happens today in 1999. At a moment of such tremendous promise 
for America, no middle aged couple should have to worry that 
Medicare will not be there when they retire; that a lifetime's 
worth of investment and savings could be swallowed up by medical 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
	If we want a secure life for our people, we must commit  
ourselves as a country to secure and modernize Medicare and to do 
it now. In the months before the election season begins, we can put 
partisanship aside and make this a season of progress. With our 
economy strong, our people confident, our budget in surplus, I say 
again we have not just the opportunity, but a solemn responsibility 
to fortify and renew Medicare for the 21st century. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the right thing to do for our parents and our grandparents.  
It's the right thing to do for the children of this country. It is 
the right thing to do so that when we need it the burden of our 
health care cost does not fall on the children and hurt their 
ability to raise our grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Like every generation of Americans before us, our generation has  
begun to fulfill our historic obligation to strength our 
fundamental commitments and keep America a nation of permanent 
renewal. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a few days before our last Independence Day of this  
century, let us commit again to do that with Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Thank you and God bless you.

<HEADLINE> Baerga Finally Joins Padres </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Thirteen years after signing with the San Diego  
Padres, Carlos Baerga finally pulled on one of their uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-time AL All-Star, who had to scrounge around for a job  
in baseball earlier this year, got another chance in the majors 
when the Padres purchased his contract from Triple-A Las Vegas on 
Tuesday. He takes the roster spot of infielder David Newhan, who 
was optioned to the Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``You always want to play with the team that signed you,'' said  
Baerga, who joined the Padres the day after they extended their 
winning streak to 10, longest in the majors this season. ``To pull 
on the Padres uniform today is going to be a dream come true for 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga was signed by the Padres as a non-drafted free agent out  
of Puerto Rico in 1986, but never made it to the parent club. He 
was traded to Cleveland with catcher Sandy Alomar and outfielder 
Chris James for outfielder Joe Carter on Dec. 6, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	After hitting .275 with 74 RBIs at Las Vegas in 1989, Baerga  
felt he was close to joining the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	``But Jack McKeon didn't want to bring me up because I was just  
19 years old,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he was among a number of future stars let go by the  
Padres in the late '80s and early '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the best thing that happened,'' Baerga said. ``When I  
got traded, I got the chance to go to the Indians and it was super. 
The years I was there, I got to go to the World Series and the 
All-Star Game. That's what every player dreams about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga returned to San Diego in 1992 when he made the All-Star  
team for the first time. Also in that game were onetime Padres John 
Kruk and Sandy and Roberto Alomar. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always think about that, man, `If we keep this thing  
together, it should be a team of the decade,' '' Baerga said. ``So 
many good players (were) let go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although his game has been in decline, the Padres think the  
30-year-old Baerga has something left. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Cardinals waived him in spring training because he  
was overweight, and he signed a nonguaranteed minor league deal 
with the Cincinnati Reds, who are managed by McKeon. 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga had been playing for the Reds' Triple-A club when he  
asked to be released in early June in order to sign a minor league 
deal with the Padres. The Reds had considered bringing him up, but 
bypassed him to promote other players. 
</P>
<P>
	Padres general manager Kevin Towers said Baerga has lost 25  
pounds since spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe this environment will be good for him,'' said Towers,  
who scouted Baerga in Las Vegas last week. ``He's in a place where 
he started his career. That's got to be a good feeling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every other place and trades he's been in, expectations were  
huge. We're just looking for him to be a piece of the puzzle 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga was traded from the Indians to the New York Mets on July  
29, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga will give the Padres another versatile player. He can  
play third, second or first base. The switch-hitter batted .286 
with two homers and nine RBI in 21 games at Las Vegas this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been playing hard and it seems like he's got a lot of  
enthusiasm,'' Towers said. ``He's ready to contribute. I think he's 
ready to make a statement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Padres third baseman George Arias, who missed 24 of the first 27  
games due to a thumb injury, has struggled at the plate. He was 
hitting .224 going into Tuesday night's game against Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Newhan hit .176 (3-for-17) with one RBI in 14 games during his  
first big league stint, earning a promotion when shortstop Chris 
Gomez went on the disabled list on June 4.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Confidence at High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Consumer confidence rose in June to its highest  
level in more than 30 years, signaling even stronger economic 
growth ahead, the Conference Board reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures were released as Federal Reserve policy-makers were  
beginning a two-day meeting in Washington, where they were widely 
expected to boost interest rates in a bid to cool off the economy 
and prevent inflation from rekindling. 
</P>
<P>
	Mortgage rates already have been rising for two months, and that  
apparently has begun putting a damper on home sales. The Commerce 
Department reported today that sales of new homes fell 5.1 percent 
in May -- double what analysts had been expecting. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 888,000 units  
in May, down from an April sales pace of 936,000 units, the 
department said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rise in the consumer confidence index to 138.4 in June from  
a revised 137.7 in May was the eighth consecutive monthly increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynn Franco, associate director of the Conference Board's  
Consumer Research Center, said the report indicates that ``current 
confidence levels point to even stronger economic growth next year 
than previously projected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She added: ``The key ingredient is the labor market. That  
remains extremely strong, and that gives consumers confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Thayer, chief economist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St.  
Louis, noted that most analysts expect the Fed to raise rates at 
this week's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Historically, the Fed's job is to take the punch bowl away  
from the party,'' Thayer said. A rise in rates ``could cause 
(consumer) expectations to cool off a bit,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets showed little reaction to this morning's  
figures, but stocks staged an afternoon rally as traders awaited 
the Fed's announcement Wednesday. The Dow Jones industrial average 
surged 160.20 points, or by 1.5 percent, to close at 10,815.35. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer sentiment is an important economic indicator because  
consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's overall 
economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report released Monday, the Commerce Department said that  
consumer spending outpaced income in May, sending the nation's 
savings rate to an all-time low. 
</P>
<P>
	Such strong spending has been the major factor pushing U.S.  
economic growth. But the Fed has begun to worry that tight labor 
markets will soon increase wage pressures and lead to higher 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board said that June's reading was the highest  
since the all-time record for the index of 142.3 set in October 
1968. 
</P>
<P>
	The June figures was well above analysts' average expectations  
of a reading of 136.1 for the index. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest report from the business-financed research group also  
indicated that consumers were optimistic about the future. 
</P>
<P>
	A companion gauge indicating expectations over the next six  
months rose in June to 114.9 from a revised 111.3 in May, the 
report said. The June reading was the highest since 116.2 in June 
1998, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there was some slippage in consumers' confidence about  
business conditions. Just slightly more than 40 percent termed them 
good in June, down from 44.3 percent in May. Some 9.6 percent of 
those surveyed rated them ``bad'' in June, up from 8.3 percent the 
month before. 
</P>
<P>
	Optimism about job opportunities also weakened, with 41.8  
percent saying jobs were not so plentiful in June, up from 39.9 
percent in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer confidence index, started in 1967, is compiled from  
responses to questions sent to 5,000 households nationwide. The 
survey polls consumers on matters ranging from job prospects to 
buying plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The index compares results to its base year, 1985, when it stood  
at 100.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft, Intel Target Big Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Facing increased competition, the heads  
of the largest personal computer software company and the biggest 
chip making firm are reasserting their commitment to be the 
technology that fuels global big business. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft Corp. CEO Bill Gates and Intel Corp. CEO Craig Barret  
planned to outline their joint commitment to leadership and 
innovation in the global workstation market today at the annual 
Workstation Leadership Forum in Burlingame, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft in recent months has had to respond to challenges to  
its dominance by the upstart Linux operating system, a software 
supported both financially and technically by Intel. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a bit like U.S. and French relations,'' said Drew  
Peck, a technology analyst at SG Cowen Securities in Boston, Mass. 
``''They want to generate a public image of camaraderie when 
obviously the friction is getting ever more intense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Erbschloe, vice president of research at Computer  
Economics in Carlsbad, Calif., said the announcements seem like an 
effort to convince consumers and analysts that ``neither one of 
these companies are going to jump ahead of each other, 
product-wise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They are trying not just to reiterate what they've said in the  
past, but to show that they are still strong and committed,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Erbschloe said the growing popularity of Linux, a well-regarded  
version of the Unix operating system used by businesses to run 
computer networks and Internet sites, is shaking up Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel has endorsed Linux, buying a multimillion-dollar stake in  
VA Research, a Mountain View, Calif.-based maker of business 
computers that run on Linux, earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel's workstation products division general manager, Anand  
Chandrasekher, said Tuesday that Intel's continued commitment to 
Microsoft doesn't undermine Intel's relationship with Linux users. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our task is to enable all operating systems to work best on  
Intel architecture,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies plan to unveil some of they ways their teamwork --  
Microsoft's software and Intel's chips -- is helping businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Robert Mondavi Winery is using their systems to  
make digital maps and analyze data about where in their orchards to 
plant what types of vines. And Sony Pictures Imageworks is using 
the combined technologies for their new digitally animated movie 
``Stuart Little,'' based on the classic E.B. White book. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint announcement comes at a time when both companies are  
struggling to get products out. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel's Merced chip is now promised for mid-2000, along with  
Microsoft's Windows 2000.

<HEADLINE> US Producers Gripe About Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A coalition of independent oil producers filed  
a petition Tuesday accusing Iraq, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and 
Venezuela of unlawfully dumping their crude oil on the U.S. market 
at prices ``less than normal value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The petition was filed with the Commerce Department and the  
International Trade Commission by an Enid, Okla.-based coalition 
known as Save Domestic Oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of a 1930 trade law, the coalition is asking the  
government to investigate whether the four countries sold crude oil 
at unusually low prices in the U.S. market. A determination of 
illegal dumping could trigger tariffs against those countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The anti-dumping petition alleges that state-owned oil companies  
in the four countries are subsidized by their governments. 
</P>
<P>
	``These unfairly traded imports have materially injured certain  
regional domestic producers manufacturing crude petroleum oil and 
threaten to cause further material injury if remedial action is not 
taken,'' the petition states.

	The president of Venezuela's national oil company, Petroleos de  
Venezuela S.A., said there is ``simply no basis'' for the filing.

	``PDVSA does not receive subsidies from the government,'' said  
president Roberto Mandini. ``PDVSA does not sell oil below 
production costs. The allegations are baseless.''

	The coalition portrayed its actions as necessary to maintain the  
viability of the American oil industry amid the lowest 
international oil prices in more than a decade.

	``We believe this action is necessary to ensure our nation's

see whether there is a way to resolve the concerns raised by this 
petition,'' Richardson added.

<HEADLINE> 1972 Treaty Shouldn't Bar Deployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States should not be bound by a  
landmark 1972 arms-control treaty in moving toward deployment of a 
national missile defense system, the Clinton administration's top 
arms-control official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	John Holum, acting undersecretary of state for arms control and  
international security affairs, told the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee that deployment decisions should be based on what best 
serves the national interest. 
</P>
<P>
	His comments, which echoed those of congressional Republicans,  
followed Russian President Boris Yeltsin's agreement earlier this 
month to consider reviewing the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, 
which bans both American and Russian missile-defense systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat of a nuclear attack by a rogue nation ``is clearly  
very prominent'' as an area of concern, far more so than just a few 
years ago, when the administration believed such a threat was still 
years in the future, Holum said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration earlier opposed moving ahead with a  
large-scale missile defense program, saying it would violate terms 
of the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a compromise with congressional Republicans, President  
Clinton last spring agreed to support legislation committing the 
nation to a missile-defense system. Top Republican leaders were to 
rally Tuesday on the Capitol steps to applaud Clinton's signing of 
that measure. 
</P>
<P>
	``In light of new estimates on the ballistic missile threat, in  
particular from North Korea and Iran, national missile defense is 
now closer to becoming another integral part of our strategy 
against proliferation,'' Holum testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Holum appeared at a nomination hearing to be the first person to  
serve in the new post. He had served since 1993 as director of the 
Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, but that agency went out of 
business on April 1 when its functions were merged with the State 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Holum's nomination was expected to be approved by the panel,  
perhaps as early as Wednesday, when it also votes on the nomination 
of Richard Holbrooke to be United Nations ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration says it will make decisions on missile  
defense system details next June. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than blindly following the ABM restrictions, ``I believe  
our missile defense should be geared toward threat'' and toward 
technical feasibility, Holum said. ``We want it to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration still intends to withhold from the Senate  
modifications to the ABM treaty agreed to in 1996 by Clinton and 
Yeltsin, Holum said. 
</P>
<P>
	He reiterated the administration view that the modifications,  
mainly dealing with impact on the agreement of the breakup of the 
Soviet Union, should be delayed until after Russia ratifies a 1993 
treaty calling for reduction in nuclear warheads. 
</P>
<P>
	After delays caused by airstrikes against Iraq and Yugoslavia,  
the Russian Duma may consider the so-called START II measure when 
it reconvenes in September, Holum said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We fully expect the Russians to ratify START II,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and other Senate Republicans have  
complained about the administration's tactics, and wanted the ABM 
modifications submitted to the Senate immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Yeltsin's agreement to reopen the part of the agreement  
dealing with missile defense has appeared to ease some of the GOP 
objections.

<HEADLINE> Pollution Regulations Rule Appealed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, thwarted by a  
court decision, has taken the first step to reviving its 
controversial smog and soot clear air rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department on Monday formally petitioned a full  
appeals court to reconsider a May 14 decision that overturned 
tougher air standards issued by the Environmental Protection Agency 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the  
District of Columbia said in the 2-1 decision that the EPA lacked 
authority to impose the tougher smog standards and had improperly 
issued new standards for soot. 
</P>
<P>
	The court action came in a lawsuit filed by some of the  
country's most powerful business interests including trucking, 
auto, chemical, and oil industries. It sent shock waves through the 
administration and the environmental community. 
</P>
<P>
	In its filing Monday, the Justice Department argued the  
three-judge panel had ``erred in concluding that the EPA lacks 
authority to implement and revise more stringent ozone'' standards 
and in holding that the agency's actions on soot was an 
``unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The full appeals court must now consider whether to uphold the  
panel's decision or reverse it. The administration may appeal the 
case to the U.S. Supreme Court, if necessary, department officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	An appeal to the full appeals court had been expected.  
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 regulation that was struck down by the panel's May 14  
decision, was one of the most controversial ever developed by EPA. 
It required much tougher air pollution controls to reduce soot and 
ozone levels in the air to ensure better protection of children, 
the elderly and people with respiratory illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA Administrator Carol Browner, who promised an appeal, said  
she was gratified of the Justice Department action to try to 
reverse ``one of the most bizarre and extreme decisions in the 
annals of environmental jurisprudence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If allowed to stand this decision would bring real  
consequences to the American people,'' she said in a statement. If 
the tougher air standards are blocked ``125 million Americans, 
including 35 million children, will breathe air that doesn't meet 
health standards based on modern science,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling came in a lawsuit filed by a broad cross-section of  
industry groups representing the trucking, utility, chemical, oil 
and auto industries, as well as small businesses. Three states -- 
Ohio, Michigan and West Virginia -- also joined the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised air standards being challenged had limited ozone, an  
essential part of smog, to 0.08 parts per million, instead of 0.12 
parts per million under the previous requirement. And for the first 
time they required that states to regulate microscopic 
particulates, or soot, from power plants, cars and other sources 
down to 2.5 microns, or 28 times smaller than the width of a human 
hair. 
</P>
<P>
	Business groups waged an intense battle against the regulation  
in 1997, but the EPA and the White House sided with 
environmentalist and health advocacy groups, which argued the more 
stringent air quality standards are needed to protect sensitive 
populations such as children and people with respiratory problems.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed higher Tuesday,  
with the key index in Tokyo rising to its highest level this year 
following a fall in Japan's unemployment rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose  
172.21 points, or 0.98 percent, to close at 17,782.79. On Monday, 
the average closed up 174.06 points, or 1 percent. The previous 
closing high was 17,777.62 points on June 22. 
</P>
<P>
	The Management and Coordination Agency announced Tuesday that  
Japan's unemployment rate eased to 4.6 percent in May from a record 
high 4.8 percent in the previous two months. 
</P>
<P>
	Also boosting the market was an overnight rise on Wall Street  
ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate committee 
meeting, scheduled to begin later Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed is widely expected to nudge interest rates higher during  
the two-day meeting, but Wall Street investors surmised it would 
only be a small increase and kept buying. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 102.59 points, or 1  
percent, to 10,655.15 at Monday's finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 121.26 in late trading,  
down 0.02 yen from late Monday in Tokyo but above its late New York 
level of 121.21 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Taiwan surged, with the key index rising to a  
14-month high after concerns eased over a possible rise in local 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnight gains on Wall Street also added to the Taipei market's  
momentum. The Weighted Stock Price Index rose 232.82 points, or 
2.81 percent, to 8,514.27, its highest close since April 24, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange closed generally lower  
after two straight sessions of gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, fell 74.80 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 
13,765.49. On Monday, the index had gained 55.78 points, or 0.4 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices fell in the afternoon on profit-taking, with investors  
showing little reaction to a government's land auction which 
fetched higher than expected prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Thai shares slumped as local investors took profits ahead of an  
expected rise in U.S. interest rates later this week, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stock Exchange of Thailand index fell 14.23 points, or 2.7  
percent, to close at 517.65. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed higher, fueled by  
investor optimism on the market's bull run and the country's 
economic outlook. The Composite Index, which tracks 100 blue-chip 
stocks, rose 9.01 points, or 1 percent, to 829.72. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mostly higher in reaction to  
overnight gains on Wall Street. The Straits Times Index rose 17.42 
points, or 0.8 percent, to 2181.08. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed higher on bargain-hunting in  
blue chips by foreign investors. The Composite Index rose 8.434, or 
1.3 percent, to 680.561. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher following a  
drop in long-term interest rates. The NZSE-40 rose 11.22 points, or 
0.5 percent, to 2,147.29. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed higher. The 30-company  
Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PSE Index) rose 22.52 points or 
0.9 percent, to 2,484.57. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed slightly higher. The All  
Ordinaries Index closed at 2,991.3, up just 1 point. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed mixed, with the key index falling  
below 900 points on profit-taking. The Korea Composite Stock Price 
Index fell 5.60 points, or 0.6 percent, to 897.45.

	Clinton: Let U.S. Pay for Drugs  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Calling for the biggest expansion in  
Medicare's history, President Clinton today said the federal 
government should help older Americans pay for prescription drugs. 
``In a nation bursting with prosperity, no senior should have to 
choose between buying food and buying medicine, but we know that 
happens,'' Clinton said. He wants Medicare to pay up to $1,000 a 
year for drugs in return for a monthly fee of $24 paid by the 
patient. The maximum federal payment for drugs would climb to 
$2,500 by 2008 as the monthly patient fee rises to $44.

auditors say in a new report. The General Accounting Office said 
the government, shifting between agencies as eggs move from the 
farm to the table, lacks a consistent approach to safety. The GAO

	Clinton Proposes Medicare Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton announced his plan to keep  
Medicare healthy through 2027 and expand its coverage. The 
centerpiece is a new prescription drug benefit that would cost $24 
a month in return for up to $1,000 a year in prescription drugs. 
The plan also includes a 20 percent copayment for clinical lab 
tests. The White House estimates that would cost $118 billion over

high-security section of the Estelle Unit, was first spotted from a

eight slayings along the tracks. Union Pacific police officers 
regularly inspect trains and yards along the railway's routes in 23 
states to catch people trying to ride the rails. But with the

warned today. Germany, which holds the EU's rotating presidency, 
led a chorus of appeals from European capitals urging Turkey not to 
execute Ocalan, convicted of treason for leading a 15-year 
guerrilla war in southeastern Turkey. No EU nation still uses the 
death penalty, and its members are often sharply critical of 
countries that do. Turkey declared that foreign interference in the

Force of peacekeepers, or KFOR, now numbers about 14,000 troops,

<HEADLINE> Jackie O's Estate Is Owed $99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' $100 million estate  
is worth a bit more -- $99 more, to be exact. 
</P>
<P>
	She was entitled to excess workers' compensation premiums when  
she died in 1994. The $99, which had been paid to cover Mrs. 
Onassis' household help, will be returned to her estate, said 
attorney Alex Forger. 
</P>
<P>
	The missing money came to light last week, when a published list  
of people owed money by Boston-based Liberty Mutuel Insurance 
included this entry: ``Onassis, Jacqueline, 1040 Fifth Ave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forger learned about the unclaimed funds after the list appeared  
in tiny print in the Daily News' classified ads as a legal notice 
last week.

<HEADLINE> Virginia Trash Restrictions Blocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Two state laws to restrict the flow of  
out-of-state garbage into Virginia were blocked by a federal judge 
Tuesday after a trash-hauling company challenged their 
constitutionality. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia is the nation's second-leading trash importer, after  
Pennsylvania, with much of the garbage coming from New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	The trash has generated important revenue for some small towns  
but led to complaints from Republican Gov. Jim Gilmore and other 
politicians that the state is becoming the nation's dumping ground. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, legislators passed two laws that would cap landfill  
growth and ban garbage barges from three Virginia rivers. The laws 
were supposed to take effect on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Waste Management Inc., a Houston-based company that transports  
trash from other states into Virginia, argued that the laws violate 
the U.S. Constitution, which gives the federal government exclusive 
authority over interstate commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a classic example of what the commerce clause is  
designed to prevent -- 50 bickering commercial islands unto 
themselves,'' U.S. District Judge James Spencer said. 
</P>
<P>
	David Botkins, a spokesman for the state attorney general, said  
the state will decide by Wednesday whether to appeal.

<HEADLINE> P. Morris Expects To Miss Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Philip Morris Cos. Inc. plans an aggressive  
campaign to improve its public image in hopes of neutralizing those 
seeking to punish or demonize the food-and-tobacco conglomerate for 
making cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	In its first meeting with securities analysts in nearly three  
years, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes, Kraft cheese and Miller 
beer also said Monday it expects to fall slightly short of earnings 
expectations for the year but is aiming to resume double-digit 
earnings growth in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman and chief executive Geoffrey C. Bible told about 450  
analysts and investors he has seen no compelling evidence that a 
splitup of the company's food and tobacco businesses would be worth 
the risks. 
</P>
<P>
	R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., industry-leading Philip Morris's  
closest U.S. rival, recently was spun off from its parent RJR 
Nabisco Holdings Corp., which was left with its 80 percent stake in 
the food company Nabisco Holdings Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters argued the food company was being undervalued because  
of its connection with the tobacco concern. 
</P>
<P>
	Bible also suggested Philip Morris plans to hold onto its Miller  
beer business despite recent lackluster showings by its two biggest 
brands, Miller Lite and Miller Genuine Draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven C. Parrish, senior vice president for corporate affairs,  
told of the company's plans to ``have a far more visible profile'' 
in responding to critics, seeking common ground in addressing 
conflicts and publicizing the company's economic and social 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the effort, which will begin in the next few months,  
should mean ``the most extreme of our critics will be seen by the 
public as unreasonable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, the demonization can end or at least fall on  
increasingly deaf ears, and we will have helped set a positive, 
enduring course for the future of Philip Morris for many years to 
come,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray Bring, vice chairman for external affairs and general  
counsel, said the campaign should also help Philip Morris in court 
where it faces lawsuits over the health consequences of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	Bring said the company found in two recent jury awards in San  
Francisco and Portland, Ore., against Philip Morris that ``at least 
some of the jurors were angry at the industry'' and wanted to 
punish it. 
</P>
<P>
	He said in the future, the company intends to employ a defense  
that would address such thinking on a jury. He declined to offer 
details. 
</P>
<P>
	Bring expressed confidence that the company's defenses against  
the cases filed against it and said it was ``in a much better 
position today than we were a year ago'' before the tobacco 
industry reached a settlement with 46 states over health claims for 
treating sick smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the settlement, in which the companies agreed to pay  
$206 billion to the states over 25 years, ended a threat that could 
have lasted for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris said it expects to earn $3.30 a share before  
charges this year, up 4 percent from $3.17 a share before charges 
last year. Analysts were expecting $3.32 a share this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company cited economic difficulties that are expected to  
result in a 4 percent decline in the number of cigarettes sold 
overseas and a steeper than usual decline in domestic cigarette 
sales in the wake of the November price increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Bible said the comany is aiming for earnings growth of 11  
percent to 13 percent for the years 2000 through 2003.

<HEADLINE>  Protesters Demand Milosevic Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CACAK, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A crowd of 10,000 demonstrators rallied  
today near Belgrade to demand the resignation of President Slobodan 
Milosevic in the first public demonstration against the Yugoslav 
leader since the end of the NATO air campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	One opposition leader after another stepped to the podium in the  
town of Cacak and urged Milosevic to step down. And each time it 
was uttered, the crowd took up the chant, ``Resignation! 
Resignation!'' 
</P>
<P>
	A small explosion about 150 feet from the platform briefly  
interrupted the rally, smashing the windshield of car and splitting 
its bumper. As jeers rose from the crowd, Velemir Ilic, Cacak's 
mayor, urged calm and warned protesters ``not to give in to 
provocations.'' The rally continued without further incident. 
</P>
<P>
	The demonstration was called by Yugoslavia's main pro-democracy  
coalition, The Alliance for Change. It was seen as a first test of 
whether Serbia's fragmented opposition can exploit public 
discontent with Milosevic's rule to press for reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	The ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party immediately denounced  
the alliance, accusing its leaders of serving the West. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement distributed by the private Beta news agency, the  
Serbian Radical Party said the United States wants to ``humiliate'' 
Serbs and choose their government. 
</P>
<P>
	A few hours before the rally, police summoned one of the protest  
organizers, Milan Kandic, to their headquarters and ``recommended 
the rally be put off,'' he told The Associated Press. But Kandic 
said he was given no written order banning the rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Another local official, Ljubisa Petrovic from the Social  
Democrats, said he received a phone call from the police early 
today informing him the rally had been banned. 
</P>
<P>
	By noon, police set up checkpoints on four main roads leading  
into Cacak, 60 miles southwest of the capital, Belgrade. Local 
officials said a Norwegian and a French television crew bound for 
Cacak were turned back 15 miles outside the capital, but dozens of 
reporters were still present for the rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Police cars repeatedly drove across the main town square ahead  
of the protest. Posters with bold letters reading: ``For Freedom, 
For Cacak,'' were plastered along town streets, exhorting town 
residents to attend the rally. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Goran Svilanovic, head of the opposition Civic  
Alliance party, expressed optimism about the rally. ``Serbia is 
feverish,'' Svilanovic said. 
</P>
<P>
	Discontent has grown throughout Serbia, the main republic of  
Yugoslavia, since Milosevic gave in to NATO demands and agreed to 
pull his troops out of the southern Serb province of Kosovo. 
Despite intense government propaganda in support of Milosevic, 
Serbs seem increasingly disillusioned with his policies, which led 
to the bombing and made Serbia a pariah state. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has said ``not one cent'' will go to rebuild  
Yugoslavia until Milosevic is ousted. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the pro-democracy opposition has for years been unable  
to galvanize discontent and rally around a new leader to challenge 
Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav parliament last week revoked the country's state of  
war. But opposition leaders say some war decrees, including a ban 
on public gatherings, remain in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Yugoslav army reservists blocked roads in Serbia to  
demand back pay for service in Kosovo. At a weekend soccer match, 
thousands of fans chanted anti-Milosevic slogans. The Serb Orthodox 
Church and former Milosevic allies have called for his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the people are increasingly aware that Milosevic and  
his policies have been defeated,'' declared Svilanovic, whose 
family comes from Kosovo. ``People can feel he is finished and they 
are no longer afraid.''

<HEADLINE> H&AMP;R Block Acquires Accounting Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- H&AMP;R Block Inc. is a step closer to  
building the one-stop financial advisory company it expects to lead 
the midsize business market with its acquisition of one of the 
nation's largest accounting firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Block has agreed to purchase McGladrey &AMP; Pullen LLP of  
Minneapolis, the country's seventh-largest accounting firm. The 
$240 million deal makes Block, best known for tax preparation, the 
country's sixth-largest accounting company in terms of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're together going to build is the leading national  
firm focused on the midsized market,'' said Mark Scally, chairman 
of McGladrey. ``Our feeling is that this is going to be a very 
unique firm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase, announced Tuesday by the Kansas City-based  
company, is the latest in a buying spree among Block and rivals 
Century Business Services Inc. and American Express Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The three have acquired about 80 privately held firms since 1997  
as they attempt to expand their business services, which range from 
tax preparation to consulting. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the gap between the three rivals and the Big 5  
accounting firms remains considerable, said analyst Alexander Paris 
Jr. of Barrington Research in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Paris said H&AMP;R Block, with annual revenue of $1.6 billion,  
cannot match the strength of multibillion-dollar firms such as 
Andersen Worldwide and PricewaterhouseCoopers, which had more than 
$10 billion in revenue in 1998 -- but that's not the point. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they want to do is build a broad-based financial  
consulting company with these acquisitions, and this is a big step 
in that direction,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scally said he was less interested in competing for the business  
of large, global companies than in serving, for example, a 
manufacturer with sales of $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Including McGladrey &AMP; Pullen, H&AMP;R Block has acquired eight  
accounting firms since May 1998. The other seven previously 
operated under H&AMP;R Block's HRB Business Services division but will 
now be integrated with McGladrey into a unified group known as RSM 
McGladrey Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	RSM McGladrey will be a national accounting, tax and consulting  
practice that will share a single client service philosophy and 
have about 4,000 employees in more than 70 offices nationwide, the 
company said. H&AMP;R Block's individual tax return business will 
remain separate. 
</P>
<P>
	Salomon Smith Barney analyst Michael Millman said putting the  
accounting firms under the H&AMP;R Block umbrella should help attract 
new clients and retain those already using the company's tax 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people know the Block brand. I think it will make it  
easier to generate more business for people that didn't realize 
that they could get their services in the accounting and CPA 
area,'' Millman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Minneapolis-based McGladrey &AMP; Pullen, serving midsized companies  
and tax exempt organizations, reported 1998 revenue of $300 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	H&AMP;R Block is the nation's largest tax-preparation business with  
about 8,880 offices.

<HEADLINE> Hollywood Video To Rent Sega Console </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- If you simply can't wait for September to  
try out Sega's Dreamcast game console, take heart -- you'll be able 
to rent it two months before the official launch at most Hollywood 
Video stores. 
</P>
<P>
	The first units will be sold in the United States on Sept. 9 --  
9.9.99 -- but starting July 15, gamers with itchy fingers will be 
able to take home the console and ``Sonic Adventure,'' Sega's 
latest game starring its popular Sonic the Hedgehog character. 
</P>
<P>
	You'll get the console and game for two nights for $19.99 -- and  
until the launch, you'll get them only at about 1,000 of Hollywood 
Video's 1,390 rental outlets. After that, other video chains will 
have the unit available to rent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dreamcast, which has already sold more than 1 million units  
in Japan, will cost $199 at its retail launch, with a library of 16 
titles available then and up to 40 by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Retailers are already seeing presale numbers going through the  
roof,'' Sega of America President Bernard Stoler said in a 
teleconference Tuesday, ``Hollywood Video provides us an excellent 
outlet for giving consumers across the country a taste of the 
system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood outlets in five cities -- New York, Chicago, Los  
Angeles, San Francisco and Sega's headquarters city of Portland, 
Ore. -- will host launch parties and will have the console available 
at 12:01 a.m. July 15. Stores in other locations will begin renting 
the console when they open for business July 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood will provide interactive units that can be played in  
the store at about 600 outlets and will have a page on its Web site 
dedicated to the Dreamcast. 
</P>
<P>
	John G. Taylor, an analyst who follows the industry for Arcadia  
Investment Corp. in Portland, thinks the rental idea is a good one. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being able to take a new system and new software for a test  
drive has gotten to be a pretty important thing in the 
marketplace,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sega is spending $100 million on marketing, hoping the 128-bit  
Dreamcast, with its built-in 56k modem, will reverse its video game 
fortunes and give it a chunk of the $6.8 billion-a-year game 
industry pie. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony controls about 60 percent of the U.S. video game market,  
with Nintendo at 30 percent and Sega with 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony's PlayStation, a 32-bit system, is set to be replaced by  
PlayStation II, a far more powerful unit, but not until late next 
year. Nintendo's cartridge-based N64, a 64-bit system which runs a 
distant second to the PlayStation, also is set to be replaced next 
year by a 128-bit disk-based system, currently code-named Dolphin.

<HEADLINE> Defense Dept. Employee Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Defense Department is investigating an  
attempted computer security breach last week at a defense agency 
responsible for reviewing sensitive technology exports. 
</P>
<P>
	An unidentified employee of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency  
is under investigation for allegedly seeking unauthorized access to 
the computer system of a co-worker, agency spokesman Clem Gaines 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaines said the employee under investigation by the Air Force  
Office of Special Investigations had requested electronic access to 
the government computer used by Peter Leitner, a senior adviser to 
the defense agency on matters involving exports of sensitive 
technologies. Gaines declined to identify the individual. 
</P>
<P>
	The individual's request to use Leitner's computer was denied  
and there was no security breach, Gaines said. 
</P>
<P>
	The unauthorized request for access was made last Thursday,  
while Leitner was on Capitol Hill testifying before the House 
Committee on Government Reform, Gaines said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leitner has rankled some in the Pentagon by charging that senior  
defense officials have glossed over concerns in the lower ranks 
that U.S. businesses were allowed to sell to China and other 
countries technology with military applications. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the House Committee on  
Government Reform, identified the person under investigation only 
as Leitner's supervisor. Burton said his committee was 
``independently informed'' this week that the individual is the 
same person Leitner told the committee had falsely accused him in 
the past of security violations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm furious that Dr. Leitner would suffer further intimidation  
for telling the truth about national security problems on the very 
day he was testifying before Congress,'' Burton said. ``This smacks 
of mob tactics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burton urged Defense Secretary William Cohen to push for a full  
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaines, the agency spokesman, said he could not discuss any  
details of the computer security investigation, which was requested 
Monday by the agency's director, Jay Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Pending the outcome of the investigation, the individual has  
been temporarily assigned to other duties, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Managers Mull Web Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Olympic managers are considering an  
Internet ticket auction to boost sales and cutbacks in snowmobiles 
and golf carts for Olympic dignitaries at the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	It's all part of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee's latest  
effort to increase revenue, cut frills and balance a budget for the 
scandal-plagued Utah games. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraser Bullock, chief operating officer, gave a finance  
committee a glimpse Tuesday of budget cuts, revenue 
``enhancements'' and contingencies he plans to propose to the full 
54-member board of trustees on July 8. 
</P>
<P>
	``We looked at the golf carts and cut those back,'' said  
Bullock, without divulging numbers. The carts were meant for 
Olympic officials and to move supplies inside venues. Bullock also 
plans to cut back on snowmobiles, two-way radios and glossy color 
publications. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going black and white,'' SLOC president Mitt Romney  
said. ``We're doing things on the Xerox machine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock, the organization's head bean-counter, said he was 80  
percent through a line-by-line review of the Salt Lake games' 
original $1.45 billion budget, including the Paralympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock said he was separating essentials from what would be  
just ``nice'' for the games, reducing the budget to a new ``base'' 
level, then layering three tiers of possible restorations in the 
event the SLOC can fill a $300 million gap in sponsor revenues. 
Salt Lake officials are struggling to raise money in the wake of a 
gifts-for-votes bidding scandal that surfaced last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	In a set of ``permanent'' reductions, Bullock said he cut $10  
million from games-time SLOC staff, now frozen at 237 employees; 
saved ``big money'' by cutting back on two-way radios, and plans to 
drop a special ceremony for International Olympic Committee 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock also cut ``bells and whistles'' for the SLOC's Web site,  
including ``real-time'' contest results. But Bullock said that 
improvement could pay for itself and more if the SLOC draws 
advertisers to the Web site -- a source of sponsorship revenue not 
already claimed by the U.S. or international Olympic committees. 
</P>
<P>
	And board members suggested the SLOC hold an Internet auction to  
hype sales of Olympic tickets, possibly raising more than the face 
value of the tickets if it doesn't run afoul of other states' 
scalping laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah does not regulate scalping, said Tracey L. Tabet, a  
spokeswoman for the Utah attorney general's office, but she said 
other states ``may choose to go after SLOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anticipating trouble, some board members suggested offering  
ticket bidders something of additional value, such as the chance to 
hobnob with Olympic dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of Tuesday's discussion, meanwhile, golf carts were  
back on the table. Romney said Salt Lake City might donate the use 
of its 400 golf carts for the games -- an offer he quickly announced 
after huddling with Roger Black, the SLOC stand-in for Salt Lake 
City Mayor Deedee Corridini.

<HEADLINE> Bush Courts Hispanic Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- For Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the campaign  
contributions keep coming. 
</P>
<P>
	At a $1,000-a-person event Tuesday, the first of seven  
fund-raisers during his three-day California trip, the Republican 
presidential candidate picked up $480,000 -- $180,000 more than his 
campaign had anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, the Bush campaign expects to take in $4.2 million over  
the three days. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prosperity alone is just materialism,'' he told the donors,  
who greeted him with a standing ovation. ``Prosperity must have a 
greater purpose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush is using the California trip, his first since launching his  
presidential campaign, to mix fund raising with an appeal for 
support among Hispanics, the nation's fastest growing ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
	He attended a Mexican-themed event at the Del Mar County Fair,  
slipping almost immediately into Spanish as he addressed a crowd of 
curious onlookers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank you for having me,'' Bush told a racially mixed crowd of  
several dozen listeners, before lapsing into Spanish. ``It's a 
great honor to be here with all of you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taking on education, an issue often described as ``numero uno''  
among Hispanics, Bush then said in Spanish: ``If you can't read, 
you can't realize the American dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the onlookers said curiosity about the Republican  
presidential front-runner -- particularly his views on race 
relations -- drew them to the event. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being from this region, I want to hear what he has to say  
about the problems with the changing face of the Southwest,'' said 
Ricardo Hackley, a black fair employee who went out of his way to 
catch the Bush appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm interested in what he's got to say,'' said Deanna Tamayo,  
a Hispanic mother who got up early to see Bush. ``I know he's 
trying to reach out to the Hispanic community, which is a plus for 
me and my children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Hernandez, 33, said he was left unimpressed by Bush's  
remarks, which lasted less than five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez, who attended the fair with his wife and six children,  
said Hispanic voters appreciate being addressed in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	``But he's going to have to do a lot more than that,'' Hernandez  
said. ``Right now I didn't see much, but hopefully we will see 
more, hopefully he will have more to say when he comes back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor didn't mention the most divisive issues in  
California politics this decade -- immigration and affirmative 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, he told reporters he opposed Proposition 187, the 1994  
California ballot measure that sought to bar illegal immigrants 
from receiving most forms of state aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to affirmative action, he said ``quotas won't work in  
order to meet certain social obligations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to Bush, the Democratic National Committee said the  
Texas governor was out of step with the Hispanic community in 
California. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Japan Firms Hold Shareholder Confabs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Following a long tradition, most of Japan's major  
companies held their annual shareholder meetings on the same day 
Tuesday to thin the ranks of racketeers who threaten to disrupt the 
gatherings unless they are paid off. 
</P>
<P>
	So-called ``sokaiya'' racketeers blackmail companies by  
threatening to reveal corporate secrets or raise embarrassing 
questions at the annual meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Holding the meetings on the same day makes it impossible for the  
racketeers to hit more than just a few companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's National Police Agency tracks how many companies hold  
their meetings on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
	The figure is watched closely as a rough measure of how active  
racketeers continue to be. Only companies who feel safe from 
extortionists are likely to break with the pack and hold meetings 
on a different day. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 2,227 Japanese companies held shareholders meetings  
Tuesday, down 98 from last year, a National Police Agency official 
said. The figure has declined for two years after peaking in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no sokaiya-related arrests or reports of violence by  
late-afternoon Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the shareholders meetings focused on corporate efforts  
to recover from Japan's darkest postwar recession, local press 
reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the recession officially ended with a report of  
surprisingly strong economic growth in the first quarter of the 
year, many Japanese companies continue to struggle with huge debts 
and falling profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives of construction companies and trading firms, like  
Kanematsu Corp., apologized to shareholders for losses last year 
and for asking creditors to forgive some of their debts, Japan's 
leading business daily, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Many companies have already announced plans to cut payrolls to  
increase profitability. And at meetings Tuesday, many firms 
promised their shareholders to continue such restructuring steps, 
the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have been cracking down on corporate blackmail,  
prosecuting both racketeers and company executives who pay them 
off. But many firms still face threats. 
</P>
<P>
	The home of a former Japan Airlines president was found riddled  
with bullets last week in what officials suspect was an attempt by 
extortionists to intimidate the company.

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted of Killing Parents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A jury recommended the death penalty on Tuesday  
for a man who killed his parents, then spent their money as the 
bodies decomposed in the family garage. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlton Akee Turner Jr. was convicted Monday of capital murder  
for the shootings of Carlton Turner Sr. and Tonya Turner in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Turner, 19, shot each parent several times in  
the head, then dragged the bodies through the house ``like 
garbage,'' prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner bought clothes, jewelry and drugs with their cash and  
checks and continued living in the home. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors called police after they had not seen the couple in  
several days. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner testified he shot his father in self-defense but recalls  
little about killing his mother.

<HEADLINE> CDs To Have Anti-Piracy Feature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The latest round of portable digital music  
players will soon be available in stores nationwide, equipped with 
security features designed to prevent piracy, designers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Secure Digital Music Initiative announced Monday  
they had completed design specifications for the Walkman-like 
devices they claim will thwart online piracy. 
</P>
<P>
	On a yet-to-be determined date, new CDs released by the major  
record producers will be digitally encrypted to prevent piracy, and 
the digital players will need to be upgraded to accept the new 
music, the Secure Digital Music Initiative said. 
</P>
<P>
	``SDMI will enable the future of music and today's announcement  
signals to consumers that this future is coming quickly. This 
future holds the promise that consumers will have access to vast 
amounts of exciting new content with a new level of portability,'' 
SDMI director Leonardo Chiariglione said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Diamond Multimedia, which makes the popular and controversial  
Rio portable digital music player, said it will comply with the new 
standards. The original version of the Rio player has served as a 
focal point for the music piracy debate because it doesn't require 
copyright protection to play music using MP3 technology. 
</P>
<P>
	New devices, available as early as Christmas, would initially  
support all current digital music formats, including MP3. After the 
new digital standard is implemented and the machines' software is 
upgraded, the only new songs that work on the machines will be ones 
that are digitally encoded with copyright protections. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the new protections, the players will still be able to  
play old music already illegally copied using the MP3 format, a 
major concession by the recording industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Future versions of Rio players will be completely  
SDMI-compliant, said Lorraine Comstock, of Diamond's RioPort 
division. A spokeswoman for Milpitas, Calif.-based Creative Labs 
said its Nomad digital music player, to hit store shelves in July, 
will also comply with the SDMI standard. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry members adopted the design specifications at a  
conference in Los Angeles earlier this month. They are under 
technical review and are to be ratified and made public by July 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the security features, however cumbersome, were  
inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think for the traditional music industry to back this, there  
has obviously going to have to be some fairly rigorous copyright 
protection,'' said Clay Ryder, an analyst for Zona Research. 
</P>
<P>
	He suspects computer-savvy hackers will try to find a way around  
the security features, but the chore will prove labor-intensive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing's 100 percent crack-proof, but you would go through a  
hell of a lot of effort to descramble something,'' Ryder said. 
</P>
<P>
	The SDMI members include each of the big five record labels --  
BMG Entertainment, EMI Recorded Music, Sony Music Entertainment, 
Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group -- all looking to 
capitalize on the growing digital music marketplace while 
protecting artist and label copyrights. 
</P>
<P>
	The Recording Industry Association of America lost a suit  
earlier this month to halt sales of the Rio -- a portable machine 
that carries about an hour's worth of CD-quality MP3 music on a 
computer chip. 
</P>
<P>
	Comstock thinks the design specifications will help make popular  
music available to online consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the consumers the SDMI specification is a good thing  
because today you cannot buy music online from well known 
artists,'' Comstock said. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, most of the music available for sale on the Internet  
consists of lesser-known artists.

<HEADLINE> Small Earthquake Hits Los Angeles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A small earthquake hit the downtown and  
surrounding areas early Tuesday, swaying high-rises and startling 
residents. No damage or injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The magnitude-3.8 quake struck shortly before 6 a.m. and was  
centered two miles southwest of East Los Angeles, according to 
seismologist Joe Franck of the California Institute of Technology 
in Pasadena. Several smaller quakes followed. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake was felt over a wide area, including downtown Los  
Angeles, Pasadena, Glendale and West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a real strong jolt,'' Los Angeles police Officer Mike  
Partain said. ``It was about equal to someone slamming a door real 
hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday night, two magnitude-3.1 quakes struck near Ocotillo  
in Imperial County, about 170 miles southeast of Los Angeles. There 
were no reports of damage or injuries.

<HEADLINE> T-Wolves, Kings To Play in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Sacramento Kings, dubbed ``Showtime'' for  
the flashy play of rookie Jason Williams and Chris Webber, will 
play two games against the Minnesota Timberwolves in Japan in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Antonio Spurs were initially slated to play the  
Timberwolves, but as NBA champions, the Spurs became obligated to 
play in the McDonald's Championship in Milan, Italy in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't want to ask a team to make two overseas trips like  
that,'' the NBA's Terry Lyons said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	After 15 losing seasons, the Kings became the league's hottest  
team at end of the season, winning 10 of their last 11 games to 
clinch a playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' dribbling tricks and no-look passes, combined with  
Webber's intensity and Vlade Divac's emotional leadership made the 
Kings an attractive team for fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Sacramento also led the league in scoring, and was the only team  
to average more than 100 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
	The games at the Tokyo Dome, scheduled for Nov. 6-7, will mark  
the fifth time the league has played regular season games in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams are making their first appearance in Japan.

<HEADLINE> Rockets May Trade Olajuwon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston Rockets center Hakeem Olajuwon, a 12-time  
NBA All-Star, could be traded to the Toronto Raptors for two 
players and two first-round draft picks, the Houston Chronicle 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper in today's editions quoted sources close to the  
talks as saying discussions have been going on for about two weeks. 
But the sources said talks had not been completed as of late 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources told the newspaper that negotiations became more intense  
Sunday and Monday and could lead to some changes in the offer, 
possibly including another draft pick or player. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockets officials refused to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing is there will be fewer free agents in the  
future under the new collective bargaining agreement,'' a source 
close to the talks said on condition of anonymity. ``You can 
already see more players signed with their teams because they get 
more money with their current teams. Free agency as we once knew it 
has been curtailed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olajuwon, the Rockets' most celebrated player in a 15-year NBA  
career that followed three seasons at the University of Houston, 
led them to back-to-back NBA championships in 1994 and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Trades cannot be made until Aug. 1, so the Raptors would have to  
select players on the Rockets' behalf during Wednesday's NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston would acquire the Raptors' two first-round selections,  
the fifth pick -- acquired from Denver -- and the 12th pick. The 
Raptors also would send former Rockets center-forward Kevin Willis 
and swingman Doug Christie to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Both players are under contract for one more season. Because  
Toronto is under the salary cap, it would be able to take on 
Olajuwon's $14.3 million salary without precisely matching the 
salaries of the players dealt. 
</P>
<P>
	Willis played two seasons with the Rockets before he was traded  
to Toronto last June for Roy Rogers and two first-round draft 
picks. Willis, 36, averaged 12 points and 8.3 rebounds last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Christie, 29, played 3 1/2 seasons for the Lakers and Knicks before  
spending the last three seasons in Toronto. He averaged 15.2 
points, 4.1 rebounds and 3.7 assists last season and a career-best 
16.5 points and 5.2 rebounds in 1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets, who have the No. 22 pick in the first round, have  
been looking to move up in the draft. The No. 5 pick would be the 
team's highest since they selected Olajuwon first overall in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	By dealing Olajuwon, Houston would begin a rebuilding process in  
the wake of consecutive first-round playoff losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal also could affect forward Charles Barkley, who is  
considering retirement and said he wanted to return only if he 
thought the Rockets were title contenders.

<HEADLINE> Reds Trying To Stay in First Place </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- For the first time in four years, the  
Cincinnati Reds are in first place in late June. And the 
small-market team with big-market aspirations is convinced it can 
stay there awhile. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have as good as anybody's chance of hanging in there for a  
whole season,'' said shortstop Barry Larkin, part of the Reds' 
World Series title team in 1990. ``We're in a position to do that. 
I don't foresee the wheels falling off. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys are having good years -- Sean Casey's having a career year  
-- but everybody else is doing what they're capable of doing. So I 
don't really see any reason to believe we're going to deviate from 
the norm here. We're at the norm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not in a financial sense. Heading into Tuesday night's games,  
the top four records in the major leagues belonged to teams in the 
Top 10 in payroll -- Cleveland (No. 6 at $69 million), Atlanta (No. 
5 at $73 million), the New York Yankees (No. 1 at $85 million) and 
Boston (No. 9 at $61 million). 
</P>
<P>
	Next up were the Reds, whose $33 million payroll ranked 22nd on  
opening day. They're getting their money's worth out of a lineup 
that includes a few stars, a lot of veteran backups and a batch of 
newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
	``First place means that we're showing we can compete with the  
best clubs in the league and that we're going to be in the thick of 
things,'' manager Jack McKeon said. ``The players are getting their 
confidence and when that happens, there's no telling what can 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds become the sentimental favorite of small-market clubs  
when they traded for Denny Neagle and Vaughn in the off-season. But 
things started badly -- Neagle was disabled by a weak shoulder 
during spring training, Vaughn slumped and was hurt and the Reds 
were stuck in last place in the NL Central in mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way we started out and seeing the standings and the way  
the Astros were playing, it was going to be tough to catch them,'' 
catcher Eddie Taubensee said. ``It's a tremendous work to do what 
we've done so far. There's a lot of games left, but it's great to 
be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since May 14, the Reds have won 27 of 40 games to overtake  
Houston. They swept a seven-game trip last week, their most 
successful trip since 1964, to nudge into first place. 
</P>
<P>
	The question now is how long they can stay.  
</P>
<P>
	``If we can get starting pitching that's good enough, we think  
this is a team that can compete all year with the big boys,'' 
general manager Jim Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rotation is the biggest concern. It was supposed to be the  
Reds' strength, with Neagle, Pete Harnisch, Brett Tomko, Steve 
Avery and Jason Bere providing balance. 
</P>
<P>
	Neagle is still on the disabled list, Harnisch has been limited  
by a sore shoulder, Tomko was demoted to the minors for a while 
because of his ineffectiveness, Avery has been erratic and Bere was 
demoted to the bullpen and then put on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	The rotation now is filled out by Ron Villone, a career  
reliever, and Steve Parris, who opened the season in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	The rotation has been bailed out by the bullpen, which has the  
best ERA in the NL at 2.93 but has pitched the second-most innings 
in the league because it's been needed so often. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Reds intend to stay near the top, they're going to have  
to do something about the rotation. Bowden is trying to trade for a 
starter -- a tough proposition, given the team's budget and 
insistence on holding onto its prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	First place is great for now, but the team is still rebuilding  
towards a new ballpark in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like building for the future and then all of a sudden,  
the future comes a lot quicker than you anticipated,'' Bowden said. 
``And the key is going to be to stay healthy and consistent.''

<HEADLINE> Slay Suspect's Poster Won't Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The FBI says Rafael Resendez-Ramirez's name isn't  
as important as his picture. 
</P>
<P>
	The alias Rafael Resendez-Ramirez will remain on the agency's  
wanted posters, even though the FBI on Monday confirmed several 
media reports that the name is just one of more than 30 the man is 
thought to have used. 
</P>
<P>
	``The picture is what's very important, because that is how he's  
going to be recognized,'' said Don K. Clark, special agent in 
charge of the Houston bureau and head of the task force pursuing 
the man linked to eight slayings in three states. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect, who appears on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List, has  
been charged with two slayings earlier this month in Illinois. He 
also is wanted for questioning in five Texas killings and a 1997 
homicide in Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect's real name is Angel Leoncio Reyes Recendis,  
according to a birth certificate. The 39-year-old was born in 
Izucar de Matamoros, Puebla, Mexico, Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
	The mother listed on the certificate, Virginia Recendis, told a  
public notary on March 9, 1960, that the child's father was Juan 
Reyes, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because most of the public knows the wanted man as  
Resendez-Ramirez, Clark said, the FBI will continue to use that 
name. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a lot of fliers out there all over the place with  
Rafael Resendez-Ramirez on them,'' Clark said. ``I don't want to 
confuse the public. The public has given us some very good 
information with the name that's known. We want to stick with 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI said the suspect probably borrowed the Resendez-Ramirez  
name from his uncle.

<HEADLINE> Bankers Trust CEO Quits Steps Aside </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Bankers Trust Corp. chief executive  
Frank Newman will resign from Deutsche Bank AG this week, following 
the merger of the two banks earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	His departure, which takes effect Wednesday, will be on  
``amicable terms,'' Deutsche Bank said in a statement on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Newman said he was stepping aside because he ``concluded that  
the role originally envisioned for me will not be necessary.'' 
After the merger, it was planned for Newman to sit on the Deutsche 
Bank board. 
</P>
<P>
	But, according to a German magazine report over the weekend,  
Deutsche Bank decided to drop Newman because he did not provide 
sufficient information about illegal money transfers at Bankers 
Trust from 1994-96. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Bankers Trust agreed to pay $63.5 million in fines to  
settle charges that it unlawfully diverted millions of dollars from 
unclaimed customer accounts into its own coffers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Der Spiegel report, released Saturday, said that Newman  
negotiated his resignation last week with Deutsche Bank Chief Rolf 
E. Breuer. It said the Bankers Trust executive had sought a 
severance package worth $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Bank would not comment on the report.  
</P>
<P>
	Newman's departure comes a week after the resignation of Richard  
H. Daniel, chief financial officer at Bankers Trust. He led the 
investigation of the illegal funds transfer. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Bank said Daniel resigned ``to pursue other  
interests.'' A source close to the situation, speaking on condition 
of anonymity, said he had been fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Bank had said in a federal filing that it may fire  
Bankers Trust executives for failing to act appropriately in 
investigating an illegal funds transfer. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger in early June of Germany's biggest bank and Bankers  
Trust, the eighth largest bank in the United States, creates the 
world's largest commercial financial institution with assets of 
about 1.55 trillion German marks ($820 billion), as of March 31, 
and a workforce of some 95,000.

<HEADLINE> P. Morris Expects To Miss Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Philip Morris Cos. Inc. plans an aggressive  
campaign to improve its public image in hopes of neutralizing those 
seeking to punish or demonize the food-and-tobacco conglomerate for 
making cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	In its first meeting with securities analysts in nearly three  
years, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes, Kraft cheese and Miller 
beer also said Monday it expects to fall slightly short of earnings 
expectations for the year but is aiming to resume double-digit 
earnings growth in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman and chief executive Geoffrey C. Bible told about 450  
analysts and investors he has seen no compelling evidence that a 
splitup of the company's food and tobacco businesses would be worth 
the risks. 
</P>
<P>
	R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., industry-leading Philip Morris's  
closest U.S. rival, recently was spun off from its parent RJR 
Nabisco Holdings Corp., which was left with its 80 percent stake in 
the food company Nabisco Holdings Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters argued the food company was being undervalued because  
of its connection with the tobacco concern. 
</P>
<P>
	Bible also suggested Philip Morris plans to hold onto its Miller  
beer business despite recent lackluster showings by its two biggest 
brands, Miller Lite and Miller Genuine Draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven C. Parrish, senior vice president for corporate affairs,  
told of the company's plans to ``have a far more visible profile'' 
in responding to critics, seeking common ground in addressing 
conflicts and publicizing the company's economic and social 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the effort, which will begin in the next few months,  
should mean ``the most extreme of our critics will be seen by the 
public as unreasonable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, the demonization can end or at least fall on  
increasingly deaf ears, and we will have helped set a positive, 
enduring course for the future of Philip Morris for many years to 
come,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray Bring, vice chairman for external affairs and general  
counsel, said the campaign should also help Philip Morris in court 
where it faces lawsuits over the health consequences of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	Bring said the company found in two recent jury awards in San  
Francisco and Portland, Ore., against Philip Morris that ``at least 
some of the jurors were angry at the industry'' and wanted to 
punish it. 
</P>
<P>
	He said in the future, the company intends to employ a defense  
that would address such thinking on a jury. He declined to offer 
details. 
</P>
<P>
	Bring expressed confidence that the company's defenses against  
the cases filed against it and said it was ``in a much better 
position today than we were a year ago'' before the tobacco 
industry reached a settlement with 46 states over health claims for 
treating sick smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the settlement, in which the companies agreed to pay  
$206 billion to the states over 25 years, ended a threat that could 
have lasted for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris said it expects to earn $3.30 a share before  
charges this year, up 4 percent from $3.17 a share before charges 
last year. Analysts were expecting $3.32 a share this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company cited economic difficulties that are expected to  
result in a 4 percent decline in the number of cigarettes sold 
overseas and a steeper than usual decline in domestic cigarette 
sales in the wake of the November price increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Bible said the comany is aiming for earnings growth of 11  
percent to 13 percent for the years 2000 through 2003.

<HEADLINE> CMGI Buying Compaq's AltaVista </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CMGI Inc., a major investor in Internet  
businesses, is buying Compaq Computer Corp.'s AltaVista Web site in 
a $2.3 billion deal that gives it a new Internet portal to draw 
visitors to its array of online services. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal today ends months of speculation over the fate of  
Compaq's property, which offers a powerful search tool for 
navigating the Web but hasn't enjoyed the popularity of rival Web 
portals Yahoo!, Excite and Lycos. 
</P>
<P>
	CMGI, based in Andover, Mass., plans to keep AltaVista's 475  
employees in Palo Alto, Calif. Rod Schrock will remain on to run 
AltaVista. 
</P>
<P>
	CMGI plans to use AltaVista as a hub to lead Web surfers to  
other corners of its online empire, including stakes in 
lesser-known properties such as Ancestry.com, CarParts.com, 
Furniture.com and Raging Bull, a financial investment forum. 
</P>
<P>
	For its part Compaq, the world's second-largest computer maker,  
hopes to sell more machines to CMGI's Internet companies to host 
their Web sites and conduct online transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq plans to direct users of its home and business computers  
to CMGI's Web sites. The companies also will team up to create 
custom-tailored Web sites for Compaq's business customers. 
</P>
<P>
	CMGI intends to spin off AltaVista in an initial public stock  
sale at a date soon to be set, CMGI chief executive David Wetherell 
said in a phone interview. CMGI has taken numerous Web ventures 
public in its strategy to reap big profits from investors' 
enthusiasm for Internet-related businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies first approached each other late last year  
about working together, but talks about an AltaVista deal didn't 
accelerate until recent weeks, Wetherell said. Compaq chief 
technology officer and senior vice president Bill Strecker, who is 
leading Compaq's Internet strategy, said the computer maker saw 
CMGI's stable of properties as a way to quickly flesh out 
AltaVista's Web services. 
</P>
<P>
	CMGI agreed to buy an 83 percent stake in AltaVista, with Compaq  
retaining the rest. CMGI is paying 19 million of its common shares 
as well as preferred shares equivalent to 1.8 million common 
shares, worth a total of $2.03 billion at Monday's closing price of 
$97.68 3/4. In addition, CMGI is paying Compaq another $220 million 
over three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors applauded the deal, driving up CMGI's stock 9 percent,  
or $8.93 3/4 a share at $106.62 1/2, by midday on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market. On the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Compaq were up 
81 1/4 cents to $23.12 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement is subject to shareholder and regulatory  
approvals. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq, based in Houston, acquired AltaVista as part of its $9  
billion purchase of computer maker Digital Equipment Corp. last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	AltaVista, in addition to its widely used search engine, offers  
news, stock quotes and shopping services and took in about $40 
million in revenue last year. But it ranked only No. 15 among 
networks of Web sites last month, with 9.5 million visitors, 
according to the Media Metrix research firm.

<HEADLINE> Co-Signing a Loan: Pros and Cons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Q. My teen-age son is planning to buy his first car. Should I  
co-sign his auto loan? 

</P>
<P>
	A. Maybe, but be aware that you're putting your own credit at  
risk. 
</P>
<P>
	A co-signer endorses a loan as a favor to the borrower, without  
taking any payment. By agreeing to repay the loan if your son 
defaults on it, you help him qualify or get better terms than he 
otherwise would get on his own. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 10 percent of all consumer loans have some extra  
collateral such as a co-signer, according to the American Bankers 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of consumers co-sign loans for friends or relatives  
every year without realizing that it can cost them a lot of money 
or even ruin their credit rating, notes the Debt Counselors of 
America, a nonprofit organization that helps people get out of 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you co-sign, you're taking responsibility for a loan that  
the lender has decided is too risky, so don't take it lightly,'' 
says Steve Rhode, the group's co-founder. 
</P>
<P>
	The Debt Counselors point out these traps:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Co-signing can ruin your credit report.  
</P>
<P>
	Many loans don't get reported to the credit-rating agencies at  
all. But for those that are, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act 
requires lenders to list co-signed loans as equal obligations of 
the co-signers and primary borrowers. Late payments can damage a 
co-signer's credit rating. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Co-signing makes it harder for you to get credit.  
</P>
<P>
	Lenders will count the full amount of a co-signed loan as your  
debt, even if you're not repaying it. That can make it harder to 
qualify for loans that you want and need. 
</P>
<P>
	-- You may not be aware there is a problem with the loan until  
the main borrower defaults. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-signers often don't discover that payments aren't being made  
until it's too late. By that time, the account may be in 
collections, or the car that it financed may be repossessed. 
Co-signers are responsible for any collection costs, not to mention 
suffering damage to their credit report. 
</P>
<P>
	-- You can get stuck with more debt than you expected.  
</P>
<P>
	Credit limits, such as those on credit cards, can be increased  
without the co-signer's knowledge or consent, leaving the co-signer 
responsible for more debt than he or she intended. 
</P>
<P>
	Debt Counselors recommends you consider alternatives. For  
example, you could lend your son the entire amount, or give a gift 
of the required down payment. Or, you can suggest that he get a 
secured credit card, so he can build his own credit history or help 
repair a damaged one. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cardinal rule,'' Rhodes concludes, ``is never co-sign a  
loan unless you can afford to make all the payments yourself. You 
never know when you may have to!''

<HEADLINE> Bradley: Health Workers Deserve More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Meeting with community groups as he  
campaigned for the Democratic presidential nomination, former Sen. 
Bill Bradley said Tuesday that home health care workers should be 
better trained and paid more. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said Tuesday that he will propose a health care plan  
this fall that addresses the needs of aides who are hired to take 
care of the elderly at their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who are the lowest-paid workers in America?'' Bradley said.  
``Those who take care of our children. Those who take care of our 
parents who are dying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to officers and employees of the New Hampshire  
Community Loan Fund, a community development group, and later at a 
forum at the nearby Concord Community Music School, Bradley said he 
regularly hears complaints from people about their inability to 
find qualified and trustworthy people to take care of their elderly 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can't determine whether the person will be a good  
caregiver or will come into their homes and rob them,'' Bradley 
said. ``I keep hearing this over and over and over again out 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, good workers are exploited, he said. For  
example, they're sent to a home to care for someone for three 
hours, only to remain longer, without additional pay, because the 
patient needs additional help. 
</P>
<P>
	``You end up spending five hours there because the person is  
very sick,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	To address the problem, the loan fund has helped create a new  
corporation, Quality Care Partners, that it hopes will be a 
profit-making enterprise. Health care workers who are trained and 
placed by the group get a financial stake in the company, and 
therefore will be able to share in any eventual profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only does the group pay its workers above the prevailing  
wage for that occupation, but it also pays them for the time they 
spend in their cars traveling from house to house and guarantees 
them a full week's worth of jobs. So far, 17 workers have been 
trained through the program. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is innovative, it's entrepreneurial and it produces real  
results,'' Bradley said. ``If you're running for president, there 
are things you learn here that can be taken to a national level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said his health plan would also include proposals  
regarding prescription drugs and extending health care to more 
people.

<HEADLINE> Nikkei Hits Record High / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's key stock index closed at its highest level  
in more than a year and a half today after the government reported 
a decline in the country's unemployment rate. The dollar slipped 
against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 172.21 points,  
or 0.98 percent, to close at 17,782.79. The last time the Nikkei 
closed higher was Oct. 6, 1997, when it finished the day at 17,825 
points. Today, the average closed up 174.06 points, or 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.26 in late trading, down 0.02 yen from  
late Monday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 121.21 
yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, traders said the better than expected  
jobless data led some investors to buy. That pushed the Nikkei 
average to its best close this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Management and Coordination Agency announced today that  
Japan's unemployment rate eased to 4.6 percent in May from a record 
high 4.8 percent in the previous two months, as some jobless people 
stopped looking for work. 
</P>
<P>
	When people stop seeking work, they are no longer counted in the  
labor force in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the agency said spending by Japanese wage earners  
in May was 336,354 yen ($2,780) on average, up 1.5 percent from the 
year earlier month in real terms despite declining incomes. 
</P>
<P>
	Also supporting share prices was an overnight rise on Wall  
Street ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate committee 
meeting, scheduled for later today, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed is widely expected to nudge interest rates higher during  
the two-day meeting, but Wall Street investors surmised it would 
only be a small increase and kept buying. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 102.59 points, or 1  
percent, to 10,655.15 at Monday's finish. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 474.43 million shares changed hands on the first  
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange on today, up from 336.84 
million shares the day before. Declines outnumbered advances 593 to 
571, while 147 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section closed up 7.78 points, or 0.55 percent, to 1,425.24. 
The TOPIX closed up 8.05 points, or 0.57 percent, on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar drifted down as investors took  
to the sidelines to await the results of the Fed's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	It had gotten a small boost early in the day from data showing a  
drop in Japan's industrial production output, but the information 
was not enough to give new direction to the exchange rate, traders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ministry of International Trade and Industry's released  
preliminary industrial production data for May showing a 0.7 
percent drop in output from April. Market expectations had been for 
a 1.0 percent rise. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 125.48 yen, down  
from 126.43 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.8000 percent from 1.7800 percent late Monday in 
Tokyo, pushing its price down to 100.00 yen from 100.17 yen.

<HEADLINE> GAO: Don't Protect Nuke Contractors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers were urged Tuesday to stop shielding  
contractors who operate nuclear weapons labs and other nuclear 
facilities from civil penalties for safety violations. 
</P>
<P>
	A report by the General Accounting Office said that a third of  
the $1.8 million in fines assessed contractors by the Energy 
Department for safety violations since 1996 were not paid because 
the contractor was exempt under the law. 
</P>
<P>
	The need to protect contractors, such as the University of  
California, which manages the weapons labs at Los Alamos, N.M., and 
Livermore, Calif., against safety penalties is no longer needed, 
the GAO told the House Commerce subcommittee on oversight and 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department disagreed and urged continuation of the  
exemptions for not-for-profit operators of the government labs and, 
in fact, expand the exemption to additional nonprofit contractors 
at nuclear facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	There is concern that universities and other such institutions  
that manage government laboratories will be ``unwilling to put 
their educational endowments at risk for potential civil penalties 
that could be very substantial,'' said David Michaels, deputy 
energy secretary for environment, safety and health. 
</P>
<P>
	The exemptions were earmarked for nonprofit contractors under a  
1988 law that made most contractors at nuclear facilities liable 
for safety-related fines. The nonprofit contractors were viewed as 
not having income to pay fines, and there was concern they would 
not participate if they potentially were putting their assets at 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
	But the GAO, Congress' investigative and auditing arm, said new  
contracting practices at the Energy Department now allow such 
contractors to earn incentive and management fees that could be 
tapped to pay for safety violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the University of California received nearly all of  
its $6.4 million incentive fee for meeting performance goals at the 
Lawrence Livermore weapons lab, but didn't have to pay $313,125 in 
fines for safety problems because of the exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas Bliley, R-Va., said ``nuclear  
violations have occurred and in some cases recurred'' without 
violators paying penalties. He said he may offer legislation to end 
the exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., already has introduced legislation  
that would require payment of safety penalties. He plans to offer 
the legislation as part of an Energy Department reorganization 
package that is being considered in the coming weeks as a result of 
the uproar over security and espionage at the weapons labs. 
</P>
<P>
	Michaels told the hearing Tuesday that the department will  
aggressively use its performance fees to enforce safety 
requirements. He said an internal review has been ordered into what 
additional measures might be taken, including a proposal to reduce 
performance fees by the amount of any civil penalties a contractor 
is assessed.

<HEADLINE> CNN Names 'Moneyline' Hosts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Moving quickly to fill a vacuum in its most  
profitable program, CNN on Tuesday appointed Stuart Varney and 
Willow Bay as co-anchors of the nightly ``Moneyline'' business 
wrap-up show. 
</P>
<P>
	They will replace veteran financial anchor Lou Dobbs, who left  
unexpectedly earlier this month to join an Internet startup firm. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN is also set to unveil a $25 million advertising campaign in  
support of ``Moneyline'' and its other programs that features 
personalities like New York Yankees pitcher Roger Clemens and 
Virgin Airlines' founder Richard Branson. 
</P>
<P>
	Although its audience is small compared to broadcast network  
shows, CNN's ``Moneyline'' is among the most profitable programs on 
television because it attracts so many corporate executives and 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	After Dobbs left, the financial news network CNBC immediately  
sought to take advantage by expanding its ``Business Center'' 
program to an hour, competing directly with ``Moneyline.'' CNBC has 
also started its own aggressive marketing campaign touting anchors 
Ron Insana and Sue Herera. 
</P>
<P>
	While CNN wanted to make the right decision on who should  
replace Dobbs, it also wanted to move swiftly, said Steve Korn, 
vice chairman of the CNN News Group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever you have a show that is as important to a network as  
`Moneyline' is to us, it's an important decision and one you 
shouldn't dither with,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Korn said CNN wanted to appoint an anchor team, instead of one  
person, to give the network flexibility to send them on 
assignments. 
</P>
<P>
	Varney, 50, worked at CNN for 18 years before leaving last year  
to go on the lecture circuit. He had been anchor of the network's 
early-morning financial news programming. 
</P>
<P>
	Bay, a former ABC News reporter, has been host of CNN financial  
and entertainment newsmagazines and has filled in for Dobbs since 
he left. 
</P>
<P>
	``My excitement meter has gone up a great deal,'' Varney said.  
``This is the premier financial news program on television today 
and it therefore represents a great opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He may have fewer opportunities for public speaking; a CNN  
ethics panel determines whether employees can take outside speaking 
engagements and will decide, case by case, whether Varney can make 
speeches, Korn said. 
</P>
<P>
	A CNBC spokesman had no comment on the move.  
</P>
<P>
	In its first week of head-to-head competition as hour-long  
shows, ``Moneyline'' had an average audience of 293,000 households 
and ``Business Center'' was at 238,000, according to Nielsen Media 
Research.

<HEADLINE> NBA, News Shows Top TV Ratings / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NBA championship and news shows accounted  
for 12 of the top 20 shows on television last week, but the 
basketball series had its lowest ratings in 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the five games between the San Antonio Spurs and New  
York Knicks were the highest-rated shows of the week, Nielsen Media 
Research said Tuesday. But the overall ratings were 40 percent 
below last year's finals with Michael Jordan's swan song. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC and CBS each had three of the top-rated newsmagazines  
</P>
<P>
	NBC won the week with a 7.2 rating and 14 share. CBS had a 6.9  
rating and 13 share, ABC had a 5.7 rating and 11 share and Fox was 
at 4.2 and 8. Among the emerging networks, the WB had a 2.3 rating 
and 4 share, UPN had a 1.4 rating and 3 share, and Pax TV was at 
0.8 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the domination of reruns, the week's ratings proved  
viewers won't be drawn to something just because it's new. ABC's 
Saturday game show, ``The Big Moment,'' was the lowest-rated 
program on any of the big four networks. UPN's premiere of a 
Canadian series, ``Power Play,'' also fell flat: It was the 
network's lowest-rated program last week. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' won the evening news competition with a  
6.6 rating and 16 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' had a 6.5 
rating and 15 share, while the ``CBS Evening News'' was at 5.8 and 
14. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of June 21-27, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: ``NBA Finals, Game 3: San Antonio at New York,'' NBC, 
12.1; ``NBA Finals, Game 4: San Antonio at New York,'' NBC, 12.0; 
``NBA Finals, Game 5: San Antonio at New York,'' NBC, 11.0;

<HEADLINE> Russians Winning Despite Long Trips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- They opened in Boston. Three days later,  
they played in Oregon. Three days after that, they headed to New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, after an improbable journey that has included two  
cross-country treks and has led to a surprise spot in the 
quarterfinals of the Women's World Cup, the Russians are coming 
back to the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia, a newcomer to women's soccer, faces China in one of two  
quarterfinals Wednesday in San Jose. Scandinavian rivals Sweden and 
Norway, the defending World Cup champion, meet in the other. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is playing in its first World Cup and was not expected to  
get this far. But victories over Japan and Canada earned the 
Russians a spot opposite China, one of the favorites. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was worried about how they would hold up, with all the  
travel and the strain of the competition. Few of them have played 
at this level,'' Russian coach Yurii Bystritzkii said. ``But they 
are doing pretty well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Very well, in fact.  
</P>
<P>
	The Russians lost their opener 2-1 to Norway in Foxboro, Mass.,  
on June 20. They flew to Portland, Ore., for a 5-0 win over Japan 
and then flew back to East Rutherford, N.J., for a 4-1 victory over 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a very tough, emotional first game against the  
defending champions,'' forward Natalia Barbachina said. ``But in 
the second half of the tournament the team has definitely improved. 
We have a lot more confidence now, and think we can continue to 
improve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians did not have much time to prepare for the  
tournament. Though eight team members play for the Samara club of 
Russia's professional women's league, Bystritzkii said the players 
had only about a week together as a national team before heading to 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the major problem,'' he said. ``But the desire of the  
women to become the top team in the women's world of soccer makes 
up for the lack of time they could spend together. I try to pack 
the most into a short amount of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has scored nine of its 10 goals in the second half. And  
it has shown it is in good condition for its game against a more 
polished Chinese team. Those 10 goals were scored by eight 
different players. 
</P>
<P>
	``That makes it easy for the coach,'' said Russian goalie  
Svetlana Petko, one of the Samara club members. ``He doesn't have 
to worry about getting us into condition and can concentrate on 
teaching tactics and strategy for that particular opponent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The quarterfinal winners in San Jose will face each other in a  
semifinal Sunday at Foxboro.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 160.20 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks rallied for a second straight  
session Tuesday, surprising Wall Street with their momentum a day 
ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average gained 160.20 to close at  
10,815.35, extending Monday's 102.59-point gain. Volume was 
relatively light throughout the session, magnifying price swings 
and suggesting that the rally, while broad-based, lacked 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Other market indicators also rose, although their gains lagged  
the Dow. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 20.10 to 1,351.45, 
and the Nasdaq composite gained 39.67 to 2,642.11. The Nasdaq, 
dominated by technology stocks, is now just 10 points away from its 
April 26 record high. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no overwhelming moonshot,'' said Larry Wachtel,  
market analyst for Prudential Securities. ``But some buyers are 
back, ready to be adventurous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Traders continued to tread lightly while they waited to see if  
the Fed's Open Market Committee, which was meeting Tuesday and 
Wednesday, would raise interest rates by an expected 0.25 
percentage point, or if the policy makers would take a more 
aggressive approach to contain the economy and inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Official word from the Fed was expected at 2:15 p.m. Wednesday,  
and market watchers were prepared to analyze every word of the 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main concern will be whether the FOMC retains a tightening  
bias,'' said Scott J. Brown, chief economist at Raymond James &AMP; 
Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla. That would indicate that the Fed 
is inclined to implement further rate increases if it determines 
that higher rates would stave off inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising interest rates pose several problems for stocks -- they  
lower corporate profits and they make bonds a more attractive 
investment. Major market indexes have slumped since May 18, when 
the Fed first signaled it might boost rates. 
</P>
<P>
	But after weeks of hand-wringing, said Tim O'Neill, chief  
economist at Harris BankBank of Montreal, market players are ready 
to move on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think most people have solidified their positions,'' said  
O'Neill, who joined many economists in predicting an increase of a 
quarter-percentage point Wednesday, to be followed by at least one 
more increase later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wachtel suggested that the recent drop in prices may have set  
the stage for a sustained rally, especially if second-quarter 
profits come in as strong as expected. ``We're lean and mean, and 
no longer as euphoric,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	An improvement in the bond market, where the yield on the  
Treasury's 30-year bond fell to 6.06 percent from late Monday's 
6.09 percent, also lent support to stock prices Tuesday. Volume was 
thin, however, as traders there also awaited the Fed's move. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, traders were responding to news on individual  
stocks. After Morgan Stanley Dean Witter raised its rating on 
Pepsi, the soft drink maker's stock rose 1 3/16 to 38. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris fell 7/8 to 40 1/8 after telling analysts Monday its  
earnings would be lower than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug stocks, which have tumbled in recent months, shot higher as  
President Clinton offered up details of his Medicare prescription 
benefit plan. While the drug companies initially worried it would 
set the stage for price controls, analysts said the plan has little 
chance of passing. Pfizer rose 3 13/16 to 104 7/8, and Eli Lilly rose 
2 11/16 to 68. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron was the biggest contributor to the Dow's gains, rising 4  
3/16 to 93 11/16 after Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette raised its 
rating on the stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The market appeared unmoved by a Conference Board report that  
showed consumer confidence rose in June to its highest level in 
more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. Composite volume on the NYSE totaled 
964.00 million shares, compared with 789.24 million the previous 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 9.10 to 637.99, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 3.38 to 777.48. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 5.47 to 453.08. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose nearly 1 percent to  
its highest level since October 1997. Germany's DAX index rose 0.1 
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 1.5 percent, and France's CAC-40 
closed 0.9 percent higher.

<HEADLINE> Saturn Launches First Midsize Sedan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Saturn is using its biggest ad campaign yet in  
getting out the word that ``the next big thing'' is coming from the 
General Motors Corp. company -- its first midsize vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Saturn began airing the ads for the new L-series  
sedan and station wagon, which the automaker said will range from 
$15,450 to $21,800 and go on sale late next month. An 
invitation-only unveiling for Saturn owners will be held at dealers 
nationwide July 8. 
</P>
<P>
	The L-series (L stands for ``larger'') is the first new model  
line for Saturn since it began selling its S-series subcompacts in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers will be targeted over the coming month with ads meant  
to pique interest in the new model. Each ``teaser'' ad inserts the 
sedan's name, ``LS,'' among familiar clothing sizes: ``S-M-LS-XL.'' 
The TV, print and billboard versions do not show the car but 
promise ``the next big thing from Saturn'' is coming soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty- and 90-second TV ads showing the car will debut in August  
and will keep with the down-home feeling of Saturn's previous 
campaigns. The longer ads, with actor Danny Glover doing the 
voiceover, will retell Saturn's story as a leader in changing the 
way American cars are made and sold. 
</P>
<P>
	But the new ads will not focus on Saturn's modern Spring Hill,  
Tenn., plant, portrayed in past ad campaigns as a harmonious place 
where happy workers built solid cars. That is because the new 
Saturn will be assembled at an older GM plant in Wilmington, Del. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's largest automaker has high hopes for the L-series.  
GM officials expect the model line to double Saturn's annual sales 
to around 500,000 within a few years. To do so, the L-series will 
have to take on the American-built Toyota Camry and Honda Accord -- 
the nation's best-selling cars -- in the industry's largest and most 
competitive segment. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturn is betting the L-series' competitive prices and Saturn's  
reputation for providing a friendly, no-hassle buying experience 
will help it do that. Toyota and Honda also no longer make wagon 
versions of the Camry and Accord, a fact that Saturn plans to 
exploit as wagons show signs of staging a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	GM has more midsize cars on the U.S. market than any other  
automaker, but Saturn officials have said they do not expect the 
L-series to pull customers from other GM models. Saturn maintains 
that a majority of its customers traditionally have bought Saturns 
after owning imports and other non-GM cars. 
</P>
<P>
	But some analysts are skeptical. Alan Baum of IRN Inc. predicted  
the LS will take away sales from similarly sized GM cars, such as 
the Chevrolet Malibu and Pontiac Grand Am. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an admirable product, reasonably priced, but not a  
breakthrough by any means,'' Baum said. ``We forecast it at a 
little under 200,000 cars a year at full production -- a significant 
number, but it will be at the expense of some Grand Ams and 
Malibus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	L-series prices will start at $15,450 for the base LS sedan with  
a 2.2-liter four-cylinder engine, manual transmission and air 
conditioning. The LS2 sedan, equipped with a 3-liter V6 engine, 
automatic transmission and several other features not standard on 
the lower-priced versions, will cost $20,575. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagons include the LW1 with a four-cylinder engine and automatic  
for $19,275 and the LW2, with the V6, for $21,800. All prices 
include the $440 destination charge. Saturn does not negotiate 
prices, though they can vary from dealer to dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturn dealers have long wanted a midsize model to accompany the  
S-series line of subcompacts, notably in the last two years as 
sales of small cars have slumped. Through May, Saturn's sales were 
down 2 percent from the same period of 1998 in an otherwise robust 
market for new vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's board last month also approved preliminary plans to produce  
a compact sport utility vehicle for Saturn at Spring Hill. It is 
expected to arrive in showrooms by 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Though designed with Saturn's trademark styling cues, the  
L-series is based on the same chassis and major mechanical parts as 
the Opel Vectra, a model sold primarily in Europe by GM's German 
subsidiary.

<HEADLINE> Gay Parent Visitation Rights Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Gay people who help their partners raise a child  
have visitation rights after the couples break up, the state's 
highest ruled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Judicial Court ruled in a case of a lesbian who  
helped her partner raise her son, saying the woman was ``de facto'' 
-- or ``in fact'' -- a parent of the child. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is to be expected that children of nontraditional families,  
like other children, form parent relationships with both parents, 
whether those parents are legal or de facto,'' Justice Ruth Abrams 
wrote for the four-member majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Gay and lesbian parents can adopt in Massachusetts, which would  
make them legal parents. But in the case considered by the court, 
the non-biological parent had not adopted the child. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Charles Fried, in a strongly worded dissent, said  
allowing visitation ``was wholly without warrant in statute, 
precedent or any known legal principle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also charged that the court was taking an unwarranted step  
toward endorsing same-sex marriages, calling the decision 
``judicial lawmaking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Buseck, executive director of Gay and Lesbian Advocates and  
Defenders that helped bring the case to the courts, lauded the 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great victory for the kids,'' he said. ``It's  
certainly a victory for gay and lesbian families.''

<HEADLINE> Highlights of Clinton Medicare Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	President Clinton's proposed Medicare changes include:  
</P>
<P>
	--A new prescription drug benefit, available as an option  
starting in 2002. Medicare does not currently cover drugs not 
administered in hospitals or doctors' offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Coverage would start with the first dollar of prescription  
costs, with no deductible. The government would pay half the first 
$2,000 of drug costs in a year. Costs above $2,000 would have to be 
paid by the beneficiary. The monthly premium would rise gradually, 
reaching $44 in 2008 and the $2,000 cap would rise to $5,000. 
Estimated cost: $118 billion over the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	--Elimination of all copayments and deductibles for preventive  
medical care including mammograms, prostate cancer screenings and 
diabetes management. Estimated cost: $3 billion over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	--A new 20 percent copayment for lab tests for which  
beneficiaries currently pay no out-of-pocket fees, and inflation 
indexing of the $100 annual Medicare deductible for doctor's office 
visits and other outpatient treatments. The inflation indexing 
would likely result in deductible increases of $2 to $3 a year. 
Estimated savings: $11 billion over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	--Beneficiaries who opt to join private managed care health plans  
that participate in Medicare would share in any savings if the 
plans were more efficient than average -- or extra expense if they 
were less efficient. Monthly Medicare premiums would be lower for 
those who chose plans that were less expensive. Those who chose 
more expensive plans would pay the difference. Estimated savings: 
$8 billion over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	--Most curbs on payments to health care providers that were set  
in motion by Congress in 1997 as part of a plan to balance the 
federal budget would be extended for another decade in order to 
achieve an additional $39 billion in savings. However, a $7.5 
billion fund would be established so that adjustments would be made 
if it was determined that some cuts were hurting patient care. 
</P>
<P>
	--Medicare administrators would get new authority to replace some  
government price formulas now used in purchasing goods and 
services, such as medical equipment, with competitive contracting. 
Estimated savings: $25 billion over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	--$794 billion in expected government surpluses would be  
dedicated to Medicare over the next 15 years.

<HEADLINE> Hubbell Talkative About Whitewater </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's  
longtime pursuit of Webster Hubbell culminates with a deal, 
questions remain about what Hillary Rodham Clinton's former law 
partner can tell prosecutors about the president and first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell has agreed to plead guilty in federal court Wednesday to  
a felony and a misdemeanor, legal sources close to the case say. As 
part of the agreement, Starr will recommend no jail time for 
Hubbell. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the second time Starr and Hubbell have been down this road.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Starr allowed Hubbell to plead guilty to tax evasion  
and mail fraud in exchange for his full cooperation in the 
Whitewater investigation. Hubbell had stolen $400,000 from his law 
firm and its clients; he served 16 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	But Starr wasn't satisfied with the information Hubbell  
provided, deeming it ``incomplete,'' and resumed his investigation 
of Hubbell. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently released court records from 1995 reveal that Hubbell  
gave Starr's office damaging information -- plus gossip, rumor and 
innuendo -- about major figures in the Whitewater scandal. But 
Hubbell provided almost no information about Bill and Hillary 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell's testimony about Whitewater figures including  
then-Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker was revealed in court papers 
filed by Starr's prosecutors in preparation for Hubbell's trial, 
which was scheduled to begin Aug. 9. Hubbell was charged with 
concealing his and Mrs. Clinton's legal work on a fraudulent 
Arkansas land development called Castle Grande, owned by her 
Whitewater business partner, Jim McDougal, and Hubbell's 
father-in-law, Seth Ward. 
</P>
<P>
	The court papers, a summary by Hubbell's legal team of his  
cooperation with Starr's office in 1995, proudly proclaim Hubbell's 
remarkable memory in supplying detailed information he recalled 
from years before regarding Tucker, a Tucker associate and other 
people who became criminal defendants in Starr's investigation -- 
defendants Hubbell was not particularly close to personally. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the 10-page memo to Starr seeking leniency, Hubbell  
lawyer John Nields devoted almost no space to the Clintons and 
Whitewater, telling Starr that ``Mr. Hubbell was not especially 
knowledgeable about this topic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two entire pages of the memo are devoted to a summary of  
Hubbell's information against Tucker, which concerns questionable 
real estate loans from the savings and loan owned by McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a marked disparity between the information Hubbell  
provides on lots of other people and the information he provides 
regarding the Clintons, which is virtually zilch,'' said Georgetown 
University law professor Paul Rothstein, who read the 10-page memo 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Starr's impeachment referral to the House in the Monica  
Lewinsky matter last year, the prosecutor said Hubbell's interviews 
and grand jury appearances in 1995 were marked by ``incomplete 
testimony'' regarding the fraudulent Arkansas land development that 
is at the center of Hubbell's guilty plea scheduled for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The question now is whether Hubbell will tell Starr anything  
more about the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	If U.S. District Judge James Robertson sentences Hubbell when he  
pleads guilty, Starr will lose the only leverage he might have over 
him -- a possible prison term. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see anything Starr gets out of it except the wind-up  
of these proceedings and another notch in his belt,'' said George 
Washington University law professor Mary Cheh. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest charges come from an investigation Starr began in  
1996 after discovering that some of the Clintons' friends had paid 
Hubbell hundreds of thousands of dollars while Starr's office was 
investigating him in 1994 and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell didn't tell Starr about the work that he and Mrs.  
Clinton had done on the Castle Grande development. But Mrs. 
Clinton's involvement came to light when her Rose Law Firm billing 
records mysteriously appeared in the White House, two years after 
Starr subpoenaed them.

<HEADLINE>  Candiotti Back With the Indians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Look who floated back into town with the  
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Knuckleballer Tom Candiotti, who played for some horrific  
Cleveland teams from 1986-91 before being traded, was signed to a 
major league contract for the remainder of the season on Tuesday by 
the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	The 41-year-old Candiotti, released by the Oakland Athletics on  
June 16 after posting a 3-5 record and 6.35 ERA, will initially be 
used out of the bullpen as the Indians' long reliever. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be able to come back here and pitch for this team is really  
like a dream come true,'' said Candiotti, who posted a 72-65 record 
in his first stint with the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	When Candiotti last pitched for the Indians, the club played in  
dilapidated Cleveland Stadium and in his five-plus years here, the 
team never won more than 86 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little different here than when I left,'' he said  
standing in the dugout before the game and looking out at beautiful 
Jacobs Field for the first time as a member of the home team. ``As 
bad as some of the teams were, I always loved this place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Indians scheduled to play a day-night doubleheader  
Saturday against Kansas City, the team had been considering adding 
a 13th pitcher to its staff for the last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Candiotti's addition gives the Indians a pitcher who can start,  
work in long relief and makes the opposition have to adjust after 
facing Cleveland's hard-throwing relievers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives you a bit of a different look, a change of pace,''  
said Indians manager Mike Hargrove, who indicated Candiotti could 
start one of Saturday's games. ``We brought Candy in here because 
he has been an effective major league pitcher and we think he's 
still has some gas in the tank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of Candiotti's best starts this season came at Cleveland on  
April 22. He allowed three hits over seven innings to get the win, 
but has struggled most of the year mainly because of a knee 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a few days after beating the Indians, Candiotti faced  
Cleveland in Oakland but was forced to leave in the first inning 
when he couldn't land on his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
	He is now taking anti-inflammatory medication and said the two  
weeks off since being released has helped his knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Candiotti had hoped for another chance to pitch for a contender,  
but never imagined it would be the Indians, who have the best 
record in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice,'' he said. ``I'm sure I'm not going out on a limb  
saying that this is probably the best team I've ever pitched for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Candiotti, 150-163 in 16 major league seasons, was traded by the  
Indians on June 27, 1991, with outfielder Turner Ward to Toronto 
for pitcher Denis Boucher, outfielders Glenallen Hill and Mark 
Whiten -- also back with the Indians -- and a player to be named. 
</P>
<P>
	He made 19 starts with the Blue Jays before leaving after the  
season as a free agent and signing with the Dodgers, who he stayed 
with until 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	All along the way, he always traveled with a large catcher's  
glove in his bag, designed specially for knuckleballers. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the first thing (catcher) Sandy Alomar said to me,''  
Candiotti said. ``'You have that big glove?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar, scheduled to come off the disabled list soon, caught  
Candiotti for two seasons and joked that when Candiotti was traded 
to Toronto, he was the happiest guy in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not coming off the DL,'' Alomar said. ``When he left the  
first time, I said, 'Candy, I love you. I loved having you on the 
team and I'm glad you're going to a contender. But I'd rather not 
catch you ever again.''

<HEADLINE>  Candiotti Back With the Indians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Look who floated back into town with the  
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Knuckleballer Tom Candiotti, who played for some horrific  
Cleveland teams from 1986-91 before being traded, was signed to a 
major league contract for the remainder of the season on Tuesday by 
the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	The 41-year-old Candiotti, released by the Oakland Athletics on  
June 16 after posting a 3-5 record and 6.35 ERA, will initially be 
used out of the bullpen as the Indians' long reliever. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be able to come back here and pitch for this team is really  
like a dream come true,'' said Candiotti, who posted a 72-65 record 
in his first stint with the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	When Candiotti last pitched for the Indians, the club played in  
dilapidated Cleveland Stadium and in his five-plus years here, the 
team never won more than 86 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little different here than when I left,'' he said  
standing in the dugout before the game and looking out at beautiful 
Jacobs Field for the first time as a member of the home team. ``As 
bad as some of the teams were, I always loved this place.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Anthrax Inoculation May Be Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inoculating all 2.4 million military troops  
against anthrax as protection against biological war may be delayed 
because the company producing the vaccine may lack the needed 
financial resources, according to congressional critics. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Government Reform Committee's national security  
subcommittee has scheduled a hearing Wednesday on the Defense 
Department's reliance on BioPort Corp. of Lansing, Mich., as the 
sole licensed manufacturer of the vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Pentagon is locked in a dependent relationship with a new,  
unproven company,'' according to Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., 
the panel's chairman. He said the Pentagon ``may have misjudged the 
financial and technical capabilities of the company to perform 
under the contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a memo last Friday to members of his panel the Government  
Accounting Office and recent reviews by the Defense Contract Audit 
Agency indicate the company has ``a cash flow crisis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen last year ordered all 2.4  
million active duty and reserve troops to get the anthrax vaccine 
as protection against biological warfare. Nearly 300,000 service 
members have been immunized so far. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon then awarded BioPort a contract valued at $29  
million to produce the vaccine. To do the job, BioPort is seeking 
an advance payment of $10 million, a five-fold increase in the 
per-shot price to about $20 and permission to sell up to 300,000 
doses each year on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without more extraordinary Defense Department assistance,  
BioPort appears financially incapable of capitalizing and 
sustaining a highly technical, heavily regulated manufacturing 
process,'' Shay's memo said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for BioPort, Kelly Rossman-McKinney, acknowledged  
the company was ``in a cash-flow crunch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But she said BioPort's move to restructure the deal was  
reasonable. Before the company went private last year, it was 
selling shots below cost and the state of Michigan was losing about 
$5 million subsidizing the lab. 
</P>
<P>
	BioPort was formerly a state-owned facility called the Michigan  
Biologics Products Institute. In March 1997, the Food and Drug 
Administration warned the facility that steps would be taken to 
revoke its production licenses, including for anthrax vaccine, if 
it did not correct quality control deficiencies and manufacturing 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
	In March 1998, the plant was closed for $1.8 million in  
renovations and a $15 million expansion funded by the Defense 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, BioPort purchased the facility and a new company  
was formed that included retired Adm. William J. Crowe, a former 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as a board member. The plant 
is about six months away from an FDA inspection that is required 
before the vaccine is sold again. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossman-McKinney said the plant now has good quality control.  
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon agreed to take on legal liability if the vaccine  
harms anyone under a deal Army Secretary Louis Caldera approved 
last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department described the arrangement as routine and  
a cost saver. Without government protection from lawsuits, the 
company would have to buy expensive outside insurance, with the 
cost passed on to the government as part of the contract price, 
said Army Col. Dick Bridges, a Pentagon spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	With nearly 900,000 shots administered so far, the vaccine has  
produced just 79 ``adverse reactions,'' the Pentagon said.

<HEADLINE> VW Designer Goes to DaimlerChrysler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Volkswagen's New Beetle has lured buyers back to  
the German automaker's American showrooms -- but it's also landed 
its creators top jobs designing American cars. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler AG announced Tuesday that Freeman J. Thomas, the  
head of VW's California design studio, would become the head of 
future product design. Thomas, 41, was one of the co-designers of 
the new Beetle, along with J Mays, who's now the head of design for 
Ford Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas will work on future products and help the company decide  
where it should take its Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep car and truck 
lines, said John Herlitz, DaimlerChrysler's vice president for 
product design. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1991, Thomas has worked at VW's design studio in Simi  
Valley, Calif. Mays and a coworker came up with the idea of 
resurrecting the Beetle in 1993; Mays asked Thomas -- who was 
supposed to be working on Audi cars -- for help in secretly 
designing the car. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Volkswagen was languishing in the United States.  
``We both felt that in the economic situation that Volkswagen and 
other companies needed to bring back the brand, to give people 
something to hold onto,'' Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	The design updated the old Beetle's style while using the engine  
and chassis of the VW Golf to save money. The car caught on with 
the public; VW sold out of the 50,000 New Beetles it imported in 
1998, and many dealers reported waiting lists. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas' hiring is part of a reorganization of DaimlerChrysler's  
design staff in the wake of longtime designer K. Neil Walling's 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas will handle Walling's duties in future product design,  
while Trevor Creed takes over Walling's job as head passenger car 
and minivan designer. Ricardo Aneiros will assume Creed's former 
job as head of truck design.

<HEADLINE> Drug Stocks Soar With Medicare Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pharmaceutical stocks soared Tuesday as Wall  
Street concluded President Clinton's plan to provide drug coverage 
to Medicare recipients will fail in Congress because it is too 
complex and vague. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the proposal would increase sales of drugs, the drug  
industry is concerned it could lead to government price controls 
that slice profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors are breathing a sigh of relief,'' said James Keeney,  
an analyst with ABN AMRO. ``They realize if Congress can't agree on 
something like gun control they don't see how they can for 
legislation to give drug benefits to the elderly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the plan leaves too many questions unanswered --  
much like Clinton's doomed 1994 health reform plan. They also noted 
that many Republicans have doubts about the plan's details. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this is his best shot, we are not particularly worried that  
anything is going to be done,'' said Charles Engelberg, with 
AmeriCal Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner-Lambert gained $4.37 1/2 to $67.12 1/2, Pfizer was up $3.81 1/4 to  
$104.87 1/2 and Eli Lilly gained $2.68 3/4 to 68 after the Clinton 
announcement. They were among the biggest winners as nearly every 
drugmaker rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug stocks have lagged in the past few months, partly because  
of concerns about a Medicare drug benefit, which Clinton first 
mentioned in January in his State of the Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a broad Medicare reform package, Clinton proposed a  
$1,000-a-year prescription drug benefit for older and disabled 
Americans -- at the cost of a monthly $24 premium. The benefit would 
be available as an option for those 65 and older and for the 
disabled beginning in 2002. It would cost the government $118 
billion over 10 years, administration officials estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	The pharmaceutical industry traditionally opposed a Medicare  
drug benefit, because it feared any government-controlled program 
would lead to price controls similar to those now imposed on 
hospitals and doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the drug industry modified its stance, saying  
it would support a Medicare drug coverage, but only if implemented 
through the private sector where competing health plans would offer 
the drug benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	Pharmaceutical executives say if profits are cut due to  
government price controls, they would be forced to cut back 
research spending, which would slow the hunt for new medicines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We prefer a Medicare drug coverage that relies on a wide array  
of competing private health plans, a private marketplace 
solution,'' said Jeff Trewhitt, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical 
Research and Manufacturers of America. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton plan, industry officials said, looks more like a  
government expansion that would face strong opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the president's proposal is really a continuation of a  
large mandated government program we will have some concerns about 
that,'' Trewhitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite those comments, Trewhitt said the group is still  
studying the plan and has not come out formally against it. 
</P>
<P>
	One analyst cautioned that as long as the bill has a chance,  
investors will be cautious about putting money into the drug 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will see stocks on a yo-yo until this issue is resolved,''  
said Hemant Shah, of HKS &AMP; Co. in Warren, NJ.

	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A predawn fire swept through a  
three-story summer camp south of Seoul on Wednesday, killing 23 
kindergarten and grade school children, police said. Two children 
and a teacher were also injured in the fire that broke out at 1:40

	Honduran Boy Admits Tale Was a Lie

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A 13-year-old Honduran boy's fantastic tale of  
journeying 37 days from his mudslide-devastated homeland to New 
York to be with his father apparently is a lie. Detectives 
interviewed Edwin Sabillon after his grandmother in Honduras told 
The Associated Press that the story he had given authorities was 
false. Edwin's maternal grandmother told the AP that the boy's 
mother is alive and his father is dead. Edwin admitted Tuesday 
night that he had lied, that he knew his father was dead and his 
mother alive, according to a police statement.

	Clinton Proposes Medicare Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton announced his plan to keep  
Medicare healthy through 2027 and expand its coverage. The 
centerpiece is a new prescription drug benefit that would cost $24 
a month in return for up to $1,000 a year in prescription drugs. 
The plan also includes a 20 percent copayment for clinical lab 
tests. The White House estimates that would cost $118 billion over 
10 years -- with most of that offset by savings through improved 
competition and efficiencies.

three hits and struck out four as Vladimir Guerrero's three-run

<HEADLINE> Killer Makes Mexican Town a Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RODEO, Mexico (AP) -- Few people get off the dozens of buses that  
roll into Rodeo, a tiny town on the ribbon of highway cutting 
through the heart of northern Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	For most, the dim roadside cafes in this town of 5,000 are  
merely rest stops on long journeys to and from ``el otro lado'' -- 
``the other side'' -- the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this hadn't happened, no one would ever have heard of  
Rodeo,'' one local businessman who declined to give his name said 
while getting a fresh shine on his fringed cowboy boots. 
</P>
<P>
	What has happened to Rodeo is the search for one of the  
most-wanted criminals in the United States. Suddenly, townsfolk 
with any connection to Angel Reyes Resendiz are being sought by 
investigators, reporters and television crews. 
</P>
<P>
	Reyes may be the man the FBI is calling Rafael Resendez-Ramirez,  
the suspected ``railroad killer'' with a long string of aliases who 
allegedly is responsible for slayings in Texas, Illinois and 
Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents in Rodeo, about 275 miles southwest of the Big Bend  
area on the Texas border, say the face in the wanted posters 
matches Reyes even if the suspect's reported violent nature does 
not. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all believe that his life here is too normal for him to  
have done these things,'' said Jesus Valdez Diaz, administrator of 
the health clinic where Reyes' common-law wife works as a lab 
analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	Reyes used to come to Rodeo every few months to visit his wife,  
Julieta Dominguez, during breaks from his work as a laborer in the 
United States, Valdez said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominguez, who began seeing Reyes in 1997, always spoke well of  
the way he treated her, Valdez said. 
</P>
<P>
	But last Friday she called in to ask for time off, saying her  
husband had been accused of horrible crimes in the United States, 
he said. She feared for the safety of their infant daughter and 
needed to go to the city of Durango to ask a human rights 
commission for protection, Valdez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominguez was still there Monday and unavailable for comment, he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reyes, 39, had never been known to cause trouble in Rodeo, a  
cluster of flat-roof concrete buildings in the remote stretches of 
Durango state. Neighbors and acquaintances remember him as 
hardworking and quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. authorities say the man they want is a heavy drinker and  
drug user: Rodeo residents say Reyes was never seen drinking or 
smoking, and regularly rode his mountain bike for exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI says their man is 5-foot-7; Townsfolk agree Reyes is  
closer to 5 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is why we are talking with authorities and reporters,''  
Valdez said, ``we are cooperating to clear this up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But whether or not Reyes is the man wanted by the FBI, Rodeo  
residents are shaken by the idea that one of their own could be a 
serial killer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels very ugly because he's a hometown boy,'' said  
Margarita Rodriguez Campo, director of the Catholic school where 
Reyes briefly taught English to grade-school and high-school 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just can't explain it -- how is it possible that he could do  
this?'' she said. ``A person who does that can't be well in the 
head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, a police commander said Reyes had been in town  
recently. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish we had known about this 15 days ago because we saw  
him,'' the officer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Rodeo is a small town, it's hard to know much about the  
private lives of its people, townsfolk say. About half the 
population migrates to the United States for work, popping in and 
out of town unexpectedly. 
</P>
<P>
	Reyes slipped out of Rodeo after getting a tip he was being  
sought in his home state of Puebla. 
</P>
<P>
	He told his wife he might never return, Valdez said Dominguez  
told him. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said he said goodbye and left. He kissed the baby and told  
her, `I'm as good as dead.'''

<HEADLINE> Joe Frazier Loses Appeal Over Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOYLESTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- A judge sent Smokin' Joe Frazier down for  
the count in his fight against hundreds of homeowners who the 
former heavyweight champion says are illegally occupying his land. 
</P>
<P>
	Common Pleas Judge Edward G. Biester Jr. ruled that the owners  
of 476 homes have valid deeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Frazier alleged that a now-defunct trust company fraudulently  
transferred his land to developers. But the judge said the

<HEADLINE> NYSE Agrees To Oversee Floor Brokers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The New York Stock Exchange failed to enforce  
laws prohibiting brokers on its trading floor from making trades 
that profited them personally, federal regulators said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission, in announcing the  
allegations, also said the NYSE agreed to a settlement of the 
charges in which it admitted no wrongdoing, but agreed to improve 
its oversight and surveillance of floor brokers. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE, the world's largest stock exchange, isn't subject to  
any administrative censure or civil fines under the settlement with 
the SEC. The market watchdog agency alleged that the exchange 
failed to detect and stop illegal trading by floor brokers from 
1993 to 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC's action was part of its effort to strengthen investor  
confidence in the fairness of U.S. stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``This action underscores that self-regulatory organizations  
such as the New York Stock Exchange must vigilantly enforce the 
federal securities laws and their own rules,'' SEC Enforcement 
Director Richard Walker said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	In February 1998, the SEC and federal criminal prosecutors  
charged two owners of brokerage firm Oakford Corp. and eight NYSE 
floor brokers with conspiring to illegally book personal trades. 
The scheme allegedly netted $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
	They were charged with violating a law designed to prevent a  
form of insider trading by brokers who have access to front-line 
information by being on the floor of the exchange. It was the first 
time federal prosecutors and the SEC pressed charges against anyone 
for making such personal trades.

<HEADLINE> Convicted Killer Captured In Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A killer who broke out of the state's  
most secure prison and fled naked into the surrounding snake- and 
alligator-infested swamps was captured Tuesday, two days later, 
hiding in a tree. 
</P>
<P>
	Clifford Jones, 33, offered no resistance and was returned to  
prison for arraignment on escape charges. He never made it off the 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, serving 26 years for murder, the attempted murder of a  
Dallas police officer and assaulting a guard, had been the object 
of an intense manhunt since he fled Sunday from the Estelle Unit's 
high-security section, for the state's most troublesome and violent 
convicts. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent two days and two nights dodging some 300 law  
enforcement officers using tracking dogs, horses, boats and 
helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was trying to survive naked and shoeless in a heavily  
wooded and swampy area populated by alligators, wild pigs and every 
poisonous snake known to North America. 
</P>
<P>
	A guard on the perimeter of a search area about three miles from  
the prison spotted movement in a tree Tuesday afternoon and saw the 
inmate, prison spokesman Glen Castlebury said. The guard summoned 
help from another officer, and they ordered Jones to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	He complied, and was slapped in handcuffs, Castlebury said.  
</P>
<P>
	A state helicopter with infrared gear had spotted the fugitive  
about 3 a.m. Tuesday but couldn't hover long because it was low on 
fuel. The sighting, however, focused the hunt for Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones broke out just after noon on Sunday. He slipped one hand  
out of his handcuffs, threatened a guard and then climbed a fence, 
slipping through an 8- to 10-inch gap high above a caged recreation 
area. Braving gunfire from guards, he climbed a camera tower and 
jumped over another fence before sprinting into the woods. 
</P>
<P>
	He had shed all his clothing shortly after fleeing, apparently  
hoping to evade tracking dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Estelle Unit shares state property with the Ellis Unit,  
where last Thanksgiving night seven condemned killers broke out of 
death row. Six were captured. After an all-out manhunt, the 
seventh, Martin Gurule, was found dead a week later in a creek on 
the prison grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	He had drowned shortly after the breakout.

<HEADLINE> Watermelons Sell for Fourth of July / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORDELE, Ga. (AP) -- Roads leading to the ``Watermelon Capital of  
the World'' are littered with the carcasses of melons that didn't 
make it to market. 
</P>
<P>
	A few bounce out of farmers' overloaded trucks as they rush them  
to Cordele's State Farmers' Market, a major supplier of the fruit 
Americans devour at Fourth of July picnics. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody objects to the vegetarian roadkill, which leaves piles of  
green rind and red flesh on the roadsides, because growing at the 
end of the melon vines is a crop worth about $27 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The watermelons that pass through the Cordele market, and those  
loaded directly into trucks in the field, create hundreds of 
seasonal jobs for the people who pick them, pack them and ship 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a cash crop that ... helps farmers get through the  
summer until the other crops come in,'' said Monica Simmons, 
president of the Cordele-Crisp Chamber of Commerce. ``We have over 
200 million pounds of melons go through our farmers' market each 
year, so it's very, very important to our economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Located about 150 miles south of Atlanta, this town of 20,000  
people has proclaimed itself the Watermelon Capital of the World. 
Many travelers know Cordele as the town with the 110-foot Titan 
missile, a relic of the Cold War that has been parked beside 
Interstate 75 for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordele commemorates its juicy fruit with an annual watermelon  
festival. This year the fest runs from June 19 to July 10 and will 
feature a seed-spitting contest, a street dance, a parade and 
fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
	Melons started rolling into the market on June 1. With July 4th  
fast approaching, the pace is frenzied as buyers attempt to fill 
holiday orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen-wheelers rumble in and out of the market, stopping at  
the gate to weigh in and out. Growers and their wives arrive in 
heavily loaded pickups, some pulling trailers containing mountains 
of melons. 
</P>
<P>
	Growers lounge in the shade of large sheds, waiting for buyers.  
The quality is good, despite a drought. But with watermelons 
selling for 6 to 7 cents per pound, growers are disappointed with 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Out on the hot asphalt parking lot, sweaty workers strip straw  
from hay bales to give watermelons a soft bed during the trip 
north. Others toss watermelons from farm trucks to semis that will 
haul them to East Coast cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Shirley Childs, smiling and joking with co-workers on a loading  
dock, has been working at the market for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love this,'' she said, while applying red stickers to  
seedless watermelons. ``It's fun. You're out with nature, 
constantly busy, constantly doing something. There is never a dull 
moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At dawn, she goes into the watermelon fields to help with the  
harvest, then she works on the dock until it's time to report for 
her full-time job, registering patients at a nearby hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Child's son, Jason, 23, also works at the market as a  
loader. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a family affair,'' she said. ``After all, we're the  
Watermelon Capital of the World.''

	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- All those shoeboxes filled with snapshots

<P>
	America Online on Tuesday began offering a service that allows  
subscribers in Orlando, Tampa and Cleveland to take conventional 
film to 38,000 Kodak photofinishing stores around the country and 
have digitized copies delivered to their computer for an extra $5 
to $7 a roll. 
</P>
<P>
	The service, called ``You've Got Pictures!'' allows subscribers  
to store photos in a private, online photo album. They are able to 
personalize the albums by adding captions and backgrounds and 
cropping or enlarging the pictures. The photos could either be 
downloaded or transmitted online to friends or family. 
</P>
<P>
	The service will be available to all of AOL's 17 million  
customers by the end of the year, said Debbie Fletter, AOL's 
director of programming and promotions. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers will still be able to pick up their negatives and  
prints from their photofinishing stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlando, Tampa and Cleveland were chosen as test cities because  
they have large numbers of AOL subscribers, Ms. Fletter said.

<HEADLINE> 76s Chief Croce Pat Leaves Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia 76ers president Pat Croce left  
the hospital today less than two weeks after a motorcycle accident. 
</P>
<P>
	In a wheelchair and with his bandaged left leg propped up, Croce  
was greeted by about 50 people at the Hospital of the University of 
Pennsylvania. He used a walker to maneuver into a limousine. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal ahead is to walk by the start of the season,'' Croce  
said. ``But I still love life. I just can't enjoy it the same this 
summer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Croce was injured about 50 miles into what was supposed to be a  
cross-country motorcycle trip June 17 with friends. When it began 
to rain, the group pulled under an overpass to change clothes. 
Another cyclist slipped on a slick spot and was thrown from the 
motorcycle. The cycle hit Croce's leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Croce fractured his lower left leg and underwent a 2 1/2-hour  
operation. A titanium nail secured the broken bone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know exactly what's ahead but I will take it to the  
'nth' degree and won't push it because I don't want to come back 
here,'' Croce said. 
</P>
<P>
	Croce, a bit of a daredevil, shimmied upside down on a rope from  
the arena ceiling before a 76ers playoff game this year. 
</P>
<P>
	He plans to begin his rehabilitation as soon as possible, with  
his recovery expected to take about three to six months. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a challenge for me because I know who the patient is,''  
he said. ``Having to keep the patient down when he wants to run is 
a big challenge.''

<HEADLINE> U.S., French Discuss Altered Foods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman met with  
French officials Tuesday to head off a potential trade dispute over 
the issue of genetically modified crops. 
</P>
<P>
	``(We're here) to deal with what looks like an impending train  
wreck between the United States and Europe on biotechnology,'' he 
told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting with French Agriculture Minister Jean Glavany,  
Glickman said French and American agriculture officials will work 
together over the next 30 to 60 days to iron out U.S.-European 
differences over the marketing of genetically modified crops. 
</P>
<P>
	``The blood pressure is high on both sides of the Atlantic,''  
Glickman said, noting that the United States has lost hundreds of 
millions of dollars in exports due to the biotechnology debate. 
``Unless there is some resolution, this will create more serious 
trade tensions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later Tuesday, Glavany said he had accepted Glickman's  
invitation to visit the United States later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, European Union environment ministers agreed to  
tighten rules on trading and selling new genetically modified seeds 
in the 15-nation EU, but rejected a French moratorium on sales. 
</P>
<P>
	France had asked its EU partners to ban any new marketing of the  
crops, and has called for better labeling and uniform EU rules on 
production and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman said the United States wants to work with France to  
help resolve the Europe-wide conflict because the country is known 
for its ``leading role in European agriculture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the U.S.-French talks don't lead to a resolution, the U.S.  
``will have to consider what trade action would be appropriate,'' 
said Peter Scher, America's trade negotiator on agriculture. ``But 
the reason we're here is to avoid that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. administration believes genetically modified seeds pose  
no risk to the health of consumers. Almost 40 percent of some 
American crops are genetically modified. 
</P>
<P>
	There are currently 18 genetically modified crops approved for  
marketing in the EU. Four more are awaiting approval, but fears 
about genetically modified foods are rising across the EU, which 
has been hit by a series of food scares in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers have concerns and they have to be dealt with,''  
Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is the largest producer of bioengineered  
crops. By breeding genes in crops, U.S. scientists say they have 
managed to improve taste and make plants more resistant to disease 
and insects. 
</P>
<P>
	Several European and Asian nations are implementing or proposing  
labeling laws that would distinguish foods containing genetically 
modified ingredients.

<HEADLINE> Rising Rates Slow New-Home Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sales of new homes fell 5.1 percent in May,  
the biggest drop in four months, as rising mortgage rates began to 
cool demand in the housing market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported today that sales of new  
single-family homes dropped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
888,000 units last month, down from an April sales pace of 936,000 
units. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline, almost double what analysts had been expecting, was  
attributed to the recent runup in mortgage rates. Rates have been 
rising over the past two months. 
</P>
<P>
	The national average for 30-year mortgages stood at 7.63 percent  
last week, nearly a full percentage point above the 6.74 percent 
low for the year reached in January. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Federal Reserve widely expected to start raising  
short-term interest rates on Wednesday in a pre-emptive strike 
against inflation, analysts believe housing and other 
interest-sensitive sectors such as autos will slow in the months 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Housing has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the  
country's current good economic times. Low mortgage rates and the 
lowest unemployment levels in three decades set off a buying spree 
that pushed up sales of both new and existing homes. 
</P>
<P>
	A report last week showed that sales of existing homes have also  
begun to feel the pinch of rising mortgage rates. After hitting an 
all-time high in March, sales of previously owned homes fell by 4 
percent in May, their second monthly decline. 
</P>
<P>
	For new-home sales, the 5.1 percent May decline followed a 6.4  
percent increase in April. It was the largest monthly decline since 
a 5.2 percent drop in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in sales pushed prices down as well. The median price  
for a new home -- meaning half of all homes sold in May sold for 
less and half for more -- was $149,900, down 5.7 percent from 
April's median price of $159,000. It was the lowest price level 
since July 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The average price for a home sold in May fell by 2.1 percent to  
$185,100, down from $189,100 in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The sales decline was led by an 18.8 percent plunge in the  
Northeast, where sales dipped to an annual rate of 69,000 units, 
the slowest pace since September 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were down in all parts of the country. The declines  
included an 8.6 percent drop in the West to an annual rate of 
235,000 units and a drop of 3.8 percent in the Midwest to an annual 
rate of 177,000 units. Sales were off 0.5 percent in the South to a 
seasonally adjusted rate of 407,000 units.

<HEADLINE> Sprewell Co. Linked to Stolen Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN GABRIEL, Calif. (AP) -- Workers at an auto shop owned by NBA  
star Latrell Sprewell sold vehicles that were stolen in Mexico, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nineteen vehicles have been recovered but there have been no  
arrests directly related to the stolen vehicles, Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies said. Search warrants have been issued for eight 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Knicks guard ``does not appear to be involved in  
these criminal activities,'' a Sheriff's Department news release 
said. Deputies refused to discuss the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell's agent, Robert Gist, said Tuesday he had been in  
contact with investigators and his client had been unaware of the 
thefts. He said Sprewell planned to comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell rejoined the NBA this year after being suspended for  
most of a season for choking his coach at Golden State. He helped 
lead the surprising Knicks to the NBA Finals, where they were 
eliminated in Game 5 Friday night by San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	Stolen vehicles, including Jeep Grand Cherokees, Ford pickups  
and Dodge Durangos, were recovered after allegedly being sold by 
employees at Sprewell Racing, the news release said. The vehicles, 
stolen in Mexico, were delivered to the shop and sold to 
unsuspecting buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell Racing, which opened in October 1998, sells  
high-performance wheels, tires, suspension systems and other 
accessories. San Gabriel is 15 miles east of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	A motor home and two SeaDoo watercraft were also recovered, as  
was $200,000 worth of computer equipment from a cargo theft in 
Northern California at San Leandro. 
</P>
<P>
	Two people were arrested during the investigation on unrelated  
charges, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation was being conducted by the joint local, county  
and state law enforcement Task Force for Regional Autotheft 
Prevention.

<HEADLINE> McEnroe: Agassi Can Go All the Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- John McEnroe gives Andre Agassi a good  
chance of pulling off the French Open-Wimbledon double. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe believes the draw favors Agassi, who is seeking to  
become the first since Bjorn Borg in 1980 to win the Wimbledon 
title a month after capturing the French. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-time Wimbledon champion is impressed by Agassi's form,  
especially against the big servers. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what I saw at the French Open and here at Wimbledon, then  
he's possibly the best returner around when he's at the top of his 
game as he has been,'' McEnroe said on NBC the day after Agassi 
reached the quarterfinals with a four-set victory over big-serving 
Australian Wayne Arthurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He played a guy who's got a nasty serve -- a big server and  
that's the kind of match he needed to get through. I like his 
chances to get to the final,'' McEnroe said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the draw is great. The quarterfinal is next and, once  
he's got past (Gustavo) Kuerten which I think he should, he's got 
only one of four serve-and-volley guys, Goran Ivanisevic or Todd 
Martin or Pat Rafter or Boris Becker. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys have to fight it out from each other. (Agassi) can  
just sit back and wait and see once he disposes of Kuerten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi is in the opposite half of the draw from defending and  
five-time champion Pete Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pete Sampras on grass is clearly favorite to win,'' McEnroe  
said. ``He has got to get past either Greg Rusedski or Mark 
Philippoussis, two of the monster servers in the game. But he's got 
a more all-court game than either of these players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe was surprised that Rafter, a two-time U.S. Open champion  
who faces Becker for a place in the quarterfinals, had never even 
reached the quarters at Wimbledon in six visits. 
</P>
<P>
	``He plays Boris Becker who has played damn well and is going to  
give Rafter a tough match,'' McEnroe said. ``But if Rafter gets by 
Becker he's confidence is going to increase and you've got to 
believe Pat Rafter can win this thing.''

<HEADLINE> Cops: Man Kills Wife After Stroke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUTLER, Pa. (AP) -- A 78-year-old man was charged Tuesday with  
suffocating his wife of 54 years in a nursing home because he 
``couldn't stand looking at her'' after her second stroke, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Marchetto visited his 75-year-old wife, Thelma, every day  
since her second stroke in March, nursing home staff said. She 
suffered her first about a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest stroke left her paralyzed on both sides, and she was  
placed in St. Francis Nursing Center North in Cranberry Township. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was able to speak. Movement was difficult,'' said Jennifer  
Fuller, a spokeswoman for the nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, a nurse walked into the room and saw Marchetto  
standing over his wife's bed with his hands over her neck and a 
bedsheet over her head, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The nurse asked what he was doing and he replied, ``I couldn't  
stand looking at her,'' police said. 
</P>
<P>
	A white plastic bag was over her head, police said. She died two  
days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Marchetto told others that his wife had suffered enough since  
her first stroke 10 years earlier, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marchetto was released on his own recognizance into the custody  
of his daughter, who lives in Pittsburgh.

<HEADLINE> Garry Shandling Suit Set for Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A $100 million lawsuit brought by comic Garry  
Shandling goes to trial Wednesday in a case that has implications 
for the growing number of personal managers who double as TV 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Shandling is suing his former manager, Brad Grey, alleging that  
Grey's role as Shandling's manager and executive producer of the 
now-ended ``Larry Sanders Show'' represented a conflict of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit alleges Grey was able to ``triple-dip,'' taking  
excess commissions and fees out of the HBO series. It also claims 
Grey used Shandling's name to make $200 million-plus in outside 
deals and owes him a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager-producers are increasingly common. Rory Rosegarten  
manages comedian Ray Romano and is an executive producer on his CBS 
sitcom ``Everybody Loves Raymond.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jenna Elfman is managed by Erwin More and Brian Medavoy, who are  
among the executive producers on her ABC series ``Dharma &AMP; Greg.'' 
Another of their clients is Laura San Giacomo of ``Just Shoot Me,'' 
which also lists the two as executive producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Shandling's complaints, actors often lobby for such  
participation in the belief their manager will be protective of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	But the trend adds to a series' costs and can create tensions  
between the manager-producer and the producers who have more 
hands-on responsibility for the TV show. 
</P>
<P>
	A manager who gets a producing credit on a show can make about  
$15,000 per episode, according to The Hollywood Reporter, a trade 
paper. That's about $330,000 a season. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-decade relationship between Shandling and Grey, who  
collaborated on ``Larry Sanders'' (a behind-the-scenes look at a 
fictional talk show) and ``It's Garry Shandling's Show,'' ended 
when Grey resigned as Shandling's manager in 1997. Shandling sued 
in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Bert Fields, the lawyer for Grey and his companies  
Brillstein-Grey Enterprises and Brad Grey Productions Inc., has 
called the lawsuit ``sheer lunacy'' and ``nuts.'' Fields has said 
Shandling had nothing to do with building Grey's outside business. 
</P>
<P>
	Shandling's legal team is led by David Boies, who is heading the  
government's side of the Microsoft antitrust trial in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Stronger Consumer Privacy Laws Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the House nearing a vote on measures  
designed to protect consumer privacy, key Democratic lawmakers on 
Tuesday pushed for tighter restrictions on companies' sharing 
financial data from their customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer and privacy advocacy groups, meanwhile, pressed  
President Clinton to get involved in the congressional privacy 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is critical that Congress act now. ... We urge you to tell  
Congress to (enact) the protections for personal privacy,'' a 
coalition of groups, including Consumer Federation of America, 
Consumers Union, U.S. Public Interest Research Group and the 
Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, said in a letter to Clinton dated 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanging in the balance is sweeping legislation to remove  
Depression-era barriers between banks, securities firms and 
insurance companies. The House is expected to vote in a few days on 
the package, which includes the consumer privacy provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic amendment, recently adopted in a surprise move by  
the House Commerce Committee, would allow consumers to stop banks, 
securities firms and other financial service companies from sharing 
their personal data with affiliated or outside companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The alternative provision being pushed by the Republican  
leadership would allow consumers to block companies from selling 
the data to outside firms, such as telemarketers, but not from 
sharing it with affiliated companies under the same corporate 
parent. 
</P>
<P>
	Key Democrats, who support the financial overhaul legislation,  
are threatening to vote against the bill if it does not contain the 
stricter privacy amendment they are pushing. 
</P>
<P>
	In that case, ``it will only be half a bill,'' Rep. Edward  
Markey, D-Mass., principal author of the amendment, said at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Markey and other Democratic lawmakers objected to Republican  
leaders excluding their amendment from a House vote in favor of one 
more acceptable to the financial services industries. Their 
objection was so strong they were calling a special meeting of all 
House Democrats to discuss the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic lawmakers were joined by a Republican, Rep. Joe  
Barton of Texas, who said he and other GOP lawmakers also would 
vote against a financial overhaul package without the stricter 
privacy measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the measures, ``There is real doubt whether the bill  
passes,'' Barton said. ``That's something the (financial) industry 
needs to think about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the banking, securities and insurance  
industries, which have lobbied for financial overhaul legislation 
for years, say inclusion of stringent privacy amendments would kill 
their support for the House bill. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the House Rules Committee, which reflects the  
views of the Republican leadership, said a final decision hadn't 
been made on which privacy amendment would be voted on by the full 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	``The importance of protecting consumer privacy is a view that  
is widely shared,'' said the spokesman, Richard Mills. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate passed a financial overhaul package in early May on a  
mostly party-line vote of 54-44. The Clinton administration 
supports such legislation in principle but has threatened to veto 
the Senate version unless there are major changes, including the 
removal of provisions that Democrats view as an attack on the 1977 
Community Reinvestment Act.

<HEADLINE> Ark. Sen. Hutchinson To Divorce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Sen. Tim Hutchinson, a Southern Baptist  
minister who stressed family values in his campaigns, filed for 
divorce Tuesday from his wife of nearly 29 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson, 49, the first popularly elected Republican U.S.  
senator from Arkansas, cited unspecified problems in papers filed 
in his hometown of Bentonville. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been tremendous strains on our marriage during the  
past few years and we sought extensive counseling prior to taking 
this action,'' Hutchinson said of his wife Donna in a statement 
from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson's brother, Asa, is a member of the House of  
Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson, a former state legislator elected to the Senate in  
1996, is touted on his World Wide Web site as a ``dedicated 
advocate for American families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to questions submitted by The Associated Press in  
1996, Hutchinson said ``the breakdown of the American family'' was 
one of the two biggest problems facing the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson's term expires in 2002.

<HEADLINE> Reactions to Medicare Announcement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Reactions to President Clinton's announcement Tuesday on the  
future of Medicare and his plans for prescription drug coverage: 

</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and Senate Majority Leader  
Trent Lott, R-Miss., in a joint statement: 
</P>
<P>
	We share the president's concern that no citizen should be  
forced to chose between putting food on the table and paying the 
bills or buying prescription drugs. ... As we evaluate any 
prescription drug proposal, including the president's, we need to 
answer some basic questions: Who pays? Will there be any higher 
premiums or hidden tax hikes places on our seniors and future 
retirees? Will the government decide what drugs seniors can use and 
which ones they cannot? 

</P>
<P>
	Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa:  
</P>
<P>
	I commend the president for including my proposal to reduce  
waste in Medicare by using competitive bidding. Medicare pays twice 
as much for many medical supplies than it should. It just makes 
common sense to ensure that Medicare and American taxpayers get the 
best deal possible. 

</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas:  
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds of Americans already have drug coverage in some form  
of insurance. Many Americans take pharmaceutical coverage into 
retirement as part of their retirement package. Most people in this 
room, myself included, will take into retirement an insurance 
policy that will cover part of our pharmaceuticals. The idea that 
somehow it would be good public policy to impose more tax burden on 
young working families to substitute taxpayer-funded insurance for 
those private insurance policies that Americans are already taking 
into retirement to me makes absolutely no sense. 

</P>
<P>
	Rep. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio:  
</P>
<P>
	Prescription drug coverage for seniors is critically important,  
but it is not intended to address, nor does it address, the market 
failure in prescription drug pricing that is driving up health care 
costs and hindering access to needed medications here and around 
the world. 

</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas:  
</P>
<P>
	I'm a little bit concerned he's now trying to advance a partisan  
effort. ... It looks as though he's going to recommend a premium 
increase for all American people while he puts the government in 
charge of what drugs seniors can get. 

</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., ranking Democrat on the Ways and  
Means Committee: 
</P>
<P>
	The president's proposal contains the greatest improvement in  
the history of Medicare -- a prescription drug benefit. By starting 
modestly, but then expanding the benefit as Medicare becomes 
financially stronger, the administration has addressed a pressing 
need of our seniors in a fiscally responsible way. 

</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., head of the Ways and Means health  
subcommittee: 
</P>
<P>
	It's essential to include prescription drugs in today's Medicare  
as well as tomorrow's Medicare. Giving seniors affordable access 
through Medicare to the latest advances in drug therapies is a 
priority for House Republicans. 

</P>
<P>
	House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo.:  
</P>
<P>
	The president's fiscally responsible prescription drug proposal  
will be the single greatest improvement to the Medicare program 
since its inception.

<HEADLINE> Fed Expected To Up Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve will nudge interest rates  
up Wednesday for the first time in more than two years, according 
to the widely held view in financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the real guessing game begins: How many more rate hikes  
will the central bank order to slow the red-hot U.S. economy to a 
more sustainable pace? 
</P>
<P>
	While analysts disagree on how high the central bank will need  
to boost borrowing costs for millions of American consumers and 
businesses to slow economic activity, they are virtually certain 
the Fed will start the process Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Short of jumping up and down and yelling, (Federal Reserve  
Chairman Alan) Greenspan has pretty much announced this move as 
much as he can,'' said David Wyss, chief financial economist at 
Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyss and other economists said Greenspan left no doubt with his  
June 17 testimony in Congress. The chairman said then: ``When we 
can be pre-emptive, we should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets rallied for a second straight session Tuesday,  
with the Dow Jones industrial average rising by 160 points to close 
at 10,815, after a 103-point gain Monday. Analysts said traders saw 
buying opportunities in advance of the Fed's expected rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed under Greenspan has preferred to be forward-looking,  
moving to raise interest rates before higher inflation has a chance 
to become embedded in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	But the question is whether these rate hikes will be a replay of  
1997 or of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	In February 1994, the Fed under Greenspan launched a pre-emptive  
strike against inflation, and before the central bank was finished 
a year later it had driven rates up by 2.75 percentage points in 
seven separate steps. The economy was slowed, and inflation stayed 
under control. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed started raising rates again in March 1997. That time it  
stopped after a quarter-point increase that it believed was 
sufficient to show its inflation-fighting resolve. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 tightening came just before the global currency crisis  
struck in Asia. Before that turmoil was over, the Fed had to 
reverse course last fall and cut rates three times to keep the U.S. 
economy from tumbling into a downturn. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics from both conservative business groups and liberal labor  
unions believe the Fed will be running the risk of upsetting a 
fragile global recovery if it begins raising U.S. rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence is pretty compelling that the risks of raising  
rates are far greater than any benefits that might be achieved,'' 
said economist Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National 
Association of Manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Working families will pay the price of a mistaken  
tightening,'' AFL-CIO President John Sweeney complained at a 
Capitol Hill rally last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Private economists believe, however, that Greenspan and his  
colleagues have become convinced that the U.S. economy must slow in 
order to take pressure off tight U.S. labor markets and keep 
workers from beginning to demand inflationary wage hikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Unemployment has fallen to the lowest levels in three decades,  
currently at 4.3 percent. Fed policy-makers are concerned that many 
of the factors that contributed to low inflation last year, falling 
oil prices and weak global demand, are beginning to reverse while 
consumer demand in the United States remains strong. 
</P>
<P>
	The government reported Tuesday that sales of new homes fell by  
5.1 percent in May, but the pace of sales remained near historic 
highs. Another report showed consumer confidence rose in June to 
its highest level in more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have red-hot domestic demand. The auto and housing  
markets are booming,'' said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey 
G. Lanston &AMP; Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said he expects the Fed, at the end of two days of  
closed-door discussions Wednesday, will boost its target for the 
federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other, from 
4.75 percent to 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	That will trigger an immediate quarter-point increase in  
commercial banks' prime lending rates, the benchmark for millions 
of consumer and small business loans, to 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said he looked for another quarter-point rate hike at the  
Fed's next meeting on Aug. 24, then probably a third increase 
either at the Oct. 5 meeting or on Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Other economists said they were not so sure of the follow-up  
rate hikes, arguing that the Fed may be content with just one 
increase if the economy shows signs of slowing on its own. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyss said even if the Fed ends up needing to boost rates three  
times for a total increase of 0.75 percentage point, that should 
not be enough to threaten an end to the current expansion, already 
the longest in peacetime history at eight years and counting. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they succeed in pre-empting inflation, they can keep this  
expansion going,'' Wyss said. ``It has been an incredible run, and 
right now you would have to say the Fed hasn't made many 
mistakes.''

<HEADLINE> Job Security Tops Boeing Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- Job security was expected to be the biggest  
issue on the table as contract talks between Boeing Co. and its 
largest union got under way. 
</P>
<P>
	``Job security is primary. The company is in a downsizing mode  
at this current time,'' chief union negotiator Dick Schneider said 
as negotiations began Tuesday with union officials handing their 
contract proposal to the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing plans to reduce its 231,000 workforce companywide to  
about 205,000 workers by the end of this year. By the end of the 
year 2000, Boeing plans to reduce its workforce to between 185,000 
and 195,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Schneider said the union aims to preserve existing jobs and, if  
possible, bring back work that Boeing has already subcontracted to 
outside workers. But he said outsourcing work to cheaper labor 
outside the United States was not a major issue in the 1999 talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are doing so to compete in the global marketplace,''  
Schneider said. ``They have a tough competitor out there with 
Airbus. We in the union don't live in a vacuum. We recognize that 
terrible and serious problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiators presented a positive joint front at a news  
conference Tuesday at union headquarters in Wichita. 
</P>
<P>
	Schneider said negotiators are further ahead now at the start of  
talks than they have ever been since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing negotiator Jerry Calhoun agreed, telling reporters the  
company and union have been working on a positive relationship for 
the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``These negotiations really aren't just about contract language.  
They are about people -- real people, their lives and the families 
that go with those members and our employees,'' Calhoun said. ``And 
these negotiations have to be about people for us to succeed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schneider said the union hopes to reach an amicable agreement,  
but it ready to strike, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace  
Workers, which represents 49,300 Boeing workers, has struck Boeing 
in the two of the last three negotiations: for 69 days in 1996 and 
for 48 days in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both sides are being very positive. They have a few problems  
which I think they are both willing to negotiate and come to a 
mutual agreement,'' said Dave Richardson, an analyst at Aviation 
Data Service, a Wichita-based aviation research company. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last time, there was a lot of animosity on both sides,'' he  
said. ``The new management at Boeing is more approachable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing cannot afford to have another strike with today's  
competition from Airbus, Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that the union has presented its proposal, preliminary  
negotiations are scheduled to start in Seattle between July 6 and 
Aug. 16, with collective bargaining to follow. 
</P>
<P>
	The current 44-month labor agreement expires Sept. 2. That  
contract covers 36,000 workers in the state of Washington, 11,500 
workers in Wichita and 1,800 workers in Portland, Ore.

<HEADLINE> Latin America Oil Cos. Plan Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Latin America's two largest oil  
companies, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. and Brazil's Petrobras, on 
Tuesday signed a letter of intent paving the way towards 
establishing a joint company. 
</P>
<P>
	The document was signed at a news conference in Rio de Janeiro  
by Petrobras president Henri Philippe Reichstul, and PDVSA vice 
president for planning Hector Cialvaldini. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter set out five key areas of cooperation, including  
refining and selling both countries' crude oil, and said they would 
be the ``starting point to establish the economic viability of a 
joint company, called Petroamerica.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It said that a working group would be set up to evaluate the  
creation of a joint-run company and would report to the presidents 
of PDVSA and Petrobras ``before the end of the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the news conference, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said  
PDVSA and Petrobras were showing ``a clear strategic vision for 
South America,'' and that he was ``convinced the concrete unity 
between Venezuela and Brazil is vital.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez said he hoped other countries in the region would soon be  
part of the project, and said he had opened negotiations with the 
presidents of Mexico, Equador and Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spoke to Equador President Jamil Mahuad last night and he  
showed himself to be very motivated by the idea,'' Chavez said. He 
added that he had received similar reactions from Mexican President 
Ernesto Zedillo and Colombian President Andres Pastrana. 
</P>
<P>
	The presidents were in Rio on Monday and Tuesday for a summit of  
leaders of Latin American, European and Caribbean countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of Brazil and Venezuela creating a joint oil company  
was first suggested in 1995, by Brazil's current President Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso, and his then Venezuelan counterpart Rafael 
Caldera. 
</P>
<P>
	Petrobras currently produces around 1.2 million barrels of crude  
oil per day, while PDVSA produces around 2.8 million per day.

<HEADLINE> Jurors Deliberate Columbia/HCA Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Jurors began deliberating Tuesday in the  
fraud trial of four hospital executives charged with bilking 
Medicare and other health insurance programs of nearly $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	A panel of four women and eight men will review evidence and  
testimony from the seven-week trial that involves four employees of 
Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., the nation's largest hospital chain. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue is whether the defendants knew the their legal duty  
and knowing it, violated it,'' defense attorney William Jung said, 
adding that his client, Carl Lynn Dick, followed the legal advice 
he was given. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick is charged with one count of conspiring to defraud Medicare  
and Medicaid, the tax-supported health insurance programs for the 
elderly, disabled and poor; and CHAMPUS, medical insurance for the 
military. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Whiteside, Jay Jarrell and Michael Neeb each are charged  
with seven counts of conspiracy and fraud for allegedly cheating 
the programs. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Whiteside, Jarrell and Neeb could face maximum  
sentences each of 35 years in prison and $1.75 million in fines. 
Dick could face five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> San Diego Seeks End To Beach Nudity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A remote strip of pristine sand long labeled  
America's most popular -- yet unofficial -- nude beach is covering 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of tolerating sunbathers in the buff, the city of  
San Diego is again trying to enforce a decades-old prohibition 
against nudity at Black's Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Some who frequent the 1,500-foot stretch of coastline in the  
wealthy enclave of La Jolla have complained about an increase in 
sexual behavior and expansion of the nude beach boundaries by the 
clothing-optional set. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's happened is that it's become a place where  
exhibitionists go,'' said longtime resident Melinda Merryweather. 
``You can't take children down there and leave your kids on the 
beach when you go out in the water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The city is seeking to drive nudists north to Torrey Pines State  
Park, where nudity is still permitted on more then two miles of 
state-owned beach property. 
</P>
<P>
	As of July 1, those who bare all on city property risk a  
citation and a $135 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a misperception by some that because we turned a  
blind eye to nudity that they could get away with other activity,'' 
said Scott Tillson, chief of staff for Councilman Harry Mathis, who 
represents the La Jolla area. 
</P>
<P>
	This isn't a new issue at Black's Beach, named for a founding  
family of La Jolla but officially known as Torrey Pines Beach. The 
southern portion of the property near Scripps Pier belongs to the 
city; the northern part belongs to the state. The dividing line is 
the city's clifftop park for hang gliders. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1974, the city decided to allow nudity at the beach, but  
voters reversed the ordinance in 1977. Ever since, San Diego's 
lifeguards have sporadically enforced the ban but generally turned 
a blind eye to nudists. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem isn't unique to Black's Beach.  
</P>
<P>
	Officials in Sandy Hook, N.J., are cracking down on nudity at  
South Gunnison Beach, where reports of lewd acts and sex crimes 
involving children rose when it was listed on the Internet. 
Thousands of visitors now visit the once quiet hideaway for 
naturists, coming from as far away as Connecticut and Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Hanauer, a freelance writer who compiles an annual guide to  
California's nude beaches, said nudists fear that the 
clothing-optional zone will get too crowded. 
</P>
<P>
	Black's Beach hasn't been overwhelmed. Those who routinely visit  
the beach say complaints are exaggerated and a live-and-let-live 
attitude prevails. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't bother me at all,'' said Steve DiPalma, surfing at  
the beach Monday in a full-body wetsuit. DiPalma, 37, a substitute 
teacher who has surfed twice a week for more than 10 years at 
Black's Beach, said he's never seen any lewd conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	A topless sunbather agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been offended by anything that's gone on down  
here,'' said Mindy Duncan, 28, a San Diego department store 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-nudity signs were posted last week, and beachgoers already  
seem to be getting the message. On a recent afternoon there wasn't 
a single person au natural on the city section, while about two 
dozen unclothed sunbathers, mostly men, relaxed on the state-owned 
portion of the beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Wisniewski, a 42-year-old dispatcher for the San Diego Water  
Department, said he will simply throw on a pair of shorts when he 
strolls along the city-patrolled section. But he doesn't think 
he'll have to do it for long. 
</P>
<P>
	``It won't last,'' he said of the al fresco crackdown. ``They'll  
give up after this season. They always do.''

<HEADLINE> Rockets Reject Olajuwon Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The Houston Rockets listened to their hearts  
Tuesday -- and possibly avoided a major public relations blunder -- 
when they refused a trade offer from the Toronto Raptors for Hakeem 
Olajuwon, one of the city's most recognizable athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Loyalty to the 12-time NBA All-Star was a factor in the Rockets  
declining Toronto's offers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe in those things,'' coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``It  
would be very hard for me to be the guy who pulls the trigger on 
something like that. We've been through a lot together. I'd hope 
that a situation like that doesn't come along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Houston Chronicle and The Toronto Sun reported Tuesday the  
teams were discussing a trade for the 36-year-old Olajuwon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I approached Houston and inquired about his availability, but  
they said no,'' Raptors general manager Glen Grunwald said from 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal reportedly would have involved Kevin Willis, who played  
two seasons with the Rockets before he was traded to Toronto last 
June for Roy Rogers and two first-round draft picks. Willis, 36, 
averaged 12 points and 8.3 rebounds last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports said Houston also would have gotten swingman Doug  
Christie, 29, who played 3 1/2 seasons for the Los Angeles Lakers and 
New York Knicks before spending the last three seasons in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomjanovich said he regretted word of the negotiations became  
public. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tough part of the business,'' Tomjanovich said. ``I  
hate it when things like this come out. It hurts people. I'm 
talking about this because it leaked out. I talked to Hakeem today. 
I told him there was no deal and how I felt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olajuwon said he might consider retirement before accepting a  
trade with two years remaining on his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in Houston 19 years and I don't see myself being  
anywhere else,'' Olajuwon said. ``That is something that when you 
get to that bridge you have to cross.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olajuwon's comments were made on the Fox Network program ``The  
Last Word.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olajuwon said he felt good after talking with Rockets coach Rudy  
Tomjanovich. 
</P>
<P>
	``This morning, I was surprised, people were calling the house  
early this morning to find out what was going on,'' Olajuwon said. 
``I am happy because I talked to coach Rudy Tomjanovich and we have 
a great relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had an open conversation. If anything is done, it will be  
done the right way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tomjanovich admitted, however, that the Rockets listened to the  
Raptors but no deal resulted. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets won consecutive NBA titles in 1994 and 1995 but have  
been eliminated from the playoffs in the first round the past two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Olajuwon, whose contract runs through the 2000-2001 season, was  
the Rockets' No. 1 pick in 1984 and became the team's centerpiece. 
He is on the NBA's 50 greatest players list and is one of three 
players in NBA history with 24,000 points, 12,000 rebounds and 
2,500 assists.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Confidence at 30-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Consumer confidence rose in June to its highest  
level in more than 30 years, signaling even stronger economic 
growth ahead, the Conference Board reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures were released as Federal Reserve policy-makers were  
beginning a two-day meeting in Washington, where they were widely 
expected to boost interest rates in a bid to cool off the economy 
and prevent inflation from rekindling. 
</P>
<P>
	Mortgage rates already have been rising for two months, and that  
apparently has begun putting a damper on home sales. The Commerce 
Department reported today that sales of new homes fell 5.1 percent 
in May -- double what analysts had been expecting. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 888,000 units  
in May, down from an April sales pace of 936,000 units, the 
department said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rise in the consumer confidence index to 138.4 in June from  
a revised 137.7 in May was the eighth consecutive monthly increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynn Franco, associate director of the Conference Board's  
Consumer Research Center, said the report indicates that ``current 
confidence levels point to even stronger economic growth next year 
than previously projected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She added: ``The key ingredient is the labor market. That  
remains extremely strong, and that gives consumers confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Thayer, chief economist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St.  
Louis, noted that most analysts expect the Fed to raise rates at 
this week's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Historically, the Fed's job is to take the punch bowl away  
from the party,'' Thayer said. A rise in rates ``could cause 
(consumer) expectations to cool off a bit,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets showed little reaction to today's figures as  
traders awaited the Fed's announcement Wednesday. The Dow Jones 
industrial average was barely changed at midmorning. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer sentiment is an important economic indicator because  
consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's overall 
economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report released Monday, the Commerce Department said that  
consumer spending outpaced income in May, sending the nation's 
savings rate to an all-time low. 
</P>
<P>
	Such strong spending has been the major factor pushing U.S.  
economic growth. But the Fed has begun to worry that tight labor 
markets will soon increase wage pressures and lead to higher 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board said that June's reading was the highest  
since the all-time record for the index of 142.3 set in October 
1968. 
</P>
<P>
	The June figures was well above analysts' average expectations  
of a reading of 136.1 for the index. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest report from the business-financed research group also  
indicated that consumers were optimistic about the future. 
</P>
<P>
	A companion gauge indicating expectations over the next six  
months rose in June to 114.9 from a revised 111.3 in May, the 
report said. The June reading was the highest since 116.2 in June 
1998, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there was some slippage in consumers' confidence about  
business conditions. Just slightly more than 40 percent termed them 
good in June, down from 44.3 percent in May. Some 9.6 percent of 
those surveyed rated them ``bad'' in June, up from 8.3 percent the 
month before. 
</P>
<P>
	Optimism about job opportunities also weakened, with 41.8  
percent saying jobs were not so plentiful in June, up from 39.9 
percent in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer confidence index, started in 1967, is compiled from  
responses to questions sent to 5,000 households nationwide. The 
survey polls consumers on matters ranging from job prospects to 
buying plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The index compares results to its base year, 1985, when it stood  
at 100.

<HEADLINE> Krause Eyed as NBA Draft Nears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- This NBA draft isn't about Elton Brand's true  
height, Steve Francis' vertical leap, Wally Szczerbiak's jumper or 
Lamar Odom's whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
	It's about Jerry Krause's secret plan to rebuild his dynasty.  
</P>
<P>
	As the clock ticked toward the moment Wednesday night when  
commissioner David Stern will walk to the podium and announce the 
No. 1 pick, the general manager of the Chicago Bulls had everyone 
on edge. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nerve wracking,'' Francis said Tuesday. ``It's the last  
day, and you hear so many rumors and so much that's going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Francis and Brand have emerged as the consensus choices for the  
No. 1 pick. Szczerbiak, Odom and UCLA guard Baron Davis are widely 
considered to be top-five choices. 
</P>
<P>
	But the order of selection -- the first five being Chicago,  
Vancouver, Charlotte, the Los Angeles Clippers and Toronto -- 
figured to change by time the draft begins. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a mystery to me, just like every other player is really  
wondering here they're going,'' Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Krause has been talking to numerous teams to explore dozens of  
trade options, and most people around the league expected him to 
deal the No. 1 pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``He holds the key,'' NBA scouting director Marty Blake said.  
``But he's not going to give any hints as to what he's going to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For weeks, the widespread belief was that the secretive Krause  
had his eyes on Szczerbiak, the smooth shooting forward from Miami 
of Ohio. The one rumor that has refused to die had Krause trading 
the No. 1 pick to Toronto, with the Raptors giving up the fifth 
pick and Tracy McGrady. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a very good possibility that we will not make any  
decision on the draft choice until Wednesday afternoon,'' said 
Krause, who is trying to rebuild the Bulls following the breakup of 
the team that won three straight titles from 1996-98. ``We don't 
feel there's an advantage to us to making it sooner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said coach Tim Floyd: ``If somebody knocks Jerry out with a  
trade, then I'm sure we'll have to look at it and go that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Statements like those were the reason why all the top players  
had a greater air of uncertainty about them than usual on the day 
before the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the comments were downright odd: Brand sounding eager to  
play for Vancouver; Szczerbiak saying he would ``love'' to play for 
the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chicago's in more of a rebuilding stage,'' said Brand the  
college player of the year, ``They don't have superstar-level 
talent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vancouver has Mike Bibby at the point, Felipe Lopez had a  
stellar year. I think surprised some people. Then you've got 
Shareef Abdur-Rahim and Big Country (Bryant Reeves) down low. I 
think I could fit in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, who left Duke after his sophomore season, is a 6-foot-8  
forward who played center in college and averaged 17.7 points and 
9.8 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis, a 6-3 guard, averaged 17.0 points for Maryland and  
skipped his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, a 6-2 point guard from UCLA, figures to be chosen no  
lower than fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Szczerbiak, a 6-7 forward, should be chosen no lower than fifth.  
</P>
<P>
	Aside from Krause's maneuverings, another big draft uncertainty  
was Odom. 
</P>
<P>
	A 6-10 phenom from Rhode Island who could play three positions  
in the pros, Odom may have hurt his stock by declaring for the 
draft, then trying to pull out. He then missed several workouts 
scheduled by NBA teams. 
</P>
<P>
	He was not on time for Tuesday's media availability session held  
by the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lamar is a great kid. I don't understand what's going on. No  
one does,'' Szczerbiak said. ``He's probably going through a real 
tough time. He's probably very indecisive, probably has a lot of 
people pulling him in all kinds of different directions and he's 
probably like a rubber band about to snap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rounding out the top 10 draft slots are Minnesota, Washington,  
Cleveland, Phoenix and Golden State, who will likely be choosing 
among Jonathan Bender of Picayune High School in Mississippi, 
guards Jason Terry of Arizona, Richard Hamilton of Connecticut, 
Andre Miller of Utah and William Avery of Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	Lottery teams Cleveland, Toronto and Seattle will choose 11th,  
12th and 13th, and the rest of the first round includes four picks 
for Atlanta (Nos. 17, 20, 21 and 27) and three for Utah (19, 24 and 
28). 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen a draft where more people in the late first  
round were willing to deal their first-round picks,'' Wizards 
general manager Wes Unseld said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's just feeling each other out, throwing a lot of  
stuff against the wall, trying to see what sticks. For me, it's as 
thick as I've seen it. I'm not getting a straight answer from 
anyone. Maybe because nobody has any.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago (Nos. 1 and 16), Toronto (5 and 12), Cleveland (8 and  
11) and Minnesota (6 and 14) have two picks apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas, New Jersey, Sacramento, Milwaukee, Philadelphia,  
Detroit, Orlando and Portland do not have first-round picks. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery worked out last week for the New York Knicks, who choose  
15th. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said they were thinking about trading up and doing some  
things, but a lot of teams are,'' Avery said. ``That's why tomorrow 
night's going to be an interesting night.''

<HEADLINE> Small Producers Lead Wine Revolt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AYIOS AMVROSIOS, Cyprus (AP) -- George and Ioanna Yiallouros took  
up wine making to escape city life. Ioanna and Iannis Ioannides are 
in it because they love making wine. 
</P>
<P>
	Both couples are part of an explosion of small wineries in  
Cyprus' grape-growing region on the southern and southwestern 
slopes of the Troodos mountain chain. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the small wineries, nearly 40 in all, have sprung up in  
the past 10 years on this sunny island at the eastern end of the 
Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
	The newcomers have given depth to the industry by introducing  
new labels and making high-quality wines and are becoming a source 
of worry to larger, older wineries as well as wine importers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Making wine was the only way to earn a living in this part of  
Cyprus,'' said Ioanna Yiallouros, who together with her husband, 
George, left the capital, Nicosia, in 1988 for the tiny village of 
Ayios Amvrosios in the heart of the grape-growing region of Cyprus. 
They now own a winery that produces 120,000 bottles a year. 
</P>
<P>
	A short drive across the hills is the village of Kilani, where  
Ioanna and Iannis Ioannides produce 50,000 to 60,000 bottles a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly don't need more money,'' said Ioanna, 60, whose  
physician husband has a practice in the coastal city of Limassol. 
``We have for years been making wine at home for ourselves and 
friends, then we attended a course in oenology, read a lot about 
wine and started the winery in 1983.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christos Lambouris, a 57-year-old vineyard owner in the mountain  
village of Platres, became a full-time wine maker in 1998 after 35 
years with the island's electricity company. He produces 20,000 
bottles a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is good that we have many wineries now. It means that  
everyone must compete to improve,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such operations are dwarfed by wineries like KEO, the largest in  
Cyprus, with a storage capacity of nearly 12 million gallons. The 
other main wineries are ETKO, LOEL and SODAP. 
</P>
<P>
	The newcomers have entered the market as a growing number of  
their countrymen are switching to wine from brandy and whisky with 
their food. Cyprus's 700,000 people now drink on average about 3 1/4 
gallons of wine a year -- less than half the consumption in other 
wine-producing countries in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The island has also attracted an average of 2 million tourists  
every year in the 1990s, and their consumption has helped boost 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	But while domestic consumption has moved up to about 2 million  
gallons a year, exports have slipped steadily from 13 million 
gallons in 1995 to 6.3 million gallons last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Trade and Industry Ministry cited the island's distance from  
consumption centers, EU subsidies to member-states and high import 
tariffs as factors contributing to the export slump. 
</P>
<P>
	``Market conditions are very difficult and we must reduce our  
costs and further improve the quality of our wines,'' said Sotiris 
Theothosiou, chairman of the industry's regulatory body, the Vine 
Products Commission.

	Kurdish Rebel Leader Sentenced to Death  
</P>
<P>
	IMRALI ISLAND, Turkey (AP) -- Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah  
Ocalan was sentenced to death today, a widely expected verdict 
against the guerrilla leader that many Turks hold responsible for 
37,000 deaths in 15 years of war. Ocalan looked somber but said 
nothing as Judge Turgut Okyay read out the sentence by the 
three-judge panel. The families of Turkish soldiers killed fighting 
the rebels began singing the national anthem after Okyay finished 
reading the verdict. The relatives were in court as part of a civil 
suit. The three-judge panel found Ocalan guilty of treason and 
separatism for leading a bloody conflict for Kurdish autonomy in 
southeastern Turkey.

	Swiss Bank To Divide Holocaust Fund  
</P>
<P>
	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- After years of waiting, tens of  
thousands of Holocaust survivors and heirs of victims were told 
today how a $1.25 billion fund set up by two Swiss banks will be 
divided among them. The fund was established more than 10 months 
ago after an out-of-court settlement between the banks and 31,000 
plaintiffs listed in a class action suit. Lawyers and Jewish 
organizations in seven countries began laying out plans today to 
find additional claimants and distribute the money. Mel Erlbach, a 
lawyer for the plaintiffs, told a Tel Aviv news conference that the 
plan would address financial -- not moral -- restitution for Jewish 
victims of the Holocaust.

	Russia Facing Poor Grain Harvest  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia is again facing a poor harvest and will  
probably need food imports to make up for the low yield, an 
agriculture analyst said today. With just 51 million tons of grain 
expected, Russia at best will have just 1 million tons of grain to 
restock its reserves this year, said Anatoly Altukhov, head of the 
Agricultural Economics Institute. As a result, the country will 
have to import as much as 6 million tons of food-quality grain, he 
said. Russia is likely to need imports of feed grain as well, he 
said.

	East Timor Factions Reach Deal  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- East Timor's rival factions have  
reached agreement on the thorny issue of how to give up their 
weapons ahead of a planned independence referendum, negotiators in 
Jakarta said today. ``The problem of disarmament has been 
resolved,'' Leandro Isaac, a pro-independence leader, told The 
Associated Press as talks entered a fourth day. His statement was 
confirmed by an anti-independence backer, Herminio da Silva da

	Serb Clerics Appeal to West Leaders  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serb clerics are appealing to  
Western leaders to curb reprisal attacks by ethnic Albanians, 
warning the violence could produce an ethnically pure Kosovo -- 
which NATO fought its air war to prevent. NATO is hoping the 
attacks against Kosovo's Serbs will subside now that ethnic 
Albanian rebels turned over their weapons to peacekeepers as part 
of the June 21 agreement by the Kosovo Liberation Army to 
demilitarize over 90 days. Under the deal, KLA fighters were to 
have put their weapons into NATO-guarded storage sites and they can 
carry them only in designated assembly areas.

	DRAS, India (AP) -- The Indian army recaptured a towering peak  
close to the frontier with Pakistan in a fierce battle after dawn 
today that claimed dozens of casualties, officers said. Infantrymen 
clambered up Point 4700, the 15,500-foot peak known by its height 
in meters, and stormed the 13 guerrilla positions on the mountain 
three miles from the Line of Control, the 1972 cease-fire line 
dividing the disputed province of Kashmir between India and 
Pakistan. The Pakistan-based guerrillas retreated, but then 
launched a counterattack.

<HEADLINE> Corn, Soybeans Mostly Up; Wheat Off / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Corn and soybean futures finished mostly higher  
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, while wheat futures 
retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans failed to hold early sharp gains despite  
forecasts for temperatures to soar this weekend into the 90s and 
100s across major Midwest growing regions. Investors were skeptical 
the hot, dry weather would linger enough to severely damage crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures are entering the crucial pollination stage, and  
typically require moderately warm temperatures and ample soil 
moisture for kernels to develop properly. Soybeans are more hardy 
and are likely to survive short-term temperatures spikes with ease, 
agronomists said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures retreated after the rally in soybeans and corn  
fizzled. Market participants also noted the hot, dry weather should 
allow much-delayed harvesting of winter wheat to get back on track. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for September delivery fell 2 cents to $2.63 3/4 a bushel;  
September corn rose 3/4 cent to $2.15 a bushel; September oats rose 1 
cent to $1.14 3/4 a bushel; November soybeans rose 3/4 cent to $4.56 1/4 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork futures fell sharply on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange;  
beef futures advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle rose 0.60 cent to 62.70 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose 0.05 cent to 75.97 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs fell 2 cents to 46.32 cents a pound; August pork bellies fell 
2.07 cents to 39.32 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Airlines Y2K Status Unclear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The global deadline was Thursday for countries  
to report the readiness of their airlines and airports for the Year 
2000 computer problem, but the traveling public won't know any 
results until later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N.-based  
group responsible for international aviation standards, asked its 
185 member nations to answer a questionnaire about their readiness 
by July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Aviation experts expect the United States and many countries in  
Europe and the developed areas of Asia to be ready, but the biggest 
problems may occur in developing nations, which were slow in 
committing attention and resources to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Denis Chagnon, a spokesman for the civil aviation organization,  
said in an interview last week, ``The response was slow getting off 
the mark, but ... I think the response will pick up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department and the Federal Aviation Administration  
plan to use the data to issue travel advisories starting in mid- to 
late July. The two agencies also hope to gain insight from the 
International Air Transport Association, a trade group that 
represents 265 international airlines. It has been conducting a 
private survey of airline readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	Because both sets of information are self-reported and won't be  
available for public inspection, it's unclear how reliable and 
useful it may be. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hoped that between the two of them, we might get some  
kind of picture into readiness,'' said FAA spokesman Paul Takemoto. 
``The accuracy of that picture is yet to be determined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K problem is a glitch that may cause computers to  
malfunction beginning Jan. 1. Some older computers recognize years 
in a two-digit format, such as ``00,'' so they may confuse 2000 
with 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA has been criticized for its slow start in addressing the  
problem, but it said all its vital computer systems will be 
repaired and ready to handle the changeover by Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Airports around the world are seen as susceptible to Y2K  
problems because they rely on outside services, from electricity to 
local phone service. Regardless of the repairs an airport makes to 
its own computers and on-site backup systems, the services in its 
terminals or along its baggage belts may be vulnerable to problems 
off the airport property. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. airlines and the government have also been eager to gauge  
overseas readiness. Many U.S. carriers have partnerships with 
foreign airlines, so they need to ensure a smooth transfer of their 
passengers over the post-holiday travel period. Also, the 
government wants to make sure that foreign airfields are safe for 
U.S.-registered aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	International airlines are picking up the pace of their work and  
expect to spend $2.3 billion overall readying their computer 
systems, said Kevin Dobby, senior director at the International Air 
Transport Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines have already passed one critical test: Their computers  
have started processing reservations for flights next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not out of the woods, but we're encouraged by what we're  
starting to see,'' Dobby said. ``We spent a lot of time trying to 
raise awareness, and it appears that we have been successful at 
that.''

<HEADLINE> AOL To Unveil Version 5.0 This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DULLES, Va. (AP) -- America Online Inc., the world's largest  
Internet access provider, will soon unveil AOL 5.0, software that 
promises faster registration, easier setup and enables users to 
send photos as easily as e-mail, the company said today in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL, based in Dulles, Va., said version 5.0 will begin beta  
testing within a few weeks and will be distributed to subscribers 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>

its CompuServe subsidiary, said the new software includes a new 
Welcome Screen, with direct access to the AOL Channel Guide, e-mail 
and top news headlines. 
</P>
<P>
	New features include ``You've Got Pictures,'' developed in  
partnership with Eastman Kodak, for photo sharing; ``My Calendar,'' 
an interactive calendar; and ``My Places,'' which will allow 
members to personalize their welcome screens with their favorite 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL 5.0 will also support e-mail use on Palm electronic  
organizers. AOL and 3Com Corp. recently reached agreement on a deal 
to bundle AOL software with Palm organizers.

<HEADLINE> 1936 Olympic Diving Champ Is Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HENDERSONVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Marshall Wayne, an Olympic diver  
whose gold and silver medals in the 1936 Games in Berlin upset 
Adolf Hitler, died earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne was 87 when he suffered a cerebral hemorrhage June 16  
while typing at his computer at home. 
</P>
<P>
	His sister, Dever Antes, said Wayne spoke with Hitler after he  
won the springboard diving silver medal and the gold in platform 
diving. The German leader was especially unhappy with Wayne's gold 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hitler wanted his man from Germany to win it, so he wasn't too  
happy at all seeing my brother win,'' Antes said. 
</P>
<P>
	German Hermann Stork took the bronze and another German, Erhard  
Weiss, was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitler had hoped the Berlin Olympics would serve as a showcase  
for his theory of Aryan supremacy and he was also upset when Jesse 
Owens, a black American, won four gold medals in the track 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne returned from the Berlin Olympics to his family home in  
Miami but returned to Europe as a colonel in the Army Air Force in 
World War II. During his service, his plane was shot down in Italy 
and Italians helped the injured American get to a British Aid 
Station and then to England for surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	He later worked as a Pan American Airways pilot. Wayne retired  
as captain in 1972 and moved to Hendersonville to be near his 
sister.

<HEADLINE> Braves' Smoltz Leaves Game After 5 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Atlanta Braves starter John Smoltz left Tuesday  
night's 6-5 loss to the Montreal Expos with stiffness in his right 
elbow after throwing 67 pitches in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully it will calm down and I'll be ready to go on  
Sunday,'' Smoltz said. ``As a starter, whether you feel good or 
not, you never want to just go five but I have to be prepared for 
these kind of situations. No matter how much I'm prepared for it, 
it's never easy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz, who didn't factor in the decision, hit an RBI single in  
the fifth to tie the game at 1 and left the game with a 3-1 lead. 
He allowed one run and three hits and struck out four as Vladimir 
Guerrero's three-run homer capped the Expos' five-run rally off 
reliever John Rocker in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	``All things considered, it's been a frustrating day,'' Smoltz  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz was making his sixth start since returning from the  
disabled list on June 1 after suffering an inflamed right elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the way the year's going to go for me,'' Smoltz said.  
``There's going to be some good ones and some bad ones. When you've 
relied so many years on doing the same thing, it takes time to have 
it sink in that you have to do things differently. Sometimes you 
have to be taken out. So, for the long haul, these things have to 
be considered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz, who is 8-2 in 14 starts, lowered his ERA to 3.03,  
third-best in the NL behind Los Angeles' Kevin Brown (2.89) and 
Houston's Mike Hampton (3.02).

<HEADLINE> RealNetworks Adds Slide Show Audio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- RealNetworks Inc. is venturing into the world of  
sound-enhanced slide shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle-based company today announced software that will  
enable computer users to make sequential displays of images, 
accompanied with sound, that can be played on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The free software, called RealSlideshow, lets home computer  
users make family photo albums, wedding albums, personal movies and 
advertisements, the company said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	Businesses can use it for apartment tours on the Internet, as  
well as product promotions, online auctions and photojournalism 
reports, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, the ability to make slide shows with sound has  
required programming, said Ben Rotholtz, general manager of the 
company's systems and tools division. 
</P>
<P>
	The software allows fixed images in the popular JPEG or BMP  
formats to be synchronized with audio. Audio can be recorded from 
CDs, a microphone or WAV files, and automatically mutes when spoken 
captions describing the slides are recorded. 
</P>
<P>
	Slide shows can be played only from Web sites hosted by Internet  
Service Providers that own RealServer.

<HEADLINE> X Games Street Luge Takes to Hills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The speed limit on the hill that drops past  
the Cliff House to Ocean Beach is 25 mph. Double that, lie flat on 
your back on a souped-up skateboard and head for the bottom -- with 
no brakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Congratulations, you've just experienced street luge -- one of  
the more ``extreme'' sports that make up ESPN's X Games. 
</P>
<P>
	While skateboarding and bicycle stunt riding events require  
style and creativity, street luge places a premium on speed and 
survival, with just hay bales lining the unbanked turns of a course 
that drops hundreds of feet in 6/10 of a mile. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot rougher than I thought it would be,'' said pro  
rider Dave Rogers after his first practice run. Coming out of the 
Cliff House turn at high speed will make the difference in the 
finals this weekend, he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're not clean coming out of there, it's pretty much  
over,'' Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The luges are aluminum frames with a steel seat on which the  
rider reclines on his back. Four large urethane wheels provide the 
road traction. Steering is done by leaning to shift body weight. 
</P>
<P>
	If you've got shoes, you've got brakes -- hard stops can  
literally leave the riders' feet smoking. Full-body leather racing 
suits and motorcycle helmets are worn for protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Derammelaere took first place in Saturday's competition,  
winning in 41.873. Lee Dansie was second with a time of 43.818, and 
Biker Sherlock was third, completing the run in 40.967. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to see somebody wipe out,'' said Benny Farber, 9, of  
Redwood City, Calif., as he watched the riders speed past the first 
turn with his father and younger sister. 
</P>
<P>
	Another spectator, Joe Goebel, born and raised in San Francisco,  
watched the runs and reminisced about the days in the late '60s 
when he and his friends made the same run on skateboards. The high 
speeds of the professional riders amazed him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nuts. I mean nuts in a good way,'' Goebel said. He  
applauded the talents of the younger riders, but got a little 
territorial as he took in the detoured traffic and media glitz that 
accompanied the competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my 'hood, and this is our run,'' Goebel smiled.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Mixed in Quiet Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar was mixed against major currencies  
Tuesday as traders awaited the outcome of a two-day meeting of the 
Federal Reserve Board's policy-making committee. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0320, down  
from $1.0351 late Monday. The dollar also was quoted at 121.06 
Japanese yen, down from 121.21. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed governors began their meeting Tuesday with the expectation  
that, as Fed chairman Alan Greenspan hinted earlier this month, the 
central bank may nudge interest rates higher in a preemptive move 
to head off inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	But some uncertainty over the size of the increase, and whether  
it would be followed by others, made many players in the currency 
market reluctant to move aggressively in trading the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5507 Swiss francs, up from  
1.5450, and 1.4779 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4683. The British 
pound fell to $1.5751 from $1.5823. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8950 German 
marks, up from 1.8896; 6.3573 French francs, up from 6.3371; and 
1,876.17 Italian lire, up from 1,869.16.

<HEADLINE> Nikkei Hits Record High / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's key stock index hit its highest close this  
year following the release of data showing a drop in Japan's 
unemployment rate. The dollar slipped against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 172.21 points,  
or 0.98 percent, to close at 17,782.79. On Monday, the average 
closed up 174.06 points, or 1 percent. The previous closing high 
was 17,777.62 points on June 22. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.26 in late trading, down 0.02 yen from  
late Monday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 121.21 
yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, traders said the better than expected  
jobless data led some investors to buy. That pushed the Nikkei 
average to its best close this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Management and Coordination Agency announced today that  
Japan's unemployment rate eased to 4.6 percent in May from a record 
high 4.8 percent in the previous two months, as some jobless people 
stopped looking for work. 
</P>
<P>
	When people stop seeking work, they are no longer counted in the  
labor force in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the agency said spending by Japanese wage earners  
in May was 336,354 yen ($2,780) on average, up 1.5 percent from the 
year earlier month in real terms despite declining incomes. 
</P>
<P>
	Also supporting share prices was an overnight rise on Wall  
Street ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate committee 
meeting, scheduled to begin later today, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed is widely expected to nudge interest rates higher during  
the two day meeting, but Wall Street investors surmised it would 
only be a small increase and kept buying. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 102.59 points, or 1  
percent, to 10,655.15 at Monday's finish. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 474.43 million shares changed hands on the first  
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange on today, up from 336.84 
million shares the day before. Declines outnumbered advances 593 to 
571, while 147 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section closed up 7.78 points, or 0.55 percent, to 1,425.24. 
The TOPIX closed up 8.05 points, or 0.57 percent, on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar drifted down as investors took  
to the sidelines to await the results of the Fed's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	It had gotten a small boost early in the day from data showing a  
drop in Japan's industrial production output, but the information 
was not enough to give new direction to the exchange rate, traders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ministry of International Trade and Industry's released  
preliminary industrial production data for May showing a 0.7 
percent drop in output from April. Market expectations had been for 
a 1.0 percent rise. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 125.48 yen, down  
from 126.43 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.8000 percent from 1.7800 percent late Monday in 
Tokyo, pushing its price down to 100.00 yen from 100.17 yen.

<HEADLINE> New Trial in Pa. Radiation Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a new trial  
in a lawsuit against uranium plant operators who lost a $36.5 
million judgment to the families of cancer victims 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Donetta Ambrose ruled that some testimony  
was prejudicial and evidence was improperly withheld from lawyers 
for the companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents say they inhaled white radioactive dust from the plant  
for three decades. The dust contained uranium that caused an 
unusually high cancer rate, according to residents of Apollo, about 
25 miles northeast of Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant shut down in 1986, and residents sued in 1994.  
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for plant operators Atlantic Richfield Co. and Babcock  
and Wilcox Co. argued that nobody could prove a medical link 
between the radiation and cancers. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury disagreed last September and ordered the companies to pay  
$36.5 million in compensatory damages. Plaintiff's attorneys called 
it the largest award for radiation exposure in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Ambrose ordered a new trial on the sole issue of whether  
violations of federal standards caused emissions which in turn 
caused cancers including leukemia. She said evidence including 
testimony from scientists who linked the violations to the cancers 
was ``highly prejudicial and often irrelevant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ambrose, who presided over the original trial, said she agreed  
with arguments from company attorneys that no juror could ``remain 
unaffected by that evidence.''

	BRIGHAM CITY, Utah (AP) -- A man accused of whipping his  
16-year-old daughter for fleeing an arranged, polygamous marriage 
to her uncle was sentenced to seven months in jail Tuesday for 
child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	In a case that threw a spotlight on polygamy in heavily Mormon  
Utah, John Daniel Kingston, 43, was also fined $2,700 and ordered 
to complete an anger-management program. 
</P>
<P>
	Kingston could have gotten five years in prison and a $5,000  
fine. He pleaded no contest. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a difficult but growing experience for me,''  
Kingston said. ``I do want to help (my daughter) go on with her 
life and be the good person I know she can be. And I'm sorry for 
any pain and suffering I might have caused her or anyone else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The girl said that her father, a leading member of one of Utah's  
most prominent polygamous clans, arranged for her to become the 
15th wife of his brother, David Ortell Kingston. She testified that 
she counted 28 lashes from her father's belt before she passed out. 
</P>
<P>
	The uncle was convicted June 3 of incest and will be sentenced  
July 9. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 25,000 to 35,000 polygamists live in Utah and other  
parts of the West. Most belong to offshoots of the Mormon Chruch, 
which renounced polygamy in 1890 under pressure from Congress and 
the courts.

<HEADLINE> Designer Makes Over Hospital Gowns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A designer whose dresswear is usually draped on  
runway models has put together a chic new clothing line that could 
permanently shelve the fashion faux pas that is the hospital gown. 
</P>
<P>
	Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey unveiled a  
new line of patient wear Tuesday that features zippers, drawstrings 
and buttons in place of the traditional rear-end airy slit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we fixed up our food, the gown was the No. 1 complaint,''  
said John P. Ferguson, the hospital's president. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid cheers and pumping music at The Rainbow Room, the new line  
was previewed on a runway by models who looked anything but ill. 
The duds are the creation of Cynthia Rowley, whose non-hospital 
work has been praised by fashion critics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have always believed that what one wears on the outside  
affects the way they feel about themselves on the inside,'' Rowley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital will introduce the new line in about six months.  
</P>
<P>
	Women will wear a mid-calf length gown with a mock turtleneck  
and three-quarter length sleeves with snaps. Men will wear 
drawstring pants, a short sleeve shirt and a matching robe. 
</P>
<P>
	For children, there's an ankle-length gown and drawstring pants.  
</P>
<P>
	Currently, white hospital gowns cost the hospital about $6 a  
piece. Ferguson said the price likely won't increase because the 
clothing is made out of the same material as the gowns -- cotton. 
</P>
<P>
	There will also be a selection of colors: red, white, blue,  
black and pink. 
</P>
<P>
	The patient-wear was unveiled just as Missouri lawmaker Sam  
Gaskill is pushing a bill in Congress that would require hospitals 
to provide patients with ``dignity gowns,'' which would completely 
cover the body from neck to knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaskill introduced the bill after a four-day hospital stay.

<HEADLINE> DNA Test May Uncover Lincoln Clues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- For years, the blood-spattered velvet cloak that  
Mary Todd Lincoln is believed to have worn on the night President 
Lincoln was shot has mostly hung untouched. 
</P>
<P>
	But with recent developments in DNA testing, researchers say the  
garment could reveal some of the mysteries surrounding the health 
of the nation's 16th president. 
</P>
<P>
	History buffs at the Chicago Historical Society acknowledge,  
however, that testing could destroy a valuable relic of history and 
prove false some of the stories and myths about Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question at hand is what value would DNA testing have and  
would it be worth the risks of losing a historical specimen,'' said 
Nancy Buenger, textile conservator at the society. ``We also have 
to ask: 'Do we want to know? Do we really want all these wonderful 
mysteries solved?''' 
</P>
<P>
	A group of scientists, conservators and historians met at the  
society Monday to debate those issues, and recommended that the 
institution hold off DNA testing. The society said it would 
probably abide by the panel's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	Testing could settle a long running debate on whether Lincoln  
suffered from Marfan Syndrome, a genetic disease that makes people 
susceptible to blood clots. 
</P>
<P>
	The syndrome could account for Lincoln's gangly appearance. It  
could also have proved fatal if assassin John Wilkes Booth's 
bullets at the Ford Theater had not. 
</P>
<P>
	Testing on the cloak and about a dozen other items, including  
the sheet thought to have come from Lincoln's death bed, could 
eventually help to authenticate much of the society's collection. 
</P>
<P>
	While existing documentation supports the specimens' origins, it  
is not always reliable, Buenger said. She noted that the society 
had to put away a suit -- purported to be the one Lincoln wore at 
the time of his assassination -- after evidence surfaced that 
another museum may have the real garment. 
</P>
<P>
	Buenger added that many of the objects came from the collection  
of Charles Gunther, a turn-of-the-century Chicago candy maker who 
donated ``a mixed bag'' of artifacts, including obvious hoaxes such 
as the skin of the snake from the Garden of Eden. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with DNA testing, she said, proving the blood was Lincoln's  
would be difficult since no samples have been taken from his 
remains and there are no living descendants of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Robert Gaensslen, director of Forensic Science at the  
University of Illinois at Chicago, who participated in the 
conference, said the cons of testing still outweigh the pros. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaensslen said current methods to extract DNA include cutting  
specimens or removing blood from them, while in ten years time 
scientific development might mean a harmless scan could provide the 
same results. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to be cautious before we cut,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone agrees.  
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Victor Mckusick, a medical geneticist at John Hopkins  
University who has pushed for DNA testing of Lincoln artifacts, 
said scientific developments have come so far that testing would 
only cause minimal damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The interest in finding out is tremendous,'' said Dr. Darwin  
Prockop, a gene therapy researcher at Philadelphia's MCP Hanhemann 
University. ``People are fascinated by him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Testing the cloak, Prockop said, ``could answer an important  
historical question that could go far in helping those struggling 
with the disease today.''

<HEADLINE> Independent Counsel Law To Expire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The independent counsel law, born of scandal  
and steeped in controversy at a cost of nearly $150 million so far, 
expires Wednesday at age 21. Its mourners are few. 
</P>
<P>
	The relevant provisions of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978  
once were hailed as a bipartisan response by Congress to the 
Saturday Night Massacre, in which two attorneys general resigned 
rather than carry out President Nixon's 1973 demand that Watergate 
special prosecutor Archibald Cox be fired. 
</P>
<P>
	But support for the law eroded after investigations spanning the  
administrations of four presidents -- Carter, Reagan, Bush and 
Clinton -- focused on allegations of, among other things, cocaine 
use, Mafia ties and marital infidelity. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, even Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel who for  
over four years has investigated President Clinton and his 
administration, calls his authority's source flawed beyond repair. 
He told Congress he favored the law's abolition. 
</P>
<P>
	``The statute creates a constitutional gremlin unleashed to work  
in behalf of the president's opponents,'' said Mary Cheh, a George 
Washington University law professor and fellow abolitionist. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the law is not needed because already ``there is  
congressional oversight, possible impeachment, scrutiny by the 
press and an alert public, and a president's worry about the next 
election or his place in history. Those were meant to be the real 
checks on executive misbehavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was a critic 11 years ago,  
the lone dissenter when the court upheld the independent counsel 
law in 1988. He said the law unconstitutionally gave too much power 
to men and women who were politically unaccountable. 
</P>
<P>
	The law's demise does not leave a void, but merely a return to  
pre-1978 policies. Attorney General Janet Reno says her Justice 
Department stands ready to take over the job of appointing special 
prosecutors to investigate misconduct by high-ranking government 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our regulations will be ready by July 1,'' she told reporters  
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	A more modest version of the 1978 law was introduced in Congress  
on Tuesday. The proposed Independent Counsel Reform Act of 1999, 
aimed at curtailing investigative powers and requiring greater 
accountability, is sponsored by Sens. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., Susan 
Collins, R-Maine, Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Joseph Lieberman, 
D-Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Including Starr's wide-ranging inquiry, five of the 20  
investigations launched under the law are still alive. Seven led to 
indictments; five investigations yielded at least one criminal 
conviction although some of those were overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's investigation into Clinton's Whitewater real estate  
dealings and other matters has cost nearly $40 million, according 
to the congressional General Accounting Office. Starr's Whitewater 
predecessor, independent counsel Robert Fiske, spent an additional 
$6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, the Clinton probe is on track to surpass the $48.5  
million spent by independent counsel Lawrence Walsh's six-year 
investigation of the Reagan administration and become the most 
costly. 
</P>
<P>
	Watergate did not begin the practice of appointing investigators  
free of conflicted interests to investigate alleged misdeeds by top 
government officials. Some 100 years before the Watergate scandal 
drove Nixon from office, President Ulysses S. Grant appointed -- and 
then fired -- John Henderson to investigate the Whiskey Ring 
scandal, in which distillers bribed government officials to avoid 
paying liquor taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Before his firing, special prosecutor Henderson obtained 253  
indictments.

<HEADLINE> Bear Stearns Settles SEC Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- By agreeing to pay $25 million in a  
settlement, big Wall Street firm Bear Stearns &AMP; Cos. is looking to 
head off a lawsuit by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which 
has been investigating its relationship with a small brokerage that 
defrauded investors. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bear Stearns still faces related criminal investigations by  
Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau and federal 
prosecutors. And attorneys representing customers of and investors 
in A.R. Baron &AMP; Co., the now-defunct small brokerage that failed in 
1997, said Monday the settlement with the SEC was just a first 
step. 
</P>
<P>
	Bear Stearns had processed trades for A.R. Baron, a financial  
function known as clearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a first step toward putting this mess behind them but  
they still have a way to go,'' said Max Folkenflik, a securities 
lawyer. ``This is not going to dispose of our claims against Bear 
Stearns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aegis Frumento, another attorney for investors who have sued  
Bear Stearns over the matter, said the company ``is not out of the 
woods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York-based Bear Stearns disclosed the tentative settlement  
Monday in a routine corporate filing submitted to the SEC. A civil 
suit against Bear Stearns by the market watchdog agency was 
believed to have been imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the settlement includes a $5 million civil  
fine, which would be one of the largest levied by the SEC on a 
single company in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	Bear Stearns likely will neither admit to nor deny wrongdoing in  
the settlement, which is normally the case in such agreements with 
the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC spokesmen declined comment on and would not confirm the  
agreement in principal for a settlement. The precise nature of the 
SEC's allegations has yet to be made public. 
</P>
<P>
	By settling the case, Bear Stearns would avoid extensive  
litigation, said Stuart J. Gordon, a former chief counsel in the 
SEC's enforcement division who now is a private attorney. From the 
SEC's standpoint, he said, it would have been a difficult case to 
prove because of the complexities of securities law concerning 
companies accused of helping others commit fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the most pragmatic thing to do,'' Gordon said. ``This  
lessens the stigma tremendously'' for Bear Stearns. 
</P>
<P>
	Bear Stearns said that under the settlement, it will pay a $5  
million fine and an additional $20 million to settle unspecified 
private claims, presumably those of customers who lost a total of 
$75 million with New York-based A.R. Baron. The investors have 
maintained that because it processed transactions for A.R. Baron, 
Bear Stearns should have noticed signs of fraudulent activity at 
the smaller firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Bear Stearns has denied wrongdoing and said it is the  
responsibility of the brokerage firms themselves, not the companies 
that clear their trades, to detect and prevent fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgenthau won securities fraud convictions in 1997 and 1998  
against several A.R. Baron executives and brokers. He has been 
investigating Bear Stearns's role in the smaller firm's failure for 
about a year, according to attorneys familiar with the case, who 
spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, federal prosecutors in New York City also are  
investigating Bear Stearns as part of their case against Sterling 
Foster, another failed small brokerage that used Bear Stearns to 
process its trades, The New York Times reported recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for Morgenthau and U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White  
declined comment on the matter Monday, as did a spokeswoman for 
Bear Stearns. 
</P>
<P>
	Bear Stearns said in its filing that the settlement payments  
would have no significant effect on its business or financial 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The filing did not mention any agreement concerning executives  
of its transaction-clearing division who may be under investigation 
by the SEC. The agency may still be planning to pursue enforcement 
actions against them.

<HEADLINE> Rockets Reject Olajuwon Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The Raptors wanted to trade for Hakeem Olajuwon  
but were turned down by the Houston Rockets, Toronto's general 
manager said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Houston Chronicle and Toronto Sun reported today that the  
teams were discussing a trade involving the 12-time all-star 
center. The deal reportedly involved two other players and two 
first-round draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston would acquire the Raptors' two first-round selections in  
Wednesday's draft: the fifth pick -- acquired from Denver -- and the 
12th pick. The Raptors also would send former Rockets 
center-forward Kevin Willis and swingman Doug Christie to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I approached Houston and inquired about his availability, but  
they said no,'' Raptors GM Glen Grunwald said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources close to the talks say discussions have been going on  
for about two weeks, the Chronicle reported. Negotiations became 
more serious Sunday and Monday and could lead to some changes in 
the offer, possibly including another draft pick or player, the 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockets officials refused to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Olajuwon is 36 years old and the Rockets' most celebrated player  
in a 15-year NBA career. He led the team to NBA championships in 
1994 and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Trades cannot be made until Aug. 1, so the Raptors would have to  
select players on the Rockets' behalf during the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Willis and Christie are under contract for one more season.  
Because Toronto is under the salary cap, it would have been able to 
take on Olajuwon's $14.3 million salary without precisely matching 
the salaries of the players dealt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, he would have tied up our cap room for a year or two, but  
he can still play and he would have given us a good player with 
another year or two left,'' Grunwald said. 
</P>
<P>
	By dealing Olajuwon, Houston would begin a rebuilding process in  
the wake of consecutive first-round playoff losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal also could affect forward Charles Barkley, who is  
considering retirement and said he wanted to return only if he 
thought the Rockets were title contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Willis played two seasons with the Rockets before he was traded  
to Toronto last June for Roy Rogers and two first-round draft 
picks. Willis, 36, averaged 12 points and 8.3 rebounds last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Christie, 29, played 3 1/2 seasons for the Lakers and Knicks before  
spending the last three seasons in Toronto. He averaged 15.2 
points, 4.1 rebounds and 3.7 assists last season and a career-best 
16.5 points and 5.2 rebounds in 1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets, who have the No. 22 pick in the first round, have  
been looking to move up in the draft.

 *Vere C. Bird    	
</P>
<P>
	ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) -- Vere C. Bird, who brought  
independence to Antigua and founded a political dynasty that 
continues to rule, died Monday. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird rose from poverty and overcame a lack of formal education  
to become a union leader who defied British colonizers in the 1950s 
by demanding higher wages for sugar cane cutters. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird led his country to independence from Britain in 1981.  
</P>
<P>
	Although Antigua began rapid development under Bird, in recent  
years the nation has became known as one of the most corrupt in the 
Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
	The dominant figure in Antiguan politics for more than 50 years,  
Bird retired in 1994. A son, Lester, was elected prime minister and 
re-elected this year. 
</P>
<P>
	As leader, Bird introduced free secondary education, island-wide  
electricity service and building projects such as an international 
airport and interior village roads. He aggressively promoted 
tourism, making Antigua a leading Caribbean destination. 
</P>
<P>
	The island gained international notoriety in the late 1970s for  
allowing the testing of weapons for South Africa, then under 
apartheid. It was in the news again in the early 1980s for 
harboring fugitive U.S. financier Robert Vesco.

	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Walter ``Walt'' Glatthaar, well-known by racing  
fans for his motor sports reports on KMOX radio, died Sunday after 
suffering an apparent heart attack. He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
	Glatthaar worked at KMOX for 33 years. In addition to his  
weekend reports on the St. Louis station, his programs were carried 
on the Internet and Armed Forces Radio. 
</P>
<P>
	He covered motor sports for 19 years for ABC Sports and was  
manager for Team Ferrari at the Daytona and Sebring endurance 
races. He served as press officer for the 12 Hours of Sebring 
competition, was the American director of racing for STP for 
several years and also co-founded the American Indy Car Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, two sons, three daughters and four  
grandchildren.

</P>
<P>
	OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) -- Charlie Hodde, a former speaker of the  
Washington House, died Sunday. He was 92. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodde, first elected to the House in 1936, became House speaker  
in 1949, and remained at the post through 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	After losing in the Democratic primary for governor in 1952,  
Hodde retired from elective office, but continued to serve in 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked many years for former Gov. Albert D. Rosellini. His  
jobs included tax commissioner, lobbyist to the Legislature, 
chairman of a special panel to revise the budget and accounting 
system and director of the Department of General Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1977, he was appointed director of the Department of Revenue  
under former Gov. Dixy Lee Ray. He also served on various boards 
for succeeding governors Dan Evans and Booth Gardner.

<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Aubrey Keel, who reported the news with  
a series of dots and dashes as a telegrapher for The Associated 
Press, died Friday. He was 97. 
</P>
<P>
	Keel was the oldest living AP telegrapher, one of the last of  
1,500 employed by the AP over a span of eight decades. 
</P>
<P>
	As a telegrapher, Keel translated words into dots and dashes and  
transmitted them to another telegrapher on the other end of the 
wire, who translated the dots and dashes back into words. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Texas AP phased in the Teletype printer in 1928, Keel  
weathered the storm, eventually becoming communications chief in 
the Milwaukee, Des Moines, Iowa and Los Angeles bureaus before 
retiring in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1998, AP President and Chief Executive Officer Louis  
D. Boccardi honored Keel at a ceremony in Arlington, Va., at the 
Newseum, a museum dedicated to the history of journalism, where an 
exhibit commemorating the AP's 150th anniversary had opened. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include a daughter, Mari McElyea; son-in-law, Larry  
McElyea; a granddaughter, and several nieces and cousins.

engineer who introduced audio magnetic tape recording to Hollywood 
and was responsible for the first regular use of radio laugh 
tracks, died Thursday. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Mullin who galvanized Hollywood, first with Bing Crosby,  
into adopting magnetic tape recording and who deserves credit for 
the post-World War II start of commercial audio, data and videotape 
in America. 
</P>
<P>
	Once he got Crosby to use magnetic tape in the late 1940s, other  
entertainers adopted the technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the use of scissors and tape, Mullen was able to splice  
in laugh and applause tracks.

<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Frank Tarloff, a blacklisted  
screenwriter whose brief membership in the Communist Party in the 
1940s haunted him during the House Committee on Un-American 
Activities hearings, died Friday. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarloff joined the Communist Party in the mid-1940s. A number of  
American intellectuals signed up with the Communist Party to show 
their opposition to fascism. 
</P>
<P>
	He hadn't attended a Communist Party meeting in years by the  
time he was subpoenaed by the committee at the height of the Red 
Scare in the early 1950s, his family said. 
</P>
<P>
	After moving to England, a producer commissioned Tarloff to  
co-write the 1964 Cary Grant film ``Father Goose.'' The screenplay, 
co-written with S.H. Barnett and Peter Stone, won an Oscar in 1965 
and the Tarloffs returned to Hollywood the following year.

</P>
<P>
	LAGUNA BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Bobs Watson, the youngest of nine  
acting siblings during Hollywood's golden age who played Peewee in 
``Boys' Town,'' died Saturday of cancer. He was 68. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson appeared in more than 200 movies and TV shows and 500  
stage productions since he was 6 months old, but was best known as 
Peewee in the 1938 movie ``Boys' Town,'' starring Spencer Tracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning in 1912, the entire Watson clan of nine appeared in  
more than 1,000 movies. They were cast as Jimmy Stewart's children 
in ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood honored the family with a star on the Walk of Fame in  
April, but Bobs Watson could not attend because of his illness. 
</P>
<P>
	His last movie, ``Deadly Delusions,'' was made in 1998 and has  
not yet been released.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Passes Disney Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Hong Kong passed its deadline for striking a  
deal to bring a Disney theme park to the territory and needs more 
time to negotiate, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong tourism commissioner Mike Rowse, the chief negotiator  
on the Disney proposal, plans a news conference on Thursday to 
announce that the ``talks will continue,'' said government 
spokeswoman Debbie Ho. 
</P>
<P>
	Ho disputed reports that talks about the proposed location were  
delaying a decision but declined to elaborate. Walt Disney Co. 
executives in Hong Kong declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong's financial secretary, Donald Tsang, confirmed early  
this year that Disney was in talks about putting a Disney park on 
outlying Lantau Island. He had said the two sides would have until 
the end of June to wrap up their negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	There had been much speculation that Hong Kong might announce a  
Disney deal on Thursday, the second anniversary of the handover 
from British to Chinese rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say the Disney park will give Hong Kong's troubled  
economy a welcome boost, providing construction jobs and bringing 
in more tourist dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have worried Hong Kong might have to make too many  
concessions to lure Disney, although most long-term jobs provided 
by a Disney park aren't likely to be high-paying.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Arena Will Host Grammys in Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The as-yet-unfinished Staples Center, a  
20,000-seat downtown arena, will host the Grammy Awards in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The new center has nearly four times the capacity of the nearby  
Shrine Auditorium, which hosted the 41st annual Grammys in February 
following their three-year New York run. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Richard Riordan was to make the official announcement  
today outside the center, along with Michael Greene, president of 
the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, which 
organizes the awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Riordan had lobbied heavily to keep the Grammys in Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's where they belong,'' Ashleigh Adams, a Riordan  
spokeswoman, said Monday. ``We're the entertainment capital of the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $350 million Staples Center, adjacent to the Convention  
Center, is to open in October. Home to the Los Angeles Lakers, 
Clippers and Kings, the new Staples Center also will be used for 
the 2000 Democratic National Convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Springsteen will give the first concert there this fall.

<HEADLINE> Latin America Oil Cos. Plan Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Latin America's two largest oil  
companies, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. and Brazil's Petrobras, on 
Tuesday signed a letter of intent paving the way towards 
establishing a joint company. 
</P>
<P>
	The document was signed at a news conference in Rio de Janeiro  
by Petrobras president Henri Philippe Reichstul, and PDVSA vice 
president for planning Hector Cialvaldini. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter set out five key areas of cooperation, including  
refining and selling both countries' crude oil, and said they would 
be the ``starting point to establish the economic viability of a 
joint company, called Petroamerica.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It said that a working group would be set up to evaluate the  
creation of a joint-run company and would report to the presidents 
of PDVSA and Petrobras ``before the end of the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the news conference, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said  
PDVSA and Petrobras were showing ``a clear strategic vision for 
South America,'' and that he was ``convinced the concrete unity 
between Venezuela and Brazil is vital.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez said he hoped other countries in the region would soon be  
part of the project, and said he had opened negotiations with the 
presidents of Mexico, Equador and Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spoke to Equador President Jamil Mahuad last night and he  
showed himself to be very motivated by the idea,'' Chavez said. He 
added that he had received similar reactions from Mexican President 
Ernesto Zedillo and Colombian President Andres Pastrana. 
</P>
<P>
	The presidents were in Rio on Monday and Tuesday for a summit of  
leaders of Latin American, European and Caribbean countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of Brazil and Venezuela creating a joint oil company  
was first suggested in 1995, by Brazil's current President Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso, and his then Venezuelan counterpart Rafael 
Caldera. 
</P>
<P>
	Petrobras currently produces around 1.2 million barrels of crude  
oil per day, while PDVSA produces around 2.8 million per day.

<HEADLINE> Plus-Size Clothing Goes Trendy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Plus-size women can throw out those tent dresses  
and stretchy pants to make room in their closets for trendier 
fashions: capri pants, tube tops and tight-fitting camisoles. 
</P>
<P>
	Being big these days doesn't mean you have to look dowdy, and  
that was absolutely clear Tuesday night at the Lane Bryant fashion 
show, featuring the large-size model-of-the-moment Camryn Manheim -- 
who stars in the television series ``The Practice'' and is author 
of the new book ``Wake Up, I'm Fat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So what if you are a size 14 or bigger? You can now keep up with  
all the fashion trends that thinner women wear -- dresses with 
spaghetti straps, drawstring pants, see-through blouses and 
bare-midriff shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is such a hot segment of the market because they finally  
figured out that these women are looking for fashion but they don't 
want to feel like they have to fit into clothes designed for Paris 
runway models who are stick thin,'' said David Rush, principal at 
the Atlanta retail consulting firm Kurt Salmon Associates. 
</P>
<P>
	The large-size market is the fastest-growing segment in women's  
clothing today. Last year, sales were $23.7 billion, up 6.6 percent 
from 1997 and almost 44 percent from 1993, according to The NPD 
Group, a market research firm in Port Washington, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Driving much of this success has been a complete overhaul in  
large-size business. Stores have finally started giving women what 
they've been looking for: trendy styles and a pleasant shopping 
experience, with attentive salespeople who help them find clothes 
that fit. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the leaders in the plus-size market is Lane Bryant, a  
division of specialty retailer The Limited Inc. After watching its 
sales and profits sink early in the decade, the 730-store division 
has become more focused on service and fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Five years ago, the large-size business was about comfort and  
covering up,'' said Jill Dean, president of Columbus, Ohio-based 
Lane Bryant. ``Now, where fashion goes, we go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was evident at Tuesday night's fashion show featuring Lane  
Bryant's fall line of clothes. Led by its size 22 spokeswoman 
Manheim, who opened the show with a slinky red silk dress, models 
showed off strapless dresses and tight jeans with embroidered legs 
-- a look crafted by fashion powerhouse Gucci this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	To publicize its new look, Lane Bryant broadcast the show online  
for the first time. According to preliminary figures, more than 
30,000 people signed up to watch the event live. 
</P>
<P>
	While that was far less than the 1.5 million who logged on in  
February to see the online fashion show of sister company 
Victoria's Secret -- which was filled with pencil-thin supermodels -- 
the Lane Bryant event still exceeded the company's expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the fashion show, Lane Bryant is also using its  
Web site -- www.lanebryant.com -- as an online gathering place for 
plus-size women, where they can discuss everything from careers to 
fitness to fashion. Visitors to the site can also browse through 
the store's merchandise, but nothing currently can be bought 
online. 
</P>
<P>
	Lane Bryant isn't the only retailer servicing -- and succeeding --  
in the large-size market. Analysts say Saks Fifth Avenue's Salon Z, 
an area of the store dedicated to bigger clothes, is attracting 
lots of shoppers. Talbots also has added some larger sizes to its 
assortment. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is absolutely an important business segment to be in and  
we are convinced that it is just going to get bigger over time,'' 
Rush said.

<HEADLINE>  Marv Albert Rehired by NBC Sports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Marv Albert was rehired by NBC today, less than  
two years after he was fired by the network following his guilty 
plea in a sex case. 
</P>
<P>
	Basketball's best play-by-play announcer signed a multiyear deal  
in which he will handle NBA coverage at NBC as well as Olympic 
boxing and hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC sports chairman Dick Ebersol said today that Albert will do  
play-by-play but will not be part of the network's top team. 
Ebersol did not say who will work with Albert. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just so happy to be back and to be part of the NBC  
situation. ... There will be plenty of national exposures and I'm 
very satisfied to come home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ebersol said one of the factors that sped the process was  
speculation that Albert was close to signing with Fox to do NFL 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realized I'd better act immediately or I wouldn't be able to  
do this for three or four years,'' Ebersol said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert began his national comeback this past season when he was  
hired by Turner Sports to work NBA games. 
</P>
<P>
	He will make his on-air return to NBC, where he worked for 20  
years, before the end of the year -- likely on a studio show or 
NBC's first NBA telecast on Christmas Day. He will also continue 
his Turner duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert will work about 15 regular-season games for NBC and the  
first four weekends of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert was fired by NBC in September 1997 after pleading guilty  
to biting a woman during a sexual encounter in a Virginia hotel 
room. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did what we felt we had to do at the time, but Marv has  
done what he had to do in the interim,'' Ebersol said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also resigned from Madison Square Garden network, but was  
brought back on board at MSG one year ago as the anchor of ``MSG 
Sports Desk'' and as the radio play-by-play voice for half of the 
New York Knicks games. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert's Turner debut came on TNT's broadcast of the Los Angeles  
Lakers game at Phoenix on April 2. He is scheduled to work a full 
slate of broadcasts next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert's last NBA national telecast for NBC was the NBA Finals  
in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Honduran Boy's Tale Called a Lie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A 13-year-old Honduran boy's fantastic tale of  
journeying 37 days from his mudslide-devastated homeland to New 
York to be with his father captured the headlines as well as the 
hearts of the police and the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it appears the boy made up much of the story, and  
authorities say they are investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy's story made front-page news here. He enchanted all he  
met -- including New York police and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani -- and 
was given gifts and assistance in his supposed search for his 
father. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all wanted to adopt him, to take care of him,'' Detective  
Gilbert Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
	But in an interview Tuesday with The Associated Press, Edwin  
Sabillon's grandmother in Honduras said the boy's mother is alive 
and his father is dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know why he did this -- maybe because he wants to live  
in the United States,'' said Paula Vazquez Hernandez, 65, who lives 
in San Buenaventura, Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy said he set out for New York City after losing his  
mother, grandfather and brother in last year's mudslides, hoping to 
find the father he never knew. For 37 days, he hitchhiked, rode 
buses and sometimes just walked -- from Honduras to Mexico, then to 
Texas, Florida and finally New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Vazquez Hernandez said Edwin's father, Grevis Sabillon,  
died of AIDS shortly after he returned to Honduras last October. He 
had been living in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	When his father died, Edwin was living with an aunt in Miami but  
then returned to Honduras, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwin then left Honduras again in March to stay with relatives  
in Hialeah, Fla. He had arrived there within two weeks, Mrs. 
Vazquez Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy's mother lives in the northern Honduras industrial town  
of Choloma, but abandoned him when he was ten months old, Mrs. 
Vazquez Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwin has two aunts in Hialeah, Maria Elizabeth Sabillon and  
Aurora Sabillon; neither could be immediately reached for comment. 
It was unclear why Edwin left Florida for New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York he became a minor celebrity. His picture appeared on  
the front page of Tuesday's edition of the Daily News. Mayor 
Rudolph Giuliani vowed to ask immigration officials not to deport 
the boy's father. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwin had told police his relatives died in a mudslide last year  
when Hurricane Mitch pummeled Central America. 
</P>
<P>
	But the area of Honduras where he lived with his grandmother is  
high ground and was not seriously affected by the hurricane, which 
devastated much of the country in November. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his father sent him $200 on May 19 and told him to meet  
him on a ramp to LaGuardia Airport on either June 25, 26 or 27, 
police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will be wearing a white shirt, black pants, white sneakers  
and a black hat,'' Edwin said he was told by his father, according 
to police. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Edwin went to a cafeteria in Miami on Saturday and  
told his story to people who bought him a bus ticket to New York 
City. He arrived in New York on Sunday and took a cab to the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
	But after driving around for a while, the driver became  
concerned and took Edwin to police. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwin repeated his story to detectives, who spent Monday and  
much of Tuesday combing the city for the boy's father. Meanwhile, 
he was showered him with gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	The taxi driver, Jose Basora, bought him in-line skates; the  
detectives bought him new clothes, fed him McDonald's hamburgers 
and got him an ice cream cake. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they had yet to confirm the new revelations, but  
were investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear what would happen to the boy, who  
is currently staying with a Spanish-speaking foster family in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want him back,'' his grandmother, Mrs. Vazquez Hernandez,  
said. ``I want him to return to me. And I'm going to send him to 
reform school.''

<HEADLINE> Steering Probed on GM Pickups, SUVs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal experts are investigating the safety  
of some General Motors Corp. pickups and sport utility vehicles 
after dozens of motorists complained the steering wheel moved 
unexpectedly as they traveled at moderate to high speeds. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is examining  
the engineering on C-K pickups and Suburban, Yukon and Tahoe sport 
utility vehicles from model years 1997-1999. GM and government 
officials said 1.5 million to 2 million of the vehicles are on the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
	Government investigators said 76 motorists complained the  
vehicles' power steering assistance system is somehow involved in 
sudden oversteering during turns or lane changes and sometimes 
cause vehicles to veer out of the lane, according to the agency's 
monthly report on auto defects released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	There are four reports of crashes, the agency said.  
</P>
<P>
	GM spokesman Greg Martin said the company is cooperating with  
the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Agency investigators are looking at whether a vehicle sensor is  
sending erroneous signals to the steering system. The so-called 
Electronically Variable Orifice sensor detects rapid steering wheel 
movements that indicate emergency maneuvering of the vehicle. A 
steering system, called the Variable Effort Steering system, then 
provides full power steering to help the driver. 
</P>
<P>
	GM has told the agency the system was designed to improve  
drivers' feel of the road when steering. ``It is GM's position that 
there is no effect on vehicle control, and therefore this is not a 
safety issue,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	About one-third of the motorists complained about a jerking  
motion in the wheel or momentary oversteering, while others 
complained about unexpected veering from the travel lane. 
</P>
<P>
	GM has logged 31,292 warranty repairs on C-K pickups and 11,362  
warranty repairs on Suburbans relating to the issue, the report 
said. Most of the repairs involved replacement of the 
Electronically Variable Orifice sensor, and the rest involved 
replacing the Variable Effort Steering system's control unit, the 
report said.

<HEADLINE> Jury Gets Landmark Smokers' Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- As the six-member jury began deliberations in the  
first class-action lawsuit by smokers to reach trial, seven 
alternates were shocked to learn they weren't off the hook. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Robert Kaye apologized to the seven for what he  
called ``a little white lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said he wants the seven alternates to stay connected  
to the case until their colleagues have determined if Big Tobacco 
is liable for injuries the plaintiffs blame on cigarette smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven alternates may still get to deliberate if any of the  
first six are unable to finish. And if the cigarette makers are 
found liable, Circuit Judge Robert Kaye intends to return the same 
group intact for the next phase, in which damages are determined. 
</P>
<P>
	That could take several more months, and Kaye didn't tell the  
first six. Kaye had previously said he intentionally kept quiet 
about a potential second phase to avoid prejudicing the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he feared that if jurors knew, they might find in favor  
of the tobacco companies in order to end the trial quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Forgive us for, uh, a little white lie in not telling you  
about that. I hope you understand that,'' Kaye told jurors Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon hearing the news, one alternate juror gasped loudly.  
Several others needed a moment for the news to sink in. 
</P>
<P>
	After eight months of testimony, the jury of four men and two  
women spent more than five hours Monday going over the evidence. 
Deliberations resumed today. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 500,000 sick Floridians are seeking an estimated $200  
billion in damages, contending they were misled about the dangers 
of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants -- Philip Morris Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,  
Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., Lorillard Tobacco Co., and the 
Liggett Group Inc., as well as the Council for Tobacco Research and 
the Tobacco Institute -- maintained everybody knows the health risks 
of cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	The smokers are represented by Stanley and Susan Rosenblatt, a  
husband-and-wife legal team who won a $349 million settlement for 
flight attendants in a secondhand-smoke case against the same 
defendants in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rosenblatts argued that cigarette manufacturers misled  
smokers in what Stanley Rosenblatt called ``one of the great cons 
of the 20th century'' -- working to keep smokers hooked and 
uncertain about the deadliness of the habit. 
</P>
<P>
	Former surgeons general, cancer researchers, erstwhile tobacco  
company scientists and health activists testified in support of the 
sick smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense contended that people who start to smoke are well  
aware of the risks and willingly assume them, that cigarette makers 
haven't done anything special to keep smokers hooked and that the 
companies have produced ``safer'' cigarettes but consumers have 
rejected them.

<HEADLINE> Retiring AID Head Vents Frustration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For six years, J. Brian Atwood kept quiet  
about his frustrations as head of the U.S. foreign aid agency. On 
Tuesday, just before returning to private life, he went public with 
a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwood, whose title is administrator for the Agency for  
International Development, had kind words for President Clinton and 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. His criticisms were directed 
more at institutions than at individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	He called the government's international affairs budget ``a  
joke. There is no money to do anything,'' he said. ``It's 
outrageous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He took aim at the congressional class of 1994, the election  
that gave Republicans control of the House and Senate. It was 
filled with ``nonpassport-carrying members,'' Atwood said, a 
not-so-subtle suggestion that such people think provincially, not 
globally. 
</P>
<P>
	Another source of distress for Atwood was U.S. policy toward the  
United Nations. ``What we are doing to the United Nations system is 
unconscionable,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``At a time when the U.N. is bending under the weight of human  
crises, most emanating from the developing world, we are sapping it 
of its vitality by refusing to pay our bills. Then we criticize it 
for not doing its job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He described as ``shameful'' a recent compromise under which the  
Clinton administration would pay $819 million in arrears on the 
condition that it pay a smaller share in the future. The 
congressionally drafted approach is ``designed to appease people 
whose real goal is to kill the United Nations,'' Atwood said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the venue for his valedictory, Atwood chose the headquarters  
of the Overseas Development Council, a group that tries to 
sensitize opinion makers to the needs of the world's poor 
countries. He spoke before a few dozen listeners, mostly 
development experts. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwood was scheduled to become ambassador to Brazil after his  
service at AID, but Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee chairman, refused to convene hearings on the 
nomination. Helms was smarting from Atwood's characterization of 
him as an ``isolationist'' and Atwood's accusation that Helms drew 
up complicated government reorganization plans ``on the back of an 
envelope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atwood withdrew his nomination in May and plans to leave AID on  
July 9. Only one of his predecessors has served longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwood also addressed these issues:  
</P>
<P>
	Budget pressures: The $1 trillion surplus the administration  
anticipates over the next 15 years ``is more than the combined 
gross national products of South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Yet 
we continue to run our government under budget caps set when we had 
a deficit. These budget caps are a disaster when it comes to 
protecting America's international interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The growing gap between rich and poor: The industrial world is  
getting shamelessly rich while most of the world's people are 
losing ground. He said the ratio of ``rich to poor'' is about 65 to 
1, or for every $65 earned in industrial countries, $1 is earned in 
poor ones. About 1.3 billion people live in extreme poverty, Atwood 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What will it take to wake up our political leaders?'' he  
asked. ``More failed states? More wars? More south-to-north 
migration? More transmission of infectious diseases? More 
terrorism?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He stressed that policies should change to spread out the  
benefits of development throughout poor societies and not be 
restricted to former ruling classes as now. ``When only a small 
percentage of a population enjoys the benefits of democracy,'' 
Atwood said, ``disillusionment sets in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After retirement, Atwood will join the Boston-based Citizens  
Energy Corp., headed by its founder, former Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy, 
D-Mass. The corporation consists of for-profit ventures that 
support a wide array of social and charitable programs in the 
United States and abroad.

<HEADLINE> Flight Planning Cited in Colo. Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Poor flight planning and decision-making  
contributed to a 1997 airplane crash in Colorado that killed eight 
Interior Department workers and the plane's pilot, the National 
Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel also said the probable cause of the Oct. 8, 1997,  
crash near Montrose, Colo., was the pilot's ``failure to maintain 
sufficient airspeed for undetermined reasons'' while flying in bad 
weather, near the plane's maximum gross weight and with its balance 
point moved behind its usual center of gravity. 
</P>
<P>
	That array of factors, the board said, ``resulted in a loss of  
control and entry into a stall/spin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plane, a Scenic Airlines Cessna 202B, had been leased by the  
Interior Department's Bureau of Land Reclamation for a flight from 
Montrose to Page, Ariz. It crashed shortly after takeoff into 
mountains some 18 miles southwest of the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the employees, the crash killed the pilot, 64-year-old  
Robert Armstrong on Phoenix, Ariz.
