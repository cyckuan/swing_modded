<HEADLINE> Henan Boosts Expressway Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan
Province, which is a strategically important hub of communications
in the country, has built some 300 km of expressways over the past
two years.
</P>
<P>
Previously, Henan had not an inch of expressway, lagging far
behind other provinces such as Guangdong and Shandong.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the province plans to build expressways along the
trunk Beijing-Guangdong and Lianyungang-Lanzhou railway lines,
which meet in the Henan capital of Zhengzhou.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Zhengzhou-Xuchang expressway, which runs parallel
with the Beijing-Guangdong railway, has opened to traffic, and the
Zhengzhou-Anyang section along the same railway line is still
under construction.
</P>
<P>
In the east-west direction, the Kaifeng-Zhengzhou-Luoyang
expressway has been completed.
</P>
<P>
Local government officials said that capital shortage is the
only problem that hinders expressway construction in the province,
which has begun raising money from overseas sources.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Henan has so far borrowed loans totalling
470 million US dollars from the World Bank for highway
construction, ranking first in the country in this respect.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Henan will give the final touches to a 120-km
expressway and start construction on two other expressways this
year, according to an official source from the provincial
communication department.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Protest marches were staged
today in all villages in the Israeli occupied Golan Heights to
mark the 15th anniversary of the uprising against the Israeli
occupation.
</P>
<P>
Damascus Radio said that the protesters were holding Syrian
national flags and portraits of Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
during the marches, defying the Israeli military measures.
</P>
<P>
The radio added that statements, which were issued by the
protesters on the occasion, stressed upon the continuation of the
uprising until the Jewish state relinquishes the Golan Heights,
south Lebanon and all other occupied Arab territories.
</P>
<P>
Israel seized the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 six-day
war with Arabs and annexed the 1,176 square kilometers plateau in
1981.
</P>
<P>
Some 12,000 Druze Arabs with Syrian citizenship now live
together with 14,000 Jewish settlers in 32 settlements on the
Golan.
</P>
<P>
In the Intifada (uprising) against Israeli occupation, the
whole Druze community staged large scale strikes in February,
1982, greatly affecting the normal life of the region.

<HEADLINE> Albright Insists U.S. Control NATO South Command </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States Secretary of
State, Madeleine Albright, has reiterated that the U.S. will not
give up its control of the Naples-based South Command of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the French daily, le Monde, published
today, Albright said Washington was "firmly attached" to this
position.
</P>
<P>
Albright will this evening begin her first visit to Europe
since she was sworn in last month.
</P>
<P>
She said the Americans had ensured that the structure of NATO
contained an important balance: "The need to have a strong
European pillar, while showing very clearly that of maintaining
the American presence in Europe," she said.
</P>
<P>
She called on Europeans in their turn to work in this direction
to achieve this balance, while reaffirming the importance for the
United States to strengthen its "anchorage in the Old Continent
(Europe)."
</P>
<P>
France has demanded a greater say for Europe in NATO's European
affairs, and suggested that its South Command be divided into two,
with a European officer in charge of ground forces, while an
American admiral commanded the air and navy forces in the
Mediterranean and the U.S. Sixth Fleet.
</P>
<P>
Some French gaullist politicians have lately expressed worry
about the full return by France to the NATO integrated military
command structure, from which President Charles de Gaulle withdrew
in 1966. They fear it will harm France's nuclear deterrent
autonomy and subordinate French conventional forces to a
U.S.-controlled NATO general command.
</P>
<P>
On NATO's eastward expansion, Albright said it was "very
important" for NATO to take in central and eastern European
countries, but it should not make people think that its expansion
was directed against Russia.
</P>
<P>
"We are working for the establishment of a charter between NATO
and Russia," she said. "Practically, this will contain a mechanism
of consultation, a common council, which will allow Russians to
understand that, if they don't have the right of veto, they have a
say in many decisions concerning Europe."

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav President Nominates Kontic for Federal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Zoran
Lilic today nominated the current prime minister to serve another
term in the federal government.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the lower and upper house speakers of the
federal parliament, Lilic proposed that current Prime Minister
Radoje Kontic remain the head of the federal government when his
current term of office ends in March.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is comprised of Serbia and
Montenegro after the other four republics of the former Yugoslavia
broke away in 1991 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
"On the basis of Article 96, Chapter 3 of the constitution of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and following consultations
with the presidents of political party clubs in the federal
parliament, I nominate Radoje Kontic as the future federal prime
minister," the official Tanjug news agency quoted the letter as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Lilic said Kontic was proposed by the ruling Democratic Party
of Socialists in Montenegro, as the prime minister comes from that
republic.
</P>
<P>
"I present this nomination with the conviction that Dr. Radoje
Kontic, thanks to his personal capabilities and his rich political
and working experience, will compose a competent and responsible
federal government and draw up a program expressing the vital
state interests of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia," the letter
said.

<HEADLINE> Gates: Television Cannot Become Interactive Medium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Television cannot become an
interactive medium in the near future, according to estimates of
Bill Gates, chief of the world leading software company Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the German news weekly Der Spiegel (latest
edition), Gates said that although some people may think of
television in on-line services, it is still quite different.
</P>
<P>
"The television is not interactive, but passive," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gates also noted that there is no danger that computer will
some time replace human beings as the decision-makers. "In the
coming decade, people will teach the computer to undertake some
human activities, but not the logical thinking in any case," he
said.
</P>
<P>
It is easy to talk about artificial intelligence, Der Spiegel
quoted Gates as saying, but people must have learnt from the past
20 years that even such simple processes as the understanding of
language are in fact extremely complicated.
</P>
<P>
Now people are talking about how to make the computer easier to
operate and to become an "intelligent assistant," Gates said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Supports Lesotho Govt in Dealing With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government has expressed support to the government of Lesotho in
dealing with police mutiny which is threatening the democracy
order in that mountain kingdom.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Pretoria today, South Africa's
Department of Foreign Affairs said the disruption of police
activities in Lesotho has caused concern as it undermined the
constitution and political order of the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Tensions are currently running high in Lesotho following 400
mutinying policemen led by eight junior officers who seized
control of the police headquarters last week in Maseru, capital
of the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The police mutiny in Lesotho has caused concerns to the
leaders of the Southern African countries, with South African
President Nelson Mandela embarking on a peace shuttle to its
neighbours, hoping to peacefully restore the situation in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said on Thursday that his government was prepared to
provide necessary assistance to Lesotho if requested to do so.
</P>
<P>
It is also reported that the Lesotho government has ordered
the army to prepare to take actions against the mutinying
policemen.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Africa appealed the Lesotho government to
take timely and appropriate measures to restore administration in
the police services.
</P>
<P>
The preservation of the rule of law was fundamental for good
order in the small land-locked mountain kingdom, said the
statement. enditem

<HEADLINE> French PM Says New Immigration Law "Balanced" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Alain
Juppe today described as "balanced" the text of the new
immigration law, which is strongly contested in France for its
requirement of registration with authorities of foreigners who
stay in French homes.
</P>
<P>
He said that nothing in the text will block foreigners from
coming to France in a legal way, and that nothing will bother
French people from playing host to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
"We are a country of reception, and it is not me who will make
difficult the coming of foreigners in accordance with our laws on
the national soil," the Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted him as
saying today in Bordeaux, southwest France, where he is the mayor.
</P>
<P>
He said that the socialist government of President Francois
Mitterrand required as early as 1982 foreigners, who stayed in
French homes but had no proper resources to live in France, to
register with the government.
</P>
<P>
The new immigration law asks foreign visitors to tell the date
of their departure from France.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted personally this new legislation to resolve also the
very sad cases of human level... which were seen last summer," he
said, referring to the forcible expulsion of paperless African
immigrants by France last summer.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that if the French National Assembly
(lower house of parliament) adopted the law on February 25, more
paperless immigrants, who have long been living in France without
residential papers, would have a second chance to stay on in
France legally.
</P>
<P>
The French Senate has approved the new immigration law, drafted
by Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre.

<HEADLINE> Birth Control Advice Urged at Age 11: UK Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Children in Britain as young as
11 should be offered advice on sex education and even free
contraceptives to reduce the nation's high rate of teenage
pregnancies, a government health research body recommended today.
</P>
<P>
A report by the National Health Service Center for Reviews and
Dissemination said the school-based sex education supported by
clinics providing contraceptives is the best way of preventing
teenage pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
Britain's teenage pregnancy rate is the highest in Europe and
the government's target is to halve the proportion by the year
2000. Latest figures show the rate is still above 8 percent per
1,000.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of what happens sexually between young people is based
on their ignorance. The younger sex education starts, the better.
That means children in the last year of primary school (age 11)
and the first year of secondary school (age 12) should be
targeted," a spokesman for the center said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, teenagers with a good education are
the least likely to become pregnant whereas those from poor homes
with low job prospects are the most likely to be mothers.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Calls on Israel to Halt Settlements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat today urged Israel to
cease settlement construction and refrain from actions against
Arab residents in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on a tour to the West Bank city of Jenin, Arafat
said that Israel should abide by the interim agreement it has
signed and not attempt to alter it.
</P>
<P>
He criticized Israel's moves of continuing the building of
settlements in the territories including East Jerusalem, and
canceling state of permanent residents for Arabs living in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader said that "the Palestinians were
stronger than the settlements and stronger than the settlers." He
added the PNA leadership had decided to conduct dialog with the
opposition of the Israeli government in its struggle against the
expansion of settlements.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's call came a day ahead of the resumption of the
Israeli-Palestinian talks on further implementing the interim
agreement. The talks signaled the continuation of the peace
process following Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank
city of Hebron last month.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of the talks was agreed in the summit held last
Sunday between Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Eight joint panels will start negotiations Sunday to discuss
economic and security issues related to the interim agreement,
including the opening of safe passages between the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, the construction of an airport and sea port in Gaza,
and the development of economic and security cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli negotiating team will be headed by Foreign
Minister David Levy and the Palestinian one by Arafat's deputy
Mahmoud Abbas (or Abu Mazen).
</P>
<P>
A day earlier, Arafat convened a joint meeting of the
Palestinian Council and PLO Executive Committee in the West Bank
city of Jericho. The meeting condemned Israel for failing to
respond to the messages issued by the council on the settlement
issue, and called on Palestinians to continue fighting against
the settlements.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leadership also adopted a resolution to grant
health, housing and financial assistance to the 30 Palestinian
women detainees released by Israel earlier this week.

a Southern African Broadcasting Association (SABA) report
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Evans also met the commander of the Lesotho Defense Force,
Makhula Mosakeng, SABA said.
</P>
<P>
Details of both meetings were not yet known, but observers
said Evans' tour is aimed at persuading the Lesotho government
into talks with the mutinying police to avoid an escalation of
tension in the land-locked kingdom surrounded by South Africa.
</P>
<P>
SABA quoted informed sources as saying that Lesotho's public
services have also been paralysed, and police stations throughout
the country have been cordoned off with heavily-armed police
roaming the main streets.
</P>
<P>
Tension has been high in Lesotho where the local police is on
an indefinite nationwide strike in support of about 400 mutinying
policemen who have seized control of police headquarters to
resist the arrest of three fellow policemen accused of committing
murder in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The government, meanwhile, has been refusing to hold talks
with the renegade policemen.

<HEADLINE> Early Menopause Related to Stress, Malnutrition: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEATTLES, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Women in developing countries
who reach menopause early may be experiencing the same condition
as anorexics and runners, rather than the natural progression of
aging, according to an American scientist.
</P>
<P>
"Rural women in developing countries tend to experience
menopause about eight years earlier than in developed countries,"
said Dr. Darry Holman, postdoctoral fellow in Penn State's
Population Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
On average, he said, American women experience menopause at
about 51 years old, while rural Bangladeshi women, for example,
are about 43 years old at menopause.
</P>
<P>
Speaking here today at the ongoing annual meeting of the
Amercian Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), Holman
said that by the time women in developing countries reach their
early 40s, they have had repeated pregnancies, breast-fed for most
of their adult lives and have relatively high disease load.
</P>
<P>
These women have very low body mass, just like runners and
anorexics, frequently experience amenorrhea.
</P>
<P>
Holman has been conducting a survey of 3,000 Bangladeshi women
who were asked if they were menopausal. The women supplied twice
weekly questionnaires and morning urine samples for a year.
</P>
<P>
Based on the data from his survey, Holman emphasized body
weight, disease load, stress of nursing and general undernutrition
as basic elements resulting in early menopause.
</P>
<P>
He also found that urban women in developing countries tend to
have a later age of menopause.
</P>
<P>
Asked what measures can be adopted by developing countries, he
suggested that improved nutrition, better medical care and fewer
pregnancies be the best choices. They need also to practise birth
control later in their lives, he said.
</P>
<P>
If things go to that direction, he added, the age at menopause
of women in developing countries might increase approaching that
of the United States.

<HEADLINE> UN Experts Call for Quickening Food Supplies to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 15 (Xinhua) -- U.N. experts on Iraq have
called for hastening food supply to the sanction-hit country
through quicker contract approvals, diplomatic sources here said
today.
</P>
<P>
Experts of the U.N. Special Commission on Sanctioning Iraq have
held a meeting since Iraq lodged Monday an official complaint to
the U.N. about the delay of the arrival of food supplies under the
oil-for-food accord.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations permitted Iraq last year to sell 2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil every six months to buy food and other
necessities for its people who are suffering under U.N. sanctions
imposed on Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that the experts' recommendation on speeding
up examination of the contracts for exporting food supplies to
Iraq is due to be submitted to the Special Commission's financial
inspector for approval.
</P>
<P>
The special commission comprises representatives of the 15
member states of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad called on the U.N. last Thursday to speed up the
arrival of food supplies to Iraq after the oil-for-food deal had
taken effect for two months, local newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
The special commission has so far approved only four contracts
out of 153 submitted to it for food supply exports to Iraq.

JOHANNESBURG, February 15 (Xinhua) -- King Mswati III of
Swaziland today expressed his resistance against foreign
interference, urging respect for national sovereignty of his
country rocked by a nationwide strike.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old monarch said neither the Southern African
Development Community nor any SADC member state has a right to
meddle with the internal affairs of an independent country,
according to the Southern African Broadcasting Association.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old Swazi Monarch said he was grateful to South
Africa and Mozambique, the only bordering neighbors of the small
kingdom, for their commitments not to interfere in Swaziland's
internal problems.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland is facing a crippling national strike organized by
the powerful Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions which has been
fighting to press the government to agree to multi-party
democracy.

GENEVA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators from 68 governments
reached a long-awaited agreement on basic telecommunications here

</P>
<P>
The global agreement to open up telecommunications markets came
after more than two years of multilateral talks sponsored by the
World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>

<HEADLINE> WTO Chief Hails Accord on Basic Telecommunications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- World Trade Organization (WTO)
Director-General Renato Ruggiero today hailed an agreement on
basic telecommunications reached in Geneva by 68 WTO members,
calling it "a very important victory."
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero said that with the telecom agreement, "we have almost
accomplished the 21st century round which will be completed with
the forthcoming agreement on information technology products."
</P>
<P>
He praised member governments for their determination and
foresight in bringing this negotiation to a successful conclusion.
By doing so, he said, the members have shown their faith in the
multilateral process of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero stressed that the agreement "is particularly valuable
at a time when a rapid growth and technological development are
changing the face of telecommunications industry and of the world
economy."
</P>
<P>
"The telecoms deal will contribute to lower costs for consumers
and the price reductions will be very significant. Of course it
will be more significant in developing countries than in developed
countries and this is a natural advantage for them," Ruggiero
said.
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero listed other benefits flow from greater competition in
telecoms markets to be brought about by the newly-reached
telecommunications agreement:
</P>
<P>
-- people and nations can communicate more easily and understand
one another better;
</P>
<P>
-- consumers enjoy more choice and better quality;
</P>
<P>
-- modernization and investment are enhanced worldwide; and
</P>
<P>
-- more jobs are created.

<HEADLINE> Bahrain to Participate Meeting in Qatar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Bahrain today announced it
will attend a Gulf-Europe meeting next week in its inharmonious
neighbor Qatar, reports reaching here from Bahraini capital of
Manama said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement by the foreign ministry came two months after
Bahrain boycotted the Gulf Cooperational Council (GCC) summit held
in Doha, capital of Qatar, last December because of the two
countries' territorial dispute.
</P>
<P>
The Bahraini delegation to the seventh ministerial meeting of
the GCC and the European Union, due to open in Doha next Monday,
will be led by Foreign Minister Mohammed Bin Mubarak Al-Khalifa,
said a statement of the Bahraini foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
The decision to participate in the meeting was made on the
directives of Emir of Bahrain Sheikh Isa Bin Suleiman Al-Khalifa,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The move is intended to boost unity of the GCC ranks and
protect the common interests of the GCC states, it said.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming GCC-EU ministerial meeting will focus on the
political, economic and trade relations between the two regions.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain and Qatar have been locked for decades in a dispute
over a cluster of small and potentially oil-rich islands,
sandbanks and reefs in the Gulf, now controlled by Manama since
1930s, but also claimed by Doha.
</P>
<P>
Doha presented the dispute to the international court of
justice at the Hague, the Netherlands, in 1991, a move opposed by
Manama which insists on a regional solution.

<HEADLINE> Liberia to Hold Post-War Poll on May 30 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) announced today that Liberia would carry
out the general elections on May 30 as scheduled to end seven
years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
"There will be elections to install a democratically-elected
president, vice-president and parliament on May 30 this year," a
report from the Liberian capital quoted Nigerian Foreign Minister
Tom Ikimi as saying at the end of the two-day ECOWAS foreign
ministers meeting.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi, chairman of the ECOWAS Ministerial Committee on
Liberia, said an independent electoral commission would be
formed, comprising seven Liberians and three international
observers -- one from the Organisation of African Unity, one from
the United Nations and one from ECOWAS.
</P>
<P>
Liberia's three main faction leaders will each name a
representative with four members representing labour unions,
women's groups, youth groups and political parties in the west
African country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, General Victor Malu, commander of the Nigeria-led
west African peacekeeping force known as the ECOMOG, was
satisfied with the security front following the disarmament of
faction fighters.
</P>
<P>
"The poll was guaranteed to go ahead as planned by the
successful conclusion of the disarmament and demobilisation
exercise and enough security," said the general.
</P>
<P>
General Malu said ECOMOG would pull out of Liberia six months
after a new government is installed, leaving behind a new
national army and police force.
</P>
<P>
On the mode of elections, Ikimi said Liberia would retain the
bi-cameral system of parliament comprising a 64-member house of
representatives and a senate of 26 members.
</P>
<P>
Observers said this echoed the recent recommendations of the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The parliament members would be elected on the proportional
representational basis so that the outcome is an "all-inclusive
parliament which ensures that all the parties will be able to
have persons representing their interests."
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons we are having this method is because some
of the existing constituencies have been so seriously eroded over
the past years of civil war that we can not have them represented
as constituted in the Liberian constitution," said Ikimi.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Promises More Aid to Refugees in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) today promised to solicit for
further financial support from international agencies for
environmental rehabilitation in Kigoma and Kagera regions,
Western Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here today, the UNHCR chief,
Sadako Ogata, admitted that there was environmental degradation
in the two regions following the presence of Rwandan, Burundian
and Zairean refugees.
</P>
<P>
"We sympathize with Tanzania on the situation but this is a
plight the country has to bear for some time," she noted.
</P>
<P>
Care International, an international non-governmental
organization (NGO), in collaboration with UNHCR, is currently
doing most of the aid work in Ngara district, Kagera region.
</P>
<P>
Ogata, who was touring countries of the Great Lakes region,
today wound up her two-day tour of Tanzania after visiting
refugee camps in Kigoma and Kagera regions.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR chief, accompanied by Tanzanian Minister of Home
Affairs, Ali Ameir Mohamed, toured refugee camps at Lake
Tanganyika stadium and National Milling Corporation in Kigoma
region.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has been hosting a multitude of refugees from Rwanda,
Burundi and Zaire following periodic and sometimes incessant
civil wars in the three neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
In her two-day tour, Ogata also met Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa early today during which they discussed the
refugee problems, among other issues.

<HEADLINE> Liberian Refugees Not Allowed to Vote in Asylum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Liberian refugees scattered in
other countries will not be allowed to participate in the general
elections scheduled for May 30, a move to encourage their
repatriation.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no voting outside Liberia," said a report from
Liberia's capital of Monrovia, quoting Nigerian Foreign Minister
Tom Ikimi who was chairing the just concluded foreign ministers
meeting of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
Ikimi said this was agreed by the ECOWAS and Liberia's ruling
Council of State, adding that "it will not be convenient for
refugees to vote in other countries."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, a decision was taken that refugees be encouraged
to return home to allow them to participate in the elections in
Liberia," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also appealed the United Nations to facilitate
the repatriation of the refugees before the elections.
</P>
<P>
But difficulties are formidable for an estimated one million
Liberian refugees to return home in only three months.
</P>
<P>
Whether the refugees would participate in the coming poll has
fueled speculations that the elections may not be held as
scheduled and the U.N. might favor its postponement to give
enough time for the preparations.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said the
holding of the election would depend very much on the meeting of
ECOWAS foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which is regarded as crucial for the peace
process in Liberia, also decided to inject new life into
Liberia's supreme court to ensure its independence.
</P>
<P>
As Ikimi put it, because "ECOWAS feels the current supreme
court is not free of factionalship or political influence, the
Council of State agreed to take immediate steps to bring in
people who will give the court a character of independence and
nonfactionalship."
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS is the broker of peace in Liberia which is among the
16-member sub-regional organization.

<HEADLINE> Mkapa Commends UNHCR for Assistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa today commended the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for having closely co-operated
with Tanzania in the planning and execution of smooth
repatriation of over half-million Rwandan refugees from Tanzania
last December.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued here today by the State
House, during discussions with the UNHCR Chief Executive, Sadako
Ogata in the town of Bukoba, North-Western Tanzania this morning,
President Mkapa reiterated Tanzania's principle of living to
international convention in relation to the treatment of refugees
such as allowing voluntary repatriation.
</P>
<P>
He further said Tanzania will at the same time never allow
refugees in the country to use their camps as base for hatching
plots against their home countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release, the president also requested
the UNHCR and the international community to assist in the
rehabilitation program of areas ravaged by the presence of
refugees especially in Kagera and Kigoma regions.
</P>
<P>
While thanking the government of Tanzania for the exemplary
treatment and smooth conduct of repatriation process of Rwandan
refugees, the UNHCR chief pledged to rally international support
for rehabilitating the environment and social facilities damaged
during the two-year stay of Rwandan refugees in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
She said the rehabilitation works which have started in a
number of former refugee camps, was bound to pick up momentum in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the press release said that President Mkapa
concurred with the UNHCR chief that African politicians had the
primary responsibilities in working out democratic systems that
would prevent the occurrence of upheaval.
</P>
<P>
On the current political situation in both Burundi and Zaire,
President Mkapa and Madam Ogata expressed their great concern on
the explosive situation prevailing on those two countries but
both hope that the politicians in those countries would be
persuaded to negotiate as the barrel of the gun would only
intensify the crisis.
</P>
<P>
They called upon the international community to take quick
actions in the two countries in order to create the necessary
conditions to allow another repatriation of Zairean and Burundian
refugees from Tanzania whose inflow was increasing daily.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has not received any
reparations due those countries hit by the 1991 Gulf War as of
mid-February, a government minister said today.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Labor and Immigration Ahmed el-Amawi said the
government is following up the issue with the United Nations
committee entrusted with paying these reparations.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. committee will pay these countries after receiving
funds from Iraq's oil exports which resumed on December 10
following a more than six years' suspension due to the
U.N. sanctions, el-Amawi added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it will earmark 142 million U.S. dollars every month
for these countries all through the renewable six-month period of
the "oil-for-food" deal ending in May.
</P>
<P>
These reparations amount to 220 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council resolution 986 allows Iraq to sell 2
billion dollars worth of oil over six months and use 1.2 billion
to buy food, medicine and other necessities to offset the effects
of sanctions imposed after Iraq's August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
During the Gulf war, Egypt joined the multi-nation forces led
by the United States to drive the Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
While the war victims are waiting for their dues, Iraq
complains about inefficiency of the U.N. committee and appealed
for speedier delivery of food and other supplies.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi U.N. envoy Nizar Hamdoon said Tuesday that two months
after the agreement became operative, no humanitarian goods had
yet arrived in Iraq, describing the process of getting contracts
approved by the U.N. Special Commission on Sanctioning Iraq as
"very cumbersome and time-consuming."
</P>
<P>
He said the commission has so far approved only four contracts
submitted to it and another 80 contracts for various purchases by
Iraq are still somewhere in the U.N. Secretariat and has not yet
reached the commission.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Telecoms Negotiators Reach Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators from 68 governments
reached a long-awaited agreement on basic telecommunications here
this afternoon just hours before the February 15 deadline.
</P>
<P>
World Trade Organization (WTO) Director-General Renato Ruggiero
today hailed the agreement by 68 WTO members as "a very important
victory." The 68 account for more than 90 percent of the global
telecommunications services market, worth an estimated 600 billion
U.S. dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia have a big share of the world telecoms market
but they have not taken part in the telecoms talks because they
are not TO members. Both are trying to join the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Asked by Xinhua what the WTO will do to have the two countries
associated with the new telecoms agreement, Ruggiero told a press
conference after the adoption of the agreement that the WTO is
having negotiations with 28 candidates including China and Russia.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that this agreement would be in a certain sense both
for China and for Russia to show to them how important it is to be
part of the WTO and of the same set of rules and disciplines and
of the same set of opportunities," he said. "So I think that this
will be in a certain sense and element which should encourage
those two countries to make all the way that it is still to be
covered to be a member of this institution."
</P>
<P>
The issues that the agreement covers include voice telephone
services, data transmission services, telex, telegraph, facsimile,
private leased circuit services, cellular mobile telephone
services, mobile data transmission, and personal communications
systems.
</P>
<P>
The global agreement to open up telecommunications markets came
after nearly three years of multilateral talks sponsored by the
WTO.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on basic telecommunications began in May 1994,
with April 30, 1996 set as the deadline for conclusion. But by the
April deadline, agreement could not be reached and the talks were
extended to February 15, 1997.
</P>
<P>
In order to help conclude the WTO-sponsored talks by the new
deadline, Ruggiero on February 10 urged negotiators to achieve a
"satisfactory agreement" in a statement to a meeting of the group
on basic telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
"Success in this negotiation will do a great deal to strengthen
the credibility of the services agreement by demonstrating that it
can deliver valuable results even in sectors of the greatest
technical and political complexity," said Ruggiero. "Failure, or a
disappointing outcome, would correspondingly damage confidence in
the GATS (General Agreement on Trade in Services) and perhaps in
the WTO itself."
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero noted that the negotiation on basic communications "is
a central piece of the negotiations for the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the press today, Ruggiero said that with the
telecom agreement, "we have almost accomplished the 21st century
round which will be completed with the forthcoming agreement on
information technology products." He praised member governments
for their determination and foresight in bringing this negotiation
to a successful conclusion. By doing so, he said, the members have
shown their faith in the multilateral process of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero stressed that the agreement "is particularly valuable
at a time when a rapid growth and technological development are
changing the face of telecommunications industry and of the world
economy."
</P>
<P>
"The telecoms deal will contribute to lower costs for consumers
and the price reductions will be very significant. Of course it
will be more significant in developing countries than in developed
countries and this is a natural advantage for them," Ruggiero
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- The number of people of working age in Arab
countries is increasing faster than anywhere else in the world but
the unemployment rate remains high, according to a latest study.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2030, around 332 million people in the Arab world,
or 75 percent of the population, will be of working age, compared
with 138 million in 1995, according to the study by the Kuwait
Institute for Scientific Research.
</P>
<P>
That figure, which includes people aged between 15 and 64, will
shoot up to 580 million by the end of next century.
</P>
<P>
But, the study said that in 1995, the Arab region had a high
rate of unemployment and only attracted 2.3 percent of total
world investment in the developing countries, down from 4.5
percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Forty-eight prominent Egyptian Businessmen, members of
the Egyptian-U.S. Chamber of Commerce, will set out on their
annual visit to the United States on February 18.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian delegation will meet a large number of top-level
U.S. Administration officials and Congress members.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will study opportunities for investment in Egypt
and prospect for entry by the U.S. side into ventures put forward
by the government and for participation in the setting up of
electric power generating stations, construction of roads and
construction of airports.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian side will put forward opportunities for investment
following the recent measures adopted by the government to
activate the Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The U.S. oil company Amoco has signed a deal to study
the building of a pipeline to export Egyptian gas to Jordan, local
newspapers today quoted Energy Minister Hisham Dabbas as saying.
</P>
<P>
Dabbas said the pipeline would cross Egypt's Sinai Peninsula,
pass under the Red Sea and pump gas to Jordan's southern port of
Aqaba, hooking up to a national gas grid which Amoco is also
planning as part of the project.
</P>
<P>
The project, bypassing Israel, is more feasible both
economically and politically than another plan to supply Jordan
and Israel with liquefied gas by tanker from the Gulf state of
Qatar, he said.

<HEADLINE> Minister: Syria Ready to Resume Talks With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Syria always has a clear stand
toward the peace process and it is ready to resume talks with
Israel immediately from the point they reached, Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouq al-Shara said today.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian minister made the remarks after a meeting with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak this morning. Shara and Vice
President Abdel Halim Khaddam are heading a high-ranking
delegation on a lightening visit here.
</P>
<P>
They delivered a message to Mubarak from President Hafez
el-Assad related to the peace process and results of the recent
tour of the two leading Syrian officials to several other Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
Shara rejected the Israeli charge that there is Syrian
intransigence on restarting talks with Israel which stalled since
last March.
</P>
<P>
He also denied that Syria is planning for armament as claimed
by Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu while visiting the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he held Israel responsible for the suspension of the
negotiations, noting that Syria does not pose preconditions for
the resumption of these negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli talks, seen as a key to an overall Middle
East peace, have long been stuck over the fate of the strategic
Golan Heights since last March.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said in Washington Friday that he would not adhere to
verbal pledges by previous Labor government to withdraw from the
strategic plateau in return for a peace treaty with the Arab
state.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that Syria is launching war from south Lebanon against
Israel through Hezbollah, or Party of God, he said the Syrian
president did not relinquish the option for violence in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In the first reaction to Thursday's talks between Netanyahu and
U.S. President Bill Clinton, Damascus said that it is not
interested in the latest ideas put forward by the Israeli leader
to resume peace talks because they approve the Israeli concept
which aims at combining occupation with peace.
</P>
<P>
But Syria is ready to resume the talks immediately if Israel
accepts withdrawal from the Golan, said the official daily
Al-Baath Friday.
</P>
<P>
Syria has warned Washington, a key sponsor of the Mideast peace
process, not to lose credit in the Arab world by supporting the
Israeli proposals.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Some 300 oil workers were
detained by armed policemen during a demonstration staged here
today, according to a well-informed source.
</P>
<P>
The source said that about 2,000 oil workers held
demonstrations in front of the Iranian Oil Ministry, protesting

higher pay because of economic hardship in the past several
years.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Soomro, Pakistan's New House Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Ellahi Bakhsh Soomro, a
veteran politician of the Pakistan Muslim League (N), took oath
today as Pakistan's new speaker of the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The gray-haired Soomro, 61, was elected to the speakership
without casting ballots as the PML(N)'s arch rival, the Pakistan
People's Party, withdrew nominations of its candidates.
</P>
<P>
Soomro, who hails from Pakistan's southern province of Sindh,
is an engineer by profession and was in government service. He
also served as a diplomat in the Pakistani Embassy in London.
</P>
<P>
He was federal minister of industries from 1981 to 1985 in the
cabinet of late President General Zia-ul Haq.
</P>
<P>
Soomro was a hot favorite when President Zia-ul Haq was looking
for a prime minister from Sindh province after the 1985 general
elections. However, he sat on the opposition benches and was an
outspoken critic of Mohammad Junejo, the then prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Soomro is a close friend of Nawaz Sharif, chief of the PML(N)
and prime minister in waiting. He was elected to the National
Assembly in the February 3 general elections on PML(N) ticket.
</P>
<P>
Regarded as one of the "cleanest political birds", Soomro was a
federal minister in the first Sharif government (1990-1993).
</P>
<P>
Soomro started his earlier education in his birth place Hathi
Gate, Shikarpur. He earned his Bachelor of Engineering from NED
Engineering College, Karachi. Later, he received his Masters
Degree in engineering from Columbia Politech, New York.
</P>
<P>
The new speaker had been chairman of the Pakistan Engineering
Council for four terms of three years each. He is widely traveled
and has visited most of the countries in the world except South
America and Australia.

CAIRO, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian exports to the United

<HEADLINE> Chinese Youth Will Remember Japanese Invasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- An opinion poll shows that
99.4 percent of polled Chinese youth say they will remember the
history of Japan's invasion of China.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the questionnaire, 97.4 percent of Chinese youth
said they think it is intolerable that some forces in Japan are
ignoring the historical facts of Japan's brutal acts, and are
educating the younger generation in Japan with the same outlook.
</P>
<P>
The survey on "Chinese Youth's Attitude Toward Japan" was
jointly conducted on December 4 by the China Youth Development
Fund and the China Youth Daily.
</P>
<P>
Those surveyed were more than 100,000 youth in China and other
overseas areas with the average age about 25. Of these, 15,000
were selected to be used to determine the results, which were
published in the Beijing-based newspaper Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the poll, 76.4 percent of the respondents said that the
sight of the Japanese flag reminded them of the viciousness of the
Japanese invaders.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, some Japanese politicians have visited the
Yasukuni Jinja Shrine, which holds the memorial tablets of some
war criminals. These activities have shown a complete disrespect
for the feelings of Asian people, the respondents believe.
</P>
<P>
Of those polled, 96.8 percent said they felt great indignation
about this.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 91.5 percent of respondents said they agreed with
the view that Japanese militarists have issued a strong challenge
to China by erecting navigation signs on one of the Diaoyu Islands
and claiming that the isle belongs to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, 95.9 percent of the respondents said they felt
certain that the sovereignty of the Diaoyu Islands belongs to
China.
</P>
<P>
The opinion poll indicates that Chinese youth prefer a
Chinese-made brand of television set over a famous Japanese brand.
</P>
<P>
And 60.7 percent of respondents said the present Sino-Japanese
relations are just "so so"; 93.3 percent of them believe that
Japan's attitude toward its history of invasion in China is one of
the major factors affecting relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Most of the respondents said China should learn advanced
science and technology and business management from Japan, and
nearly all of them think friendly cooperation between the two
countries is important for China and all of Asia.

<HEADLINE> South China Province Witnesses Stable Increase In Revenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The revenue of south China's
Guangdong Province reached 47.461 billion yuan (5.72 billion US
dollars) last year, up 24.8 percent over 1995, according to the
latest statistics.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the provincial government show that the
province once again had a balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
Among the 21 large and medium-sized cities in Guangdong, 20 saw
an increased revenue last year, with the booming city of Shenzhen
taking the lead. Its revenue was 4.355 billion yuan higher than in
1995, accounting for 46.2 percent of the province's overall
increase, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The stable increase of the province's revenue can be attributed
to the consistently healthy development of the provincial economy,
said an official with the government.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials at all levels have paid more attention to tax
collection, he said, and tax departments have redoubled their own
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the prosperity of the stock market, the stamp tax has
increased by a big margin, hitting 3.475 billion yuan in 1996, up
7.64 times over the previous year, the official added.

NICOSIA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides Returned here today from a six-day state visit to India,
during which he held talks with his Indian counterpart Shankar
Dayal Sharma and Prime Minister Deve Gowda.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation before
leaving India, President Clerides said India backs more intensive
efforts to help settle the protracted Cyprus question and
opposes any solution resulting in the abolition of the Republic
of Cyprus or in the creation of two separate states.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish-Cypriot community in
the north and the Greek-Cypriot community in the south since 1974
when Turkey sent troops and occupied the northern part of the
island following a short-lived coup by some Greek Cypriots
seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, an agreement on maritime transport was
signed to improve bilateral shipping links between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and India have signed a number of bilateral
agreements, covering commercial, agricultural, tourism and
investment sectors.

<P>
HONG KONG, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Nicholas Kioko
proved to be the best of the men's field and China's Zheng Guixia
scored a hard-won victory in the women's at the Standard Chartered
Hong Kong-Shenzhen Marathon today.
</P>
<P>
Kioko, 25, clocked a title-winning time of two hours 16 minutes
and 13 seconds, some five minutes slower than his personal best
time.
</P>
<P>
Chinese debutee Zhao Chaochun came second in 2:16.39 and
Kioko's teammate Ambrose Makau was third in 2:17.19.
</P>
<P>
Another Kenyan John Musila kept the pace for most of the race.
Kioko and Zhao overtook the lead at about 38 kilometers mark and
more powerful Kioko broke out with four kilometers left. He never
gave up for the rest of the race.
</P>
<P>
Zheng, winner of the Beijing marathon in 1995 and 1996, has
been out of form these days. She had to fight an ever-declining
fitness during the race and was timed at 2:31.33 at the finish.
</P>
<P>
She was followed by Kenya's Silina Chirchir in 2:40.14 and
Canadian Kimberley Webb in 2:40.44.
</P>
<P>
Unsatisfied with the time, which was more than two minutes
slower than her personal best, Zheng, from East China's Shandong
province, said she hoped to be in a better shape during the spring
national championships in April in Tianjin and at the Eighth
National Games slated for October in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
"I hope, of course, to compete in this year's world
championships, but I have to be qualified first," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I think they have to train harder and get themselves ready for
the National Games," Zheng said of her Hong Kong counterparts.
</P>
<P>
"I hope them the best at the Games," she said.
</P>
<P>
China's Lian Jiaguo won the men's open category in the

<P>
AMMAN, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Minister of Industry
and Trade Ali Abul Ragheb has said that the kingdom is heading for
intensive economic activities with a wider opening of new markets
for its products, Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The intensive economic activities are facilitated by growing Arab and
foreign investments in Jordan's agriculture, industry and tourism,
the minister said here Saturday in response to a series of foreign
media reports on the kingdom's economy.
</P>
<P>
The minister dismissed as untrue earlier press reports that
some factories were shut down at the Sahab Industrial Estate. He
said the factories are actually opening additional branches in
other Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
He added that the estate is busily occupied and the government
is planning to establish additional industrial cities in all
governorates across the country to provide more opportunities to
investors.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Anthrax outbreak continued to
spread in southeastern!!Australia's Victoria state today, with a
further six properties quarantined and 105 reported cattle deaths
(16 more than on Friday).
</P>
<P>
The Department of Natural Resources and Environment (NRE) said
there were now 52 quarantined properties in the Tatura-stanhope
area of the state, all confirmed with anthrax, and veterinarians
were trying to create a buffer zone by vaccinating properties
surrounding the contaminated properties.
</P>
<P>
NRE regional manager Chris McRae said 184 samples from animals
had been tested, with 119 proving negative to anthrax. "We have
even tested a rat, two pigs and a horse, all of which tested
negative to anthrax."
</P>
<P>
Since the first outbreak on January 26, more than 21,000 cattle
have been vaccinated. Investigations into how the disease is
manifesting are continuing but there are no leads, the department
said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Chief veterinary officer Andrew Turner said the disease was not
responding normally to treatment. "It's a concern that the disease
is behaving unusually. We usually get one property infected, and a
few others, with vaccinations, it goes away, but this one is not
acting that way."

<HEADLINE> Dozens of Mutinous Policemen Surrender: Lesotho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Rebel police leader
Phakiso Modise and 32 policemen surrendered to the Lesotho army
this morning after the army attacked the Maseru Central Police
Station, Lesotho Radio said.
</P>
<P>
The Lesotho government troops surrounded the police
headquarters and the Maseru Central Charge Office this morning,
according to the radio.
</P>
<P>
An urgent announcement by the government said, "armed police
who are still occupying the Central Charge Office are requested
by the army to lay down their arms and surrender peacefully to
avoid bloodshed."
</P>
<P>
The state-controlled radio broadcast the statement repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
The radio said although some rebel policemen have surrendered,
there are still others who have ignored the army's request.
</P>
<P>
The radio appealed to Lesotho nationals to keep calm and avoid
moving around the so-called danger areas and continue their
normal business.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the South African Press Association quoted witnesses
as saying that the Lesotho government troop's armored vehicles
fired shells at the police headquarters seized by rebels from a
nearby hill after the police station was surrounded.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have been running high for days in Lesotho following
400 mutinous policemen led by eight junior officers seized
control of the police headquarters last week in Maseru, capital
of the Kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Loses Land to Soil Degradation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has lost 285,000 square
kilometers of land, nearly one third of its total 924,000 sq km
territory, to various forms of soil degradation, according to
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture
show that 115,000 sq km of the area has been lost to gully
erosion, the Guardian newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The states mostly affected include Anambra, Imo, Enugu, Akwa
Ibom, Abia, Delta and most other states in the east, it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics, wind erosion, which is sweeping
through most of the northern states has swept away 65,000 sq km,
while sheet erosion has caused the loss of 71,000 sq km.
</P>
<P>
Other types of erosion account for 34,000 sq km of the land
area so far lost, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the statistics also show some gains in land being
recovered for planting, from 2.7 million hectares of arable land
in 1981 to 3.01 million in 1994, the period covered by the study.
</P>
<P>
However, it is observed that the area lost to erosion and
other forms of land degradation far outstrips areas gained.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also reveal similar loss in the country's
forest and woodland, in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The country lost more than 3.7 million hectares of forest and
woodland between 1981 and 1994, a drop from 14.6 million hectares
to 10.8 million, or roughly an average annual decline of more
than 200,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
Africa's rain forests are said to be suffering the fastest
rate of logging in the world. And there are also increasing
worries that an onslaught by foreign logging companies is
gathering speed in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The depletion of forest reserves especially in the states on
the northern fringe of the country has remarkably enhanced desert
encroachment.
</P>
<P>
As a result, there is risk that areas as southward as the
Federal Capital Territory in the center of the country could be
encroached in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The serious land degradation and deforestation situation has
aroused attention of states concerned. Some measures, including
the increase of investment and foreign cooperation in this field,
are being taken to solve the problems.

<HEADLINE> Debris May Have Caused Senna Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Debris on the Imola race track
may have caused the crash that killed Brazilian Formula One driver
Ayrton Senna in 1994, the Sunday Times said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper published a photograph showing a small piece of
debris in the path of Senna's Williams car moments before he
crashed into a wall at Imola's Tamburello curve during the opening
laps of the San Marino Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times said the fragment may have come from a
collision between a Benetton car and a Lotus at the beginning of
the race.
</P>
<P>
"There, clearly in the path of the Williams, lies a piece of
what is probably, judging by its colour, Benetton bodywork," the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
It suggested that Senna, three times world champion, may have
jinked the steering wheel to avoid the debris, hit a bump and lost
control of his car. At the time of the crash, his tyre pressure
was low, making the car vulnerable to bumps, it said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the picture, by a French motor racing
photographer, had not been published before but had been given to
the Williams Formula One team.
</P>
<P>
Team chief Frank Williams and five other people go on trial in
Italy on Thursday charged with manslaughter over Senna's
death.

<HEADLINE> Australian Housing Market Set For Upturn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Australia's housing market is
set for a slow and steady upturn this year after prices began to
pick up in 1996, the Real Estate Institute of Australia (REIA)
said today.
</P>
<P>
Despite the usual pre-Christmas housing slowdown in December,
there was a general improvement in the property market in 1996,
REIA said in a statement released here.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest trend figures for housing prices,
Sydney enjoyed the biggest annual increase to December 1996 of 7.4
percent, followed by Melbourne, at 5.7 percent. While Canberra
suffered the biggest fall in price, which was down 2.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
REIA deputy president John Franklyn said, while interest rate
cuts in the past six months would help the market continue to
strengthen, "falls in interest rates during 1996 have meant that
home loan affordability is currently very high around Australia."
</P>
<P>
"Remaining pockets of over-supply combined with lower levels of
general consumer confidence, make it likely that this property
upturn will be slower and steadier than previous booms," Franklyn
said.
</P>
<P>
Median unit prices rose 15 percent in Sydney from a year
earlier, while Brisbane prices rose 18 percent. Over the 1996
calendar year, the rental market around the country also showed
strong growth, with median rents increasing in all state capitals.

HANGZHOU, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Overseas investors actually
turned in about 79.2 percent of their contracted funds for
projects in east China's Zhejiang Province last year, up two

where the hostages are being held.
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass said Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Ignatenko
had three telephone conversations with Sadirov earlier today,
strongly demanding immediate release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Ignatenko also spoke with a TV journalist, Odilahon Ashurov,
who is one of the hostages, and was informed that the armed rebels
and the hostages had moved to a place some 25 kilometers away from
the rebels' camp, based on top of a mountain in a remote rocky
region 80 kilometers from Dushanbe.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday the Tajik authorities, backed by Moscow, handed
over more than 30 fighters to Sadirov in exchange for the release
of the 11 captives, including Russian journalists, United Nations
military observers and Tajik Security Minister Saidamir Zukhurov.
</P>
<P>
The hostage crisis started on February 4, when Sadirov seized
the hostages and demanded that the government allow free passage
for his brother Rizvon and some 40 of his men to his base in
Tajikistan from neighboring Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> HK and Beijing Will Benefit From Cooperation: HK Businessman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Beijing and Hong Kong have
their respective advantages when it comes to market potential, and
enhance cooperation between the two can only benefit both, a
well-known Hong Kong businessman said today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Herbert Liang, chairman of the Chinese Manufacturer's
Association of Hong Kong, said in an interview with Xinhua News
Agency that the combination of Beijing's technological advantages
and Hong Kong's financial strength can create economic miracles.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing has one of the biggest market potentials in the world,
but its development is often limited by the lack of funds," said
Liang, who is also a member of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is one of the world's leading financial and
information centers, but in the course of developing its own
technology-intensive industries as planned, its weak technological
background will be a big problem," Liang said.
</P>
<P>
With the return of Hong Kong to the motherland this year, he
said, more and more Hong Kong business people will come to Beijing
looking for business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that since 1978 through the end of January, the
total direct investment from Hong Kong businessmen to Beijing had
reached 9.986 billion US dollars, making Hong Kong the biggest
overseas investor in the Chinese capital.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi PM Hopeful of Solving Tribal Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina today expressed her optimism that the problems in
the much-troubled Chittagong Hill Tracts would be solved and a
just solution would be found.
</P>
<P>
"This is my firm belief that we will be able to resolve the
issue," she said while talking to newsmen at Zia International
Airport on her return from Indian capital New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Just on Saturday, the tribal rebels, who have been fighting
bush war ever since 1973 for autonomy in the three hill districts
bordering India and Myanmar, killed three policemen and defied the
current ceasefire with the government.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, however, said that she was always
optimistic about a possible solution to the problem, adding
"Unless you are optimist, the desired goal may not be achieved."
</P>
<P>
She said a national committee has been formed to hold talks
with the tribal leaders and the committee is expected to continue
the talks to find a permanent solution.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hasina left here for New Delhi three days ago to attend
the specialized Inter-Parliamentary Union conference, the theme of
which was "towards partnership between men and women in politics".
</P>
<P>
She also held separate talks with Indian President Shankar
Dayal Sharma and Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda.

<HEADLINE> India to Respond to U.S. Expulsion of Its Diplomats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 16 (Xinhua) -- India is formulating its
formal response to U.S. expulsion of its two diplomats from
America, External Affairs Ministry sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We are studying State Department's decision and formal
response is expected tomorrow," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
India had asked two U.S. diplomats to leave the country by
February 20 for their unauthorized meetings with Rattan Sehgal,
additional director in charge of anti-espionage division in the
Intelligence Bureau. Sehgal was asked to retire last December.
</P>
<P>
Washington's action was retaliatory in nature and was taken as
a protest against India's decision rather than on any specific
charges against the two Indian diplomats, the same sources said.
</P>
<P>
State Department Spokesman Phyllis Young said Saturday, "On
February 10, Indian charge d'affaires Mukhejee was summoned to the
State Department and told the U.S. requests that the Indian
government withdraws two officials for activities that were
incompatible with their consular status."
</P>
<P>
The two Indian diplomats were posted in the San Francisco and
Chicago consulates.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank and the
Inter-Arab Investment Guarantee Corporation (IAIGC) have signed a
memorandum of understanding to jointly boost investments on Arab
projects.
</P>
<P>
Officials from both sides said it is a time when good economic
performance is registered in the region as a whole, a source from
the Kuwaiti-based IAIGC said today.
</P>
<P>
The source said the memo was signed here Saturday after
preliminary negotiations were conducted between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The document provides that the two agencies would cooperate in
promoting investments in Arab region, exchanging investment
information and holding seminars in the field.
</P>
<P>
Minutes of joint guarantee are yet to be drafted, however.
</P>
<P>
The economy of the region has been picking up for the
past two years and most of the Arab countries are opening
windows to attract investments.
</P>
<P>
The IAIGC, which started its operations in mid 1975, has worked
to include all Arab countries as its members. Its role is to
provide insurance protection for investors in the Arab world in
case adverse events negatively affect their investments.
</P>
<P>
A survey of 1,000 Arab investors completed in 1996 showed
that the main risk they feared was the political instability
in the Arab world, followed by economic reforms, bureaucracy
and the high taxation system.

<HEADLINE> Cargo Ship Catches Fire at Kenyan Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 16 (Xinhua) -- A Hongkong-registered Greek
ship loaded with more than 10,000 tons of cargo burst into flames
as it approached Kenya's port of Mombasa Friday night, the Sunday
Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted maritime sources as saying that fire broke
out in hull number four, where containers of hydrogen peroxide,
among other chemicals, were loaded.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's port fire-fighters aboard pollution-control tugs
doused the fire in sea water before the vessel was brought
alongside berth number 18, where the crew started offloading the
cargo in an attempt to reach the burning containers.
</P>
<P>
The ship's First Officer, Ridal Kumar, said that there were no
injuries among the crew, adding the fire may cause substantial
losses.
</P>
<P>
Acting Marine Engineer of the Kenya Port Authority P.M.
Wainaina pointed out that measures had been taken to contain the
fire and prevent oil pollution.
</P>
<P>
Three tugs are on hand to tow the ship back to the sea should
the need arise, he added.
</P>
<P>
Maritime sources said that some of the containers of
pharmaceuticals from India were destined for Mombasa while others
were for Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The biggest fire ever recorded at the port of Mombasa was in
1978 on board the mv Rrafaela, which was carrying 14,000 tons of
cargo including chemicals.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Museveni Promises Free Secondary Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan president yoweri
museveni said he has an ambitious target of implementing free
universal secondary education by the end of his present term of
office (2002).
</P>
<P>
He made the pledge while addressing hundreds of old boys and
willwishers of Ntare school, his old school here yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Museveni was quoted by today's "New Vision", a local daily as
saying that he is optimistic that this target could be achieved
as it has been done with primary education.
</P>
<P>
He said, through universal primary education over three
million children who had failed to join school for lack of school
fees are now enrolled.
</P>
<P>
Uganda started its universal primary education last month.
Because of it, children enrollment rate in the primary school
went up from 2.1 percent of 3.98 million 6-12-yeear-olds last
year to 81.6 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
He told his audience that tax revenue in the country had
increased from 40 million dollars in 1986 to over 800 million
dollars today, which will enable the government to give more
contributions to educational institutions than before.

<HEADLINE> Newspaper: Netanyahu Tells Clinton Ideas of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 16 (Xinhua) -- In his fourth visit to
the White House in eight months, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu carved out a peace approach that is consistent with
the path of his predecessors, but not identical to it, according to
the pro-Likud newspaper The Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
The paper, in an editorial, said that Netanyahu is defining
what the "Likudification" of the Oslo process means in practice,
and U.S. President Clinton may have a better idea on what it
means now.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli premier is expected to return to Israel today
following his four-day visit to the U.S..
</P>
<P>
"Netanyahu is striving for a formula that will keep the
peace process alive and well, not one that will cause it
to explode or fall apart," said the paper. "It is too soon
to tell whether that formula will succeed, but whatever it is,
it seems to be within the range of reason for Washington,
and probably will be for the wide majority of Israelis."
</P>
<P>
The paper said that Netanyahu has called on Clinton to
urge Arab states to take concrete actions in reinforcing the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The paper added that Arab states cannot expect the Netanyahu
government to continue to tear itself apart over the peace process
and receive nothing but criticisms and threats in return from the
Arab world.
</P>
<P>
"This requirement to reciprocate goes not just for the Arab
world in general but for Syria and the Palestinians in
particular," said the paper. "Palestinian Authority Chairman
(President) Yasser Arafat can no longer act as if Netanyahu's
commitment to the peace process is in question," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"Redeployment in Hebron was a tough pill for Israel to
swallow; Now Arafat has bitter medicine of his own to take -- he
must dismantle the terrorist infrastructure of Hamas and other
groups opposed to the peace process," the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the Israeli-Syrian track, the paper said, "the ball
is clearly in Damascus's court. Israel has refrained from linking
 the opening of talks to Syria ending its proxy war against
Israel in Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
The paper concluded: "Israel will talk on the basis of
U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338, which is diplomatese for 'land
for peace.' Netanyahu may not be willing to go as far as
(Shimon) Peres would have, but the notion of territorial
compromise is clearly in the air."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabweans Urged Not to Forget Past History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 16 (Xinhua) -- President Robert Mugabe has
urged both the young and the old not to abandon the history of
their struggle because if that takes place it will be absolutely
dangerous for the unity and integrity of the nation.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Sunday Mail paper on the eve of his
73rd birthday which falls on February 21, Mugabe stressed, "it
would be dangerous for the nation if the young people were to
forget the history of the liberation struggle."
</P>
<P>
In reply to questions what new challenges were emerging and
what currently burning political issues were, Mugabe said
Zimbabweans should not accept all that the western countries
tried to tell them.
</P>
<P>
"This is why i have said i shall never ever listen to any
sermon on democracy from those who only yesterday were our
oppressors, fighting us. They have nothing to teach us about
democracy," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of reconciliation, Mugabe pointed out, "the
policy of reconciliation has yielded a position where we have
done all the forgiving without reciprocity."
</P>
<P>
He said, "there is need for those of us whto o cherish the
principles of our revolution to pass them on to the younger
generation."

<HEADLINE> India Explores Big Arms Purchase Deal With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 16 (Xinhua) -- India is exploring the
possibility of signing a large deal of purchasing advanced
weapons from Israel, English daily The Jerusalem Post
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Israeli officials as saying that senior
Indian officials had been visiting Israel's military plants.
Indian Defense Secretary T. K. Banjeri, accompanied by senior
Air Force and defense officers, recently inspected electronic
and radar systems at Israel's defense plants.
</P>
<P>
Banjeri was the second senior Indian defense official to
visit Israel recently. In last June, Abdul Kalam, the chief
scientist at the Indian Defense Ministry responsible for
research and development, secretly visited Israeli satellite and
missile programs.
</P>
<P>
Last December, Israel and India signed cooperation agreements
in several fields, including technological research and
development.
</P>
<P>
"There is good cooperation. We expect that in 1997, there
will be continuity of defense relations as well as contracts
signed," an Israeli defense official said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials revealed that the two countries were
considering significantly strengthening their military ties. "The
Indian military establishment wants relations with Israel but
the politicians in New Dehli are hesitating," said P. K.
Kumaraswamy, a researcher at Hebrew University's Truman Institute.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel is pursuing several contracts in India, and one
of them is the planned upgrading of several hundred T-72
tanks. Elbit Ltd., and El-Op in Ness Ziona, have joined in
a bid to provide the fire control systems for the vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Kumaraswamy said, however, the Indian government has found it
difficult to make decisions regarding a significant upgrade in
defense relations with Israel. One reason was that it lacks fund
for procurement programs. Moreover, India's ruling coalition has
prevented decisions on sensitive subjects such as arms deals with
Israel, he added.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been steadily increasing the sale of military
equipment to India, although officials refuse to release
figures.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) said it
had sold the Super Dvora Mark II attack boat to New Dehli.
In addition, IAI also delivered Astra business jets to India.
The company, along with BVR Teconology, also sold the Ehud
AIr Combat Maneuvering Instrument to the Indian Air Force.
</P>
<P>
Kumaraswamy said that India was also seeking a maritime
surveillance radar that could counter Pakistan's recent acquisition
of PC-3 Orion Radar from the United States.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Leader Accepts Arbitration On Controversial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb leader
Buljana Plavsic said on Saturday that a decision by the
arbitration tribunal to put controversial Brcko under
international control for not less than one year was in line with
Dayton peace accord on Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic, president of the Bosnia Serb Republic, told reporters
after meeting European Union representative to Bosnia Carl Bildt
that she saw nothing in the arbitration on the strategic Brcko
area that ran counter to the Dayton peace accord, as the decision
was on an area whose boundaries were not demarcated.
</P>
<P>
The president added that there was no reason to feel concerned
as the ruling would help ease the tension in the area and
guarantee the future of the area's Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Brcko, a six-kilometer-wide land corridor linking eastern and
western halves of Serb-controlled territory in northern Bosnia, is
the only place in Bosnia which is still disputable in the Dayton
agreement that was reached in November 1995. The dispute over who
should control it almost caused talks to collapse in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
Brcko was seized by Bosnian Serbs early in the 1992-95 war. The
judgment on the fate of the area was already postponed once for
two months from December 14, 1996 till now.
</P>
<P>
According to the decision by the arbitral tribunal on Friday,
Brcko would be placed under international supervision pending a
final decision on the town next year.
</P>
<P>
Bildt said the arbitration was a good thing for the people
living in Brcko and in the west of the Bosnia Serb Republic.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday Bildt also met with district leaders of
Brcko. Bildt said at a press conference after the meetings that
Brcko leaders had asked the international community to provide up
to hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars in aid to help rebuild the
area.
</P>
<P>
He added that the international community would send several
supervisors to oversee the implementation of the decision on
Brcko.

<P>
LUSAKA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- A joint environmental and
health protection program has been set up by the Zambian
government to preempt epidemics such as cholera.
</P>
<P>
Environment is all encompassing as it has an impact on
practically all spheres such as health, agriculture, tourism,
mining and industry and the Ministry of Environment is to work
out measures to address the issue, Minister William Harrington
said here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent outbreaks of cholera in Lusaka and
other parts of the country, Harrington noted, "cholera is no
longer just a health problem and we feel it is important for us
to first address these environmental causes" as "most of these
cholera outbreaks we have especially in Lusaka are as a direct
result of environmental problems."
</P>
<P>
He urged a change in the negative attitudes of the public
toward the environment, saying that no matter how committed his
ministry may be toward addressing environmental problems, the war
would not be won as long as members of the public do not change
their attitudes.
</P>
<P>
He also urged non-governmental organizations to devote their
activities toward environmental protection.

KUALA LUMPUR, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said today his country is for
immediate reformation of the United Nations (UN), especially the
UN Security Council.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Drought Continues to Worsen in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The drought situation in
Mandera district, northeastern Kenya is at its worst, forcing
mass migration of people and livestock to neighboring Somalia and
Ethiopia, the Sunday Standard reported today.
</P>
<P>
A research carried out by Mandera Education Development
Society said that all surface water in the area have dried up and
livestock pasture depleted.
</P>
<P>
Malnutrition of children under five years old accounts for 30
percent due to tremendous reduction of milk production and food
shortage, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the district requires immediate action to
save both human and animal life, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Meteorological Department of Kenya said on Saturday that
there would be no rains until mid March and predicted that the
current drought which has gripped most parts of this east African
country would continue to worsen.
</P>
<P>
The department noted that "significant numbers of livestock
are likely to be lost and the food situation will worsen in the
affected areas."
</P>
<P>
The current drought has affected most parts of the country
including all districts of Eastern and Northeastern provinces, 11
out of 17 districts in Rift Valley Province and four out of seven
districts in Central Province.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has declared the looming famine in the
country a national disaster, saying that some 2.5 million people
will require famine relief food in the next six months.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Denies Ruling Party Behind Plan to Amend Charter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today denied the ruling party Lakas-NUCD was behind a plan
to amend the Constitution to lift the term limits of the president
and other elective officials.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the president clarified that the statement of
Executive Secretary Ruben Torres issued to media over the weekend
regarding the supposed role of Lakas-NUCD on the Charter
amendments campaign was purely his "personal opinion".
</P>
<P>
"Secretary Torres is really just stating his personal opinion
because we have not taken any official stand in Lakas-NUCD. We
have not even met on this particular subject," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
Torres said earlier that an "overwhelming" majority of the
party favor amendments to the Constitution to pave the way to
extend Ramos' term for six more years. The current charter did not
allow Ramos to seek a second term.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, who is the national chairman of the Lakas-NUCD,
disclosed that only administrative matters, not Charter changes,
were taken up during his recent meetings with top Lakas-NUCD
officials.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lakas-NUCD spokesman Gualberto Lumauig revealed that
the ruling party would hold a caucus but the exact date was still
to be decided.
</P>
<P>
"We have no definite agenda yet on the planned caucus but it is
possible that the issue on constitutional amendments will be taken
up," he said.
</P>
<P>
Press Secretary Hector Villanueva reiterated on the same day
that Ramos' previous statements calling for changes in the Charter
should go beyond the issue of lifting the term limits of elective
officials.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized that the president was not interested in
seeking re-election and was, in fact, against the move to extend
the term limits of incumbent elected officials.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Efforts Being made to Tackle Traffic Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 16 (Xinhua) --The first "bus advance
area" system was put into operation today at one of the busiest
junctions in Malaysia's capital city of Kuala Lumpur as part of
efforts being made to overcome the city's traffic woes.
</P>
<P>
The system involves placing a set of traffic lights before the
existing ones to create a 50-meter "bus and taxi only" zone to
allow these vehicles to change lanes to move first ahead of other
motorists who will have to wait for the new traffic lights to turn
green.
</P>
<P>
A police officer said the system would be introduced in stages
in other parts of the city which is described as another
"Bangkok" known to all for its traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
This new system is a complement to the "bus special lane"
system which was enforced Saturday on 10 most choked roads of the
city, with "bus lanes" on seven of the 10 to be gazetted.
</P>
<P>
Motorists using the bus lanes will be fined at least 300
ringgit (about 120 US dollars), with the maximum penalty being
1,000 ringgit (about 400 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The system which gives priority to buses is aimed at ensuring
more efficient transportation and encouraging private car users to
leave their cars at home or at outstations to use public
transportation means to reduce the car flow in the city to ease
traffic congestion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, earlier on February 13, the city police started
imposing the maximum fine of 300 ringgit (about 120 dollars)
against the present 30 ringgit (about 12 dollars) on motorists
booked for parking their vehicles in the city's no-parking zones.
</P>
<P>
The increase in fine, according to City Police Traffic Chief
Supt. Mohamad Zain Ismail, was to prevent vehicle owners from
taking lightly their parking offenses which often resulted in
traffic jams in and around the city.
</P>
<P>
Police have identified indiscriminate parking to be one of the
main causes of traffic jams in the city. Other main causes of
traffic congestion in the city identified by police are the
increasing number of construction sites which had taken up parts
of roads and the increase of vehicles.

<P>
In Kuala Lumpur alone, which is not a spacious, sprawling city,
rather a compact, congested city, there are 1.4 million registered
vehicles, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Every five or six weeks, about 20,000 new vehicles are
registered to come out on roads in the city.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account outstation vehicles entering the city, the
situation is even worse, Mohamad Zain said, adding there are
estimated 1.8 million vehicles moving in and around Kuala Lumpur
at any one time during the day.
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, nearly 70 percent of motorists are
single occupancy vehicles, according to police observation.
</P>
<P>
And most of the indiscipline drivers commit an offense by being
trapped inside the yellow box at traffic junctions, blocking other
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Thus, road accidents in Kuala Lumpur are increasing. According
to official records, road mishaps in the city increased 19.5
percent to 33,375 cases with 396 casualties last year from 27,939
cases with 332 casualties in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The number of vehicles involved in last year's road accidents
was up by 14.4 percent to 60,053 units from 52,479 units reported
in 1995, the records showed.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the Malaysian authorities already carried out various
efforts in recent years to alleviate the traffic congestion,
including introducing commuter train system, Light Rail Transit
(LRT) system and air-conditioned bus service.
</P>
<P>
But, the public transport like bus and LRT does not attract
much crowd due to what was said its inconvenience like stops far
away from passengers' destinations, controversial high fare and
punctuality.
</P>
<P>
So the city's traffic congestion still remains a problem which
caused Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim to step in.
</P>
<P>
Last month, after a ride on a bus to see for himself how bad
the state of the city's public transport and traffic congestion
was, Anwar instructed the authorities and companies handling city
public transportation to come up with solutions to the capital's
traffic woes by February 3.
</P>
<P>
Anwar stressed the government could not afford to let traffic
congestion and poor public transport hinder other developments.
</P>
<P>
The above efforts made by the authorities concerned after
Anwar's instructions are believed to help mitigate if not entirely
solve the city's traffic woes that have been building up for
decades.

<HEADLINE> American Scientists Alarmed at Pinch of Nature Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEATTLE, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Ecologists attending a
conference here warned that the loss of nature's services is not
some hypothetical future disaster, nor something restricted to
poverty-stricken regions of the world.
</P>
<P>
Affluent Americans are also feeling the pinch of ecosystem
services, the "utilities" that natural systems provide free of
charge, like pollination of crops and maintenance of soil
fertility, said scientists attending the ongoing annual session of
the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).
</P>
<P>
They cited outbreaks of agricultural pests, diseases such as
acidification and decline of forests, and rapid siltation of
reserviors.
</P>
<P>
The most recent examples are disastrous mudslides in the states
of Washington and Oregon this winter, which were partly traceable
to overharvesting of timber. Northern California also suffered
severe floods not long ago, making people think of the natural
flood controls that forests exercise over flows of water.
</P>
<P>
"Interference with nature's services comes home to the rich in
higher fish prices and loss of sport fisheries, loss of real
estate values, higher risks from natural disasters like floods,
droughts and possibly other extreme weather events," alarmed Paul
Ehrlich, an ecologist from Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the damage of the natural system to population
growth, increased consumption per person, and the cultural,
institutional and technical means through which each unit of
consumption is supplied.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that a flood of lies and misinformation is being
generated by anti-environmental forces that helps keep that fact
from decision makers and from the public.

Absurd insertions Ehrilich listed include those saying that
ozone hole is a hoax, concern about global warming is unwarranted,
there is no extinction crisis, and continued human population
growth can be supported for seven billion years.
</P>
<P>
Those who generate these misinformation are only concerned
about their personal financial interests.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the trees, shrubs and herbs growing on a
Washington State hillside, for example, not only help to control
erosion and flooding, but also are involved in maintaining the
balance of gases in the atmosphere, cleaning the air and recycling
wastes.
</P>
<P>
"That's why scientists are so concerned with the mass
extinction of populations and species of plants, animals and
microbes now under way," he said, citing humanity causes the
extinction of at least one species and thousands of populations of
other organisms every day.
</P>
<P>
Gretchen Daily, another Standford ecologist, said that the
goods and services provided annually by natural ecosystems are
worth many trillions of dollars in conventional economic
terms. She is editor of a new book, Nature's Services, a book
featuring contributions from more than 30 distinguished economists
and natural scientists.
</P>
<P>
Nature's services are the life support functions normally
performed by ecosystems, such as purification of air and water,
detoxification and recycling of wastes, generation and maintenance
of soil fertility, pollination of crops and other plants,
regulation of climate, and mitigation of weather extremes like
flood or drought.
</P>
<P>
Two Columbia University professors and a Smithsonian
Institution scientists have embarked on an unprecedented research
agenda to calculate an economic value for natural resources which
include forests, oceans and fossil fuels.
</P>
<P>
Their research will explore assigning dollar values to
biological systems. For example, the natural purification of water
by bacteria can replace chemicals and filters. For New York City,
the cost is 4 billion dollars. For all the world's large urban
areas, a figure would be 900 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> First Patrol Boat Ordered from France to Arrive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The first of eight fast
patrol boats being built in France for the Kuwaiti Navy is
expected to be delivered later this year to beef up Kuwait's
defense capability, according to informed military sources here
today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the boat was rolled out at the Cherbourg
Shipyard in northwestern France recently.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait signed a contract with the French shipbuilder
Construction Mechaniques De Normandie in March 1995 to purchase
eight 250-tone "Combattante 1" patrol vessels valued at around 500
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The patrol boats, expected to be used in coastal defense
operation, are specially designed to work in the restricted
waters off Kuwait in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's Defense Ministry said recently that the 42-meter-long
patrol craft would be equipped by Sea Skua surface-to-surface
missiles built by Matra and British Aerospace.
</P>
<P>
The construction time for the first boat is two years and the
sources said sea trials will be completed this summer. The second
vessel should be completed by next summer, they said, adding that
the program was runing on schedule until early next century.
</P>
<P>
The French company will also provide a fully integrated
combat system that will include French-built Thomson 3-D radar,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
France had also been competing for a missile contract from
Kuwait, but failed to win the deal.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that the British missiles to be
equipped on the patrol boats would cost about 90 million
U.S. dollars. Kuwait had drafted a plan to spend 11 billion
dollars over 10 years in a bid to improve its armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
During the Gulf crisis in 1990, Kuwait's most of military
strength was destroyed as a result of the Iraqi occupation.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- About 200 vehicles have been
impounded by the anti-smuggling unit of Uganda Revenue Authority
(URA) in the southwestern district of Masaka, according to a
report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the crackdown carried out on Saturday was
intended to net road license defaulters and smugglers who use the
Lake Victoria and Mutukula border post as an inlet. Mutukula is
about 100 kilometers south of Masaka.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown virtually paralyzed business in the affected
areas in the district, the report said.
</P>
<P>
During the operation, sugar from South Africa and other
assorted goods from Dubai which smugglers were trying to cross
into the country via Lake Victoria were impounded, the report
added.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Commissioner in the URA Jack Bigirwa was quoted as
saying, "the exercise will continue. We shall use both the ground
and air means to crack down on the smugglers who seem to be on
the increase."
</P>
<P>
He said, "owners of the goods and vehicles will have to pay
the due to the URA before they are released. If the owners fail
to pay, the state will confiscate their vehicles and the URA will
auction them to recover the taxes."

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has not paid
its total annual membership contribution to international
organizations for the past three years, the local paper "Sunday
Observer" said today.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's last total membership contribution was made in
1993. It contributed a total of Tanzania Shillings (Tshs)
4,908,561,450 about 8.2 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted highly-placed sources with the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation as saying, "we have
not been able to measure up to the yearly contribution since
1993," citing economic constraints as the set-back.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, the value of the Dollar has doubled. Tanzania will
thus have to double pay a total of Tshs 9,817,122,900 if it is to
pay this year's contribution, the sources further said.
</P>
<P>
Last year Tanzania managed to pay only 10 percent of its
contribution to some few organizations including the Organization
of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
The ministry has been reviewing the possibility of withdrawing
Tanzania's membership from some of the organizations since 1987,
but no resolution has however be reached so far, according to the
sources.
</P>
<P>
"For the past 10 years, the ministry has yet decided which
criterion should be used in withdrawing its membership," the
sources added, noting however that the ministry has started
reviving the idea recently.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania now has membership in 150 international
organizations.

NANNING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Nanning, capital city of
southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, utilized 239
million US dollars of foreign investment in 1996, four times that
of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Due to its geographic advantage as a communication hub of
China's southwestern region, Nanning was approved by the State
Council as an open coastal city in 1992.
</P>
<P>
An official with the city government says that, the government
has taken great efforts to improve the investment environment by
improving management and service quality.
</P>
<P>
The city government makes it a point to serve foreign-funded
enterprises by helping solve problems in water and electricity
supply, loans and related disputes.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 248 foreign-funded enterprises are now
operational. In 1996, the foreign-funded enterprises made a
combined output value of 2.5 billion yuan, up 31.58 percent over
the previous year. Exports of the foreign-funded enterprises
totalled 32.88 million US dollars, accounting for one third of the

<HEADLINE> Rusedski Sets up Final Match with Sampras </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Greg Rusedski eliminated
Andre Agassi 6-3, 6-4 in the Sybase Open Saturday night to set up
a final match against Pete Sampras.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, defending champion and world number one, beat Todd
Martin 6-2, 6-3 earlier Saturday for Sunday's final at the San
Jose Arena.
</P>
<P>
Rusedski, No. 39 in the world and seeded seventh, had 14 aces,
including one which was clocked at 223.7 kph. He hit the fastest
serve of all time, 225 kph, in Beijing last October on match point
against Jean-Philippe Fleurian.
</P>
<P>
The serve simply overpowered the third-seeded Agassi, who
returned the British left-hander's 180.2 kph serve into the net at
match point. Agassi was unable to serve an ace during the
73-minute match.
</P>
<P>
In the earlier semifinal match, Martin, ranked No. 14 and
seeded fourth, had trouble with his first serves during the
59-minute play due to his tendinitis in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
The top-seeded Sampras, who had eight aces, capped the victory
with an overhand smash on capture match point. It was his 11th
straight victory this year and 14th straight overall.
</P>
<P>
Sampras has won 12 of his last 14 meetings with Martin, his
last loss coming in the semifinals of the 1995 Memphis Open.

<HEADLINE> Chief Executive Meets Rifkind in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive-designate of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Tung Chee Hwa
met with British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind here this
morning.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing after the meeting, Tung said that
the discussion was very useful and constructive.
</P>
<P>
He said that they talked about the overall need for a stable
and good transition, which is the desire of the whole people of
Hong Kong; they talked about the need to cooperate between the SAR
government and the Hong Kong government today; and they also
discussed the Provisional Legislative Council and the need for
support and help from the Hong Kong government.
</P>
<P>
"We exchanged views very generally about the role of Britain
after 1997, and I emphasized the importance of the British
commercial interest in Hong Kong," Tung said, adding that he hoped
the British business community will continue to play an important
role in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions about Rifkind's saying in Singapore that
China's policies are damaging confidence in Hong Kong, Tung said:
"I did say to him (Rifkind) that you should look at the business
community's confidence level: a survey done by various business
organizations showed the confidence level of the French business
community in Hong Kong was at 90 percent, that of the British
business community was at 92 percent and that of the American
business community was at 95 percent."
</P>
<P>
"So I think it is important when we see these things to bear in
mind what is actually happening in Hong Kong. For many of us who
are local residents in Hong Kong, it would be nice if you talk
these things through in Hong Kong, this is very important."
</P>
<P>
Rifkind arrived here Saturday night after attending the
Asian-European foreign ministers' meeting in Singapore. According
to official sources, he will leave Hong Kong for London Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Hong Kong, he also met with Governor of Hong
Kong Chris Patten and other senior government officials, as well
as local Executive Council and Legislative Council members.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Stresses Importance to Join First Euro Wave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi today reiterated the importance of being one of the first
countries to adopt the Euro, the future single European currency
set by the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference of his center-left Olive Tree
alliance, Prodi said, "It makes no sense to wait a year to be part
of the European Monetary Union (EMU)."
</P>
<P>
"When you join a club, the first thing the founding members do
is to draw up stricter rules and higher charges for those who come
in afterwards," Prodi said.
</P>
<P>
The EU is targeting to launch the Euro by January 1, 1999. But
scepticism is growing over whether the deadline can be met as few
members have been able to fulfill the EMU criteria set by the
Maastricht Treaty due to their sluggish economy.
</P>
<P>
One of the criteria is that the budget deficit and national
debt of a member country must not exceed 3 and 60 percent
respectively of its gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Prodi indicated that Italy was already reaching three of the
five criteria. He also expressed confidence that his country would
fulfill all the five by 1998.

<HEADLINE> Moody's Not to Downgrade Thailand's Credit Rating: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh said if Moody's investor services is fed with good
news about the country's economy, it will not downgrade Thailand's
credit worthiness status.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit told reporters on Saturday that the problem had arisen
because Thailand had not given clear information to the U.S.
agency and that with proper economic details the analysis might
change.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Moody's, which monitors credit worthiness of
countries in the world, said it was reviewing Thailand's status
and might downgrade its A2 rating.
</P>
<P>
Last September, Moody's downgraded Thailand's short-term
sovereign ceiling rating for bank deposits and other short-term
obligations from prime 1 to prime 2, because of the country's poor
economic performances.
</P>
<P>
If the country's credit worthiness is downgraded, it will cost
Thai businesses more to obtain long-term loans from abroad,
resulting in higher production costs and making exports more
expensive.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit said, "If we in the nation follow the belt-tightening
policy and work for the country, we can be confident in our
economy."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Transport and Communications Minister Suwat
Liptapallop said that he was concerned about Moody's announcement,
saying that if Thailand's credit worthiness is to be downgraded,
the investment climate and prospects for loans would be affected.
</P>
<P>
He said it was now necessary for the government to move to
restore confidence in the economy.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Thai Finance Ministry, questioning
Moody's motive, said the move to downgrade Thailand's credit
worthiness had a psychological effect on investors, especially
those in the stock market, the Bangkok Post quotes a ministry
source as saying.
</P>
<P>
Moody's statement came just as Thailand was being hit hard by
rumors of baht devaluation.

<HEADLINE> PML(N)'s Soomro Elected Pakistan's House Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Veteran politician of the
Pakistan Muslim League (N) Ellahi Bakhsh Soomro today took oath as
the new speaker of the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Because of his rival's withdrawal, the gray-haired Soomro from
Sindh province was elected without casting ballots by members of
the National Assembly to take over the job from outgoing speaker
Yousuf Raza Gilani.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mohammad Jaffer Iqbal, also from the PML(N), was
elected the deputy speaker of the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Since the withdrawal of the candidates of the Pakistan People's
Party led by former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, it was not
necessary for the National Assembly members to cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
Soomro, in his 60s, is a close friend of prime minister-elect
Nawaz Sharif, chief of the Pakistan Muslim League (N).
</P>
<P>
Regarded as one of the "cleanest political birds", Soomro, was
a federal minister in the first Sharif government (1990-1993).
</P>
<P>
Iqbal, in his 40s, was a minister in Punjab province and is
also considered to be among Sharif's closest aides.
</P>
<P>
Gilani, who was defeated in the February 3 elections, will
leave the office of speaker today.
</P>
<P>
The PML(N) has won a massive victory in the general elections
by bagging 134 seats in the 217-member National Assembly while its
arch rival, the PPP, has scored only 17 seats.
</P>
<P>
Sharif is to take oath as the new prime minister Monday.
</P>

Elected members of the National Assembly took oath on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Decision on Hydro Project by US Firm Put off in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Nepal has decided to call
additional proposals for a large-scale hydropower project while a
big energy group of the United States is eager to develop it with
an investment of several billion US dollars, the local press said
today.
</P>
<P>
The Water Resources Ministry has delayed to decide on the
proposal by Enron Corp., the U.S. power conglomerate, to develop
the 10,800-megawatt Karnali project in West Nepal and is on the
process of inviting additional bids for the project from other
foreign companies, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Enron group last year put forth its proposal of developing
the Karnali project and another 402-megawatt project in East Nepal
with 9 billion dollars on Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) basis to
the Nepali government.
</P>
<P>
A high-level delegation from the American company late last
month came to Nepal to explain its proposal of developing the two
projects to Nepali officials and lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
According to the company, the delay in the implementation of
the Karnali project under its proposal would cost Nepal at least 2
billion dollars in power revenue and taxes every year.
</P>
<P>
The company also said in its proposal that a process of
competitive bidding would lower the values of Nepal's water
resources.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Water Resources Ministry's decision to call for
competitive bids, Enron, which claims to be the world leader in
development of independent energy projects, is most likely to win
the letter of intent for developing the Karnali project, about 400
km west of here, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's office has been for granting the project
to Enron in accordance with the government's "first come, first
serve" policy on large-sized hydropower projects, they said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's tribal insurgents
Saturday ambushed and killed three policemen at Katapahar, four
kilometers off the Roangchhari county of the troubled southeast
Bandarban hill tracts, said reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Police said the shooting took place on Saturday morning when
the tribal rebels fired automatic weapons on the police group
patrolling the road.
</P>
<P>
The outlawed gunmen took away three automatic rifles and
ammunition from the police patrols while making their way into
deep forest.
</P>
<P>
This is the first killing incident, which also defied the
current ceasefire that ends March 31, after the peace talks held
in the capital from January 25 to 27 between the government and
the tribal guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The Buddhist rebels have been fighting bush war since 1973 for
political autonomy in the three hill districts in southeast
Bangladesh bordering India and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The insurgency has claimed the lives of more than 20,000
people, including 500 troops, and driven 50,000 tribals into
refugee camps in the Indian state of Tripura.
</P>
<P>
The next round of peace talks aiming at resolving the
Chittagong hill tracts problem is scheduled for March 12.

MOSCOW, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Two Russian women reporters
from Itar-Tass and Interfax news agencies have safely returned to
Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikstan, ten days after they were taken
hostages by the Tajik Islamist guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The two reporters, Galina Gridneva and Suraye Sabirova,
together with a driver, were set free by the rebels late Friday,
in exchange for six rebel fighters, from the captors' base on a
mountain top in a barren rocky region about 80 kilometers from the
capital.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Ignatyenko described the
release of the three captives as a good deal and said that the
Russian and Tajik governments are seeking a way for the release of
the remaining hostages, Interfax news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas led by Bakhrom Sadirov have been demanding the
return of fellow-fighters from Afghanistan in return for the
release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 11 hostages held by Sadirov's men include three
U.N. observers -- two from Switzerland and one from Ukraine -- and
four workers with the U.N. refugee agency, two Russian television

<HEADLINE> Thai Economy in Poor State: PM Chavalit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh has admitted that the country's economy is in a poor
state.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on bureaucratic reform on Saturday,
Chavalit said his government must work hard to win back public and
investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
He in particular mentioned that the government would promote
exports and encourage the people to save.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Thailand's exports registered a drop of 0.1 percent
and the economic growth rate is believed to be below 7 percent,
the lowest in a decade.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the new constitution, which is in the process of
being drafted, he said it will not be a "magic medicine" to cure
all the country's "political diseases."
</P>
<P>
He said it was dangerous for the people to believe that the new
charter could completely eliminate chronic problems such as
corruption and vote-buying.
</P>
<P>
When the public sees that the new constitution does not help
solve these problems, they will completely loose faith in the
political system, he said.
</P>
<P>
The constitution drafting assembly is expected to finish a
charter draft by August 22 and the new charter will be adopted in
two years' time.

<HEADLINE> China Enhances Economic Ties with Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Trade between Africa and China
hit 4.03 billion US dollars last year, up 2.7 percent from the
previous year, according to Chinese Customs statistics.
</P>
<P>
The figure represented 1.3 percent of China's external trade,
the statistics indicate.
</P>
<P>
Economic reform and development in Africa and China are
creating increasing opportunities for bilateral trade and economic
co-operation, today's "China Daily" quotes Minister of Foreign
Trade and Economic Co-operation Wu Yi as saying.
</P>
<P>
Great potential exists because China and Africa are highly
complementary in resources, products, and economies, she said.
</P>
<P>
Africa is rich in mineral resources, wood, coffee, cocoa, and
cotton. It also has abundant fishing and agricultural
resources. However, Wu said, African countries generally lack
capital and technology to exploit those resources and want
international co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China possesses relatively advanced technology and
equipment to exploit petroleum and various mineral resources. And
it needs many kinds of raw materials from Africa.
</P>
<P>
"It is highly possible Africa will become a major partner of
China in these sectors in the next century," she said.
</P>
<P>
China will launch six investment and trade centers in Africa
this year to help domestic enterprises to expand business in the
continent, Wu revealed.

<HEADLINE> Hostage Talks Suspends without Agreement in Lima </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Peruvian government and
rebels holding 72 hostages at the Japanese ambassador's residence
here failed to reached an agreement today in their third round of
talks.
</P>
<P>
A vague statement issued after the talks suggested that the two
sides need to move closer if talks are to continue.
</P>
<P>
The two sides did not announce when they would return to the
table.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Ambassador Anthony Vincent, who was mediating the
talks, told reporters negotiations would continue as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
In the three-hour meeting, government negotiator Domingo
Palermo and rebel representative Roli Rojas Fernandez finished
making their proposals for the agenda of definitive talks.
</P>
<P>
Vincent said the negotiators agreed "to elaborate a proposal
which will facilitate the continuation of the preliminary
conversations".
</P>
<P>
He did not explain what that meant, but the statement indicated
that talks between the government and the rebels, starting on
Tuesday, had run into trouble.
</P>
<P>
When the second round of talks was held Friday, Vincent said
that "the conversations have resulted in real progress."
</P>
<P>
The hostage crisis started on December 17, 1996, when 22
guerrillas of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA)
stormed into the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima, taking
more than 500 cocktail party guests hostage to press for the
release of their 400 comrades from jail.
</P>
<P>
Most of the hostages have now been freed but the rebels are
still holding 72 key people, including two Peruvian ministers, the
Japanese and Bolivian ambassadors, some Japanese businessmen and
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori's brother.

<HEADLINE> China's Auto Industry Continues Opening Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- China's open policy for its
auto mobile industry should continue despite debate over foreign
participation in most car manufacturing projects, today's "China
Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The English newspaper quoted Zhang Xiaoyu, director-general of
the Ministry of Machinery's automobile department, as saying that
China's stance for international co-operation for the industry has
not changed, and policies remain consistent.
</P>
<P>
The one billion US dollars mid-size car manufacturing joint
venture between the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp and General
Motors of the United States has just been approved by the State
Council. License registration is to be completed as soon as the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation endorses it.
</P>
<P>
Two Chinese plants and Germany's Mercedes-Benz are discussing
plans to build a one billion US dollars plant in south
China. However Chinese auto makers will strengthen research and
development independent of foreign-funded joint ventures, Zhang
said.
</P>
<P>
The two-way development would create an auto industry that
would be relatively independent from foreign capital and
technology and product ranges, as many government officials,
industry insiders and researchers insist is necessary.
</P>
<P>
The Changchun-based China First Automotive Corp is pioneering
an independent path with its competitive technology, professionals
and financial strength.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said he advocated competition between Chinese and foreign
auto makers as well as between Chinese and foreign-funded joint
ventures.
</P>
<P>
In Changchun, Jilin Province, China First Automotive Corp. is
making efforts to develop Chinese sedans and limousines.
</P>
<P>
Independent Chinese research and development is moving in sync
with a joint venture between First Automotive Corp and Germany's
Volkwagen AG.
</P>
<P>
In Shiyan, Hubei Province, Dongfeng Motor Group and its joint
venture with France's Citroen is expected to have separate
research and development.
</P>
<P>
Separate technology and product development will be the normo
in Beijing, where Beijing Automotive Industry (Group) Corp and
Beijing Jeep Corp, a joint venture with US Chrysler Corp, go their
own ways.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, where an Volkswagen-funded joint venture
constitutes the backbone of the automotive industry, the
State-owned Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp will consider
independent research and development, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Through debate last year, more Chinese recognized the
automotive industry's fate in intense worldwide competition under
a low trade barrier depends on the strength of the industry's
development ability, the paper says.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Appoints Commission to Negotiate With Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadoran Acting President
Fabian Alarcon appointed today all the members of the Ecuadoran
commission to negotiate pending border disputes between his
country and Peru.
</P>
<P>
Alarcon named Edgar Teran as chief of the group, which is due
to negotiate with the Peruvian side in Brasilia, capital of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The negotiators are expected to discuss the demarcation in the
disputed Zarumilla Canal zone. Last month, the commission visited
the zone.
</P>
<P>
Teran said that his appointment was "a logical and wise step,"
because it showed Alarcon would continue to adopt the same foreign
policy toward Peru.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador and Peru, sharing a common border of almost 1,700
kilometers, have disputes over the demarcation in several
sections, especially in the jungle area to the east of El Condor
near the Amazon.
</P>
<P>
The two countries were involved in a brief armed conflict early
1995 due to a border dispute over a zone in the Andes known as the
Condor Range.

<HEADLINE> 12,000 Labor Violations Reported in Costa Rica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Costa Rican Labor
Ministry received a total of 12,200 labor rights violation
complaints filed by workers in 1996, a senior official said today.
</P>
<P>
Of the 12,200 cases, 7,808 involved economic disputes between
employers and workers, Vice Labor Minister Eugenio Solano was
quoted by local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that the most frequent charges were against unjustified
termination of labor contracts after the employers refused to pay
legal benefits.
</P>
<P>
Most workers signed labor contracts detrimental to their own
rights for fear of losing jobs during the country's economic
restructural process which started last year, the vice minister
said.
</P>
<P>
He said 4,868 cases were registered in San Jose, the capital of
Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that from 1991 to 1996 the Labor Ministry
received 10,200 cases annually against labor rights violations.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Ruling Party Wants 2nd Term for Ramos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The ruling party Lakas-NUCD of
the Philippines finally admitted it was in the forefront of a
campaign to amend the Constitution to enable President Fidel Ramos
to run for a second term, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ruben Torres, vice president of the
Lakas-NUCD, said an "overwhelming" majority of the party favors
amendments to the Charter to pave the way to extend Ramos' term
for six more years.
</P>
<P>
He said the party leaders would try to convince the president
to include the lifting of term limits in an ongoing campaign to
introduce changes in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Ramos changed his mind and decided to support Charter changes
after the Supreme Court recently meddled in the government's
business and economic affairs. However, he said the move was aimed
at clipping the powers of the Supreme Court, not extending his
term of office.
</P>
<P>
Torres said that Ramos would also be convinced to call for a
party caucus in one or two months to discuss the lifting of term
limits for the president and other elective officials.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the party leaders will listen to the party chairman
(Ramos), but if there is an overwhelming demand, he might be the
one to bow," Torres said.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Chief Legal Counsel Renato Cayetano said that
Charter changes could be faster, cheaper and more reliable if the
Congress convenes itself into a constituent assembly.
</P>
<P>
However, the Senate stood firm against any Charter changes.
Senate President Ernesto Maceda said the chamber remained bound by
a 1995 resolution opposing changes in the Constitution before
1998. He warned that Charter changes would affect the country's
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, senator Edgardo Angara, chairman of the opposition
Laban Ng Demokratikong Pilipino, said Torres' statements confirmed
that the administration organized groups to create false and
fabricated public clamor for Charter changes.
</P>
<P>
He added that the two Presidential Palace officials' statement
also proved that it was Ramos himself who lifted the veil of the
People's Initiative for Reform, Modernization and Action, which
was launched to amend the Constitution last year.

<HEADLINE> China Cutting Down On Grain Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- China imported 12 million tons
of grain in 1996, down 42 percent from the previous year, while
grain exports increased 42.3 percent to 1.43 million tons last
year, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing based English newspaper also quotes statistics from
a report released by the Ministry of Agriculture Information
Center as showing that, in 1996, China's wheat imports decreased
28.3 percent to 8.3 million tons.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, since early last year, the central
government has adjusted its tax rebates to foreign traders,
decreasing the rate to three percent from seven percent for
exporters of agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
The change dampened the enthusiasm of agricultural exporters
but gave the government opportunities to save more grain for its
reserves, which are considered vital for implementing its grain
security policy.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, China decreased its imports of grain, cotton. cooking
oil, sugar, fertilizers, seafood and meat products. But its
imports of fresh vegetables, fruits and eggs increased.
</P>
<P>
To balance its foreign trade in agricultural products, China's
exports of grain, sugar, fertilizers, seafood, fresh vegetables,
fruit and eggs also expanded.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's report indicated China's foreign trade of
agricultural produce gained a trade surplus of 4.64 billion US
dollars last year to reach 23.64 billion. But its trade volume
dropped 11.8 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that, exports of agricultural products decreased
month by month from February to September last year because the
government cut tax rebates to exporters and the country
experienced a bountiful harvest.
</P>
<P>
However, rising demand fueled prices of farm produce
internationally, and China's exports of agricultural products
regained vitality after last October, and started to increase
sharply.
</P>
<P>
The report explained 52 percent of agricultural exports went to
Hong Kong and Japan. Guangdong and Shangdong have become the
largest foreign trading provinces for farm produce as their sea
ports are equipped with comparatively strong handling
capacities. Beijing was the largest recipient of the country's
grain imports last year.
</P>
<P>
Australia has emerged as the second largest supplier of
agricultural products for China. The United States is the largest,
the paper says.

<HEADLINE> More Urban Residents hoard Foreign Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Foreign money has become
commonplace for more urban residents in China, today's "China
Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
According to the Beijing-based newspaper, a survey conducted by
Bank of China's Finance Institute showed 67 percent of Beijing,
Harbin, Wuhan and Lanzhou residents owned foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed an amazingly high proportion of older people
has hard currency. Among people over 60, 88.9 percent had foreign
money.
</P>
<P>
The more people earn, the more foreign currency they
own. Respondents who earn more than 261.4 US dollars a month have
foreign currency on hand. A third of the respondents who earn
fewer than 26.1 US dollars a month have foreign money.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that, 33.7 percent get foreign money from
overseas friends or relatives, 41 percent from banks or the black
market, and 32.5 percent earned it when working abroad.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 46.3 percent of the respondents keep
foreign currency because they worry the renminbi might devaluate.
High inflation rates in 1993 and 1994 also made residents want to
hoard foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
The second strongest reason Chinese people want foreign
currency is to buy duty-free products. Some people think the
quality of duty-free goods is guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
About 27.8 percent of respondents said they do not have
specific reasons for keeping foreign exchange, while 15.7 percent
said they keep the hard currency because they plan to go abroad.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed 49.8 percent of the foreign exchange held by
Chinese residents was in US dollars, 35.2 percent in Hong Kong
dollars and 15.88 percent in Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
About 85 percent said they had most confidence in the US
dollar. Other respondents preferred the German mark, British pound
and Japanese Yen, the paper says.

<HEADLINE> British Gov't Rules Out Contacts With Sinn Fein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
ruled out further contacts with Sinn Fein, the political wing of
the Irish Republican Army (IRA), following the murder of a British
soldier earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC radio interview today, British Northern
Ireland Secretary Patrick Mayhew said that the recent repeated IRA
attacks in Northern Ireland have made it even more difficult for
Sinn Fein to attend the all-party peace talks even if the IRA
declared a new cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
A 23-year-old British soldier was shot dead by a suspected IRA
sniper at an army checkpoint in Belfast Wednesday and this is the
second British army casualty since the IRA ended their
17-month-old cease-fire last February.
</P>
<P>
Mayhew noted that Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams had requested a
meeting with British government officials last week, but "in light
of the events of this week it certainly isn't appropriate now."
</P>
<P>
"You cannot then come along and say we now declare an
unequivocal restoration of our cease-fire and expect that to be
accepted after not only the murder of this young soldier but all
other attempts that have made (upon British armed forces)," he
said.

<P>
ATHENS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Greek police today arrested
four Ukrainians and a Moldavian for passing counterfeit 10,000
drachma (about 40 U.S. dollar) notes on the market.
</P>
<P>
Oleg Andriasko, 27, was arrested trying to shop with one of the

<HEADLINE> American Airlines Continues Flying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 15 (Xinhua) -- After U.S. President Bill
Clinton took action to have blocked the pilots strike earlier
today, American Airlines quickly let its planes flying.
</P>
<P>
To avoid economic losses, the airlines was trying to lure back
passengers with hefty discounts and double frequent-flier miles.
</P>
<P>
The airline said fewer than 100 of 2,200 daily departures had
been canceled. The canceled flights involved Europe, Japan and
South America, and had been announced in advance of the midnight
Friday strike deadline because the airlines did not want to have
planes stranded on foreign soil.
</P>
<P>
American spokesman Tim Smith said all flights should be running
regularly by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Smith said the airplanes were running at about 60 percent
capacity over the weekend and the strike threat would cost the
company 100 million U.S. dollars in lost revenue.
</P>
<P>
Many passengers jammed the ticket counters of American's
competitors in some cities today, but the American terminal was
relatively quiet.
</P>
<P>
To woo back passengers, American announced its offer of deep
discounts on walk-up airfares through March 3 and double
frequent-flier points through March 14.
</P>
<P>
The strike lasted just a few minutes before Clinton ordered a
60-day "cooling off" period. Under the order, negotiations will
continue during the 60-day "cooling off period."
</P>
<P>
In signing the order, Clinton appointed a three-member
emergency board. The board will take 30 days to propose a
settlement while the pilots are continuing to fly. The parties
would get another 30 days to resolve the dispute. If that doesn't
work, Congress could impose a settlement.
</P>
<P>
The disputes between the American Airlines and the pilot union
focused on the rate of wage increases and stock options. Pilots
want raises totaling 11 percent through 2000 and increased stock
options. The company has offered 6 percent and smaller stock
options.

<HEADLINE> Immunity Waived for Georgian Diplomat Involved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February (Xinhua) -- The Republic of Georgia has
lifted diplomatic immunity for its diplomat in Washington, who was
involved in a car accident that killed a girl, the U.S. State
Department announced today.
</P>
<P>
"This is an unusual case," State Department Spokesman Nicholas
Burns said.
</P>
<P>
"There are very few instances in diplomatic history where a
government has lifted diplomatic immunity in a case like this,
where the charges are so serious," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Georgian move will lead to the filing of crimes against
George Makharadze, the second-ranking diplomat in Georgia's
embassy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Police accused Makharadze of drinking before driving and being
responsible for the accident, which occurred on January 3, also
injuring four others.

"We're very gratified.... We think this is the best step
forward, and we're very, very appreciative to the government of
Georgia," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
The next step, Burns noted, is for the Justice Department to
file formal charges against Makharadze.

<HEADLINE> Kontic Accepts Nomination as Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Prime Minister
Radoje Kontic, who has been nominated by Yugoslav President Zoran
Lilic as head of the new government, accepted the nomination
today.
</P>
<P>
"It is a great honor for me to be entrusted by the president of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with composing the new federal
government," he told a press conference in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
After a wide-range consultation with political parties and
institutions in the country, President Lilic sent a letter to the
parliament earlier in the day nominating the current prime
minister to remain the head of the cabinet after his current term
of office expires in March.
</P>
<P>
"In the coming days, I shall endeavor to compose a government
of professional, competent officials who will, I hope, be able to
successfully face the present complex political, economic and
social problems, who will be able thanks to their knowledge and
capabilities to respond to all challenges of the present time and
the coming period," Kontic said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the new government will probably be a
coalition, but it is essential for it to draw up a program in
which deputies from opposition parties will also be interested.
</P>
<P>
This means the internal policy program will focus on overall
economic reforms, the establishment of the rule of law, political
and economic democratization and the consolidation of the federal
state as a community of republics and citizens enjoying equal
rights, Kontic said.
</P>
<P>
As regards foreign policy, the prime minister said the new
government will give priority to the reintegration in the
international community, including international political,
financial, trade and other organizations.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, comprised of Serbia and
Montenegro, has not been admitted into the United Nations or other
key international financial institutions due to its debt disputes
with other republics which have broken away from the former
Yugoslavia in 1991-92.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Zambia Concerned Over Situation in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba called here today for closely monitoring the volatile
situation in neighboring Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba made the appeal upon his return from a four-day visit
to Malawi.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said his country is concerned over the situation in
Zaire and is ready to handle Zairean refugees as the crisis in
the country continues.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Home Affairs Minister Chitalu Sampa today warned
Zambians not to give asylum to unregistered Zairean refugees,
saying that if not properly handled the influx of the refugees
could spark off problems in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
He said the armed conflict between the Zairean government
forces and the anti-government forces is still going on and the
number of refugees is expected to increase.
</P>
<P>
After over 3,000 more Zairean refugees arrived in Mpulungu
port in northern Zambia by four big boats on Thursday, bringing
the total number of the Zairean refugees to 4,600, the Zambian
government sent a team to the area to investigate the new
arrivals.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government has also intensified screening of
Zairean refugees and taken measures at border check points to
check armed infiltrators masquerading as refugees to enter the
country.
</P>
<P>
The influx of the refugees also has concerned local officials
and residents.
</P>
<P>
Robertson Nthala, a local official, was worried about the poor
security arrangement at Mpulungu harbor where hundreds of
refugees fleeing ethnic fighting in eastern Zaire are pouring in
almost daily.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the increasing number of refugees has posed a
great danger because some of them are coming with weapons and
then selling them to the local people and even to criminals.
</P>
<P>
He said the police and other security officers should be
equipped with a speed boat to enable them to carry out a constant
patrol of the Tanganyike Lake as some refugees disembark from
their boats before reaching the harbor and cross into villages.
</P>
<P>
With the cases of diarrhea and suspected cholera already
surfacing, the whole community in Mpulungu will be wiped out if
an epidemic breaks out.
</P>
<P>
A captain of refugee boat said a number of refugees have been
dying on the boats while other are giving birth on waters.
</P>
<P>
Mpulungu port authorities were also worried as there is very
little control of people moving in and out of their premises.
</P>
<P>
The large number of boats on the port has also adversely
affected the operations of the port.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees
were facing difficulties in transporting the new arrivals to the
transit center in Kasama about 200 km from the port because of
inadequate transport.

<HEADLINE> Three Shellings Fired in Mostar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Croats fired three mortar
shells early this morning on the Muslim-controlled part of divided
Mostar in southern Bosnia but caused no casualties, the Tanjug
news agency said.
</P>
<P>
One shell damaged a house and two cars, one fell on the Muslim
neighborhood of Zavik and the third did not explode, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The Croat extremists fired the bombs only a few minutes after
Mostar Mayor Ivan Prskalo appealed over local Croat television to
both sides in the divided city to keep their extremists in check,
Tanjug quoted Muslim Radio Sarajevo as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian authorities imposed a curfew in Mostar last Monday
after one person was killed and 22 were wounded in the ethnic
violence in which Bosnian Croats fired shots towards Muslims who
were trying to visit a local cemetery in the Croat-controlled
western section.
</P>
<P>
However, the police station in the Croat part of Mostar said
the same day that infantry fire was opened from the Muslim side to
the Croat area.
</P>
<P>
Sources of the NATO-led Stabilization Force (SFOR) in Mostar
have confirmed that two explosions occurred in a northern Croat
neighborhood of Mostar, caused by cluster shells fired from the
Muslim side.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Muslim radio also said the SFOR and
international police were protecting today the homes of 10 Muslim
refugee families who returned Friday to the Croat-controlled
western part of Mostar, as Croat extremists have threatened them
with expulsion once again.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the meeting scheduled for today
between the head of the regional office for Mostar Martin Garrod,
Mayor Prskalo and his deputy Safet Orucevic was postponed due to
alleged requirement of the latter, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few weeks, there were escalating political
battles inside the Muslim-Croat federation and systematic
expulsions of Muslims from western Mostar, some of them
perpetrated by Croat police.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Muslims and Croats fought a war in 1993-94 until
agreeing to form the federation under heavy U.S. pressure.
Hardline nationalists, mainly Croats in western Mostar, have
blocked efforts to reunify Mostar.

<HEADLINE> Assailants in Egypt's Church Raid Identified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The six gunmen involved in
Wednesday's attack on a Coptic church in southern Egypt have been
identified, security sources here said today.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian MENA news agency quoted the sources as saying
that the six gunmen, all in their 20s, are unemployed and from
Abu Qorqas, southern Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen opened fire indiscriminately on Wednesday night at
the Mary Girgis Church in Abu Kurkas District, Minya, 240
kilometers south of the Egyptian capital of Cairo. Nine Copts were
killed and six others injured.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry has urged all citizens having information
on the whereabouts of the gunmen to contact security authorities.
</P>
<P>
Sami Abdul-Gawad, assistant interior minister and director of
Minya Security Department, told the Egyptian T.V. today that
security conditions in Minya are stable.
</P>
<P>
He described Wednesday's attack on the church as an individual
incident that has nothing to do with the Muslim-Christian
co-existence in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The police that have been under an intensive manhunt for
perpetrators, suspect a link between the church incident and
another crime in which three Copts were killed, according to a
security source.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the three victims were found Friday in one of
the sugar cane plantations in Abu-Hereir village, 70 kilometers
from the church.
</P>
<P>
The police have imposed a siege on the inlets of Minya and
tightened securities on nearby provinces.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights today
condemned the attack as a heinous crime which is aimed at sowing
seeds of disunity among the Copts and Muslims in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Muslim extremists have from time to time targeted Coptic
Christians on grounds they are heretics.
</P>
<P>
The attack has been among the worst ones on Christians since
1992 when Muslim extremists killed 12 Christian villagers in
Assiut, about 320 kilometers south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The militants have waged a violent campaign to establish a
strict Islamic state since 1992. Over 1,050 people have been
killed in the clashes, most of whom are civilians and police in
the south.
</P>
<P>
In a predominantly Muslim country, Copts make up about 10
percent of Egypt's 60 million population.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Rejects Dialog With Extremists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Information Minister
Safwat al-Sherif said today Egypt will reject dialog with
extremist groups and dismissed the possibility of setting up a
political party on a religious basis.
</P>
<P>
This has been the Egyptian government stand since 1994, Sherif
said when commenting on Wednesday's gunmen attack on a Coptic
church in southern Egypt.
</P>
<P>
"There is no room for dialog with criminals. Egypt's nature and
national unity do not allow establishing parties on a religious
basis," he was quoted by the Egyptian MENA news agency.
</P>
<P>
Allowing an Islamic party means that Christian parties and
parties of other religions may also be granted the green light,
he said.
</P>
<P>
However, those willing to work in politics should set up a
political party, he added.
</P>
<P>
While dismissing that violent attacks are on the rise, he noted
that terrorism has been put under control in Egypt due to
intensive efforts by the security departments since violence
peaked in 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
"The attack does not mean a revival of the Islamic terrorist
acts... Instead, it serves as an indication that terrorist groups
are on the fall," the minister asserted.
</P>
<P>
Sherif said that Egyptian Muslims and Christians reject such
acts of violence and the church raid was carried out by fugitives.
</P>
<P>
Nine Copts were killed and six others injured when gunmen
opened fire indiscriminately on Wednesday night at the Mary Girgis
Church in Abu Kurkas district, Minya, 240 kilometers south of
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The six gunmen involved in Wednesday's attacks, all in their
20s, are unemployed and from southern Egypt, said security sources.

<HEADLINE> 50 More Zairean Soldiers Arrive in Western </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Fifty more Zairean
soldiers arrived in Kigoma town, western Tanzania, on Friday
evening, totalling the number of Zairean government troops
fleeing from the eastern Zaire to 211.
</P>
<P>
Acting Kigoma Regional Commissioner, Alhaji Lugusha, told the
official Daily News in a telephone interview today from the town
of Kigoma that the 50 combatants were not heavily armed like the
161 soldiers who arrived on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean troops loyal to ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko
are reportedly running away from heavy fighting against rebels in
eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Lugusha described the 50 soldiers as weary, crestfallen and in
tattered uniforms, a reflection of how ill-equipped the
government troops are compared to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Security forces in Kigoma were on the alert, very cautious and
prepared to contain any insecurity incidents which might be
caused by the refugee soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the acting regional commissioner commended the
United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), the World
Vision, Red Cross and other relief organizations for their timely
move in providing food to the refugee soldiers.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Club in Nigeria Inaugurated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) today made a new move towards
socio-economic integration of the sub-region by inaugurating a
non-governmental body to enhance the effort.
</P>
<P>
The new body, ECOWAS Club in Nigeria, the first of its kind in
all its 16 member states, was aimed at promoting community
consciousness among ECOWAS citizens.
</P>
<P>
"We will therefore promote economic integration, technological
diffusion, information and cultural exchange and social
development within the sub-region," said Tony Ani, president of
the ECOWAS Club in Nigeria, at the inauguration ceremony held
here today.
</P>
<P>
The body will act as an intermediary between officials and
diplomats of ECOWAS and the citizens of the sub-region, he said.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS, founded in 1975, was aimed at promoting the
development of the 16 member states through cooperation, with
particular emphasis on market integration.
</P>
<P>
Despite the great progress that has been made in the
sub-regional integration process during the past 22 years, many
people at the grassroots are still ignorant about the
organization or the treaties among member states to facilitate
free movement of goods and persons.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats attending today's ceremony said the agreement on
visa exemption has been signed for many years, but many people in
one member state intending to travel to other member states have
kept going to relevant embassies applying for visa.
</P>
<P>
Besides, 11 of the member states are French-speaking countries
while the remaining five are English-speaking nations, leaving a
language barrier that needs to be overcome.
</P>
<P>
It was among the calls made by diplomats at the ceremony that
French should be spoken in the English-speaking member states.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, the current chairman of ECOWAS, has decided to take a
lead in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The country's head of state General Sani Abacha on Friday
reiterated that the desire to reinforce the learning of the
French language in primary and secondary schools in Nigeria is a
conscious effort to enhance socio-economic integration in the
West African sub-region.

<HEADLINE> 5 Arrested for Circulating Counterfeit in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Greek police today arrested
four Ukrainians and a Moldavian for passing counterfeit 10,000
drachma (about 40 U.S. dollar) notes on the market.
</P>
<P>
Oleg Andriasko, 27, was arrested trying to shop with one of the
notes in an Athens supermarket. The shopkeeper realized the note
was counterfeit and called police, who arrested Andriasko after
finding another 10 counterfeit notes in his possession.

After a search of his home, where he lived with Luba Anoupreia,
37, Igor and Maria Fostich, both 32, and Eugeni Savraduze, 36, all
illegal immigrants, police arrested all the five after another 71
counterfeit notes were found there.
</P>

a total sum of 30 U.S. dollars, from a Bulgarian named Anton a
week ago in downtown Athens.
