<HEADLINE> HK Customs Awarded for Striking Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Customs officers of Hong Kong
have succeeded in containing the piracy trade by reducing its
availability and penetration in the market in less than a year's
time, Commissioner of Customs and Excise John Tsang Chun-wah said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tsang was speaking at a ceremony in which he received an
appreciation plaque from the International Federation of the
Phonographic Industry (IFPI) in recognition of the achievements in
tackling piracy by his department.
</P>
<P>
"These achievements are attributable to the whole-hearted
devotion of our officers in the Intellectual Property
Investigation Bureau and the Special Task Force," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
At the presentation ceremony, Tsang announced that the
deployment of the Special Task Force set up in June 1999 would be
extended to another six months starting from Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He also gave assurance to the IFPI that the Hong Kong customs
would continue to do its best to fight against copyright piracy.
</P>
<P>
"We have spent 150 million HKD (19.2 million USD) to support our
enforcement action in suppressing copyright piracy here in Hong
Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there were last year over 1,000 outlets selling
pirated CDs in Hong Kong carrying them five million CDs in the
retail market at any one time - about a quarter of these CDs
falling in the music category.
</P>
<P>
"A snapshot today would reveal a market of fewer than 100 retail
outlets with less than 100,000 pirated CDs in circulation,
depicting a significant reduction of 98 per cent in terms of
availability," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tsang stressed that Hong Kong was wholly committed to protecting
the rights of the copyright owners.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the ceremony, IFPI Chairman Jason Berman paid
tribute to Tsang for his outstanding leadership in the fight
against music piracy.
</P>
<P>
"The record industry not only recognizes the achievement of the
Department, but also Mr. Tsang's dedication and determination to
solve the problem of music piracy in Hong Kong," Berman said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that although the fight against copyright piracy was
still far from over, it was no small achievement on the part of
the Hong Kong customs that the market was now in a much better
form.
</P>
<P>
"We in particularly are impressed by the department's two
pronged enforcement strategy, clamping down on both the supply
side and the retail end at the same time," Berman said.
</P>
<P>
Berman said, as a result of customs enforcement actions, the
sales figures of music products had increased significantly since
last year and the industry was able to register growth for the
last three quarters.
</P>
<P>
He said the growth in the sales was most encouraging to the
record industry, in particularly to local artists whose products
were heavily pirated.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Probe Illegal Exploitation of Minerals in DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Friday decided to set up a panel of independent experts to examine
how the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is financed
by illegal trading in minerals.
</P>
<P>
A presidential statement, issued at the end of a closed-door
meeting of the 15-nation Council which sent a delegation of seven
ambassadors to the region last month, asked U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan to appoint five experts for an initial period of six
months.
</P>
<P>
The panel, to be based in Nairobi which is the headquarters of
the U.N. operations in Africa, was asked to make a preliminary
report after three months. The move was intended to assess the
situation in a country where it has already authorized the
peacekeeping force of 5,500 troops and military observers.
</P>
<P>
The decision to look into illegal trade in mineral resources in
DRC is modeled upon the council's investigation of breaches of U.N.
sanctions against the rebel National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The DRC panel will "follow up on reports and collect
information on all activities of illegal exploitation of natural
resources and other forms of wealth," the statement said, adding
that it would "research and analyze the links between the
exploitation of natural resources and other forms of wealth in DRC
and the continuation of the conflict."
</P>
<P>
DRC, the former Zaire, is rich in copper, zinc, manganese, tin
and gold.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Reactivates Foreign Investment Inflow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, June 2 (Xinhua) --  Colombian government announced
Friday a new regulation that eliminates red tape and eases
official control of foreign capital, to reactivate foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in Colombia last year reached 4.020 billion
dollars, falling by 39 percent drop, according to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
The reform, approved by the Economic and Social Policy National
Council (CONPES), to be promulgated in a short term by the
presidency, puts on an equal foot national and international
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
In the future, the resources from abroad can arrive and start
operating immediately with the sole notification to the government
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The only restrictions are those related to the sectors of
defense, security, and handling of toxic wastes, for national
security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Colombian investments abroad were also liberated, although with
limitations in tax and rates of exchange matters. The Bank of the
Republic (the government emitting bank), will be in both cases the
highest controlling authority.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in Colombia, up to now and by region of
origin, is as follows: Central America, 38 percent; Europe, 28.2
percent; North America, 28.1 percent; South America, 4.4 percent,
and Asia, 1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The composition of foreign investment in the country is as
follows:
financial sector, 32 percent; manufacturing industry, 28.7
percent; mines and coal, 20.6 percent; electricity, gas and water,
19.9 percent; restaurants and hotels, 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 foreign investment drop is attributed to the Brazilian
economic crisis and to the escalation of violence in the country.

<HEADLINE> 500,000 Cuban Women Demand Elian's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mothers, grandmothers, working women and housewives shouted
slogan "down with the lies, return our Elian."
</P>
<P>
The protest is the reaction to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Atlanta's decision on the case of Elian.
</P>
<P>
The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta ruled that
Elian was not entitled to a political asylum hearing as his U.S.
relatives had sought. But the court did not let the boy return
immediately to Cuba as his father and other relatives in Cuba have
demanded.
</P>
<P>
The boy and his father currently are residing together in
Washington with some other relatives and friends, waiting for
permission from U.S. authorities to return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Elian was rescued at sea in November after his boat capsized,
killing his mother and 10 other illegal Cuban migrants.
</P>
<P>
Elian's father, a tourism worker from the provincial Cuban
town of Cardenas, has demanded his son's return from the start and
was reunited with the boy in Washington in April after a dramatic
raid on the Miami house of the boy's U.S. relatives.

<HEADLINE> Britain: Fiji May Face Commonwealth Suspension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain said Friday that Fiji might
be suspended from the Commonwealth if its new rulers do not return
the country to democratic constitutional government.
</P>
<P>
John Battle, a Foreign Office minister of state, said
suspension was a real option when Commonwealth foreign ministers
meet in London next week to discuss the crisis in Fiji.
</P>
<P>
But he said it was too early yet to make a decision.
</P>
<P>
Battle made the remarks after George Speight, the leader of the
coup in Fiji, told the BBC in an interview that he would free the
hostages over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever way Fiji comes through this, then if it turns its
back on democracy, then there are a range of options," Battle told
BBC radio's Today program.
</P>
<P>
When asked if suspension from the Commonwealth was one of the
options, Battle said it "really is a serious option if Fijians
were to find themselves in this position."
</P>
<P>
"But what we have to do is not make judgments now, because it's
still unclear," the minister of state said.
</P>
<P>
"We want to see respect for the democratic process, democratic
rights," Battle said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Fiji was suspended from the Commonwealth, which
mainly groups Britain and its former colonies, in 1987 after a
coup and was only allowed back in 1997.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Independent
Electoral Commission (IEC) announced on Friday it has set November
1 as the provisional date for local government elections across
the country.
</P>
<P>
However, this date still has to be ratified by the South
African National Assembly and the government.
</P>
<P>
Outlining some of the challenges facing the IEC ahead of the
poll, the IEC's chief executive Mandla Mchunu said the current
disputes on the demarcation of municipal boundaries need to be
resolved urgently so that the IEC has enough time to finalize
electoral wards.
</P>
<P>
The Municipal Demarcation Board is currently dealing with five
disputes, including the concerns of tribe chiefs in KwaZulu-Natal
Province that their powers may be reduced in the new local
government system.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Mchunu said the commission is working with all
stakeholders to ensure that "all were comfortable" with the
elections.
</P>
<P>
On the question of special votes and the right of prisoners to
vote, Director-General of the Provincial Affairs and Local
Government Department Zam Titus said the matter will be discussed
at a special meeting in Parliament next Monday.

MAPUTO, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan President Paul Kagame
visited Maputo for a few hours on Friday to hold talks with his
Mozambican counterpart Joaquim Chissano on the situation in Rwanda
and the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after their meeting, Chissano said Kagame
told him that his government had set up "a commission to revise
the country's constitution, work out strategies for
democratization, for decentralization of government powers and
ensure respect for human rights."
</P>
<P>
Chissano said that they discussed the situation in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and both of them claimed
there is progress in the implementation of the ceasefire agreement
signed in Lusaka last July.
</P>
<P>
Chissano said they agreed all foreign troops involved in the
conflict should leave the country to ensure the deployment of
United Nations peacekeeping forces in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the implementation of the Lusaka accord, Chissano
 expressed satisfaction with the fact that by and large it is
holding despite some small setbacks, blamed on the rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
Kagame was optimistic that the Congolese peace process would
succeed, " since many countries, including South Africa, the
United States and others are showing serious commitment, once they
found that the warring parties are themselves committed".

<HEADLINE> United Nations Calls off Visit by Senior Official to Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Friday called off a visit to Zimbabwe by a senior U.N.
official after the African nation said that it would seize 804
white-owned farms without compensation.
</P>
<P>
The Administrator of the U.N. Development Program (UNDP), Mark
Malloch Brown, had been due to visit Zimbabwe this weekend to
reactivate a two-year-old UNDP-sponsored land reform program in
the hope of ending the crisis over land ownership.
</P>
<P>
A statement, issued here by Annan's spokesman, said, "Earlier
today, the Government of Zimbabwe publicly gave notice of its
intention to compulsorily acquire 804 farms from the large-scale
commercial farming sector. The Secretary-General regrets this
development because it undermines the ability of UNDP to build
international support, including resources, for a legally-based
solution, including compensation based on the principles of the
1998 land reform conference."
</P>
<P>
"In light of this announcement, whose consequences we will
need carefully to review, the Secretary-General has decided to
postpone the visit to Zimbabwe" by Brown, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General remains convinced, however, the issue
of land acquisition, redistribution and resettlement will not be
resolved without good faith efforts by all parties to achieve a
mutually agreed way forward," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Achieving a just and equitable solution is critical for the
economic prosperity and stability of Zimbabwe and the region," the
statement said. "The Secretary-General, through UNDP, will
continue his efforts for a solution."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, the Zimbabwean Government published a list of
804 white-owned farms to be seized without compensation for
landless members of the black majority, reports said.
</P>
<P>
On May 18, Brown told a press conference that he hoped to
encourage international donors to provide funds for Zimbabwe to
compensate white farmers.
</P>
<P>
But he said, "Nobody's going to write a blank check," and
donors needed to be assured that Zimbabwe was committed to a "
transparent, fair and legally enforceable process."
</P>
<P>
The UNDP envisaged the transfer over five years of five
million hectares (12.3 million acres) of land to resettle 150,000
families.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP figures showed that 4,460 large-scale commercial
farms in Zimbabwe currently hold 11.2 million hectares (27.7
million acres) while more than six million people, mostly in
communal areas, occupy 16 .4 million hectares (40.5 million acres).
</P>
<P>
The land ownership dispute erupted in February when black
veterans occupied more than 1,000 white-owned large-scale farms
nationwide, which later led a clash, killing 3 people were killed
and injuring a dozen others.

<HEADLINE> China Demands Probe into Impact of NATO Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- China Friday demanded a
probe into "the possible severe violation" of the humanitarian law
by NATO in its bombing of Yugoslavia, saying that convinced
evidence is needed to support the allegation that there was no
basis for a U.N. investigation into the unilateral NATO air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xu, representative of the Chinese Mission to the United
Nations, told an open Security Council meeting that China fully
supports such an investigation by the International Criminal
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that the tribunal can implement the law in
objective and justice way, not to become a political tool," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the statement in response to the remarks by Carla
del Ponte, the tribunal's prosecutor, at the Security Council, who
said, "Although some mistakes were made by NATO, I am very
satisfied that there was no deliberate targeting of civilians or
unlawful military targets by NATO during the bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
However, Belgrade and Western lawyers have produced numerous
complaints and evidence supporting their observation that NATO
forces committed war crimes, including the strike against a bridge
as a passenger train was crossing it, the bombing of a refugee
convoy near Djakovica, and the targeting of the Serbian television
building in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal was set up under a Security Council resolution
seven years ago to prosecute those responsible for atrocities in
the Balkans following the disintegration of Yugoslavia in 1991.
</P>
<P>
According to the tribunal's stipulations, NATO military
activities in the Balkans are within its jurisdiction, he said.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Chip Market Sizzles in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide sales of
semiconductors reached an all time record high of 15.2 billion U.S.
dollars in April 2000, up 35.6 percent from a year ago, an
industry group said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Silicon Valley-based Semiconductor Industry Association (
SIA) said the strong growth in chip revenue is being fueled by
cell phone shipments, PC demand, consumer product sales and e-
commerce over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
PC units and consumer electronics sales remained strong during
the first four months of this year, SIA said. Flash memory and
digital signal processing (DSP), used for communications
applications, were especially hot in the market. Flash revenue
jumped 193 percent in the first fourth months of 2000 compared
with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Boston Consulting Group, business to business
e-commerce conducted over the Internet will increase from 92
billion U.S. dollars to nearly 2 trillion dollars by 2003. If this
trend proves correct, SIA said, demand and sales for silicon chips
will be strengthened and increased.
</P>
<P>
In the Asian-Pacific and Japan market, the industry grew at 46
percent and 41.1 percent, respectively from last year. The
Americas market was up 25.7 percent and Europe's sales grew 33.6
percent, according to SIA.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Request $440 million Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique will ask for 440 million
U.S. dollars of loan at next week's meeting in Paris of the World
Bank's Consultative Group, Finance Minister Luisa Diogo said here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
She said that the government would bring proposals not only for
urgent rebuilding of infrastructures destroyed by the flood in
February and March, and also for poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
The Consultative Group brings together the main donors and
funding agencies, and it is at this forum that the government
presents its funding needs for the year.
</P>
<P>
Diogo said that the new money to be requested at this year's
meeting is in addition to the 453 million dollars pledged for
reconstruction at the donors' conference held in Rome in early
May.
</P>
<P>
The government document for the Paris meeting envisages
external funding of well over 500 million dollars every year for
the next decade.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government hoped to keep annual debt servicing
down to " no more than 25 million dollars a year", she said.
</P>
<P>
This year the debt servicing is just 23 million dollars instead
of around 70 million dollars as a result of the various debt
cancellations and moratorium declared by creditors in response to
the floods.
</P>
<P>
Diogo said that if all goes well and Mozambique qualifies in
March 2001 for the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
Initiative of debt relief, then next year's debt servicing will be
lower than 23 million dollars.

BEIRUT, June 2 (Xinhua) -- U.N. special envoy Roed Larsen held
talks with Lebanese President Emile Lahoud and Prime Minister Salim
Hoss Friday afternoon on the Israeli-Lebanese border issue.
</P>
<P>
Expert teams from the U.N. and Lebanon were making a field
survey in south Lebanon Friday afternoon and the work will last
longer than previously envisaged.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has complained to the U.N. that Israel still occupies 16
areas along the borderline that belong to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Lebanon claims its ownership to the 250-square-
kilometer Shebaa Farms located on the west side of Mount Hermon,
which is under Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Local radios predicted that Larsen will submit his report to the
Security Council at the weekend on the border survey and the effect
of United Nations' peacekeeping force in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In the recent two weeks, Larsen has been holding shuttle talks
among Israel, Beirut and Syria on verifying Israel's withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has rejected repeatedly its military presence in south
Lebanon since the Israeli pullout on May 24 from south Lebanon,
where the resistance group Hezbollah and Amal movement are in
control of the former occupied zone.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain's anti-terrorist police
hunting bombers who detonated a device on a bridge in west London
were trying to trace two taxi drivers who left their passengers
near the site.
</P>
<P>
Officers said two passengers were dropped off on the south side
of Hammersmith Bridge where the bomb was planted.
</P>
<P>
No-one has claimed responsibility for Thursday's explosion but
there were fears dissident Irish republicans opposed to the
Northern Ireland peace process may be involved.
</P>
<P>
Police were questioning motorists and pedestrians at roadblocks
across west London in an effort to find witnesses.
</P>
<P>
The first cab was seen on the bridge at 02:45 a.m. (01:45 GMT).
It drove from north to south, where it was observed dropping off a
male passenger.
</P>
<P>
It is thought the car then turned around and drove back to the
north side of the Thames.
</P>
<P>
The second taxi was seen on the bridge at 03:40 a.m. (02:40 GMT)
. It drove over from the north side, and stopped briefly on the
south side to drop a passenger and then continued towards Barnes
on the south side.
</P>
<P>
The high-explosive device exploded at 04:30 a.m. (03:40 GMT),
damaging the bridge but not causing any injuries.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, London police sounded the all-clear after a bomb
scare triggered a major security alert in the capital and forced
them to seal off a large area of the City financial district.
</P>
<P>
Police had told people in banks and office buildings in the
Bishopsgate area to stay away from windows and said they might
have to conduct controlled explosions.
</P>
<P>
But by 3.45 p.m. (14:45 GMT) police were lifting road blocks.

<HEADLINE> 1,4000 Foreign Women Become Sex Slaves in UK Each Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Up to 1,400 foreign women were
tricked into sexual slavery in Britain each year, according to a
report commissioned by the Home Office.
</P>
<P>
Organized gangs were forcing women, increasingly drawn from
Eastern Europe, into prostitution because it was a lucrative and
low-risk activity, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Vice detectives in London said the women suffer threats and
intimidation which makes the situation increasingly difficult to
police.
</P>
<P>
But researchers said most police forces adopt a "hands off"
approach to prostitution and will usually only act after
complaints from the public, the BBC reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Liz Kelly and Dr. Linda Regan of the University of North
London's Child and Women Abuse Studies Centre, said the increase
in the numbers of women trafficked around the world was a "major
concern".
</P>
<P>
Their study - the first of its kind to assess the extent of the
problem - highlights the difficulty of accurately saying how many
women are brought into Britain for prostitution.
</P>
<P>
But following interviews with experts, a survey of police
forces and official figures they estimated that between 140 and 1,
400 women were used as sex slaves each year in the UK.

<HEADLINE> New International Tender for OA Stake to be Called Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- An international tender will be
called next week for the buyout of a Greek Olympic Airways (OA)
share package following British Airways's failure to table a bid
for up to a 20 percent stake in the Greek national carrier.
</P>
<P>
Announcing this after the collapse of the negotiations between
Greece's Economy and Finance Minister Yiannos Papantoniou,
Transport and Communications Minister Christos Verelis and the new
British Airways (BA) management in Athens late Friday, Papantoniou
said that the winner of the tender would also take on OA's
management.
</P>
<P>
Late last year, the Greek government signed with BA's
subsidiary Speedwing a contract, which allows the latter to have
the right to manage the ailing Greek national carrier for 30
months in order to shape up its finances and operations.
</P>
<P>
The contract, which expires at the end of next year, gave BA
the option of bidding for up to 20 percent stake in OA.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Verelis will meet with OA's British managing
director Rod Lynch in order to end the cooperation and finalize
the timetable for the withdrawal of Speedwing from OA's management.
</P>
<P>
Verelis said that interests had already been expressed by
foreign banks and Greek investors, but the basic goal was to place
OA in an international partnership in order to survive in the
international competition.

<HEADLINE> Some White People Ready to Leave Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 2 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of white
Zimbabweans are ready to go abroad by clearing their vehicles as
they anticipate an escalation in political violence ahead of the
parliamentary elections scheduled for June 24-25.
</P>
<P>
Harare provincial police spokeswoman Tendai Nembire told the
Zimbabwe News Agency Friday that there had been a sharp increase
in the number of white people clearing their vehicles.
</P>
<P>
In May alone, a total of 3,001 vehicles from the white
community were cleared compared with 540 during the same period
last year, she said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the whites who cleared their vehicles said that they
were going for holidays and would come back after elections as
they feared political violence.
</P>
<P>
Travel agencies told the national news agency that most of the
whites intended to leave for South Africa at least a week before
the elections. Some will fly to Australia, Britain and New Zealand
among the countries they consider safe.
</P>
<P>
"I think they are being influenced from some quarter as I
cannot see the reason why they are fleeing in such large numbers.
There are no problems from black foreigners as they are not
panicking," she added.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has been gripped by a wave of political violence
related to farm invasion and the coming elections, in which at
least 20 people, including five white farmers and opposition party
candidates and supporters, were killed.

<HEADLINE> African Countries Urged to Honor Pledges to JMC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Friday called upon African
countries to honor their pledges to the Joint Military Commission
(JMC) to enable full operation and facilitation of the commission
in charge of monitoring ceasefire in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
"Logistical and financial problems have paralyzed your (JMC)
work, but we hope that most of these problems will be solved and
appeal for your patience," Presidential Affairs Minister Eric
Silwamba said at the opening of the seventh JMC plenary session in
Zambian capital Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
The minister thanked the countries and organizations for
providing financial and logistic support to the JMC comprising all
warring parties to the DRC conflict, which erupted in August 1998
with the DRC President Laurent Kabila's government backed by
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia on the one side and the rebels
supported by Uganda and Rwanda on the other.
</P>
<P>
Silwamba noted that all the warring parties had complied with
the new ceasefire agreement reached in the Ugandan capital Kampala
in April this year.
</P>
<P>
He said the fact that the ceasefire agreement has been holding
was evidence of the seriousness of both sides of the conflict, who
have been accusing each other of violating the ceasefire agreement
signed in Lusaka last year.

<HEADLINE> U.S Jobless Rate Rises to 4.1 Percent in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. unemployment rate increased
by 0.2 percentage points to 4.1 percent in May as American
businesses lost 116,000 jobs, the worst showing in nearly nine
years, the Labor Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The employment report showed that overall payrolls rose by 231,
000 in May, but all the strength came in government hiring of
temporary workers to conduct the census. There was a gain of 357,
000 census workers.
</P>
<P>
However, American businesses cut 116,000 jobs during the month.
It was the first time that U.S. companies had suffered a job loss
for any month since a severe winter storm disrupted the economy in
January 1996.
</P>
<P>
It was the biggest loss since a decline of 129,000 private
sector jobs in November 1991 as the country was pulling out of the
last recession.
</P>
<P>
Average hourly earnings rose just 0.1 percent in May, a sharp
slowdown after a 0.4 percent increase in April.
</P>
<P>
In another report, the Commerce Department said that new orders
to American factories fell by 4.3 percent in April, the biggest
decline since November 1990, when the country was mired in the
last recession.
</P>
<P>
The decline, which followed a 2.7 percent rise in March orders,
reflected falling orders in a number of industries from steel
plants to auto and aircraft factories.
</P>
<P>
Orders for durable goods, items expected to last three or more
years, fell 6.5 percent, the biggest setback since December 1991.
Orders for nondurable products fell 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts saw the new reports as further indication that the
economy is finally slowing under the impact of the Federal Reserve
's interest rate campaign. The central bank has boosted rates six
times over the past year in an effort to slow growth and keep
inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
The economic reports released in the past week indicating that
the economy has finally begun to slow were likely to relieve
pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates further
during its regular meeting later this month.

<HEADLINE> UK Rail Travel at Record, But Profits Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 2 (Xinhua) - More people in Britain traveled by
train last year than at any time since 1946. Passengers made 947
million rail journeys, covering 24 billion miles, official figures
show.
</P>
<P>
According to Railtrack, the company that owns the UK's railway,
train punctuality increased slightly, but the percentage of train
services that failed to run more than doubled, from 0.8 percent of
trains to 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The company announced annual profits down by 16 percent, to 360
million pounds, adding that the fall was caused by extra
investment in infrastructure, prompted by demand.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said Railtrack's profits fall was largely a
result of its decision to take a special 61 million pounds charge
for its continuing track maintenance bills.
</P>
<P>
Gerald Corbett, Railtrack's chief executive, said his company
needs an extra 750 million pounds a year from Britain's train
companies if the Government's plans for rail rejuvenation are to
go ahead.
</P>
<P>
However, Railtrack will be forced to cut its investment at the
time of the next general election unless profits recover, he added.

<HEADLINE> UK Shop Prices Fall 1.1 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 2 (Xinhua) - Shop prices in Britain have fallen in
May for the thirteenth consecutive month to stand at 1.1 percent
lower than a year earlier, which is good news for consumers but
bad for retailers.
</P>
<P>
The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said Friday that food
prices fell slightly faster than non-food goods due to lower
prices of produce, particularly the price of tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
Mark Bradshaw, the BRC acting director general, said: "Whilst
deflation in the high street is great news for customers,
retailers are seeing margins squeezed at the same time as pressure
is applied to their operating costs."
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe the figures can be taken as evidence
that the Bank of England's monetary policy committee does not need
to raise interest rates to combat inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Bank left its main lending rate on hold at 6 percent last
month for the third successive month, which is regarded as an
evidence that UK interest rates are approaching the peak of the
current cycle.
</P>
<P>
In April, the committee raised interest rates by 0.25 percent
to 6 percent, amidst fears that rising house prices and growing
consumer confidence could signal inflation.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Trade Deficit Widens in First 4 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's trade deficit widened
to 746 million U.S. dollars in the first four months of this year,
a 82 percent increase over the same period a year earlier, the
Central Bank said Friday.
</P>
<P>
It said in a statement the ever-increasing deficit was due to a
sharp surge in imports which were up 36.1 percent at 2.285 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Exports grew by 21.2 percent in the January-April 2000 period
to 1.539 billion dollars from 1.269 billion dollars in the same
period of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The bank said agricultural exports increased by 10.7 percent to
302.5 million dollars from 273.2 million dollars in the first four
months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Industrial exports, especially food and beverage and petroleum
products, were up 23.6 percent at 1.186 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The rise in imports was reflected mainly in two of the three
main categories -- consumer goods, intermediate goods and
investment goods, which rose by 5.4 percent, 40.8 percent and 46.8
percent, respectively.

percent in March 1998. The ratio had peaked to 41 percent in 1992.

improved from the third largest debtor after Brazil and Mexico in
1991 to ninth in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Out of the total external debt, 94.34 billion dollars
constituted long-term debt while short-term debt constituted only

JOHANNESBURG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Health care workers in South
Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Lesotho and Swaziland will soon be
hooked up to an internet information network linking them with
HIV/AIDS specialists throughout the world, South African Press
Association reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-based International Association of Physicians in AIDS
Care (IAPAC) will link hospitals and clinics in the five countries
with 10,000 physicians in 52 countries through the internet
medical exchange.
</P>
<P>
Information available on the network will include issues
related to the care of HIV/AIDS sufferers who can not afford
expensive drugs.
</P>
<P>
"We will not be focusing only on the use of anti-retroviral
drugs. We recognize that given the economic situations in the
region access to those drugs is not universal," IAPAC Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Jose Zuniga said in a telephone interview
from Geneva.
</P>
<P>
"We will be looking at such basic things as monitoring,
palliative care and life issues that are relevant to the southern
African experience. That is a goal of this program," Zuniga said.

BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Mayor Liu Qi said here
today that construction projects in the capital have to be blend
with the ancient buildings and architecture in the city.
</P>
<P>
He said that any construction project that does not meet with
preservation requirements will not be given the green light. If
construction goes ahead, advanced technologies should be used to
protect historical relics.
</P>
<P>
Li made these remarks at the Urban Development Meeting of
Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The capital city of several dynasties, Beijing is one of the
architectural wonders of the world, said Liu, adding that people
should not ignore the preservation of cultural relics as the city
continues to develop rapidly. Preserving ancient relics and sites
in the city is important now and for future generations to come.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the people have to adopt new ways of protecting
the historical city. Preservation is not a burden on the economic
development of the city, but rather provides invaluable economic,
social and cultural resources.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the priority sites for of preservation include
the Forbidden City, the layout of the city and its waterways.
</P>
<P>
He noted that less than one-third of the 222 ancient buildings
earmarked for urgent protection will become museums and memorials.
Those occupying historical buildings will be asked to move out and
find other premises so that restoration work can begin on these
buildings.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Commission Adopts Protocol on Baku-Ceyhan Pipeline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 2 (Xinhua -- The Foreign Affairs Commission of the
Turkish parliament adopted on Friday a protocol for a change in the
Baku-Ceyhan Oil Pipeline Agreement between Turkey, Azerbaijan and
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Cumhur Ersumer and
representatives of Turkey's Pipeline Oil Transportation Inc.
(Botas) briefed the commission on the pipeline during a debate at
the panel session.
</P>
<P>
The parliament's Industry Commission already approved the
protocol to amend part of the pipeline agreement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Following the approval by the parliament's two committees, the
issue will be taken up for discussion in the full parliament.
</P>
<P>
Ersumer said during the Industry Commission debate that all
costs of the part of the pipeline in Turkish territories, estimated
at 1.3 billion U.S. dollars, will be met by the investor
consortium.
</P>
<P>
The minister disclosed that Turkey had extended a fixed-price
guarantee to the investor consortium for the field allocation.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on transport of Caspian basin oil to world markets
was signed among the three countries under the promotion of United
States President Bill Clinton, on the sideline of Organization of
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) summit at Istanbul last
November.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said the 1,740-kilometer pipeline, starting from
Azeri Caspian port Baku to Turkish southern port city Ceyhan via
Georgian capital Tbilisi, is of political and strategic importance
rather than a lucrative investment.
</P>
<P>
They considered it a vital move of the U.S.-led western powers
to curb Russian and Iranian expansion of their influence in the
newly-independent Central Asia and Caucasus regions.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Undertake Rehabilitation in Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
ordered Friday concerned government agencies to immediately
undertake the rehabilitation of areas affected by the conflict in
Mindanao as the Moro rebels took another steps towards peace.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Orlando Mercado of the Department of National Defense
said Friday night that the president approved his recommendation
to set up "zones of peace" in 20 towns and one city in the
affected areas to intensify recovery and rehabilitation efforts.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a cabinet meeting in the Presidential Palace,
Mercado told reporters that some 50,691 families or 288,510
persons have been displaced because of the conflict erupted in
April between government troops and Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) rebels.
</P>
<P>
He said the death toll of the conflict includes 160 soldiers
and 66 civilians, while the number of injured includes 650
soldiers and 185 civilians.
</P>
<P>
Mercado and Chief of Staff Angelo Reyes visited Mindanao Friday
morning to praise the soldiers for their heroism and assure Muslim
communities that the government will take care of them.
</P>
<P>
Continuing skirmishes between government soldiers and MILF
guerrillas are still noted in Mindanao despite the signing of a
joint statement by government-MILF peace brokers on Thursday of
their commitment to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Reports said government forces occupied Friday the main
entrance to Camp Abubakar, the MILF' biggest camp in Mindanao.
Government troops have destroyed scores of MILF camps since April.
</P>
<P>
The 15,000-strong MILF has been fighting for more than two
decades to establish an independent Muslim state in Mindanao,
which was flatly rejected by the Philippine government.

<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The All-China Federation of Taiwan
Compatriots issued an open letter to compatriots in Taiwan today.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that people from all walks of life in Taiwan
and Taiwan compatriots on the mainland are keeping a close eye on
the Taiwan Straits issue. Since Taiwan has a new leader, everyone
is hoping that relations between both sides of the straits will
turn around for the better.
</P>
<P>
However, the letter pointed out that the policy statement that
the new leader of Taiwan made and the comments that some new
members made in public have made compatriots disappointed and
anxious. Taiwan compatriots on the mainland share the same deep
worries as the people of Taiwan about the safety of their home and
lives.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that peaceful reunification of the motherland
cannot be postponed indefinitely. The Chinese people, including
23 million Taiwan compatriots, will not agree on the separation of
Taiwan from the motherland again.
</P>
<P>
The letter called for compatriots in Taiwan to stand up and
stop the activities of a handful of separatists. It also called
for Chinese all over the world to urge the new Taiwan authorities
to embrace peaceful reunification as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Asian Firms Urged to Act up to Corporate Governance (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Companies both in private and
public sectors in Asian countries were urged to take immediate
actions to carry out the corporate governance principles adopted
by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (
OECD).
</P>
<P>
The appeal came from the OECD officials who participated in the
three-day Asian Roundtable which was held in Hong Kong from May 31
to June 2.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 representatives from stock exchanges and international

financial institutions, regulators, public sector officials and
academics around the world attended the roundtable, which showed a
remarkable agreement on the principles of corporate governance
adopted by the OECD in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
This was the second Asian Roundtable aiming to improve the
understanding of corporate governance and assist in developing
public policy responses in an effort to enhance investment, the
development of robust capital markets and the welfare of Asian
societies.
</P>
<P>
Participants drew up a broad set of recommendations on aspects
of governance ranging from disclosure to shareholder rights, the
equitable treatment of minority shareholders, boards of directors
and the role of shareholders in governance.
</P>
<P>
The OECD's Deputy Secretary-General Seiichi Kondo said in his
opening address that in an international context, good corporate
governance is seen as one building block in the construction of a
new international financial architecture aiming to diminish the
risk of future financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Participants believed that a transparent and effectively
monitored market environment for international equity flows
enhances the stability of these flows and serves as an early
warning system for corporate and financial distress.
</P>
<P>
However, good corporate governance will only produce its full
results in terms of economic and social welfare if other
structural reforms are undertaken, and effective competition
policy is a key element of improving corporate governance, they
noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
Rafael Hui, Acting Financial Secretary of Hong Kong, said also
in an opening address that disclosure is the most basic of
corporate governance principles.
</P>
<P>
This is because potential investors and shareholders must be
given sufficient information to make informed decisions about
their shareholdings and safeguard their interest in any given
company, Hui explained.
</P>
<P>
Kondo believed that corporate governance is a concern for those
who want to make sure that corporations have access to capital
they need for viable investment. That is why policy-makers,
regulators and the business community care about the quality of
corporate governance in their respective countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
In his interview with Xinhua, Kondo said that state-owned
enterprises like those in China also have to have appropriate
corporate governance in order to get access to low-cost capital
internationally.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the successful reforms of SOE, Kondo said that it is
quite important to build up a sound social security system, since
the globalization forces these enterprises into severe competition
and the society and the government have to take care of the losers
and encourage them to go back in the competition.
</P>
<P>
Michael Klein, director of the World Bank's private sector
advisory services, told Xinhua separately that he has noticed the
Chinese government, in principle, is taking a number of steps to
move towards some new forms of financial arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Particularly, Klein said, China has encouraged some of its
state-owned enterprises to be listed on the stock exchanges, and
in fact, it has at least introduced certain elements of exposure
to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
"The capital market is now starting to look and see if it
trusts these people, if they make profit, or if they give a fair
turn, so by listing on stock exchanges, listed companies can
expose themselves more to pressures to adopt good governance,"
Klein said.
</P>
<P>
Many of the participants shared the similar view on China's SOE
with Kondo and Klein, and were optimistic that the reform program
would be successful.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Most of China's major cities
reported improved quality of air this week owing to widespread
rainfall throughout northern China and slashed production of coal
for heating, the China Environmental Monitoring Center said today.
</P>
<P>
From May 26 to June 2, Lanzhou, a capital city in northwest
China, reported unhealthy air, while Yinchuan, Hohhot,

mostly in northwest and north China, also reported slight air
pollution.
</P>
<P>
Twenty cities, including Tianjin, Xining, Beijing, Taiyuan,

<HEADLINE> Peres Wins Unanimous Backing for Presidential Candidacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Regional Cooperation
Minister Shimon Peres, a Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, was
unanimously confirmed on Friday as candidate for his Labor party to
run for president.
</P>
<P>
The nomination of the 76-year-old former prime minister was
finally approved by the party's central committee, which held an
extraordinary party congress for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
Peres had won the endorsement of the Labor party leadership late
Thursday and the support from the parliamentary caucus of One
Israel ruling coalition, in which Labor party acts as the backbone,
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The presidential election was put into parliamentary schedule
after the incumbent President Ezer Weizman was forced to announce
last Sunday that he will resign by July 11, three years before the
end of his second term.
</P>
<P>
The 76-year-old president was involved in a financial scandal
with a French Jewish businessman and escaped a relevant police
indictment just because the statute of limitations on the charges
had run out.
</P>
<P>
A new president will be elected on July 31 in a secret ballot in
the 120-seat Knesset (Parliament) and be inaugurated a day later,
or on August 1, to serve his seven-year term.
</P>
<P>
Peres, a world-known politician who is one of the major Middle
East peace builders along with late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, enjoys great popularity
both at home and abroad. He won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1994 because
of his contributions to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He seems to have a slight advantage over his major contender
Moshe Katsav, the candidate proposed by the opposition Likud party
on Monday, in several preliminary polls of the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
However, the race will be close when it runs into white-hot
stage and Peres should be wary not to take his victory for granted,
local analysts warned.

<HEADLINE> Barak Vows to Keep 80 Percent Jewish Settlements in Israel Hands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
said Friday that 80 percent of Jewish settlements on the West Bank
will be maintained under Israeli sovereignty under whatever peace
deal to be reached between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Barak told the a meeting of the Labor Party's Central Committee
in Tel Aviv that some breakthroughs are within view in the Israeli-
Palestinian negotiations. But no matter what will come out, 80
percent of the Jewish settlements will remain under Israeli
control.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators striving to reach a
framework agreement over final status issues had held two rounds
of "back-channel" talks in the Swedish capital of Stockholm without
achieving substantial progress.
</P>
<P>
Barak interrupted the talks on May 21 by calling back Public
Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami over violent demonstrations in the
Palestinian territories pressing for the release of Palestinian
prisoners held in Israeli jail.
</P>
<P>
The talks were resumed on Thursday at a secret location in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, Barak paid a flying visit to Lisbon for the
first meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton after the Israeli
withdrawal from South Lebanon. Clinton had intended to help secure
some breakthroughs in the Israeli-Palestinian track before the
Israeli pullback originally scheduled for July. However, an
unexpected collapse of the pro-Israeli South Lebanese Army led to
an early withdrawal of the Israel forces.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Clinton said he would send Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright to the Middle East on Monday to work with
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat "on narrowing the gap
that still remains between them".
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson is
scheduled to arrive in the Middle East on Sunday in an effort to
help overcome the snag in peace talks between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Stockholm newspaper Svenska Dagbladet said that Persson's
visit was arranged because of apparent progress in secret talks
between the Palestinian and Israeli representatives in Sweden over
the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
In another bid to boost the Mideast peace process, German
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer will travel to the region on
Saturday to hold separate talks with Barak and Arafat, said the
German foreign ministry on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, leaders of Jewish settlers have revealed that Barak
plans to hand over between 92 percent and 95 percent of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip to the Palestinian Authority under a permanent
settlement.
</P>
<P>
They also learned that there will be three categories of
settlements, including those to be dismantled, those that are to
remain but will be on land under Palestinian sovereignty but linked
to the state of Israel and those that will be annexed to Israel
along with areas that are to stay in Israeli hands.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Palestinian and Israeli negotiators have agreed that
the framework deal, which was due on May 13, will include Israeli
recognition of a Palestinian state and a Palestinian declaration
that the conflict between the two peoples has ended, according to
the Israeli paper Ha'aretz.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis and Palestinians are expected to strike a final
peace treaty before September 13 over the thorniest issues such as
the fate of Jerusalem, the future of the Jewish settlements, border
and water resources.
</P>
<P>
Both sides aim to reach a framework accord first, with mid-June
the latest target date, that would pave the way to the permanent
agreement.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Barak told his party colleagues on
Friday that although peace talks with Syria have not been
resumed, "the door is not closed."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian negotiations resumed at the end of last year
after a nearly four-year break but only were stranded again in
January over such differences as on the return of the Golan
Heights, a strategic plateau captured by Israel in 1967, and
security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Since then, there have been incessant international efforts to
bring the two sides back to the negotiating table.

BEIRUT, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss
announced Friday at his office that his government will increase
the number of security forces deployed in south Lebanon to 1,000,
local radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Hoss said in his declaration that Lebanon will deploy security
forces instead of the Lebanese army in south because "we now do not

want to serve as Israeli border guard in the liberated region".
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government quickly set up checkpoints on some main
roads to south after the large-scale Israeli withdrawal on May 24.
</P>
<P>
Hoss expressed hope that the Lebanese army will enter into south
in some appropriate circumstances, and said, "Nothing can impede us
doing
that."
</P>
<P>

necessity of putting the Lebanese army in south Lebanon after the
Israeli withdrawal, which is now under the control of the Hezbollah

<HEADLINE> Malaysians Asked to Preserve Peace, Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Yang di-Pertuan
Agong (King Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah Friday called upon
his countrymen to strive to preserve the country's peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
The King expressed his worriness that lately there had emerged
an unhealthy situation among Muslims in this country which could
jeopardize unity among them.
</P>
<P>
The culture of slandering each other would not only give rise
to confusion among Muslims but would also retard their progress
and resilience if left unchecked, the King said in his official
birthday address over Radio and TV Malaysia (RTM) Friday night.
</P>
<P>
He urged Muslims to play their respective roles to strengthen
brotherhood among them, saying conflicts among them would only
create a bad image for them among other races.
</P>
<P>
"As Muslims we should hold firmly to the holy teachings of
Islam which exhorted its followers to always remain united and
collaborative and refrain from making allegations or hurling
slander against each other," the King said.
</P>
<P>
He said "as the entire world Muslim community is facing even
tougher challenges arising from globalization, the borderless
world, the Internet and so on, we should not allow confusion among
Muslims to make things even worse."
</P>
<P>
Urging Islamic scholars to find ways of eliminating confusion
about Islam by providing accurate interpretations, the King said
only with a knowledgeable and united Islamic community which
practice close cooperation could Malaysia, an Islamic country,
become more progressive and respected.
</P>
<P>
Malaysians should be grateful for Malaysia to be always at
peace compared to other developing countries, he said, reminding
the citizens that the vision of a developed and wealthy country
could not be realized if the people practiced negative culture
such as rioting, loafing and breaching the law.
</P>
<P>
The King said the people should support and cooperate with the
government in its efforts to bring about even more rapid
development and progress.
</P>
<P>
He said the era of globalization and growth of information
technology in the new millennium required people to equip
themselves with various skills and IT-linked knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Asking the people to realize the potentials of information
technology and act quickly to become well-informed, more
competitive, efficient and productive, the King said "we should
remain vigilant and strive with even greater determination to
ensure that the country remained safe from external threats."
</P>
<P>
The King lauded the government led by Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad for what he said having succeeding not only in restoring
the country to the pre-financial crisis level but having enhancing
the good name of the country in the eyes of the world.

<HEADLINE> Manila Vows to Accelerate Dev't Projects in Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Friday that it will accelerate development projects in Mindanao in
line with President Joseph Estrada's commitment to develop the
region into the country's food basket and regional economic hub.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Benjamin Diokno of the Department of Budget and
Management said that the plan aims to intensify ongoing pro-poor
programs in areas unaffected by hostilities between government
troops and rebels.
</P>
<P>
"We have a stepped-up plan to accelerate the implementation of
pro-poor programs, especially in areas unaffected by conflict,"
Diokno said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
This would mean mostly the whole of Mindanao since the areas
affected by the conflict comprise only a small portion of the
region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Diokno pointed out that the intensified efforts would cover
agriculture, public works, economic planning, transportation and
communication, education, health, and agrarian reform.
</P>
<P>
He said that from the start of 2000, the national government
has released funds amounting to 2.5 billion pesos (62.5 million
dollars) for the region.
</P>
<P>
Diokno also maintained that the police and military operations
will not affect ongoing development projects in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Government troops and Moro Islamic Liberation Front rebels were
locked in fierce battles recently in Mindanao, resulting in heavy
losses on both sides.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Gov't Urges MILF to Accept Autonomy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government urged the
separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) Friday to accept
meaningful autonomy instead of independence as both sides work to
put a permanent end to the conflict in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said this would bring all
parties a step closer to forging a lasting and genuine peace in
southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the MILF would realize that independence is not option.
It is better for them to consider our offer of autonomy," Zamora
said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
He also tagged as premature reports that the government may
allow an extension of the peace process after June 30, the
deadline President Joseph Estrada set to wrap up the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"It is not proper to talk of an extension now, the talks are
still ongoing. I believe we can achieve good results," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said the government's proposed political package for the
MILF revolves on the expansion of ARMM (Autonomous Region in
Muslim Mindanao), depending on the results of a plebiscite later
this year.
</P>
<P>
This, he said, will allow increased participation for local
government units and regional governments in services devolved by
the national government.
</P>
<P>
Autonomy may also allow MILF fighters to be integrated into the
Armed Forces of the Philippines and Philippine National Police, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Government negotiators maintained Thursday night that the joint
communique they signed with the MILF remains the best deal they
can strike for now.
</P>
<P>
The government and MILF panels signed Thursday night a joint
communique where the MILF expressed openness to meaningful
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Technical working groups of both panels will meet June 7 to
take up the MILF's initial response to the government's proposal.
Both panels are scheduled to meet again on June 28.

<HEADLINE> Lead Poisoning Among Shanghai Children Reduced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The rate of children who suffer
lead poisoning in Shanghai has been reduced from 37.8 percent in
1997 to 24.8 percent, according to a research report released in
Shanghai recently.
</P>
<P>
The two-year study, conducted by a group of experts from the
Shanghai No. 2 Medical University, tested 1,972 children aged one
to six.
</P>
<P>
The results indicate that the average content of lead in these
children's blood has been reduced to 76 micrograms from 83
micrograms per liter in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Lead in children's bodies can affect their nervous, circulatory,
and digestive systems. The acceptable level of lead is 100
micrograms per liter.
</P>
<P>
Exhaust fumes from automobiles, preserved eggs, pencils, and
paint can all be sources of lead pollution.
</P>
<P>
Local experts attributed the downward trend in lead content in
Shanghai children's blood to the ban on the use of leaded gasoline
in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
They urged that greater efforts be made to do away with other
sources of lead pollution.

<HEADLINE> Experts Remind People of Indoor Air Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Environmental specialists from
Germany and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region said here
Friday that more attention should be paid to the indoor air
quality, whose potential risk is critical to people's health.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar entitled "To Improve Outdoor &AMP; Indoor Air Quality,
" participants stated that the outdoor air quality has been focus
for the environmental study, but in fact, the density of
pollutants in the air indoors is much higher that outdoors.
</P>
<P>
Professor Heinrich Holter, president of Holter Technologies
Holdings of Germany, said the occurrence of adverse health effects
indoors began to increase, as buildings became increasingly sealed
with insulation, and windows and brickwork became more airtight.
</P>
<P>
Holter noted that the reduction of air-change rate leads to a
greater concentration of harmful substances, which in non-airtight
buildings had previously been reduced by natural air changes.
</P>
<P>
"For health reasons," he said. "It is known that an air-change
rate of 1 to 1.5 is desirable, yet in houses that have been
insulated accordingly we only encounter rates of 1.15 to 0.1."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, contaminated indoor air is replaced at much too low
a rate, leading to an increase in the number of complaints
suffered by the occupants of such buildings," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In addition, room humidity levels have increased, leading,
above all, to a greater occurrence of moulds and mites as potent
allergen carriers, which best thrive at relative humidity levels
higher than 60 percent to 70 percent and temperatures greater than
23 degrees Celsius, he added.
</P>
<P>
Holter pointed out that indoor air pollutants are to a large
extent dependent upon the prevailing indoor atmospheric conditions,
in particular with regard to ventilation, and, for the most part,
upon the air supplied via air-conditioning systems.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Committed to Implementing Beijing Platform for Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The HKSAR Government published a
report here Friday on actions taken to implement the Beijing
Platform for Action. The report will be submitted as part of China
's report to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The report sets out Hong Kong's achievements in meeting the
strategic objectives under the 12 critical areas of concerns
contained in the Platform since 1995, said Robin Gill, deputy
secretary for health and welfare of HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Platform for Action was adopted in the Fourth World
Conference on Women held in September 1995. It identified priority
areas for action by Governments, international communities, non-
governmental organizations and private sectors, including
education and training of women, violence against women, women and
health, women and the economy etc.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations will hold a Special Session of the General
Assembly entitled "Women 2000: Gender Equality, Development and
Peace for the 21st Century" on June 5 to June 9 in New York to

<HEADLINE> Tonic Food Banned For Misleading Advertising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Health (MOH)
has punished tonic food manufacturers for falsely misleading the
public by claiming that thirteen kinds of tonic products had
therapeutic function.
</P>
<P>
MOH asked local departments responsible for food hygiene
supervision to suspend production and sales of the products and
fine the manufacturers in accordance with China's Food Hygiene Law,
MOH official Huang Jiansheng said today.
</P>
<P>
The products include calcium supplement, weight-reducing tea,
soya lecithin capsules, and nutritional drinks for men. Some of
these products are widely known throughout China through intensive
promotional advertising campaigns.
</P>
<P>
The calcium supplement, produced by Changjiang Biochemical
Technology Co. Ltd. in east China's Fuzhou City, was described in
TV commercials as "effective in enhancing six centimeters of a
person's height within one month." However, MOH never issued any
license to that purported to make one grow, according to a Health
News Report.
</P>
<P>
Tonic products are enjoying a vast growing market in China as
more Chinese are becoming health-conscious.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is now in charge of examining and approving health-
promotion foods. Ministry officials say that many manufacturers
start to exaggerate their products only after passing strict
examinations and obtaining a permit.
</P>
<P>
MOH issued a circular to local health authorities last November
requesting them not to mislead the public when selling their
products.

<HEADLINE> China Recovers Smuggled Fossil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Sciences (
CAS) announced today that the smuggled fossil of Archaeoraptor
liaoningensis has returned to China with the help of the United
States' National Geographic Society.
</P>
<P>
Coinciding with the Fifth International Meeting of the Society
of Avian Paleontology and Evolution and the Symposium on Jehol
Biota, the Dinosaur Museum of Blanding, Utah, reverted the fossil
which was excavated from a layer dating back to 120 million years
ago in northeast China's Liaoning Province and later smuggled out
of the country.
</P>
<P>
"We show sincere gratitude to the National Geographic Society
for its help for the fossil recovery," said Wang Yuanqing, vice
chief of the CAS Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and
Paleoanthropology (IVPP).
</P>
<P>
"China hopes that the international academic circles help all
smuggled fossils return to the country," said professor Wang.
</P>
<P>
In a story titled "Feathers for T. Rex?" in its November 1999
issue, National Geographic reported that Archaeoraptor
liaoningensis fossil shows "missing links in dinosaur evolution".
</P>
<P>
However, Wang and his colleague Xu Xing, a Ph.D. with the same
CAS institute, ascertained that the fossil is a composite of two
different fossilized creatures.
</P>
<P>
Their dispute has been accepted by the National Geographic
Society which publishes the magazine. Furthermore, the society
acknowledged the mistake publicly.
</P>
<P>
"Smugglers often manufacture fake fossils for economic gains,"
said Wang. "Fossil smuggling does great harm to scientific
research."
</P>
<P>
In recent years, most of influential museums and research
organizations stipulated strict policies, prohibiting illegal
trades on smuggled fossils.

<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- One of the 50 most beautiful people
of the century is now in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Neither a Hollywood superstar nor a famous footballer, Paul
Sereno was selected by "People" magazine in 1997 as one of the
top 50 beautiful people.
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old paleontology professor at University of Chicago
is attending the Fifth International Meeting of the Society of
Avian Paleontology and Evolution and the Symposium on Jehol Biota
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
As one of the most active dinosaur expert in the world, Sereno
gave a keynote speech at the ongoing high-profile meeting,
supporting the hypothesis that modern birds originated from the
extinct Mesozoic dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
"When the magazine sent an intelligent journalist to interview
me, I thought it was a good idea to let Americans know that
scientists were also human beings," said Sereno, who claims he
cares little about the honorary title granted by the magazine.
</P>
<P>
"People will always think that scientists are old and never
attractive," he said. "They are only men and women."
</P>
<P>
"It's good to show we are normal people, too," said the
scientist, who has never labeled himself a fashionable man.

<HEADLINE> Symposium on Curbing Juvenile Delinquency to Be Held in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A symposium on implementing a law
to curb juvenile delinquency is scheduled to be held in Beijing
next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature, will attend the
three-day symposium and deliver an important speech.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials from such ministries as public security and
education, and representatives from 14 provinces, municipalities
and autonomous regions are also expected to make speeches at the
symposium. Topics will include strengthening legal education
among primary and secondary school students and providing a more
healthier environment near schools.
</P>
<P>
The symposium is sponsored by the NPC Committee for Internal
and Judicial Affairs and the Central Committee of the Communist
Youth League of China.
</P>
<P>
China's top legislature approved the Law on Curbing Juvenile
Delinquency on June 28, 1999. The Law went into effect on
November 1st last year.
</P>
<P>
Wan Chaofen, vice-chairwoman of the NPC Committee for Internal
and Judicial Affairs, pointed out this morning at an new briefing
that curbing juvenile delinquency is a matter of great importance.
</P>
<P>
"It is crucial to the healthy growth of juveniles, to the
happiness of many families, and to the stability of society," she
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the rate of juvenile delinquency worldwide is on the
rise, and those teenagers violating laws or committing crimes tend
to be younger and even organize criminal gangs. China is no
exception.

<HEADLINE> Israelis, Palestinians Continue Final-Status Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators continued their final-status talks Friday at a secret
location in Israel to try to narrow the gaps between the two sides
for reaching a framework agreement on final-status issues.
</P>
<P>
Friday's talks have been divided into two groups to discuss
specific issues, Israel Radio quoted Israeli government source as
saying.
</P>
<P>
One group was attended by Israeli Public Security Minister
Shlomo Ben-Ami and Palestinian Legislative Council Speaker Ahmed
Qurei to discuss the issues of Jewish settlements, borders and
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
And chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and his Israeli
counterpart Oded Eran joined another group to discuss such issues
as security, water and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two sides had to reach a framework agreement in May, the
rescheduled date as the two sides failed to strike such a deal in
February under the Sharm el Sheikh memorandum signed last
September, but this had been delayed again due to differences on
all key issues needed to be solved in the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
The key issues include the fate of Jerusalem, settlements,
borders, Palestinian refugees, water and others. The two sides have
to reach a final peace deal on all those issues by September.
</P>
<P>
The two sides resumed the talks in Israel on Thursday at a
secret location.
</P>
<P>
Due to slow progress made in the talks, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat has urged U.S. President Bill Clinton to put more
pressure on Israel to force it to make compromise.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, meanwhile, blamed the
Palestinian side for foot-dragging in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is sending Secretary of State Madeleine Albright back to
the Middle East Next week to try to help narrow the gaps between
the two sides.

<HEADLINE> Thai Govt Okays Tourism Satellite Account Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has approved a
plan to develop the Tourism Satellite Account (TSA), which will
allow economic policy-makers to better understand the economic
contribution of tourism, the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT)
announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
TAT said in a report obtained by Xinhua that the plan will help
precisely identify both the direct and indirect contribution of
the tourism to the country's economy and systematically evaluate
its true economic advantage.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that the TSA will help us more efficiently
and effectively develop our future growth strategies," TAT
governor Pradech Phayakvichien was quoted by the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 26-million-baht (670,000 U.S. dollars) budget of the plan
will be spent on conducting extensive studies and surveys to
gather more comprehensive information and statistics about the
country's tourism, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The TSA, which is an intensive information-gathering system of
tourism initiated by the United Nations in 1993, has already been
facilitated by the World Tourism Organisation and is now being
implemented by many countries worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President to Visit Portugal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid will visit Portugal in September, a senior official
confirmed here Friday.
</P>
<P>
President Wahid has accepted Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio
's invitation for the visit, Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab said
after a meeting between the president and Portuguese Foreign
Affairs Minister Jaime Gama at the Merdeka palace.
</P>
<P>
If president Wahid realized his plan to visit Portugal, it
would be a new phase in Indonesian-Portuguese relations, Shihab
said.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Indonesia and Portugal had been strained
until last year after East Timor -- a former Portuguese colony --
voted for independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
East Timor integrated into Indonesia in 1976 following a
civilian war.
</P>
<P>
On December 28, 1999, Indonesia and Portugal normalized their
diplomatic relations which had been frozen by Lisbon in 1975 due
to the East Timor issue.
</P>
<P>
Shihab said he does not know the exact date of President Wahid'
s planned visit to Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gama said he was impressed with his meeting with
President Wahid, who believed that Indonesian-Portuguese ties will
further develop.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers also held talks on a plan to sign
four agreements on general affairs, investment, social and
cultural affairs as well as double tax exemption.
</P>
<P>
Shihab said he believes that the new ties between Indonesia and
Portugal should start with a concrete cooperation in investment
and tourism.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Town of Military Importance Found in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A rare and remarkably well-
preserved town of military importance has been discovered in
central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
The square-shaped town, surrounded by a 1,200-meter rampart,
occupies less than 90,000 square meters of land. The northern and
western walls, built from mud and sticks, stand two to three
meters high -- probably their original height, according to
experts.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists said it's the smallest town ever discovered in
the province, which they believed was built in the early Shang
dynasty (around 1500 B.C.). The town, which locates between the
Yellow River and the Taihan Mountain, was targeted to control the
then east-west traffic in the area and serve as a shelter to major
cities.
</P>
<P>
Henan Province was once the most prosperous area in ancient
China, and several of its cities have served as provincial
capitals over the past thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 pieces of pottery, stone, bone, and mussel wares
were also unearthed at the ruins.
</P>
<P>
The ancient town will provide new data for studying the
connection between dynasties of Xia (about 2000 B.C.-- 1500 B.C.)
and Shang (about 1500 B.C. - 1000 B.C.), and the history of Shang
Dynasty, said chief scientist Li Boqian who has been working for
archaeological evidence for dating the Xia and Shang dynasties.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Insects Come from Eurasia and India: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists recently said
research achievements have shown that the original form of the
insects in southwest China's Tibet came from Eurasia and India.
</P>
<P>
Wang Baohai, researcher with the Sciences Academy of
Agriculture and Stockbreeding of the Tibet Autonomous Region, said
that the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau emerged out of sea in the late
period of the Cenozoic Era, when most of the insects had already
come into being. So it is most likely that the insects in Tibet
came from neighboring Eurasia and India.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the entire development process involved
transformations of sea, islands, peninsula, and land, and the
insects first lived and moved among the islands. So, an insects
community gradually appeared in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, the huge mountains on the north side of
Tibet prevented many insects from coming, while the insects from
India met no obstructions, and many of them entered Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Studies also show that the insects in Tibet love a wet and hot
environment and most of them live in the tropic primeval forests.

SHENYANG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of people held a ceremony
today to celebrate the 100th birthday of general Zhang Xueliang,
in the city of Haining, Zhang's birthplace, in northeast China's
Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Zhang and General Yang Hucheng arrested Chiang Kai-shek, leader
of the Kuomintang (KMT), in the famous Xi'an Incident on December
12, 1936, which was eventually settled peacefully with the efforts
of the Communist Party of China (CPC), and which impelled Chiang
to fight together with the CPC against invading Japanese troops.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhang was imprisoned by Chiang soon after the incident,
and spent decades under house arrest in Taiwan under the KMT until
recent years, and General Yang was tortured to death in a KMT
prison in September 1949, just before the founding of the People's
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Relatives of Zhang and Yang were invited to attend today's
ceremony. The city also sent telegraphs and representatives to
congratulate Zhang in Hawaii, where the general is now living.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A leading Chinese economist said
here today that China's economy will have a higher growth rate in
2000 than in 1999 as long as no unexpected factors arise.
</P>
<P>
This year's economy is expected to develop in a stable and
healthy way, Qiu Xiaohua, deputy director of the National Bureau
of Statistics, told a press conference held by the Information
Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The country's gross domestic product (GDP) should be close to
eight percent for the first half of the year, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the first quarter, economic growth was up 8.1 percent; in
the second quarter growth won't be as high as the first quarter,
but not too much lower," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He explained that this is because agricultural production will
be lower in the second quarter than in the first due to seasonal
factors.
</P>
<P>
"Although prices of consumer goods in general are still falling,
the speed of their decline has slowed," said Qiu, who expressed
confidence that the consumer price index (CPI) will "come out of
its downward trend."
</P>
<P>
He attributed the better performance of the Chinese economy
mainly to the implementation of proactive fiscal policies over the
past two years or more, and the improvement of the international
economic environment.

<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A seriously injured Pacific dolphin
found on the beach of Dongshan Island in east China's Fujian
Province was saved Wednesday by local experts.
</P>
<P>
The dolphin was driven on to the beach by the tide and could
not return to the sea because of injuries, according to today's
Liberation Army Daily.
</P>
<P>
When local fishermen found it on May 30, the dolphin was
actually on the verge of death.
</P>
<P>
Upon learning the news, local military medical workers and
civilian medical personnel immediately launched a rescue operation
to save the mammal.
</P>
<P>
The dolphin, seven or eight years old, 2.4 meters long, and
weighing 120 kilograms, is still under special care at a local
oceanarium.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Scientist Deduces Perching Dinosaur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese paleontologist has
deduced that a small Mesozoic dinosaur could perch on trees and
develop the ability to fly by gliding through the trees.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered to the ongoing Fifth International
Meeting of the Society of Avian Paleontology and Evolution and the
Jehol Biota, Zhou Zhonghe, curator of bird fossils, discussed this
controversial subject of the origin of flight.
</P>
<P>
Zhou, professor with the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)
Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP),
claimed that Caudipteryx, a theropod dinosaur which lived some 100
million years ago, was able to climb trees.
</P>
<P>
"Fossilized specimens show that this kind of feathered dinosaur
had claws which are necessary for perching animals," said the 35-
year-old bird expert.
</P>
<P>
Academic circles widely believe that Caudipteryx had many
similarities to modern birds.
</P>
<P>
"The lineal ancestors of birds most likely lived in trees,"
Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
The dinosaur's forelimbs gradually became wings which supported
them as they learned to fly, the professor said. At the same time,
the structure of Caudipteryx's feet was almost the same as the
claws of modern birds.
</P>
<P>
While Zhou and several other scientists hold to this new theory,
most researchers who believe in the dinosaur-bird relationship
claim that dinosaurs learned to fly while running fast.
</P>
<P>
"I could list many pieces of evidence for the evolutionary
development from dinosaurs to primitive birds," Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
Scholars from around the world attending the international
meeting said that Zhou's proposal may arouse another round of
heated discussions.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Some of the world's leading
authorities on dinosaurs and birds are attending the Fifth
International Meeting of the Society of Avian Paleontology and
Evolution and the Symposium on Jehol Biota in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The latest finds of vertebrate fossils in western Liaoning
Province in northeast China, and Chinese paleontologists' academic
achievements have made China one of the world's centers for the
study of the origin of birds.
</P>
<P>
Among the famous experts in Beijing, Alan Feduccia, dean of
biology at the University of North Carolina, delivered several
talks opposing the hypothesis of a dinosaur-bird relationship.
</P>
<P>
The well-known professor has published The Age of Birds, and
The Origin and Evolution of Birds, two influential books in the
field.
</P>
<P>
As an active dinosaur expert in recent years, Paul Sereno, a
paleontology professor at the University of Chicago, brought to
the meeting new evidences supporting a lineal link between
dinosaurs and birds.
</P>
<P>
Sereno has collaborated several times with Chinese scholars in
the study of the fossilized creatures found in Liaoning.
</P>
<P>
Other important experts participating in the meeting include
Walter Bock, Storrs Olson, Ken Campbell, and Cecile Mourer-
Chauvier, all key organizers for the previous international bird
meetings.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the four-day Beijing meeting are discussing the
relationship between dinosaurs and birds, the nature of the "
feather" or "fiber-like" filaments in Sinosauropteryx, and the
relationship between the origin of birds and the origin of flight.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan As Part of China Shall Not Change: Xinhua (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- China's official news agency Xinhua
released a signed article today, stressing that Taiwan's status as
part of China shall not change in spite of the recent clamor made
by Taiwan's Annette Lu.
</P>
<P>
The die-hard independence stance of Annette Lu and her
illogical talk have long been held in contempt by the Chinese
people, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Lu talked once again about the so-called "unsettled
Taiwan status," claiming that it is a fact that the legal
international status of Taiwan has not be settled.
</P>
<P>
She also negated the authority of the Cairo Declaration and the
Potsdam Proclamation, saying that the only effective agreement was
the San Francisco Peace Treaty, and that the treaty didn't specify
that Taiwan's sovereignty belongs to China.
</P>
<P>
Her remarks are in disregard of historic facts, and have
exposed her true colors of being ignorant of the history of her
own country and splitting the motherland, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The article relates the historic background for the absurd
notion of an "unsettled Taiwan status."
</P>
<P>
The island of Taiwan was occupied by Japan in 1895 under an
agreement with the Qing Dynasty. In December 1941, the Chinese
government proclaimed to the world that all the country's treaties,
agreements, and contracts with Japan be abolished immediately.
</P>
<P>
In December 1943, the Cairo Declaration jointly issued by China,
the United States, and Britain stipulated that all the Chinese
territories that Japan had stolen from China, including the island
of Taiwan, be returned to China. The 1945 Potsdam Proclamation
reiterated that demand.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan As Part of China Shall Not Change: Xinhua (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On October 25, 1945, Taiwan was returned to China. Taiwan's
status as part of China has not changed since then, the article
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo Declaration and Potsdam Proclamation are both widely
recognized as legally effective documents of international law.
And, after the signing of the two documents, the United States and
its allies declared its recognition of Chinese sovereignty over
Taiwan on many occasions.
</P>
<P>
The United States changed its tune only after the Korean War
broke out, and tossed out the idea of a so-called "unsettled
Taiwan status," which the Chinese government declared as both
illegal and ineffective.
</P>
<P>
Despite their political differences, the Chinese people on both
sides of the Taiwan Straits all expressed their opposition to the
U.S. move, which was also opposed by the then Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
However, with the normalization of Sino-U.S. relations, the
United States dismissed the so-called unsettled status of Taiwan,
and has since stuck to the principle that there is only one China
and Taiwan part of the Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
The article said that at the present crucial juncture in cross-
Straits relations, Lu disregarded the historic facts and legal
documents, and harped on the same old string about the status of
Taiwan. Her remarks have already met harsh criticism on the island
itself.

<P>
In addition, Lu also spread fallacies, saying that the stepping
down of the formerly ruling Kuomintang means that no relations now
exist between Taiwan and the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Lu's laughable remarks will not alter the fact that Taiwan
is part of China, which is also widely recognized by the
international community.
</P>
<P>
The shifting of governments in Taiwan will not have any impact
on the legal status of Taiwan, the article stressed.
</P>
<P>
It will prove to be only a fond dream that some people hope to
promote the independence of Taiwan by taking advantage of the
stepping down of the Kuomintang. The Chinese people will never
allow this to happen.
</P>
<P>
As early as the 1950s, the imperialists attempted to split
China through the so-called unsettled status of Taiwan. They
failed miserably. Now that Lu has harped on the same old string,
her fate is also destined to doom, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Since taking office, Lu has spread many fallacies about Taiwan
independence. The Chinese people will not tolerate Lu's
provocation, which will surely worsen cross-Straits relations, the
article concludes.

<P>
In the statement, they said they are ready to take all the
necessary steps to honor the "agreement signed by our
representatives in Switzerland."
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Indonesian government and the separatist
group GAM signed a humanitarian pause accord in Geneva,
Switzerland, on May 12.
</P>
<P>
Friday's statement was signed by Col. (Police Idhwan Karim
representing the government and Nashiruddin bin Ahmed of the GAM
in the provincial capital of Bandar Aceh.
</P>
<P>
The two parties said: "We believe that the conflict between our
armed forces has caused tremendous suffering in Aceh. We are
committed to find ways to successfully stop the violence here. We
will work together in a spirit of cooperation and goodwill to
provide humanitarian assistance to those in need and to improve
the security in Aceh," the statement was quoted by the Antara News
Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The two parties have also agreed to establish a Joint Committee
on Security Modalities and a Joint Committee on Humanitarian
Action.
</P>
<P>
"We will inform the public of the proceedings of the joint
committees and encourage all the people of Aceh to support the
humanitarian pause which comes into effect on June 2, 2000," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the Geneva accord, a joint panel of rebel
leaders, government officials and independent Swiss mediators will
oversee the deal in Aceh. It would regularly report to another "
joint forum" based in Switzerland, which is the highest decision-
making body. The goal would be to extend the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
In a televised address on Thursday night, President Abdurrahman
Wahid said the humanitarian pause accord would be "the beginning
of a new era of peace" for the people of Aceh after decades of
civil strife.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, Sweden Sign Defense Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and Sweden on
Friday signed an agreement on defence co-operation which would
include peacekeeping and logistics.
</P>
<P>
Endorsing the agreement at the South African Defence Force
headquarters in Pretoria, Defence Minister Mosiuoa Lekota said in
a statement that the aim of the agreement was to meet and maintain
the technological demands, capabilities and standards of the new
millennium in the defence force.
</P>
<P>
"We are like Siamese twins in so many ways going through
similar baptism," Lekota said.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa's defence and security policy had a
national and international dimension.
</P>
<P>
"While an outright military offensive against us may be
remote, in military terms anything is possible and it would,
therefore, be exceedingly naive and embarrassing to be caught
snoozing," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa's policy was defensive, deterrent,
politico- diplomatic and human rights oriented.
</P>
<P>
Concerning cooperation and collaboration with other states at
international level, he said: "We actively participate in the
peaceful resolution of conflicts, diplomatic intervention and
strengthening of democracy."
</P>
<P>
"We uphold respect for human rights without interference in
the internal affairs of our neighbors, participate actively in the
affairs of the United Nations, the Organization of African Unity
and the Southern African Development Community," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was important to control and reduce the spread of
conflicts for the benefit of South Africa, the Southern African
Development Community region and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
"We therefore disapprove vehemently of dictatorships and coup
d'etats as they constitute a flagrant recipe for political
instability with disastrous results to the inhabitants of the
whole region."

<HEADLINE> Audit Discloses Appalling Mismanagement in Listed Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese auditors have discovered
appalling mismanagement, falsification, and misappropriation of
funds in the Hainan Huaqiao Investment Co., Ltd., a company listed
on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Securities, an audit conducted upon
former company chairman Zhao Kai found that the company was very
badly managed, with its financial management in total disorder and
many accounting and contract files missing.
</P>
<P>
Also during Zhao's term, the company is suspected of using 90
million yuan in public funds for stock investment and claiming a
false profit of 200 million yuan and equity capital for three
million shares.
</P>
<P>
The company in south China's Hainan Province also had off-the-
books debts of 400 million yuan, and had been producing false
accounts for years.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, similar audit conducted upon former
general manager Li Shixiang found that Li may have misappropriated
nearly 10 million yuan in company funds, and deliberately wrote
enormous false accounts.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xiaocheng, the company's financial manager, was also found
to have loaned out huge amounts of cash, but could not reasonably
explain where this money went.
</P>
<P>
The board of directors have requested that securities
regulators and the judicial authorities become involved in further
investigations, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The company's 1999 annual report shows that its operations have
completely collapsed, and that by the end of 1999, the company was
actually bankrupt, with its stock placed under special treatment
by the Shanghai Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> China's GDP Expected to Grow By Eight Percent This Year (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Also, the world economy is widely predicted to see higher
growth this year, and China's anticipated entry into the World
Trade Organization will also improve the external environment for
the Chinese economy, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter this year, China's GDP had a year-on-year
growth of 8.1 percent, which was 1.9 percentage points higher than
that of the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
The country's industrial growth, which accounted for 43 percent
of China's GDP, showed a robust year-on-year growth of 10.7
percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Capital investment has also been on the rise, up 9.3 percent in
the first four months over that of the same period last year. And
overall capital investment is expected to see an increase of 10
percent this year, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The first quarter's retail sales were 10.4 percent higher than
those of the same period last year, and the country's trade volume
witnessed a growth of 38.8 percent in the first four months this
year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the good performance of the economy, the article noted
that it will be very difficult to achieve faster economic growth
after the economy has entered a period of relative balance.
</P>
<P>
Future efforts should be focused more on upgrading the country'
s economic quality and efficiency, the Outlook article concluded.

<HEADLINE> China's GDP Expected to Grow By Eight Percent This Year (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- China's gross domestic product (GDP)
is expected to grow by eight percent this year since major
economic indicators have showed improvements, said the latest
issue of the country's most authoritative news weekly Outlook.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, China's economy has maintained a fairly good
performance, and all economic indices have been relatively
satisfactory, according to the June 5 issue of the magazine, which
will hit newsstands early next week.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the overall performance of the Chinese
economy in the second half of the year will be better than that of
the first half of the year, it said.
</P>
<P>
After two years of efforts, both the internal and external
environments have become more favorable to the Chinese economy,
the magazine said in an article by Zhang Hanya, an official with
the State Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Internally, China has to a large extent adjusted itself to the
new situation of the post short-supply economy, and acquired a
significant amount of experience in macroeconomic tuning.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the series of economic policies and reforms
aimed at propelling economic growth continue to exert positive
effects on the overall economy, said Zhang, director of the
commission's investment study institute.
</P>
<P>
The external environment has also continued to improve. Most of
the Asian economies hit in the last financial crisis have now
rebounded to normal growth, and are expected to demand more
Chinese exports.

NAIROBI, June 2 (Xinhua) -- At least 600,000 people in Kenya's

Maurice said that the government was planning to increase
relief supplies to the province.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Hydropower Project Targeted by International Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- At least six international groups
have expressed interest in developing Zambia's 80 megawatt Itezhi
Tezhi hydropower project, the Times of Zambia newspaper reported
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Once completed, the project would boost the country's capacity
to export electricity to Tanzania, Zimbabwe, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo and Kenya, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Peter Mwamfuli, Energy and Water Development
Permanent Secretary, as saying in an interview in Lusaka on
Thursday that the companies expressed interest when bids opened
last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Itezhi Tezhi project requires the successful bidder to build a
hydro power plant as there is only one reservoir.
</P>
<P>
"We are moving steadily, we hope we can get the groundwork done
by early next year," Mwamfuli said.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government is bracing itself for increased
electricity demand in the region, the official said, citing Kenya
where serious load shedding is taking place due to insufficient
power.
</P>
<P>
On the building of a 67 million U.S. dollar mini-hydropower
station in North-Western Province, Mwamfuli said his ministry is
awaiting a final report before making further recommendations on
the modalities of development.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Vows to Defeat Anti-Referendum Petition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has vowed to defeat a petition filed against the Referendum Act
and Other Provisions Act by Democratic Party (DP) President Paul
Ssemogerere, Ugandan media reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Ssemogerere and his likes are trying to attack the referendum
law so that they derail the people, but they will not manage
because we also know the law," the New Vision daily quoted
Museveni as saying.
</P>
<P>
"If he thinks he is making a strong point by going to the
courts of law, we shall show him that he is making no point at
all," Museveni told a consultative meeting attended by Soroti
district Movement and referendum committee members on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The petition, which was dismissed by the Constitutional Court
on technicalities last September, got a new lease of life on
Wednesday after the Supreme Court remitted it to the same court
for hearing.
</P>
<P>
"The referendum was not ordered by the Referendum and Other
Provisions Act, but by the Constitution which is the supreme law
of the land," the Monitor daily quoted Museveni, also chairman of
the ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM), as saying.
</P>
<P>
He accused Ssembogerere and his party of raising "irrelevant"
issues against the NRM including a plot to "block" the June 29
referendum on political systems, said the Monitor.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Constitutional Court Thursday set June 6 as the
date to hear Ssemogerere' petition against the Referendum Act and
Other Provisions Act.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the NRM will come out a winner in
the coming referendum late this month.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Warns Presidential Aspirants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
has warned Environment Minister Ben Mwila, a presidential
aspirant, and other ruling party leaders campaigning for the
presidency that he would take action against them at an
appropriate time.
</P>
<P>
The president told cadres of the ruling Movement for
Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) Thursday in a northern city of Ndola
that he will make the move to justify his action to discipline MMD
leaders who are not following party regulations by campaigning
prematurely, the Times of Zambia newspaper reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mwila and all ministers campaigning for the presidency are free
to leave MMD if they fail to comply to party rules and
regulations, Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
"We share a common denominator as a party. Anyone going against
such regulations is free to leave," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Mwila announced his candidature for the MMD presidency on May
26, paving the way for him to run for the country's presidency in
the general elections to be held next year.
</P>
<P>
Mwila is one of the country's richest with a business empire
spanning manufacturing, construction, finance and fertilizers. He
helped incumbent President Chiluba defeat former President Kenneth
Kaunda in the 1991 elections and is now seen as a leading
candidate to replace Chiluba in the next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
However, Chiluba has indicated that he would ensure that Mwila
does not become the president and MMD has said it is not the time
now to start the election campaign.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Tourism Sector Earns More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's earnings from tourism
increased by 21.7 percent to 21.3 billion shillings (about 288
million U.S. dollars) in 1999 against 21.3 billion shillings
(about 236 million dollars) in the previous year, the latest
statistics indicated.
</P>
<P>
The good performance was due to concerted efforts of the entire
tourism industry in the national spirit of unity, Friday's East
African Standard daily quoted Kenya's Tourism, Trade and Industry
Minister Nicholas Biwott as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tourism, the third largest foreign exchange earner in the east
African country, has been picking up in the last two years

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenya has ratified the treaty for
the establishment of the East African Community (EAC) and become
the first of the three east African countries to deposit the
document of ratification with the EAC secretariat.
</P>
<P>
According to Nairobi-based newspapers on Friday, the
ratification pact was signed on Wednesday by Kenya's Minister for
Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Bonaya Godana in
Arusha, Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Kenya hoped to facilitate the early entry into force of the
treaty and undertake to fulfil the treaty's stipulations, Godana
said.
</P>
<P>
The treaty shall be effective upon ratification and deposit of
the instruments of ratifications by Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan parliament ratified the treaty on April 27 and
awaits to deposit the pact with the EAC secretariat.
</P>
<P>
A motion by the Tanzanian government for the ratification of
the pact is scheduled to be tabled before the parliament on June
13.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of the three east African states signed a treaty
in Arusha last November for the establishment of the East African
Community to replace the East African Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The new regional body is expected to expand and deepen
economic, political and social cooperation among the three
neighboring states for their mutual benefit at a higher level.

<HEADLINE> China Reforms Methods for Assessment of Research findings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- China will reform its methods of
evaluating scientific and technological achievements, and these
new procedures are expected to become effective sometime this year.
</P>
<P>
According to a symposium on the management of scientific and
technological achievements which closed here today, the assessment
of scientific and technological achievements is now conducted by
the government, but will, for the most part, be carried out in
accordance with market considerations in the future.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Ministry of Science and Technology said
that his ministry started revising the "methods for assessment of
scientific and technological achievements" last September.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua has learned that the ministry put forward the "
management methods for assessment of scientific and technological
achievements" at the just-closed symposium to solicit opinions.
</P>
<P>
The new management methods stipulate that relevant government
departments will be responsible for the examination and appraisal
of scientific and technological achievements that involve state
secrets and those of especially great importance. For the rest,
the great majority of research achievements, qualified social
intermediary organs will be responsible for examination and
evaluation according to certain criteria and regulations.
</P>
<P>
China has issued three methods for the assessment of scientific
and technological achievements since 1961.

<HEADLINE> Smuggling of Imported Wines, Spirits Halted in Shantou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANTOU, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Shantou Customs officers in south
China's Guangdong Province stopped a ship attempting to smuggle 2,
367 cartons of imported wines and spirits worth over 10 million
yuan at sea near the town of Huilai, also in Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
In the early hours of May 28, after being alerted to be on the
look-out, a coast guard vessel on patrol in sea waters near
Huilaih spotted a suspicious fishing boat at 2:10 am which refused
to be inspected when requested to do so.
</P>
<P>
The fishing boat was eventually overtaken after 20 minutes of
maneuvers, and was found to have 18 kinds of illegal foreign wines
and spirits on board.
</P>
<P>
The smuggling boat set sail from the Philippines on May 25, but
was quickly found by the coast guard vessel soon after it reached
the Chinese coast near Huilai. The smugglers intended to secretly
unload all the contraband on the nearby coast, but the plan was
aborted.
</P>
<P>
All six people aboard the boat were detained, with all the
contraband commodities confiscated. The case is still under
investigations, said sources from Shantou Customs.

<HEADLINE> China's Northwest Development Faces Six Major Problems (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The development of China's vast
northwest area faces six major problems, a group of leading
scientists and scholars said in a report that has been presented
to the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The problems must be properly addressed with if the country's
drive of grand scheme to develop the northwest is to be a success,
they noted.
</P>
<P>
The report from 25 academicians and 20 senior researchers and
engineers of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese
Academy of Engineering lists the mis-use of water resources in the
arid land as the biggest obstacle.
</P>
<P>
The haphazard use of water resources, such as the backward
irrigation system and poor management, has resulted in the
deterioration of the local environment, including the expansion of
deserts.
</P>
<P>
In the future development plan, water for maintaining the
ecological balance must be guaranteed and a water-conserving
irrigation system should be further promoted.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the management of water resources should be
enhanced through economic and legal methods, the report says. (

<TEXT>
<P>
The report lists the area's sub-par educational and scientific
facilities as the second hindrance to the northwest development.
</P>
<P>
It suggested that a special education program be set up to
foster local teachers and to attract skilled outsiders. Education
infrastructure construction and distance education programs should
be given adequate attention.
</P>
<P>
The backward transportation and telecommunications systems are
the third obstacle, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, in the process of tapping the abundant energy and
mineral resources, the northwest should equally consider
environmental protection and the development of renewable
resources such as wind and solar energy.
</P>
<P>
The fifth problem is the irrational industrial structure and
widening gap between cities and rural areas, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It suggested that the northwest's industries should shift to
areas in which they have comparative advantages, such as raw-
material processing and textile industries. In addition,
urbanization drive and the construction of medium-sized and small
cities should be encouraged.
</P>
<P>
Finally, more efforts should be made to develop water-saving
and ecological agriculture in the northwest area, the report noted.

<HEADLINE> To Be or Not to Be: China's Auto Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- China's automotive industry must
adopt effective means to tackle the unprecedented challenges it
will face after the country enters the World Trade Organization (
WTO), says the latest issue of Outlook, the country's most
authoritative news weekly.
</P>
<P>
"After China joins the WTO, the automotive industry will face
great challenges from the outside, so the industry is at a crucial
historic moment," the magazine's June 5 issue says in a signed
article.
</P>
<P>
As globalization is an irreversible trend in the development of
the auto industry, China's automotive industry will unavoidably be
driven into this trend, whether China joins the WTO or not, the
article argues.
</P>
<P>
Faced with globalization, China's automobile sector has
weaknesses such as small scale, irrational allocation, and low
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the global auto industry is shifting to
developing countries in the process of globalization.
</P>
<P>
"That means globalization not only brings about challenges, but
also provides opportunities for China. The crux of the problem is
how to create the best investment environment to attract foreign
investment," the article says.
</P>
<P>
Since combining domestic motor enterprises to form several huge
enterprise groups and building small joint ventures have both
proved ineffective, the article puts forwards a better alternative,
that is, Sino-foreign cooperation on a large scale.
</P>
<P>
The ideal partner for China's automotive industry would be
large multinational enterprises that are not only willing to set
up research centers in China, but also intend to build large-scale
production bases, the article says.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) is
trying to establish an unofficial buffer zone between Israel and
Lebanon at sea, in an effort to prevent maritime mishaps that could
cause friction and derail efforts to restore peace in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
UNIFIL spokesman Timur Goksel confirmed Thursday that the force
commander, Major General Seth Kofi Obeng, is trying to arrange an "
informal separation zone with the consent of both sides."
</P>
<P>
This follows a number of incidents in which Lebanese fishermen
have encroached on Israel's territorial waters, claiming that they
were operating in Lebanese waters.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak had reshuffled the workload
of his two negotiating teams on the framework and permanent status
agreements with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
A coordination meeting was held this week between the head of
the formal team, Oded Eran, and attorney Gilad Sher, Barak's envoy
to the "secret" track being run by Public Security Minister Shlomo
Ben-Ami.
</P>
<P>
A senior Barak associate says that the Ben Ami-Sher team will
discuss fundamental issues with senior Palestinian officials Abu
Ala and Hassan Asfour. Eran will deal with secondary issues, such
as routine security arrangements between Israel and the
Palestinians, the legal appendix to the agreement, and the economic
aspects.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton, hoping to clinch one final
Middle East peace coup before he leaves office, said Thursday he
would like to convene an end-of-month summit with Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Barak flew nine hours to Lisbon and back to spend just an hour
and a half with Clinton. The two discussed ideas to bridge the
remaining gaps between Israel and the Palestinians and pave the way
for a final status agreement.
</P>
<P>
U.S. special envoy Dennis Ross will visit the region this
weekend and be followed next week by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright. They will meet with leaders and negotiating teams and
report back to Clinton on the state of progress.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Thursday night that
Jerusalem will remain united under Israeli sovereignty and will
never be divided.
</P>
<P>
Barak, speaking at a ceremony at Ammunition Hill marking
Jerusalem Day, said that the Holy City should not be compared to
other territories captured during the Six-Day War. The Day
commemorates the anniversary of the city's "unification" in the
1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
"Jerusalem shall forever remain ours because it is in our souls.
Never again will Jerusalem be under foreign sovereignty. Only he
who is cut off from Israel's heritage could allow the thought of
dividing the city to pass his lips," said Barak.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Hostages to Be Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Fiji's hostage crisis seems to be
close to its end as an agreement was reached Thursday night
between the military authorities and Hostage-taker George Speight.
</P>
<P>
According to Australian Associated Press, Speight told
reporters at the parliament house complex Friday that "All going
well, my plan is to release them (the hostages) before the Great
Council of Chiefs meeting on Monday."
</P>
<P>
Final details of the deal to set free Prime Minister Mahendra
Chaudhry and his MPs were being hammered out Friday, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Speight and military rulers made a major breakthrough Thursday
night when they agreed Fiji's powerful Great Council of Chiefs
would decide finally whether to accept Speight's demands for an
interim civilian government, or continued military rule.
</P>
<P>
The chiefs will have a meeting next Monday but they are
reported having had already agreed to Speight's demand to play an
influential role in the country's political arena.
</P>
<P>
Speight insisted he has "leadership potential" and began
lobbying chiefs to back his plan for power.
</P>
<P>
Fiji's former Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and his cabinet
members were taken hostage on May 19.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Tanker Blast Attributed to Monitoring Failure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Absence of proper monitoring system
in the private ship-breaking yards and inadequate precautionary
measures by the buyers of abandoned ships have led to the
explosion of an oil tanker on Wednesday in Chittagong, The Daily
Star reported here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The casualty figure caused by the explosion rose to 18 from 16
when two more workers succumbed to their burn injuries at
Chittagong Medical College Hospital early Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Police and other sources said lapses in precautionary measures,
including making the ship chamber gas-free before scrapping,
triggered the blast and other accidents at ship-breaking yards.
</P>
<P>
Standard procedure requires a ship to be free of gas before
breaking, but it is hardly followed at ship-breaking grounds.
Sources said ship-breakers sometimes obtain gas-free certificates
from the government's explosive department in collusion with a
section of customs officials.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, negligence as well as gross violation of rules and
regulations of the concerned government departments by the
operators of the yards are rampant.
</P>
<P>
At least 50 workers had been killed in 30 such blasts in the
ship-breaking yards of the district during the last two decades, a
survey conducted by The Independent newspaper revealed.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said that over 40,000 workers are directly
engaged in the ship-breaking industry while over 1 million people
are indirectly dependent on it.
</P>
<P>
The ship-breaking industry has an annual turnover of about 5
billion taka (96 million U.S. dollars), they said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Ratifies East African Community Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenya has ratified the treaty for
the establishment of the East African Community (EAC) and become
the first of the three east African countries to deposit the
document of ratification with the EAC secretariat.
</P>
<P>
According to Nairobi-based newspapers on Friday, the
ratification pact was signed on Wednesday by Kenya's Minister for
Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Bonaya Godana in
Arusha, Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Kenya hoped to facilitate the early entry into force of the
treaty and undertake to fulfil the treaty's stipulations, Godana
said.
</P>
<P>
The treaty shall be effective upon ratification and deposit of
the instruments of ratifications by Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan parliament ratified the treaty on April 27 and
awaits to deposit the pact with the EAC secretariat.
</P>
<P>
A motion by the Tanzanian government for the ratification of
the pact is scheduled to be tabled before the parliament on June
13.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of the three east African states signed a treaty
in Arusha last November for the establishment of the East African
Community to replace the East African Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The new regional body is expected to expand and deepen
economic, political and social cooperation among the three
neighboring states for their mutual benefit at a higher level.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Build Two Diesel Power Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Power and Lighting
Company has concluded two agreements which will accelerate the
delivery of two 55- megawatt diesel power generating plants on a
fast-track basis.
</P>
<P>
The agreements were signed Thursday with a consortium
consisting of Deutz (UK) Limited and Burmeister and Wain
Scandinavian Contractor, Friday' s East African Standard newspaper
quoted the company's Managing Director Samuel Gichuru as saying.
</P>
<P>
The two power plants, to be located in Lanet and Eldoret, both
in Rift Valley Province, will cost 135 million U.S. dollars,
Gichuru said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Lanet plant is expected to be operational in next
June while the Eldoret plant will start producing electricity in
next July.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the agreements is part of the measures
undertaken by the Kenyan government to minimize the adverse effect
of the ongoing 12-hour power rationing program on customers.
</P>
<P>
Kenya began power rationing last September due to a two-year
drought leading to the lowest water level of major energy
reservoirs, leaving an electricity shortfall of between 154 and
360 megawatts in the off-peak and peak hours respectively.
</P>
<P>
The government last week introduced a 12-hour power rationing
schedule starting this week, with industrial and commercial
consumers having power between 6:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. everyday
except Sunday.

<HEADLINE> 12 Tanzanian Fishermen Still Held Hostage by Burundian Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Twelve Tanzanian fishermen
are still being held hostage by the Burundian army who suspect
them to be members of a rebel group in the central African
country, the Guardian newspaper reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzania People's Defense Forces (TPDF) is negotiating with
the Burundian army for the release of the fishermen, said
Tanzanian Chief of Defense Forces (CDF) Robert Mboma on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said TPDF has already sent the Burundian army the names of
the captives to prove that they are Tanzanians who just crossed
the border into Burundi in search of fish.
</P>
<P>
According to the military chief, the fishermen, mistaken as
gunmen loyal to the rebel National Council for Defense of
Democracy (CNDD) in Burundi, were arrested last Sunday in a war
zone after crossing the border into Burundi on Lake Tanganyika.
</P>
<P>
A total of 26 fishermen were arrested after they crossed to the
 Burundian side of the border which has been forbidden for fishing
 activities, but 14 of them managed to escape from captivity soon
after being taken in a boat to Kabonga in Burundi where they were
kept hostage by the Burundian soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Analysts Predict U.S. Auto Sales to Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 1 (Xinhua) -- After ripping up the road over
the past two years, General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler hit a
speed bump in May as higher interest rates and a slowing economy
combined to slow down sales, said auto industry analysts Thursday.
</P>
<P>
General Motors Corp., the world's leading automaker, saw U.S.
average daily vehicle sales fall 5.8 percent, as it sold 455,868
vehicles in the month.
</P>
<P>
Ford's daily vehicle sales rose 1.4 percent from a year earlier
to a record 416,660, but its daily U.S. car sales slipped 1.5
percent in the month.
</P>
<P>
German-U.S. automaker DaimlerChrysler, which reported an 18
percent drop in May sales late Tuesday, announced a new incentive
sales program Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The seasonally adjusted annual (industry-wide) sales rate in
the last six months has exceeded 18 million," said Bob Rewey, a
Ford group vice president. "Going forward, we anticipate that
consumer demand will moderate in response to higher interest rates.
"
</P>
<P>
Analysts agree that the industry will be hard-pressed to top
last year's record or maintain the current pace of sales.
</P>
<P>
"I think the auto industry and the economy at large are
inseparable," said John Casesa, auto analyst for Merrill Lynch."
An increase in the cost of money is going to slow down big ticket
purchases, and it's inevitable that is going to hit auto sales. I
think that's what we're beginning to see in May."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. auto industry is facing its first monthly sales
decline since August 1998, as the Federal Reserve has raised
interest rates six times since June, including an aggressive half
percentage point increase two weeks ago, trying to slow the
economy and keep inflation from becoming a problem.
</P>
<P>
Other economic indicators also have found less enthusiasm among
American consumers for large purchases. Demand for big-ticket
goods in April took its biggest nose dive since late 1991, and
consumer spending rose at its slowest pace in nine months.
</P>
<P>
Salchow and Susan Jacobs, an analyst with Jacobs &AMP; Associates,
said interest rates were affecting consumers' minds more than
their pocketbooks. Salchow noted that if the interest rate on a
five-year, 20,000-dollar loan rose from 8 percent to 9 percent,
the monthly payment would go up 10 dollars.
</P>
<P>
"I think the increase in interest rates and the wide
fluctuations in the stock market are giving consumer reasons for
pause," Jacobs said. "I think it's too early to assume that
consumers are retrenching in large ways, but they're more cautious.
"
</P>
<P>
Import automakers including American Honda, Volkswagen of
America Inc., Mitsubishi Motors, Hyundai Motor America, Toyota and
Nissan fared better, but saw the pace of sales slow from recent
months.
</P>
<P>
But even some of those posting gains said they believe that the
boom that saw record vehicles sales the last two years may be
running out of gas.

<HEADLINE> Americans Worry About Recession, Stock, Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A public opinion poll released
Thursday shows most Americans expect a recession, a dramatic drop
in the stock market and significantly higher interest rates in
next four years.
</P>
<P>
On the possibility that a recession will hit U.S. economy, the
answers were: very likely, 14 percent; somewhat likely, 42 percent;
not likely, 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the stock prices will drop dramatically, the answers
were: very likely, 15 percent; somewhat likely, 35 percent; not
likely, 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
Answering the question that if they think that interest rates
will rise dramatically, 28 percent voters said it is very likely,
44 percent thought it somewhat likely, while only 24 percent said
it is not likely.
</P>
<P>
The poll of 1,002 likely voters, taken in May 29-31 by pollster
John Zogby, found 40 percent of respondents expected a
substantial increase in unemployment in the next four years, while
55 percent didn't think so.
</P>
<P>
The poll also found a virtual dead heat in the presidential
race between Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic candidate, and
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, his Republican rival.
</P>
<P>
Asked if a recession was more likely under Bush or under Gore,
30 percent said Bush, 23 percent said Gore and 35 percent thought
either or neither.
</P>
<P>
But asked if they personally would be better off under Bush or
Gore, 43 percent said Bush and 39 percent said Gore.

<HEADLINE> Hostage Taker Shot Twice in Head, Critically Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A gunman, who held more than three
dozens of children hostage for 28 hours, was shot in the head
twice by a police sniper and was critically injured, police
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Police disguised as television camera crew lured the Tunisian-
born man, 39, into a fake interview and then shot him in the head.
The gunman, with a history of mental problems, now remains in a
Luxembourg hospital.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five children and three adult teachers were rescued
unhurt. They were all safe and sound after the ordeal that started
on Wednesday afternoon at Wasserbillig near the Luxembourg-Germany
border.
</P>
<P>
The incident was not the first in recent years in European
countries.
</P>
<P>
In May 1993, 21 children aged between three and four were taken
hostage in a nursery school near Paris. The gunman released 15
children and police rescued the rest kids.
</P>
<P>
In February 1994, a man armed with a hand grenade held two
children, a teacher and a school bus driver hostage in Ukraine.
All the hostages were rescued unhurt.
</P>
<P>
In December 1995, gunmen detonated two hand grenades to kill
three children and injured nine others in Russia. A fourth child
died four days later from the injury sustained from the grenade
blasts.
</P>
<P>
On March 13, 1996, at Dunblane of Scotland, 16 children aged
between four and six together with their teacher were shot dead in
a nursery school gym. The gunman took his own life after the
shooting spree.
</P>
<P>
A gunman shot and seriously injured nine people in a British
school in July 1996 before he was overwhelmed by the police. Among
the injured were three children aged between three and four.
</P>
<P>
On May 15 this year, a man took 25 children and several of a
day-care center's staff hostage in Norway. The gunman released 20
children and eight of the 10 nursery school staff. The incident
ended with no harm to the hostages.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Rise For Third Straight Day in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices rose for the third
consecutive day in Tokyo Friday, led mainly by high-priced
information and technology issues.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange gained 105.76 points, or 0.63
percent, from Thursday's close to end at 16,800.06.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, added 14.47 points or 0.94 percent to 1,556.
45.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei index climbed as high as 16,941.42 in the morning
session, but lost momentum in the afternoon, with traders taking
profits ahead of Friday's announcement of U.S. employment data for
May, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section increased to 783.50 million
shares from Thursday's 654.43 million.
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
High-priced issues led overall share prices higher, while
issues which have drawn active buying recently succumbed to profit-
taking, traders said.
</P>
<P>
The gain in leading issues came after New York's Nasdaq
composite index surged 181.59 points to 3,582.50 on Thursday, they
said.
</P>
<P>
Gainers included brokerage houses, wholesalers and nonferrous-
metal makers, while paper, rubber and real estate issues were
among losers.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers outpaced
gainers 732 to 541 despite the gains in the Nikkei and TOPIX, with
119 issues closing unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Teams to Discuss Jerusalem in Nicosia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian negotiators
will kick off a three-day meeting here Friday on the future status
of Jerusalem, within the framework of an overall solution to the
Arab-Israeli problem.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports said the two sides are expected to deal with
issues concerning the future status of Jerusalem, expressing "their
interests, fears and anxieties" over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Each side will send seven to eight representatives who are "very
close to leadership" to the meetings, including diplomats,
officials dealing with security matters and experts.
</P>
<P>
Israel seized the Arab eastern part of Jerusalem in the 1967
Middle East war. It insists that Jerusalem is its eternal and
indivisible capital, while the Palestinians want East Jerusalem as
the capital of their future independent state.
</P>
<P>
The final status of the Holy City, widely acknowledged as one of
the thorniest issues in the entire peace process, is to be decided
in the final-status talks between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus News Agency quoted reliable sources as saying that the
talks will be the start of a "dialogue" between the two sides that
would pave the way for future negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is organized by the Jerusalem-based Israeli-
Palestinian Center for Research and Information.
</P>
<P>
A member of the Swedish Social Democratic party will act as a
mediator during the talks. Sweden has sponsored similar contacts in
the past between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has repeatedly expressed its wish and readiness to play
host to meetings between the parties involved in the Middle East
peace process, in a bid to contribute to the efforts for an overall
settlement.

GUANGZHOU, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The marine resources regulation
authorities in south China's Guangdong Province have mounted a
fight against the illegal exploitation of the local sand beaches.
</P>
<P>
The coastal province has witnessed rapid marine economic growth
in recent years. However, illegal sea area reclamation and
tideland enclosures have already caused problems for the
comprehensive development of marine resources.
</P>
<P>
In order to step up law enforcement, the province has set up a
marine police force, which is equipped with a fleet of over 100
jetboats to patrol the coast line.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong now has four protected beach reserves covering some
131,700 hectares, which have been established for turtles,
mangroves, and pearl oysters, and the province is planning to set
up another 16 natural sea reserves in river delta areas to protect
such rare animals as the white dolphin.

<HEADLINE> Descendants of Great Wall Guards Repair Fortress (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Descendants of ancient warriors who
guarded the 6,700-kilometer Great Wall have spent the past nine
months repairing a section of the structure in north China,
carrying stones on their backs up the side of a mountain to fix
the deteriorating fortress.
</P>
<P>
"I can't think of anything that could make me more excited than
rebuilding the Great Wall," said Su Wenyu, the 40-year-old head of
Xinguan village, Pingding County in north China's Shanxi Province,
who spearheaded the project and is a long-distant relative of a
former Wall soldier.
</P>
<P>
"People can hardly believe that this part of the Great Wall was
almost left to ruin in the desolate mountains just a few years ago,
" said Su, who with his 700 fellow villagers has been working on
the section known as Guguan Pass.
</P>
<P>
This segment of the Wall, 400 kilometers west of Beijing, was
built during the Warring States Period (475-221 B.C.) and is one
of the Wall's four renowned passes. The three others are
Juyongguan Pass, Daomaguan Pass, and Jiayuguan Pass, where the
Wall ends in the west.
</P>
<P>
Guguan Pass has been repaired several times throughout history,
and was designated a cultural relic under key protection by the
Shanxi Provincial Government in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Men and women, old and young, have toiled for nine months to
return to its former glory a 620-meter portion that once was
safeguarded by their ancestors.
</P>
<P>
"The work was a tough job compared to planting several thousand
mu of crops on flatland because we have had to carry bricks and
stones on our shoulders up to the mountains," Su said.

Su was told that the stone, and mortar should look similar to
the original materials used to build for Wall. Su's team of
workers used a mortar mixture of lime, cement, ash and sand.
</P>
<P>
Citing the beacon towers restored as an example, Su explained
that the bricks used to build the beacon towers were the same as
those used in restoring the ancient town of Pingyao in Shanxi
Province, which has been inscribed into the World Heritage List by
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO).
</P>
<P>
Su hopes that the new and improved Guguan Pass will serve a
special purpose.
</P>
<P>
"Our ancestors built the Great Wall to keep out marauding
nomads so that they could live a peaceful life," he said. "We,
their offspring, have rebuilt the Great Wall to attract tourists
so that we can live a better life."

<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's High Court of Sindh (
SHC) has admitted an appeal seeking enhancement of life term upto
death sentence for former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif who had been
convicted in a plane hijacking case.
</P>
<P>
A full bench of SHC comprising Chief Justice Saiyed Saeed

</P>
<P>
The prosecution also filed another appeal which challenged the
acquittal of Sharif's six co-accused including his brother Shahbaz
Sharif in the hijacking case.
</P>
<P>
The case pertains to alleged hijacking of a civilian plane from
Colombo, Sri Lanka, to Karachi on October 12, 1999, which the then

<HEADLINE> Rain Helps Contain Southern US Wildfire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Firefighters in northern New
Mexico got unexpected help as rain fell in the Sangre de Cristo
mountains, where a fire has charred more than 25,000 acres of land,
local authorities reported late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"At first we thought we were going to get dry lightning, but
it's real rain," Maria Garcia, a fire information officer, said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Just weeks after Los Alamos being devastated by the worst
wildfire in New Mexico's history, another fire broke out Monday,
sweeping 6,500 acres Tuesday and more than 25,000 acres till
Thursday. The blaze, being held along the Gallinas Canyon ridge,
is still threatening water supply for the town of Las Vegas, New
Mexico, which has 18,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
About 900 firefighters, including 23 so-called hotshot crews of
full-time wildfire specialists, were fighting the wildfire. Eight
air tankers and six helicopters continued to drop water and fire
retardant over the ponderosa and mixed-conifer forest, while
bulldozers cut 50-foot firebreaks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National Interagency Fire Center's Web site
indicated on Thursday that fires were also burning in Florida,
Arizona, California, Colorado and Utah. And fire officials warned
that most of the southern United States was at high risk for fires
because of hot, dry weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
More than 11 southern states remain at high risk for wildfire,
according to U.S. Forest Service officials, who said nearly 600,
000 acres of land had been consumed by wildfires in the region
since January, well above average.
</P>
<P>
"The areas suffering from the drought seem to be experiencing
the worst of it now," said Denny Truesdale, assistant director for
fire management at the U.S. Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
Truesdale warned that northern states were also at risk for
wildfires as the summer months arrive.
</P>
<P>
"You could certainly get fires moving north throughout the
United States up towards the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific
Northwest as the season progresses," he said in an interview
Thursday.

<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Major newspapers here Friday
described the China visit by Kim Jong Il, leader of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), as "fruitful and satisfactory.
"
</P>
<P>
Reports given prominence in Rodong Sinmun and Minju Choson said
Kim's May 29-31 visit to China was historic and would help fortify
the friendship between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The visit came ahead of a planned historic June 12-14 summit
between Kim and his South Korean counterpart, Kim Dae-jung, in
Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
The papers said that in a friendly atmosphere, leaders of the
two countries briefed each other on the achievements made by their
respective nations and parties in socialist construction.
</P>
<P>
They exchanged views in a sincere manner on international
issues concerned and further consolidation and development of the
traditional DPRK-Sino friendship.
</P>
<P>
The leaders noted that the long-lasting friendship between the
DPRK and China was built and fostered by the last generation of
leaders of both nations.
</P>
<P>
"Strengthening such relations at the turn of the century when
the world situation is complicated and volatile conforms to the
aspirations and interests of the two peoples and is conducive to
peace in the Asian-Pacific region and the world at large," the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that the DPRK supported the five points in the
proposal put forward by Chinese President Jiang Zemin during their
talks on further developing DPRK-Sino friendship and extended
appreciation for the brotherly aid China has offered it.
</P>
<P>
The papers also reported Kim's satisfaction at his visit.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Industrial Base Promotes Clean Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Province, a heavy
industrial base located in northeast China, is actively promoting
clean production as a means to check pollution at its point of
origin.
</P>
<P>
Already involved in cleaning up their production are 200 local
enterprises mainly located in heavy industrial cities such as
Shenyang, Anshan and Fushun, according to a provincial official in
charge of environmental protection in Liaoning.
</P>
<P>
The province started to enforce clean production in 1995, when
the provincial bureau of environmental protection and the State
Economic and Trade Commission jointly launched a production
project characterized by low consumption, low pollution and high
return.
</P>
<P>
Ten enterprises were selected for the experiment, which helped
generate economic returns of 34 million yuan during the first year
while saving 3.9 million tons of water and reducing exhaust
emission by 7.7 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
To popularize the practice, the provincial government has
mandated that local governments use more than ten percent of the
charges collected from local enterprises for generating pollution
to enforce clean production, and set up a clean production center
providing technical support and information in the area.
</P>
<P>
The clean production endeavor received a good boost when the
province launched an ambitious environmental protection project in
late 1999, with 37 million euros of funding from European Union.
Of the total, 13.1 million euros will be used on clean production.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Xinliang, deputy governor of Liaoning, said the provincial
government will continue to guide more enterprises to engage in
clean production in the future.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A grand photos and pictures
exhibition in celebration of the golden jubilee of diplomatic
relations between China and Myanmar opened at the City Hall here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony of the exhibition, jointly sponsored by
the Chinese embassy and the Myanmar Information Ministry, was
attended by Chinese ambassador Liang Dong, third secretary of the
Myanmar State Peace and Development Council Lieutenant-General Win
Myint, foreign minister U Win Aung and four other ministers.
</P>
<P>
Present on the occasion were also foreign diplomats in Myanmar
as well as representatives of Myanmar-Chinese and Chinese
residents in the country.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition displays 150 sheets of photos which cover three
contents -- exchange of visits by the two countries' leaders,
economic cooperation and social and cultural relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Chinese ambassador Liang Dong
said China and Myanmar are good neighbors linked by common
mountains and rivers, adding that the pauk-phau (fraternal)
friendship between the two countries can be traced back long in
history.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Myanmar is among the countries that first
established diplomatic relations with China and the first one that
signed the boundary treaty with China.
</P>
<P>
"Our two countries jointly advocated the Five Principles of
Peaceful Co-existence in the international community, and
maintained close cooperation and mutual support in many
international affairs," he recalled, adding that the exchange and
cooperation between the two countries in various fields were also
steadily developed and strengthened.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the display of true portrayals of
friendly exchanges between the two countries and peoples will be
conducive to the broadening of the knowledge about the history of
friendly exchanges between the two countries, to the strengthening
of mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples and
to the further consolidation of confidence in building the Sino-
Myanmar friendly cooperative relations of good neighborliness and
mutual trust into the new century.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, Myanmar foreign minister U Win Aung said a new
chapter has been opened in the history of bilateral relations
between Myanmar and China since the two countries established
diplomatic relations fifty years ago and the bilateral relations
are always characterized by mutual friendship and understanding.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Myanmar and China were able to establish kinsfolk-
like relations between the two countries for being immediate
neighbors sharing a long common border and having close affinities
in culture, traditions and custom.
</P>
<P>
He appraised that the successful demarcation of the over 2,000-
kilometer-long boundary between the two countries was an important
milestone in the annals of the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He also said Myanmar and China together with India are proud of
being co-founders of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence
which are now regarded as important guiding principles in the
conduct of international relations.
</P>
<P>
He added that the exhibition witnesses how the leaders of the
two countries have relentlessly tried to maintain and further
strengthen the bilateral amicable ties to the mutual benefit of
the two countries and peoples.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will last for three days.
</P>
<P>
China and Myanmar established diplomatic relations on June 8,
1950.

<HEADLINE> Bhutan Buys More Time on Refugee Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Bhutanese government sent a
response Thursday to the Nepali Foreign Ministry stating that it
needed more time to discuss the differences relating to refugee
issues between the two countries, a foreign ministry source said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The Bhutanese government sent us a letter, which says it is
still discussing on the points raised by Nepal and will need some
more time," said Lilap Sharma, a Foreign Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
The 9th ministerial talks between Nepal and Bhutan held in
Thimpu, Bhutan on May 22-25 was inconclusive, as the Bhutanese
side asked for one-week's time to ponder over Nepal's proposals.
</P>
<P>
"The differences still persist on the modality of verification,
namely the Nepalese side insists on verification on family basis,
while the Bhutanese side wants it to be conducted one by one,"
said Sharma.
</P>
<P>
Despite the differences, the Nepali Foreign Ministry is hopeful
that the verification will begin within two months, as agreed at
the 9th ministerial talks, said Sharma.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts here believe that verification is not likely
to begin within two months due to Bhutan's indecision.
</P>
<P>
The verification will divide the 100,000 Bhutanese refugees
living in eastern Nepal into four categories: Bhutanese who were
evicted, Bhutanese who emigrated, Bhutanese with criminal record
and non-Bhutanese.
</P>
<P>
The categories will be the basis for repatriation of the
refugees who were evicted from Bhutan in 1990s.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Lower House Dissolved For General Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori
on Friday dissolved the House of Representatives for a general
election set on June 25 prior to a no-confidence motion against
his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The lower house was dissolved at the outset of a plenary
session from 1 p.m. (local time) Friday after Speaker Soichiro Ito
read out a dissolution rescript from Japanese Emperor Akihito,
which was signed by Mori, for the chamber's first election in
three years and eight months.
</P>
<P>
A no-confidence motion against Mori's cabinet was presented to
the plenary session, but the lower house was dissolved before
deliberations on the motion could begin.
</P>
<P>
Japan's four opposition parties, the Democratic Party of Japan
(DPJ), the Japanese Communist Party (JCP), the Liberal Party (LP)
and the Social Democratic Party (SDP), submitted the motion to the
lower house Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties accused Mori of violating the country's
constitution by his recent controversial remark that Japan is a
divine nation with the emperor at its center.
</P>
<P>
Mori's cabinet is expected to hold an extraordinary meeting to
formally fix the June 25 election date. A 12-day official campaign
period begins on June 13.
</P>
<P>
In the election, more than 1,200 candidates will vie for 480
seats in the lower chamber, following a February legislation to
reduce the number of proportional-representation seats by 20 from
this election.
</P>
<P>
The ruling coalition, consisting of the Liberal Democratic
Party (LDP), the New Komeito party and the New Conservative Party,
aims to win a comfortable majority and keep its grip on power.
</P>
<P>
The ruling coalition, which currently holds a combined 336
seats in the 500-seat lower house, needs 254 seats to hold at
least the same number as the opposition in all lower house
standing committees, while still chairing all of them.
</P>
<P>
The opposition bloc, meanwhile, plans to target its attack on
Mori's "divine nation" remark that sparked an uproar and dragged
down Mori's approval ratings.
</P>
<P>
It also plans to question the process of the transfer of power
to Mori after late Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was rushed to
hospital on April 2 due to a stroke.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Atomic Energy
Agency (Batan) is still keen to establish nuclear power plants in
the country, despite fears that earthquakes and volcanic eruptions
could lead to meltdown and radiation fallout, a national newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
It said that apart from nuclear energy, Batan is also
concentrating on the production of genetically modified foods, as
well as genetics technology to breed bigger and fatter livestock.
</P>
<P>
"Our main inventions in the field of genetics and plant
engineering have created excellent rice and corn seeds, as well as
soybeans, green beans, and phenomenal cattle breeding. All of this
is to be socialized among the public without any remuneration,"
Head of Batan, Iyos R Subki was quoted by the Indonesian Observer
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Batan, which is funded by the Research and Technology Ministry,
has a test nuclear reactor at Serpong, the country's West Java
province, which is powered by Uranium 238 (U-238).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Head of Research and Development of Batan, Wuryanto
said that Batan is also considering the feasibility of
constructing nuclear power plant in Indonesia and is paying strict
attention to safety procedures.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia's power plants could possibly be erected on
ships, which would make them mobile and able to provide energy to
various regions.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand (BOT) has told
Moody's Investor Service, a famous credit rating agency that Thai
financial institutions have recovered from the financial crisis
and they deserve a ratings upgrade, a report from the bank said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
BOT officials had reiterated to Moody's that Thai financial
institutions had secured sufficient funds as required by
regulators to cover loan-loss provisions and that they are capable
of expanding their business without the necessity to raise capital
until 2001, it said.
</P>
<P>
The officials, it said, also pointed out to the rating agency
that some Thai commercial banks had shown signs of improvement,
witnessed by first quarter reports of net earnings.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, without required provisions several more banks would
have posted net profits in the first quarter and that is a
positive signal," it added.
</P>
<P>
Lack of new lending, however, is now the only factor that
impedes the banks' growth, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Moody's rates Thailand with the grade of "Ba1",
which means low investment grade.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Etna Volcano Erupts Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Mount Etna, located on Italy's
Mediterranean island of Sicily, erupted briefly again Thursday
after its latest eruption on April 16, shooting up a black column
of ash, gas and steam about two kilometers into the air.
</P>
<P>
Smoke started to burst out of one of Mount Etna's southern
craters at about 9:00 a.m. local time and the black column could
be seen within a radius of dozens of kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The eruption, which ended half an hour later, send a large
amount of ash to the city of Catania at the foot of the mount,
affecting transportation in the city and sending residents
frequently sweeping streets and their gardens.
</P>
<P>
Lava streams flew along slopes of the volcano, but none of the
nearby villages were believed to be in danger.
</P>
<P>
The crater, which burst Thursday, was formed in 1971 and is the
youngest on Mount Etna. The 3.5-kilometer-high Etna, the largest
and most active volcano in Europe, has erupted frequently since
the beginning of this year and Thursday's eruption was the 59th, a
record high in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Seismologists, who monitor the volcano around-the-clock at an
observation post, said that such activities will not endanger
nearby towns.
</P>
<P>
During a 1992 eruption, lava streams temporarily endangered the
7,000 residents of Zefferana on Etna's lower slopes. But the grand
view of the volcano's eruption and picturesque woodland and
orchard on the mountain's slopes make the area a magnet for
tourists.

BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- China's economy will have a higher

would be marginally lower than the 8.1 percent in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
He explained that this is because agriculture production would
be lower in the second quarter than in the first quarter due to
seasonal factors.

<HEADLINE> Droughts will not Affect China's Grain Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The severe droughts that hit north
China this year will result in a reduction of agricultural output,
but will not affect the country's grain supply, Qiu Xiaohua,
deputy director of the National Bureau of Statistics said here
today.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that China has enough grain stocks
which can satisfy the country's consumer demand for at least a
year and half.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe, the price of some varieties of grain will go up in a
certain period of time, but we are more concerned with grain price
fall than price rise," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is a good thing if the grain price rebounds,
which will help raise the farmers' income and boost the country's
economic development.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, all Chinese farmers are expecting the grain price to
rebound," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, China has witnessed consecutive agricultural
harvests, which has led to an oversupply of agricultural products
and a continuous fall in their prices.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Cuts Growth Target for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A worsening peace and order
situation in Mindanao is taking its toll on the Philippine economy,
forcing the government to lower its overall economic growth target
for 2000,Business World said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Philippine Finance Secretary Jose Pardo as
saying that the government is now aiming at only a four percent
growth rate for the gross domestic product (GDP), instead of the
original five percent target.
</P>
<P>
"We are standing pat at 4 percent, and 5 percent will be
elusive.Whereas before, it was within reach we had to temper it,"
said Pardo,stressing that "the lower end is what we are looking at
due to the Mindanao problem."
</P>
<P>
According to Pardo, the lowered economic target was discussed
on Wednesday by the Economic Coordination Council in the
Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
The government was originally targeting the GDP to grow by four
percent to five percent. The gross national product (GNP), or GDP
plus the income from foreign sources, is forecast to grow by 4.5
percent to 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
While the government has yet to determine the economic impact
of the conflict in Mindanao, Pardo admitted it would put a dent of
the state's expenditure program.
</P>
<P>
But the Finance chief said it is still committed to a 62.5-
billion-peso (1.56 billion U.S. dollars) budget gap despite the
higher expenditures in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Pardo said the government has come up with belt-tightening
measures to cushion the impact of the Mindanao conflict on the
budget.
</P>
<P>
Since April this year, the heavy fighting between government
troops and Moro Islamic Liberation Front rebels has cost hundreds
of lives on the two sides. The battle also forced more than 200,
000 people to flee their homes.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Unrest Blamed on Soeharto Supporters: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Defense Minister Juwono
Sudarsono said he believed supporters of former president Soeharto
were behind the series of riots and disturbances plaguing the
country recently.
</P>
<P>
He said supporters of Soeharto were stirring up violence to try
to shake the government of President Abdurrahman Wahid.
</P>
<P>
"These incidents were to anger and confuse Gus Dur (as the
president is known), but Gus Dur will remain strong and has said
he will fight all such attempts," Sudarsono was quoted by national
newspapers Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he thought followers of Soeharto were behind the
attacks, Sudarsono said: "Yes, and based on the information which
I have received from military intelligence sources, these people
are in Jakarta."
</P>
<P>
At least 47 people were injured on Sunday when a bomb exploded
in a church in Medan, some 1,425 kilometers northwest of Jakarta.
Bombs were also found at two other churches.
</P>
<P>
Violence in North Maluku has flared up again with dozens killed
in attacks on mostly Christian villages on the remote island of
Halmahera, about 2,800 kilometers northeast of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a grenade exploded in Ambon, capital of Maluku,
killing two people. The incident has caused tensions to rise again
in the battle-torn province, which has been hit by religious
conflicts for over 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Tension in North Maluku and Maluku has been fanned by the
arrival of more than 2,000 hard-line Muslim volunteers from a
group which has vowed a jihad (holy war) in the region.
</P>
<P>
Sudarsono said he had information that followers of Soeharto
were helping fund the jihad fighters.
</P>
<P>
The 78-year-old Soeharto is under house arrest and Attorney
General Marzuki Darusman said he expects to bring a corruption
case against the former ruler by August.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was pushed from power in May 1998 amid mass social
unrest and economic chaos.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Decides to Dissolve Lower House For Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori
and his cabinet decided Friday morning to dissolve the House of
Representatives in the afternoon for a general election on June 25.
</P>
<P>
The dissolution is expected to take place during a plenary
session this afternoon, Japanese government officials said.
</P>
<P>
A no-confidence motion against Mori's cabinet will be presented
to the plenary session, but the dissolution rescript is expected
to be handed to lower house Speaker Soichiro Ito before the motion
is discussed, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's four opposition parties, the Democratic Party of Japan,
the Japanese Communist Party, the Liberal Party and the Social
Democratic Party, submitted the motion to the lower house
Wednesday after the opposition-proposed censure motion against
Mori's cabinet was voted down by the ruling coalition at the House
of Councilors.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties accused Mori of violating the
constitution by saying that Japan is a divine nation where the
emperor was at the center.
</P>
<P>
Once the lower chamber is dissolved, the Japanese cabinet will
meet again to fix the June 25 election date to follow a 12-day
official campaign period beginning on June 13.
</P>
<P>
In the election, more than 1,200 candidates will vie for 480
seats in the lower chamber, following a February legislation to
reduce the number of proportional-representation seats by 20 from
this election.
</P>
<P>
The ruling coalition, consisting of the Liberal Democratic
Party, the New Komeito party and the New Conservative Party, aims
to win a comfortable majority and keep its grip on power.
</P>
<P>
The ruling coalition, which currently holds a combined 336
seats in the 500-seat lower house, needs 254 seats to hold at
least the same number as the opposition in all lower house
standing committees, while still chairing all of them.
</P>
<P>
The opposition bloc, meanwhile, plans to target its attack on
Mori's "divine nation" remark that sparked an uproar and dragged
down Mori's support ratings.
</P>
<P>
It also plans to question the process of the transfer of power
to Mori after his predecessor Keizo Obuchi was rushed to hospital
on April 2 due to a stroke.

<HEADLINE> Increased Fiscal Support Lifts 2.85 Million Out of Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Increased fiscal support to the
poor population in central China's Henan Province has lifted 2.85
million poverty-stricken people out of poverty during the past
five years.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the number of people under poverty line in the 34
poverty-stricken counties in Henan had been reduced to 1.25
million by the end of 1999 from the 4.1 million in 1994. And the
average per capita income of rural residents in the area had risen
to 1,466 yuan from the 501 yuan in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The main reason behind the improving picture is the intensified
poverty-reduction financial support by the government as a result
of the implementation of a national program designed to basically
eliminate poverty by the year 2000. A total of 1.7 billion yuan
has been injected into the poor areas in such forms as subsidies
and poverty-reduction funds to alleviate poverty and facilitate
development during the five-year period.
</P>
<P>
Preferential fiscal policies were also adopted to support the
34 poverty-stricken counties in Henan, including allocation of
special poverty-reduction and development funds and fiscal
subsidies, tax breaks, and exemption of some taxes.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels have also focused on upgrading the
infrastructure in poor areas as so to make full use of the fiscal
funds for poverty-reduction. A total of 340 million yuan were
invested in rural infrastructure in poor areas in 1998 and 1999
alone, renovating 24 small-size reservoirs, completing 1090 water
control projects and 1229 water supply projects, building 1,204
kilometers of highways and 27 hydroelectric power stations, and
erecting 2,744 kilometers of electricity-transmission lines.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia to Expand Organic Farming, Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, June 2 (Xinhua) -- North China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region has decided to develop organic farming and
tourism to make optimal use of its natural resources and protect
the environment.
</P>
<P>
The regional government recently issued a circular, calling on
all local governments to nurture the two sectors as new growth
factors in their economies and a means to better protect the
environment. The region aims to have 800,000 ha of farmland for
organic food production by the year 2005, to account for one third
of its food output.
</P>
<P>
The region will strive to make rational use of underground
water, reduce the use of plastic film, pesticides and chemical
fertilizer, and control industrial pollution, according to the
circular.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia, with 1.183 million sq km of land, has the
largest grassland and forest resources among all provincial
administrations in China, which amount to 87 million hectares and
32 million hectares, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia is known for its animal husbandry, but excessive
grazing over the years has resulted in deterioration of the
environment. The regional government therefore decided that animal
farming should be kept at a rational scale, while diversified
undertakings should be developed to improve its economic structure.
</P>
<P>
Since the region initiated a project to develop the organic
food industry in 1992, a total of 78 such businesses have emerged,
making over 170 kinds of organic food products including mutton,
beef, milk, processed edible herb, according to the latest
statistics from the organic food development center in Inner
Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia also plans to invest more than 50 million yuan
to upgrade the tourism facilities in two of its major grasslands
Holonbuyr and Xilin Gol to develop them into major tourist
attractions in the region.
</P>
<P>
A tourism development fund is also expected to be established
in the region to provide support for the tourism sector.

<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- High-technology companies started
by college students are faring quite differently in their foray
into the business world, according to today's China's Daily.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Fanso, an Internet company started by
students of the Beijing-based Qinghua University, is growing
rapidly. It launched a website on Chinese literature recently.
</P>
<P>
Another Qinghua-based student company, Syntech Cooperation Ltd.
which develops projection TV systems, is also doing well after
receiving 3.7 million U.S. dollars venture capital from a Chinese
company.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Yahu Networks is not enjoying the same success as the
other student companies. Started by Wang Rucong, a computer whiz
from Sichuan University in southwest China, the company is
suffering from a serious lack of capital.
</P>
<P>
"We simply couldn't find venture capital investors interested
in Internet industry," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
After local media reported Yahu's financial problems, several
investors contacted Wang, but no deal has been reached so far.
</P>
<P>
The different fates of the student businesses might be
contributed to the location of the businesses and the policies
adopted by their respective universities, the report said.

<HEADLINE> President Wahid Officiates Aceh Cease-fire Amid Explosions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid officiated the cease-fire between the Indonesian Military (
TNI) and the Free Aceh Movement (GAM), just hours after a dozen
explosions rocked Aceh on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a televised address on Thursday night, the president said
the humanitarian pause accord would be "the beginning of a new era
of peace" for the people of Aceh after decades of civil strife.
</P>
<P>
"I believe there will be peace in Aceh and peace will bring
prosperity to the region," the president was quoted by the
Indonesian Observer Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wahid promised greater autonomy for Aceh, a province with
special autonomous status in northwestern Sumatra, but ruled out
rebel demands for full independence.
</P>
<P>
He said that Aceh's people would enjoy "a good future and
prosperity" by remaining part of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The president delivered the speech to welcome the
implementation of the humanitarian pause accord starting June 2.
The three-month accord was signed in Geneva, Switzerland, on May
12.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the accord, a joint panel of rebel leaders,
government officials and independent Swiss mediators will oversee
the deal in Aceh. It would regularly report to another "joint
forum" based in Switzerland, which is the highest decision-making
body. The goal would be to extend the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, home-made bomb explosions
and gunfire rocked the provincial capital of Banda Aceh and Aceh
Besar district, about 60 kilometers south of Banda Aceh. The
powerful explosions and gunfire, which started at 11 p.m. local
time on Wednesday and lasted until 03:00 a.m. on Thursday, had
made the people afraid to carry out their daily activities.
</P>
<P>
The Antara News Agency quoted a source as saying that after the
huge explosions, people continued to hear gunfire for almost 60
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Aceh Besar police chief Lt. Col. Sayed Husaini admitted that
the explosions had shaken Banda Aceh city and its surroundings.
</P>
<P>
"Security officers have checked several locations where the
explosions occurred. But no casualties or material damage were
found," Husaini was quoted by Antara as saying.
</P>
<P>
Local residents expressed hope that Thursday's happening would
be the last instance of violence prior to the implementation of
the accord.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the incident will be the last to happen. We want to
live in peace. We hope the conflicts can be ended immediately," a
young woman told Antara.
</P>
<P>
Violence between government security forces and armed GAM
rebels killed more than 400 persons this year. Twenty-three of the
fatalities occurred after the signing of the accord.

<HEADLINE> More U.S. Small Businesses Going Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Several surveys released this
week by U.S. market research firms have found small business
owners in the United States are increasingly taking their
businesses online and purchasing online.
</P>
<P>
An annual survey conducted by Dun &AMP; Bradstreet (D&AMP;B) in
February and March of 2000 found that 40 percent of the small
businesses have their own Web sites, up from just over a quarter
last year, and that 70 percent now have Internet access.
</P>
<P>
The survey found 38 percent of the U.S. small companies with
Web sites transacted business with customers over their sites. On
average, 8 percent of 1999 revenues came from their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
D&AMP;B also found a notable change in the way small businesses use
the Internet. The top use of the Internet among small businesses
is e-mail, with 71 percent of them saying so. Forty-three percent
said they used the Web for purchasing goods and services for the
business. Use of the Internet for research at work dropped, from
71 percent in 1998 to 58 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Small businesses owned by women were more likely to have
Internet access than their male-owned counterparts, the survey
found. They were also more likely to conduct research and to
purchase goods and services on the Web.
</P>
<P>
A survey by PSI Global found small businesses of all sizes have
quickly embraced the Internet as a new information channel. Two-
thirds of U.S. small businesses are online, and 30 percent of them
have a Web site, according to the PSI survey of 876 businesses
with annual sales ranging from half a million dollars to 10
million dollars. Eight percent of the businesses have been selling
online for about a year and predict that 15 percent of their
revenue in the year 2000 will come from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The study also found that 19 percent of small businesses use
the Internet as a communications channel for introducing products
and services to potential customers.
</P>
<P>
The third survey of more than 1,000 small firms conducted by
International Data Corporation (IDC) found e-commerce is the wave
of the future for small businesses.
</P>
<P>
According to IDC's research, the number of U.S. small
businesses engaged in e-commerce will increase from 400,000 in
1998 to nearly 2.8 million in 2003. Overall, most small businesses
have annual revenues less than 5 million dollars, but the average
annual revenues of companies that regard the Internet as important
are significantly higher than those that rate it less important.
Of 7.5 million small businesses, 11 percent were engaged in e-
commerce activity in 1999, IDC said.

<HEADLINE> Holyfield-Ruiz WBA Title Fight Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 1 (Xinhua) The fight on June 10 between
Evander Holyfield and John Ruiz for the heavyweight title have
been postponed because of a training injury to Holyfield, the
World Boxing Association heavyweight said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Holyfield suffered a rib injury during workouts in Houston. He
was set to try and become a world champion for the fourth time
here at Caesar's Palace by claiming the piece of the world crown
stripped from Britain's Lennox Lewis.
</P>
<P>
Holyfield, 37, has a 36-4 record with one draw, that a
controversial outcome against Lewis in New York in March of last
year that enabled him to keep his crowns until Lewis took them
with a unanimous decision in Las Vegas last November.
</P>
<P>
Promoter Don King had been trying to stage this bout since he
went to court in New York and had Lewis stripped of the WBA crown
for facing Grant instead of Ruiz, the dubious top-rated contender
of the WBA and one of three King fighters the WBA had ranked as
its top challengers.

<HEADLINE> Subtropical Golden Monkey Bred In NE China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A couple of golden monkeys have
produced babies three times in the Harbin Zoo, northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province, since they arrived here in 1992.
</P>
<P>
This couple of golden monkeys, a kind of subtropical animal,
had their first baby in Harbin in 1995, which is also the first
time that golden monkeys have babies in cool temperate zone.
</P>
<P>
What surprises people most is that both of the golden monkeys
are in their old age, the husband is 17 years old and the wife 19.
The natural life expectancy for golden monkey ranges from 18 to 22
years old.
</P>
<P>
Such golden-coated monkey mainly live in the subtropical area
in southwest China, and is a typical wild animal to the country.
This animal is under state first-grade protection because of its
very small number.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the zoo said considering the fact that the golden
monkeys love to rest on trees and are fear of contacting human
beings, workers in the zoo build special houses, as high as seven
meters above the ground level, for them, so that they can avoid
mis-birth caused by dread.
</P>
<P>
Workers also choose September and October as the time for
golden monkeys to cohabit and get pregnant, thus preventing them
from giving births in severe winter.
</P>
<P>
Workers also feed them with nutritious foods such as peanut,
eggs and Chinese dates and moderate Chinese medicines during their
pregnant period to help golden monkeys improve immunity in cold
environment.

<HEADLINE> More Overseas Tourists Flock to Guangxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A total of 333,000 overseas
tourists visited south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region
from January to April this year.
</P>
<P>
The number of overseas arrivals went up by 77.5 percent from
the same period last year, a record high, said local sources.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is bounded by Yunnan Province
on the west, Guizhou on the north, Hunan on the northeast, and
Guangdong on the southeast, and by Vietnam and the Beibu Bay on
the southwest.
</P>
<P>
With an area of 236,661 square kilometers, Guangxi is unique in
China that is located along coast, border and big rivers. Guangxi
is also a place where many of China's ethnic groups such as Zhuang,
Miao, Yao, Maonan, Gin live.
</P>
<P>
The predominance of limestone gives many parts of Guangxi a
spectacular type of landscape, known to geographers as "karst", in
which pinnacles and spires, caves and caverns, sinkholes, and
subterranean streams abound. Picturesque rocky hills, spires of
grotesque proportions, strangely shaped caves, and all manner of
stalactites and stalagmites can be seen in many parts of this
region.
</P>
<P>
Among them, the most famous is Guilin City, which has a history
of more than 2,000 years and is renowned for its green mountains,
clear water and strangely-shaped stone formations.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Fenglan, vice chairman of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Regional Government, pledged that they would make greater efforts,
including intensified promotion campaigns and construction of
infrastructure, to explore rich tourism resources in Guangxi's
countryside and attract more tourists to those places.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Develop Land Along Expressways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Development of land resources
along an expressway in Panshan County in northeast China's
Liaoning Province has proved successful, and the province is to
extend the practice to other areas.
</P>
<P>
In Panshan, local people develop aquatic breeding by using the
pits left over during the construction of the road, which in turn
gives rise to other growing businesses and processing of farm
products.
</P>
<P>
With initial success in Panshan county, the province has
decided to launch a similar project along one of its major
expressways, allocating 18,000 sq km of land for modern farming.
</P>
<P>
So far, Panshan has built 88 experimental ponds, planted 200,
000 trees, and developed 66.7 hectares of aquatic breeding area
along the expressway running through the county. The undertakings
generate 1.65 million yuan in revenue annually.
</P>
<P>
Further off the road, an experimental high-yield farming belt
has been demarcated, and a rice breeding center and a large
wholesale market of aquatic products have also been established.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder, Clinton Open "Modern Government" Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
and visiting U.S. President Bill Clinton began a meeting here
Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
With middle-left government heads from 12 other states, the
two were trying to draw up a blueprint for "good governance" in
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Over a dinner Friday evening in the Charllottenburg palace,
Berlin, the leaders began talks about the modernization of social
welfare system, and the new missions of the government in
globalization.
</P>
<P>
Presidents from Argentina, Brasilia, Chile, and South Africa --
Fernando de la Rua, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Ricardo Lagos
Escobar, and Thabo Mbeki -- participated in the conference.
</P>
<P>
Also attending the meeting were the government chiefs of
Canada, France, Greece, Italy, New Zealand, the Netherlands,
Portugal and Sweden: Jean Cretien, Lionel Jospin, Costas Simitis,
Giuliano Amato, Helen Clark, Wim Kok, Antonio Guterres and Goran
Persson.
</P>
<P>
The conference followed "the third-way summit" last year in
Florence, Italy.
</P>
<P>
A draft declaration said the leaders would agree on the
government's role in stabilizing financial markets and necessary
measures to keep social justice in the globalization.
</P>
<P>
The draft also said the Internet-led New Economy would bring
the world "unprecedented wealth." A final statement is due to be
published Saturday after their formal talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 200 scientists and government advisors from
the 14 countries held another meeting in so-called "working groups.
"
</P>
<P>
Invited by Schroeder, the experts were trying to find ideas
for leaders on the social system, education, the Internet and the
New Economy.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said they had agreed on the key of education in the
21st century and called for a radical liberalization of the
education system.
</P>
<P>
"In the future we will distinguish people as those well-
educated and bad-educated," said Georges Charpak, a 1992 Nobel
Physical Prize laureate who led a working group.

<HEADLINE> Panama Canal Authority Evaluates Cost of Improvements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is what ACP general secretary Leon Gonzalez said Friday
here, stating that a third set of floodgates could be an alternate
solution to the widening of the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez also said that the cost could amount to four billion
dollars if the construction of bridges, a hydroelectric plant, and
the concession are taken into account.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the third set of floodgates, said Gonzalez, exceeds
the
financial capability of Panama, so this must be managed at the
level of the international society as a project of international
infrastructure for the world economic development.
</P>
<P>
An office of studies of Capacity of the Canal had been created
previously, where diverse projects of expansion of the waterway
have been analyzed during two years, said Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
The number of high sea commercial ships that traverse now the
Canal every year is some 13,000 or more, an average of 35 transits
a day.
</P>
<P>
The average time of transit of the ships through the
interoceanic waterway during the same period is of more than 30
hours.
</P>
<P>
This means that the present situation of the Canal is in the
brink of saturation, because of the growing demand for the
waterway services and the increase of international trade.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Oil Closes Week at 27.13 Dlrs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The price of Venezuelan oil closed
the week at 27.13 U.S. dollars per barrel, 0.68 dollars above last
week's price, said the Mines and Energy Ministry (MEM) Friday.
</P>
<P>
The average price for the first five months of this year is 24.
86 dollars per barrel, a figure that leaves far behind the 16.07
dollars of 1999 and the 10.57 dollars of 1998, when the oil barrel
quotation collapsed.
</P>
<P>
The median for the price of the barrel of oil for the first
quarter of 2000 was 25.40 dollars, a figure that, according to the
experts, should drop slightly in the second quarter as a result of
the decision of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC), of which Venezuela is one of its founding members, to
increase production to reduce its high price.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC decided to control the prices through increases of
cuts in the production in such a manner that they will fluctuate
within an upper band of 28 dollars and a lower one of 22 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Oil contributes 70 percent of the hard currency for Venezuela
and about 50 percent of the income for the national budget.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Coming Nigeria's Petroleum Price Rise Evokes Mixed Response </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Song Li
</P>
<P>
LAGOS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government's decision to
rise by 50 percent to 30 naira per liter of petroleum has met with
mixed reactions in Africa's largest oil producing country.
</P>
<P>
After hearing the news announced by the state-owned Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) on Thursday, motorists in
Lagos, the largest city in the country, rushed to local petroleum
filling stations to buy petroleum at the original price of 20
naira (one U.S. dollar equivalent to 100 naira) per liter, which
had remained unchanged since December 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the decision, which was approved by President
Olusegun Obasanjo, a liter of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) now goes
up for 30 naira and may see further rising-ups in the future.
</P>
<P>
People in the business sector generally welcomed the move
despite the costs added to their operation.
</P>
<P>
"This is an achievement in a democratic government. It is
commendable. What military governments were afraid to do, a
democratic government has been able to do it," said Abba Gana,
president of the Major Marketers Association of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He said price increase is the only option to avoid sinking huge
amounts of money into subsidizing fuel products imported into the
country.
</P>
<P>
According to NNPC group manager Gaius Obaseki, the corporation
spent 19. 4 billion naira (194 million U.S. dollars) in
maintaining low petroleum product price only in the first three
months of this year, and could spend even more in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The latest increases notwithstanding, the corporation would
still not be able to recover its production cost, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, local sources told Xinhua that the decision instantly
led to an increase of over 100 percent in transport fares in many
parts of the country and invited violent criticisms from the
Nigeria Labor Congress, which even threatened a resistance to the
hike.
</P>
<P>
The Petroleum Committee of the House of Representatives also
"regretted" the decision, saying it would further lower the life
quality of the country's huge population living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
For the poor, the price hike seems a rather unpopular policy at
the time being, especially when the country's poor has yet to see
the economic benefits promised by the first civil administration
after more than a decade of military misrule.
</P>
<P>
"The newly adopted 5,500 naira (55 dollars) minimum wage (up
from a former 3,000 naira), which we had just finished cheering
for, is largely put on sales due to the price hike," a Lagos
resident complained in an interview.
</P>
<P>
His words further illustrated the dilemma the Obasanjo
administration is involved in: to raise the living standard of the
people and to cure the ailing economy at the same time -- but the
problem is that the two are often at odds.
</P>
<P>
Since its inauguration last May, the Obasanjo administration
has repeatedly vowed to deregulate the petroleum industry with a
final aim to allow marketers to set the prices to a level which
will make their operation profitable.
</P>
<P>
The wide-spread non-profitability in the country's economy,
which might be tolerated when the country was rich in the 1970s
and early 1980s, seemed to have run into a dead end after the
mid-1980s when the country's income dwindled largely due to the
mismanagement of corruptive military leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Obasanjo administration needs to free large sums of money
from subsidization to materialize its campaign promises: to free
the economy from total reliance upon the oil sector, achieve
universal education and mend dilapidating infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government also wants to use the price hike to
fight ramping smuggling of the comparable cheap petroleum products
from the country to its neighbors and avoid heavy losses for the
country.

ADDIS ABABA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia said Friday that the
port of Djibouti is capable of handling the relief good destined
for Ethiopian drought victims.
</P>
<P>
The port now unloads 4,700 tons of relief items daily, Tadese
Bekele, senior official of the Disaster Prevention and
Preparedness Commission (DPPC) said at the weekly press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has refused to use Eritrean port of Assab for handling
relief aid as requested by foreign donors and international aid
agencies.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the delivery of food aid from
central warehouses to the distribution centers is also going
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
About 3,200 tons of goods are distributed every day to various
 locations throughout Ethiopia from the central warehouses in
Makale, Kombolcha, Nazreth and Dire Dawa, Belete said
</P>
<P>
More than eight million Ethiopians were reportedly facing with
starvation following long spells of drought. About 800,000 tons of
food are required to feed them.

<HEADLINE> UN Probes Human Rights Abuses in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The UN mission in Sierra Leone has
launched an investigation into human rights abuses by the
country's fighting parties, an official of the mission said Friday
in the country's capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here quoted Richard Bernett, head of the
mission's human rights section as saying that the probe is
intended to get a " complete picture" of the human rights
situation in the war- torn west African nation.
</P>
<P>
He said human rights investigations have been undertaken in
places in the country like Freetown, Waterloo, Masiaka, Port Loko,
Lungi, Bo and Rogbere junction for over three weeks.
</P>
<P>
However, Bernett said that access to other areas outside
Freetown has been limited since the recent outbreak of
hostilities.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the current fighting there are reports of
civilians being subjected to forced labor, abduction, rape, and
physical harassment.
</P>
<P>
Fear of gross human rights violations has caused thousands of
civilians to flee from areas controlled or attacked by the
Revolutionary United Front rebels, deteriorating the humanitarian
problems.
</P>
<P>
Bernett said the UN mission was concerned about the situation
of the war prisoners, thousands of abducted civilians, taken over
in recent years by the rebels, and that of the rebel child
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
He added that the mission has also received reports indicating
that government and its allied forces have been responsible for
extra-judicial executions, arbitrary detention and beatings.
</P>
<P>
The allied forces of the Sierra Leone army include the Civil
Defence Force, known as 'Kamajors' and members of the ousted
military junta headed by Johnny Koroma, under the banner of the
Armed Forces Revolutionary Council.
</P>
<P>
Bennett said reports from the investigations would be forwarded
to the UN Secretary General's special representative in Sierra
Leone and to the UN High Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Energy Industry to Face Personnel Crunch, Says Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 2 (Xinhua) -- More than one million employees
have been shed by the largest 25 U.S. oil companies since 1982 as
a result of consolidation, divestiture and downsizing, according
to a new study released this week.
</P>
<P>
This frenzy could leave the industry critically short of
skilled professionals, according to the comprehensive study of U.S.
oil industry employment by John S. Herold, Inc., a U.S. research
and consulting firm exclusively on the petroleum industry.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 25 years of strong economic expansion that have
witnessed the creation of a net 20 million new jobs in the United
States, Herold said that large energy companies eliminated nearly
one-third of the workforce that existed in 1974. From the peak of
1.65 million employees of the top public oils in 1982, the 1999
employee count of roughly 640,000 workers is down 61 percent.
</P>
<P>
On average, the largest oil companies have shed an astonishing
5.2 percent of their workforce every year for the past dozen years.
The 10 largest oil companies again axed more than 38,000 workers
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Herold's analysis confirmed that downsizing can generate
positive results for the large oils, as evidenced by average
growth in pre-tax cash flow per employee of five percent over the
past five years.
</P>
<P>
"With crude oil and natural gas pricing and demand fundamentals
extremely solid today, energy sector employment should be
expanding," said the firm. "However, personnel reduction programs
instituted during the oil price meltdown of 1998-1999 and
resulting from consolidation among the large oils continue to '
downsizing momentum' that is inconsistent with today's upbeat
energy market."
</P>
<P>
Employment in the oil and natural gas sector is projected to
decline six percent between 1998 and 2008.
</P>
<P>
Herold found that energy industry distress, coupled with the
inability to attract young talent, have contributed to a
pronounced "graying of the energy workforce" from the drilling rig
to the boardroom. More than 65 percent of workers in the oil and
gas industry are between 35 and 54.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, recent trends suggest that a personnel shortage in
oilfield service is already becoming evident, Herold said. The
dearth of experienced personnel is much more of an issue today
than equipment availability.
</P>
<P>
Herold said that the oil industry may have a difficult time
overcoming its tarnished image. At best, the firm said, the energy
industry is tarred with being a mature, low-growth, "old economy"
sector, making it unattractive to bright new talent. At worse,
energy companies can be charged with brutal and short-sighted
treatment of their people.

<HEADLINE> Luxembourg Police Criticized for Ruse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Luxembourg police were criticized
Friday for posing as television camera crew to lure and shot a
gunman holding more than two dozen children hostage.
</P>
<P>
The Brussels-based International Federation of Journalists, the
world's largest journalists' organization, chided Luxembourg
police for posing as journalists to lure the 39-year-old gunman
into an ambush and ending a hostage crisis at a day-care center at
Wasserbillig bordering Germany.
</P>
<P>
The federation asked for an investigation into the police
tactics.
</P>
<P>
When the gunman, said to have a history of mental problems,
emerged for an "interview" late Thursday holding a child in one
arm and a hand grenade in the other, police shot him twice in the
head to overwhelm him.
</P>
<P>
The police ambush ended the 28-hour hostage crisis that started
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Aidan White, general secretary of the International Federation
of Journalists, said in a written statement that the police
tactics were disturbing in that television cameramen are always
potential targets when filming in dangerous situations.
</P>
<P>
"Incidents like this may put them even more at risk from
trigger-happy criminals," the general secretary said.
</P>
<P>
Hostage-taker Neji Bejaoui, an unemployed Tunisian immigrant,
walked into the Wasserbillig nursery school with a pistol, a hand
grenade and a knife and took 49 children and three teachers
hostage.
</P>
<P>
Bejaoui was recovering from his injuries Friday after surgery
and police said that his wounds were no longer life threatening.
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said that police
were forced to act when the gunman demanded fleeing in a car with
three children.

caused almost 1,000 victims, cut roads, isolated communities,
paralyzed work in the mines and closed two border ports.
</P>
<P>
The uninterrupted rains started Thursday night and continued
until Friday morning. The bad weather front left 540 victims in
the last hours just in Antofagasta because of the state of the
roofs of their houses.
</P>
<P>
Emergencies regional director Hernan Flores said Friday that
the rains caused collapses on the road that links Calama with San
Pedro de Atacama, and that the traffic in that route is
interrupted.
</P>
<P>
The great amount of snow that fell on the northern mountain
range forced the authorities to close the Jama and Sico border
ports.
</P>
<P>
The strong rain, hailstorms, fog, and strong wind forced the
suspension of scientific work in the most powerful astronomical
observatory of the world, located 2,632 meters above sea level in
the Paranal Mountain. The domes were closed to prevent damage to
the giant mirrors.
</P>
<P>
The main mining firms of the zone decided to stop some of the
operations for safety sake.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Rise In Second Consecutive Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks rose strongly
in the second consecutive session Friday as additional signs
showed a slowdown in the pace of U.S. economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 142.56 or 1.3
percent at 10,794.76, extending its gain of 129.87 points Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The technology heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 230.88 or 6.4
percent at 3,813.38. The composite ended the week with a gain of
608.27 points or 18.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor'
s 500 index rose 28.45 at 1,477.26.
</P>
<P>
Stocks rose after the Labor Department reported that the
unemployment rate climbed back to 4.1 percent in May from a 30-
year low of 3.9 percent in April. American businesses cut 116,000
jobs in the month under pressure of interest rate hikes.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department also said average hourly earnings for
labor force rose just 0.1 percent in May, a sharp decline from a 0.
4 percent increase in April.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the report on weak jobs and lower earnings, the
Commerce Department reported that orders to American factories
fell by 4.3 percent in April, the biggest decline since November
1990.
</P>
<P>
The two separate reports showed additional signs that the
tightening monetary policy by the Federal Reserve is working. The
Federal Reserve has raised interest rate six times since last June
in an effort to cool off the U.S. economy and keep inflation at
bay.
</P>
<P>
Wall Street analysts believe that the slowdown in the economy
would lead the Federal Reserve to end the tightening cycle after
one more rate hike or two. The optimism encouraged investors to
move in the market to pick up stocks they had abandoned amid fears
of rising rates.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 8.23 at 659.69 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 10.97 at 923.32. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 20.57 at 513.03.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-2 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 2,218 up, 854 down and 349
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 1.15 billion shares from 951.19
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Researcher Backs Lockerbie Prosecution Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAMP ZEIST, the Netherlands, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A British
researcher Friday backed the prosecution's case against two
Libyans by testifying that the bomb that brought down Pan Am
Flight 103 was some way away from the fuselage skin.
</P>
<P>
Christopher Peel, from the British Defense Evaluation and
Research Agency, calculated that a 450-gram explosive device was
hidden 24 inches (60.9 centimeters) from the aircraft wall.
</P>
<P>
His calculation had a margin of error of four inches (10
centimeters) either way, he added.
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyer Richard Keen pointed out differences in the two
reports both prepared by Peel about the Lockerbie bombing, the
first being written shortly after the crash on December 21, 1988.
</P>
<P>
Peel defended the second report, saying that it was based on an
improved analytical model as well as results of tests on
explosions in aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The exact location of the bomb that brought down the New York-
bound Boeing 747 jumbo, killing 259 people on board and 11 others
on the ground, is crucial to the prosecution's case that accused
Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and Al-Amin Khalifa Fahima of hiding
plastic explosives in a cassette player which was then hidden in a
suitcase that was put in a cargo container.
</P>
<P>
Christopher Protheroe, an expert from Britain's Air Accident
Investigation Branch, testified last week that his agency made a
mistake in calculating the distance between the planted bomb and
the aircraft wall.
</P>
<P>
If calculated by using the "mach stem" formula, he said, the
distance would be around 12 inches (30.4 centimeters) instead of
25 inches (63.5 centimeters).
</P>
<P>
Peel, however, said that the mach stem theory was developed to
measure the damage done by a nuclear bomb exploded in mid-air and
that the theory did not apply to explosions within aircraft.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Rebel Group to Expropriate Corrupt Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia (FARC) announced Friday a new "law" to stop
administrative corruption that will oblige those responsible to
return with interests and fines illicitly appropriated money, and
even the expropriation of their assets.
</P>
<P>
FARC spokesman Raul Reyes said in a telephone communication
that "law 003 goes in force today."
</P>
<P>
The FARC had announced before this rule on administrative
corruption another on the agrarian reform, which it has not issued
yet, and one more that forces Colombians with more than one
million dollars to deliver them 10 percent of their assets.
</P>
<P>
The rebels pretend with this new decision to warn those who
have appropriated in an illicit way public assets that they must
return them in full together with the corresponding interests,
according to the current banking rate of interest.
</P>
<P>
The FARC is the oldest and largest rebel group in the South
American country.
