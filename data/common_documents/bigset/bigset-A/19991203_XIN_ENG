MOSCOW, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy on Thursday expressed understanding of Russia's military
actions against rebels in the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"As I have gathered from my discussions in Moscow, Russia is
not waging war on the civilian population there," Levy, here on a
one-day working visit, told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Levy, who is also deputy prime minister, expressed hope that"
all this will soon come to an end," the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>

Russia launched the current military campaign following Chechen
rebels' armed incursions into neighboring Daghestan and a spate of
terrorist bombings that killed 300 people in Moscow and two other
Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no forgiveness for terrorists or cooperation with
them," Levy said. "It is our duty to fight terrorism without too
many complaints."
</P>
<P>
Levy held talks with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov during the trip, discussing bilateral
cooperation in the economic, cultural and other fields as well as
international issues, especially the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Both sides expressed satisfaction over the status of bilateral
ties and pledged to work together for closer relations.

<HEADLINE> Greece in Principle Positive About Turkey's EU Candidacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The issue of Turkey's European
Union (EU) candidacy at the forthcoming EU Helsinki summit is
being seen positively in principle by the Greek government, which
hopes that the decisions reached will be in harmony with the
principles and the rules of the EU.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said Thursday that Greece was clear on what it was
aiming for and what had to come before the community to achieve a
decision which will ensure expansion and Turkey the status of
candidate country.
</P>
<P>
The EU enlargement should be dealt with on the basis of rules
which govern the operation of the EU, he said, adding that in this
context, Greece was in principle positive about a decision to
bestow the title of candidate country on Turkey.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman stressed that Turkey's position to date
did not appear to be matching this framework and that it was up to
the EU to take a decision.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou said
Thursday that Turkey's EU candidature would be determined and
decided on how things would develop.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Arab Organization for Human
Rights on Thursday welcomed Kuwait's decision to release 29
Egyptian workers detained for involvement in a street rioting in
the Gulf sheikdom.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Cairo, the human rights organization
expressed confidence in the justice of the Kuwaiti legal system.
</P>
<P>
A quarrel between an Egyptian worker and an Asian shop
assistant triggered a serious rioting in Kuwait City, involving
thousands of Egyptian and Asian expatriates, last October.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti police detained hundreds of Egyptians for their role in
the incident and later freed most of them. On Tuesday, Kuwait set
free the last 29 on bail. The Egyptian workers face charges of
resisting police officers, hindering patrols and burning cars.
</P>
<P>
The organization said it followed up the incident with great
concern and has demanded that the detainees be guaranteed their
legal rights according to laws.
</P>
<P>
It has also set up a follow-up committee and asked the Kuwaiti
government to allow a group of its lawyers to look into the
conditions of the detainees, the organization added.
</P>
<P>
It expressed appreciation for the efforts exerted by the
Egyptian and Kuwaiti governments to contain the tensions prompted
by the riots and protect the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the incident, Egypt and Kuwait cooperated
closely in dealing the issue. Senior Kuwaiti officials said the
incident would not affect the bilateral relations.

<P>
LONDON, December 2 (Xinhua) - AstraZeneca and Novartis
announced plans Thursday to each spin off their agricultural
chemical businesses, then merge them into a world leader.
</P>
<P>
The new company, with estimated annual revenue of nearly 8
billion U.S. dollars and a market value of about 12 billion U.S.
dollars, will be called Syngenta. It will be listed on the Swiss,
London, New York and Stockholm bourses.
</P>
<P>
But in a drive to cut costs, the combined company will lose
some 3000 jobs worldwide. Within three years, this and other
measures are to generate savings of 525 million U.S. dollars,
according to the announcement.
</P>
<P>
The new company will be based in Basel, Switzerland. Heinz
Imhof, currently head of Novartis Agribusiness, will become its
chairman.
</P>
<P>
Tom McKillop, AstraZeneca's chief executive, said the new
company could expect to benefit from the expected recovery of the
agricultural business.
</P>
<P>
"We don't anticipate a fast recovery, but the business will
definitely improve," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal troops fighting
Chechen rebels completely encircled the strategic town of Argun
Thursday afternoon, a step closer to taking Grozny, capital of the
breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
A mop-up operation will start in a day or two, the Interfax
news agency reported, quoting General Gennady Troshev, a commander
of the federal forces in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Some rebels have left the town, while others remained, Troshev
said.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, the Russian Defense Ministry denied reports of heavy
federal casualties near Argun.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that around 150 soldiers were killed or wounded in
a clash with militants.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, federal troops are continuing their efforts to
encircle Grozny, the Defense Ministry said. It reported more
aerial and artillery raids on rebel groups and positions near
Grozny.
</P>
<P>
The rebels continue to dig in and build firing positions on the
outskirts of Grozny, Shali and Urus-Martan. Mountain camps are
being prepared for the winter. Arms, ammunition, winter clothes,
food heaters and independent energy sources are being shipped
there, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the rebels, facing the prospect of losing
Grozny to federal troops, are planting explosives in buildings and
communication facilities there. They also hide bombs in vehicles,
television sets, radios, and other household appliances.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Opposes European Interference in Ocalan Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Justice Minister Hikmet
Turk said on Thursday that the European Court of Human Rights
(ECHR) could not decide for a retrial of outlawed Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ECHR is not an appeal authority over the
Turkish courts, and the appeal authority is the Turkish Supreme
Court of Appeals, according to a report of the Anatolia News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Turk said that "the ECHR cannot decide for a retrial, but if it
rules that the trial was not fair, it can decide to sentence
Turkey to pay compensation."
</P>
<P>
On November 30, the ECHR requested Turkey to suspend the
execution of Ocalan's death sentence after the Turkish Supreme
Court of Appeals on November 25 upheld the verdict against Ocalan
made by the Ankara State Security Court in June.
</P>
<P>
Turkish government held Ocalan responsible for the death of
30,000 Turks in the conflicts between government forces and the
PKK rebels, who have been fighting a guerrilla war since 1984 for
an independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Peace Talks to Open at U.N. On December 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The scheduled Cyprus
peace talks would start on December 3 at the United Nations
headquarters and it is expected that the talks may last for a
couple of weeks, a U.N. official announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the press on the upcoming peace talks, U.N. Secretary-
General kofi Annan's Special Adviser for Cyprus, Under-Secretary-
General Alvaro de Soto said the talks are called "proximity talks
" between the two Cypriot parties.
</P>
<P>
Both Glafcos Clerides, President of Cyprus and the leader of
the Greek Cypriots, and Rauf Denktash, the leader of the Turkish
Cypriots are in New York at the moment.
</P>
<P>
Clerides and Denktash would be seeing the U.N. Secretary-
General one after the other in the course of Friday morning's
talks, and there would be no opening ceremony for the talks, Soto
said.
</P>
<P>
The proximity talks mean that they would not meet face to face,
they are close within reach but they would not actually meet face
to face, Soto said.
</P>
<P>
The proximity talks are expected to last for roughly a couple
of weeks and the Secretary-General has asked the both sides to
remain until about the 15th of December, the roughly targeted date
for the conclusion of this particular round of talks, Soto said.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General is hoping that this would be the
beginning of the serious process that will be carried through with
the participation of the both parties constructively and seriously,
and the term under which they had agreed to come to New York is to
hold proximity talks in order to prepare the ground for meaningful
negotiations leading to a comprehensive settlement, said Soto.
</P>
<P>
It would be dangerous to expect that any agreements are likely
to emerge on substantive questions during this round of proximity
talks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Soto said it is very much the Secretary-General's hope that
they will address the issues that underline the Cyprus question
which in his view include security, distribution of powers,
property and territory.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General last month In Istanbul made the appeal
to them to come to the talks in a constructive spirit and there
should be no preconditions to holding the talks and to addressing
the questions, Soto said.
</P>
<P>
Clerides and Denktash are not known to have met face to face
for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been virtually partitioned since 1974 when troops
from Turkey took over the north of the island in reaction to a
coup in Nicosia engineered by the junta then ruling Greece. But
the two communities have been estranged since 1963.

<HEADLINE> NATO Allies Discuss Defense Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- NATO defense ministers met
here Thursday to discuss situation in the Balkans, Defense
Capabilities Initiative and the development of the European
Security and Defense Identity.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting of 19 defense ministers from NATO members,
NATO Secretary General George Robertson said the success of the
Defense Capabilities Initiative will be crucial if the allies are
to be able to carry out all of NATO's missions in the future.
</P>
<P>
"We need troops which are trained, equipped and ready for actual
use, not just forces which exist on paper alone. These troops have
to be mobile, sustainable, and survivable and backed up by the
best command and control and intelligence," the NATO chief said.
</P>
<P>
Robertson told a new briefing that the NATO welcomes the
European Union's intention to develop headline goal, and in
particular the proposal for a European rapid reaction force of 40,-
50,000 available within 60 days.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the meeting's discussion about European Security
and Defense Identity, Robertson said he got broad support for his
three"I's": improvement, inclusive and indivisibility.
</P>
<P>
"The European Security and Defense Identity must bring an
improvement in capability; it must be inclusive of all Allies; and
it must reaffirm the indivisibility of Allied security," he said.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief also told reporters that U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen gave an update during the meeting on U.S.
consideration of a possible "National Missile Defense" system.
</P>
<P>
"He assured us that no final decision on such a system has been
taken as yet. And he reemphasized that the decision, when it is
taken, will take into account the views of Allies," Robertson said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Allows Government Employees to Work Shorter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian cabinet decided on
Thursday that government employees will work shorter hours and
have an extra day off each week during the Muslim holy fasting
month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet Secretary General Ahmad Abu Taleb said the decision is
aimed at easing traffic jams, Egypt's official Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian government employees usually work six days a week with
Friday as the Muslim Sabbath. During Ramadan, which will begin
next week, they will also get Thursday off, Abu Taleb said.
</P>
<P>
The normal working hours is 8 a.m. to 3 p.m., but during
Ramadan civil servants will work from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., he
added. But the decision will not apply to schools and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
During Ramadan, Muslims are forbidden to eat, drink, smoke or
have sexual intercourse between sunrise and sunset. The fast
commemorates God's revelation of the Koran, Islam's holy book, to
the Prophet Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
Cairo is notorious for traffic jams and the congestion reaches
a peak during Ramadan when hundreds of thousands of people rush
home in the hour before sunset.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet also ordered the Interior Ministry to assign more
traffic police to major intersections to improve the flow of
traffic, Abu Taleb said.

<HEADLINE> Greek, Turkish Officials Working on Bilateral Pacts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- A team of Greek and Turkish
government officials began talks here Thursday on putting the
final touches to a range of bilateral agreements arising from the
recent dialogue between senior foreign ministry officials of the
two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The texts of the five bilateral agreements between Greece and
Turkey refer to tourist cooperation, the environment, issues of
security for citizens, economic cooperation and cooperation in the
scientific and technological fields, the semi-official Athens News
Agency (ANA) quoted diplomatic sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The final touches to the agreements on the avoidance of double
taxation, investment protection, shipping cooperation and
cooperation in the energy sector are expected on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that a committee of senior foreign ministry
officials from the two countries would convene before the European
Union (EU) summit in Helsinki next week and draft a report on the
results of the talks.
</P>
<P>
For decades, Greece and Turkey have been at odds over their
disputes in the territorial waters, air space limits and the
delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean Sea and the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of July, rounds of talks between senior foreign
ministry officials of the two countries have taken place in Ankara
and Athens respectively, with the aim of finding ways to improve
their strained relations.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that it is possible for the two long-time
rivals to make progress in cooperation in the fields of tourism,
the environment, culture, economy and science and technology, but
it will be very difficult for them to reach consensus on the
sensitive issues such as their disputes in the eastern Aegean Sea
and the Cyprus problem.

<TEXT>
<P>
MUSCAT, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese top legislator
Li Peng held friendly talks with Omani Deputy Prime Minister for
Cabinet Affairs Fahd Bin Mahmoud here Thursday, both calling for
increased cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud said relations between Oman and China can be traced
long back into the remote years and the economic cooperation
between the two sides has made new progress since they
established diplomatic relations in 1978.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that Li's visit will certainly help
deepen mutual understanding and expand bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud said the people of Oman have come to know that they
could not rely totally on oil and natural gas and they must
diversify their economy, adding Oman is ready to strengthen
economic cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress of China, said he agrees with Mahmoud and
called for joint efforts to further promote the existing
friendship and cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud said Oman-China relationship features mutual respect
and trust.
</P>
<P>
He told Li that he appreciates China's practice of treating
small countries as equals and its moderate and responsible
foreign policy, which has won favorable comments and praises
across the world.
</P>
<P>
Li said mutual respect and treating each other as equals
constitute the solid foundation for China-Oman cooperation, though
the two countries differ in social system, historical background,
cultural tradition, the size of territory and population.
</P>
<P>
Li told Mahmoud that he had reached broad consensus with Hamoud
bin Abdullah Al-Harthy, president of the State Council, during
their talks in the morning.
</P>
<P>
On China's foreign policy, Li said China adopts a responsible
attitude in handling international issues, adheres to principles,
upholds justice.
</P>
<P>
China bases its judgement of important international and
regional issues on the truth and adopts appropriate measures
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived here Wednesday for an official goodwill visit,
after winding up his trip to Mauritius, South Africa, Kenya,
Palestine and Israel.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Angolan rebels have seized
strategic positions of Wako Kungo town in Angola's central
highland in their first major counterattack against the government
troops since a military setback in October, informed sources said
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After three days of heavy fighting that left many civilians and
soldiers dead or wounded, combats are still continuing in and
around the town.
</P>
<P>
Government military officials declined to provide casualty
figures or details of the fighting.
</P>
<P>
According to the informed sources, some strategic positions had
been seized by the rebels since they launched the attack on Monday
morning to recapture the town from the Armed Forces of Angola.
</P>
<P>
The combat was the first reported big rebel operation since the
 government troops launched a mass offensive on September 18
against the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola(UNITA) in the central highland, during which the government
forces captured the rebels' political and military headquarters in
Bailundo and Andulo.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of the ruling People's Liberation Movement of
Angola (MPLA) Joao Lourenco admitted recently that the government
troops had won the battles, but had not yet won the 25-year-old
civil war.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's draft constitution
which was prepared by the Constitutional Commission and presented
to President Robert Mugabe on Monday was gazetted on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The draft constitution proposes an executive president assisted
by a prime minister to run the country.
</P>
<P>
It also proposes the setting up of two houses of Assembly, the
 Parliament and the Senate.
</P>
<P>
It also advocates for the establishment of several commissions
including the independent electoral commission, the media
commission and an anti- corruption commission.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe appointed the Constitutional Commission early this year
with a view of drafting a new constitution to replace the
British-authored Lancaster House constitution said not to
represent the views of the majority.
</P>
<P>
The draft constitution would be tested in a referendum before
it went to Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, opposition Democratic Party (DP) President Wurayayi
Zembe on Thursday rejected the draft constitution describing it
as shameful and fraudulent act, the Zimbabwe News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
He said his party had been consistent from the beginning in
mobilizing for the rejection of the draft constitution and the
idea of a referendum even during its alliance with the National
Constitutional Assembly (NCA).

<HEADLINE> European Children's Number Drops Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The number of children in Europe
has reduced by 16 percent since 1970 due to the falling birthrates
and increasing childhood accident rates, experts said in the
northern Greek city of Thessaloniki Thursday.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 European children lose their lives every year
and 30,000 others become victim to accidents which leave them with
serious disabilities, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Twelve types of children's games deemed to fall short of safety
regulations have since 1995 been taken off the market, the experts
said, adding that in 1999 alone, 28 leading companies were forced
to withdraw from circulation 750,000 types of children's games
around the world.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Recommends to Extend Mandate of UNFICYP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Thursday recommended to extend the mandate of the
United Nations Peacekeeping Forces (UNFICYP) in Cyprus for another
period of six months until June 15, 2000.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the United Nations Security Council, Annan said
during the past six months, the situation along the cease-fire
lines has remained stable and the prevention of incidents remains
dependent entirely upon the discipline imposed upon the troops on
both sides and upon their consistent cooperation with UNFICYP.
</P>
<P>
Annan said this year's United Nations Day celebration was a
timely reminder that direct contact between Greek Cypriots and
Turkish Cypriots can positively influence the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Under the existing circumstances, the presence of UNFICYP on
the island remains indispensable for the maintenance of the cease-
fire between the two sides, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"On November 14, 1999, in response to my invitation, both Mr.
Glafcos Clerides and Mr. Rauf Denktash agreed to start proximity
talks in New York on December 3, 1999 in order to prepare the
ground for meaningful negotiations leading to a comprehensive
settlement. I shall keep the Security Council informed of
developments," said the U.N. chief.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus became independent in 1960 with a Constitution that was
intended to balance the interests of both the Greek Cypriot and
the Turkish Cypriot communities. However, a series of
constitutional crises resulted in the outbreak of violence in
December 1963.
</P>
<P>
After all attempts to restore peace had failed, on March 4,
1964, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 186, by
which it recommended the establishment of UNFICYP with a mandate
to use its best efforts to prevent a recurrence of fight and, as
necessary, to contribute to the maintenance and restoration of law
and order and return to normal conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Council has reaffirmed this mandate every six months,

<HEADLINE> North America Property Giant Emerging from Takeover Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Ontario Teachers' Pension
Plan Board has become one of the largest real estate companies in
North America, with a takeover deal struck in Toronto Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At a price of 2.3 billion Canadian dollars (about 1.6 billion U.
S.dollars), Teachers acquired all the shares of Cadillac Fairview
Corp., the best real estate portfolio in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Teachers will run the company the way it currently is being run
and keep all the assets, which are valued at 34 Canadian dollars (
about 23 U.S. dollars) a share on the local stock market, said the
Toronto-based National Post newspaper Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cadillac owns stakes in 102 shopping centres and office
buildings in North America. In Canada, its portfolio includes the
Eaton Center and Toronto-Dominion Center in Toronto, as well as
the Pacific Center in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
Cadillac suffered heavy losses in the 1990s as the real estate
bubble finally burst. The company lost about 4 billion Canadian
dollars (about 2.8 billion U.S. dollars) from 1991 to 1995.

<HEADLINE> Minister Defends Democratic Developments in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Iran's reformist Minister of
Culture and Islamic Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani said on Thursday
democratic developments in the country are not against the
principles of Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the end of the 5th
Conference of Islamic Information Ministers, Mohajerani said
democratic developments have brought positive impacts on the
country.
</P>
<P>
He rejected the possibility of a return to the past and a halt
to the process of democracy, saying the two-decade experience of
the country is the background of the process of democracy in
Iran.
</P>
<P>
"When we accepted democracy, it means we accepted political
competition observing the rules and regulations, the rival
parties are now experiencing democracy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani, who is also the government spokesman, said that
the positive developments in Iran's foreign relations are also
a result of the developments in the country.
</P>
<P>
Iran had cold relations with Saudi Arabia in the past, but
"now we have excellent ties," he said, adding that in the past 20
years Iran had failed to establish relations with Egypt, but the
ties between the two countries are now clearly improving.

<HEADLINE> Ballot Count Begins as Namibia's Third Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Whether Namibia's ruling
South West African People's Organization (SWAPO)  would retain
its two-thirds majority in parliament became the focus of concern
as vote counting began Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Two days of Namibia's third general elections ended Wednesday
night and ballot boxes were taken to 102 points for counting,
according to a press report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Namibian President Sam Nujoma's SWAPO has ruled this arid
southwest African country since 1989, after leading a 23-year
struggle for independence from apartheid South Africa.
</P>
<P>
His main challengers are the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance,
which has 20 percent of National Assembly's 72 seats, and the
Congress of Democrats (COD) , formed earlier this year by
disgruntled SWAPO supporters.
</P>
<P>
Primary results will make known on Friday and final results are
expected to be announced Sunday or Monday.
</P>
<P>
About half of Namibia's 1.7 million citizens are registered to
vote.
</P>
<P>
Electoral Commission head Peter Mietzner said he did not expect
 political parties to contest the election results.
</P>
<P>
"The election has been pretty fair," he said.
</P>
<P>
Election observers expressed satisfaction at the fairness of
the poll.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma, 70, and SWAPO pushed through a controversial amendment
to the Constitution allowing him to run for a third five-year term
of presidency.
</P>
<P>
SWAPO won 72.7 percent of the vote in 1994 elections.

<HEADLINE> China, Vietnam PMs Reach Consensus on Land Boundary Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji and
his Vietnamese counterpart Phan Van Khai expressed their
satisfaction here Thursday with a report on the negotiations of
the land boundary between the two countries, a Chinese spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
At their meeting, the two premiers reached "important
consensus" on the report which was prepared by the heads of the
two negotiation teams.
</P>
<P>
They also spoke highly of the approach to settle the
territorial issue with a strategic perspective, which has been
taken by the general secretaries of the communist parties of the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman gave no details of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The two premiers held in-depth discussions on bilateral,
regional and international issues and reached broad consensus.
</P>
<P>
Khai said Zhu's visit will contribute greatly to the
development of a future-oriented relationship of long-term
stability, good neighborliness and all-round cooperation between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese prime minister said his country attaches great
importance to the friendly cooperation with China, saying frequent
high-level exchanges serve very much the promotion of relations
between the two communist parties and two countries.
</P>
<P>
While pursuing reforms and opening-up, both countries are
upholding the socialist orientation and communist leadership, Khai
said, adding that the traditional Vietnam-China cooperation must
be carried on.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the relations between the two parties and two
countries have developed in an all-round way since they were back
on the normal track eight years ago and high-level meetings
betweenevelop Sino-Vietnamese relations is
not only conducive to the two countries' respective development,
but also to peace and stability in the region and the world at
large, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed ways of promoting economic and
trade cooperation between China and Vietnam, agreeing that more
efforts are needed in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the Chinese government will continue to support and
encourage Chinese investment in Vietnam, especially in the areas
of farm produce processing, machinery, household electrical
appliances, and the assembly of electronic and telecommunication
products.
</P>
<P>
Zhu arrived here Thursday from Ho Chi Minh city on the second
day of his four-day official visit to Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Not to Resign: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer
Weizman does not intend to step down next May, Israel Radio
quoted Director General of the President's Office Arye Shumer as
saying on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a Ha'aretz newspaper report that the president is
considering resignation , Shumer, a close aide of the president,
dismissed the report as "not true", saying he didn't know where
the rumor came from.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz published a front-page story Thursday morning, saying
that Weizman has decided to step down before next summer and that
senior figures in the Labor party have already prepared for the
replacement, with former prime minister Shimon Peres as a leading
candidate.
</P>
<P>
The report also said Weizman, who is already 76 years old and
recently underwent gall bladder surgery, had informed Prime
Minister Ehud Barak shortly after the general elections last May
of his intention to retire.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's Office denied the report well and said
Barak hopes the President would continue at his post.
</P>
<P>
Weizman, a nephew of Israel's first president Chaim Weizman,
was elected president on March 1993 and reelected on March 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli president, whose duties are mostly ceremonial as
head of state, is elected by a simple majority of the Knesset
(parliament) for a five-year term which is renewable once.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Bryant Struggles in Season Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Kobe Bryant made his season
debut for the Los Angeles Lakers Wednesday night and picked up
right where he left off -- shooting.
</P>
<P>
Bryant scored 19 points within 30 minutes as the Lakers routed
the Golden State Warriors, 93-75. But the star guard, who chose to
announce his return via his Web site, made just 7-of-18 shots and
committed four fouls.
</P>
<P>
"I was a little tired at first but then I got my second wind,"
Bryant said. "My legs felt a little heavy which is kind of
natural. I was just out there playing."
</P>
<P>
"Kobe is going to find a way to score whether he is shooting
well or not," Lakers coach Phil Jackson conceded. "That is the
mentality he brings to the game.... He is just a wild, compulsive
kid right now."
</P>
<P>
Just 21, Bryant was greeted by a rousing ovation before the
game and a standing ovation when he entered the contest late in
the first quarter. He wore a protective purple glove over his
right hand but said it did not effect his game.
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't bother me at all. I have been shooting with it the
last couple of days," he said. "Shaquille O'Neal said when I made
my first buckt I should do like a little Michael Jackson."
</P>
<P>
Bryant missed the first 15 games of the season with a broken
bone but Los Angeles went 11-4 in his absence. He is expected to
thrive with O'Neal and Glen Rice in Jackson's triangle offense.
</P>
<P>
"It makes me feel good," said Rice, who scored 10 points on
just 4-of-16 shooting. "Now all I have to do is step up and hit
the shots. I'm going to have a lot more opportunities and have to
be ready to knock down those shots. With his ability to penetrate
and get the ball up the floor very quickly, I have got to deliver
my package."
</P>
<P>
"The big key is he disrupts the team on defense," Jackson added.
"That's the one thing they will have to learn."
</P>
<P>
Bryant suffered the injury in Los Angeles' first exhibition
game and has missed seven weeks. He was forced to wear a cast to
protect the fractured fourth metacarpal bone in the hand.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the cast was removed and Bryant revealed he is
putting it up for bid on eBay, a public auction Web site.
</P>
<P>
In his fourth year directly out of high school, Bryant played
in all 50 games last season and registered 19.9 points, 5.3
rebounds and 3.8 assists per game. He became the youngest All-
Star in NBA history in 1998.
</P>
<P>
To make room for Bryant, the Lakers placed rookie forward
Devean George on the injured list. George played four minutes in
Tuesday's 101-77 win at Seattle and scored six points but now is
sidelined with a bruised right knee.
</P>
<P>
George, the 23rd overall draft pick from Diviison III Augsburg
College in Minnesota, has averaged 3.9 points and 1.5 rebounds in
13 games.

<HEADLINE> Indian Parliament Passes Foreign Exchange Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 2 (Xinhua) -- India's lower house of
parliament, or Lok Sabha, Thursday passed the Foreign Exchange
Management Bill (FEMA) along with the Prevention Money Laundering
Bill (PMLB).
</P>
<P>
Before the passage of the two bills, Finance Minister Yashwant
Sinha said the government would move very cautiously and never
take a risk that exposes the country to unnecessary hardships.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the house passed the controversial Insurance
Regulatory and Development Authority Bill, thus opening the
insurance sector to private and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Sinha said the money laundering bill sought to prohibit
dealings in "proceeds of crime" directly or indirectly by any
person as a result of criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
FEMA, introduced in the house last Monday, proposed to replace
the Foreign Exchange Regulations Act and envisages stringent
penalties for violation of foreign exchange norms.
</P>
<P>
The two bills, which were passed at the fag end of the day with
barely 30 out of over 500 members of parliament present, provide
for stringent penalties to offenders and facilitate external trade
by removing hurdles to legitimizing foreign exchange transactions.
</P>
<P>
A number of amendments in the name of Congress party and other
opposition members against certain provisions of the two bills
were not taken up due to their absence.

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Meet on Iraq's Oil-for-Food Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Thursday is scheduled to meet on U.N. oil-for-
food program in Iraq in a bid to hammer out a resolution on
continuing a new phase of the deal.
</P>
<P>
The phase six oil-for-food program, which began on May 25, 1999
and should have expired on November 20, was extended by the
Security Council for two weeks until December 4, a stopgap of the
Council amid its division on the program.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. diplomats, the United States and Britain
wanted the technical rollover of the program with the same terms
as the previous ones and Russia urged to lift the ceiling of the
Oil that Iraq is allowed to export and double the oil revenue that
Iraq could use to import spare parts and equipment for its oil
industry.
</P>
<P>
Iraq rejected the Council's move by cutting its oil flow. Iraq
said the extension was meaningless.
</P>
<P>
With the expiring date coming, the Council has not reached an
agreement on a new phase of the oil-for-food program in Iraq and
the U.N. diplomats said the United States was planning to push the
Council to have the six phase extended for another week so as to
save time for the Council to narrow their differences over a new,
comprehensive policy towards Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating that it would reject the supposed one-week
extension of the six phase of the oil-for-food program, Iraq said
it needs the renewal of another six period of the deal.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food program, which began to be implemented since
late 1996, is aimed to ease the deteriorating humanitarian
situation in Iraq caused by the stringent U.N. sanctions which was
imposed on the country after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Angola delayed circulation of
its new currency kwanza for one week, official source said here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The National Bank of Angola (BNA) said earlier that kwanza,
substitution for the former readjusted kwanza, was to enter into
circulation on December 1.
</P>
<P>
An official with the bank explained that the preparation was
not completed for the circulation of the new currency.
</P>
<P>
"We think we need one more week for concluding the process,"
said the official, who admitted the existence of problems in the
information system, but predicted those problems are "perfectly
surmountable".
</P>
<P>
"We believe that in a week, surely, we will meet the conditions
for the start of the circulation of kwanza without sudden fear in
the residents or enterprises," said the source.
</P>
<P>
Kwanza was designed by the central bank as a more convenient
currency in the market, with one kwanza equivalent to one million
readjusted kwanza. The exchange rate against U.S. dollar is 5.7
kwanza to one.

3 percent in October to an all-time high level even though
mortgage rates continued to rise, the Commerce Department reported
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that sales of new single-family homes surged
ahead to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 986,000 units in
October. In September, new-home sales plunged 8.1 percent to an
annual rate of 848,000 units.
</P>
<P>
The new gain marked the biggest jump in new-home sales since a
16.7 percent increase in April 1993, the report said.
</P>
<P>
October's sales were up significantly in all parts of the
country except the Northeast, where they fell.
</P>
<P>
The monthly average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in
October was 7.85 percent, up from September's 7.82 percent and
much higher than the 6.71 percent rate for October 1998.
</P>
<P>
By region, the Midwest posted the biggest increase in sales of
new homes, a whopping 40.3 percent to an annual rate of 240,000
units. Sales in the West rose a hefty 18 percent to an annual rate
of 268,000 units. The South saw sales rise 10.3 percent to an
annual rate of 406,000 units. However, sales fell by 11 percent in
the Northeast to an annual rate of 73,000 units.
</P>
<P>
The median price for a new home was 159,000 dollars, slightly
less than September's median price of 159,900 dollars.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Eyes Great Potential of Sino-Omani </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MUSCAT, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Visiting top Chinese legislator
Li Peng said here Thursday that there is great potential for
economic and technological cooperation between China and Oman.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Hamoud bin Abdullah Al-Harthy, president
of the State Council of Oman, Li Peng called for concerted
efforts to fully tap the potential of cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
"We should give play to the role of the business communities of
our two countries," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress of China, also called for increased exchanges
and mutual understanding for facilitating Sino-Omani cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Al-Harthy said Oman is ready to further strengthen friendly
and cooperative relations with China's National People's Congress,
which plays an important role in the political life in China.
</P>
<P>
He said Li's visit has provided an opportunity for both sides
to review Omani-Chinese relations and look into the future of
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Al-Harthy told Li that Oman follows China's progress closely
and admires the great achievements China has made, saying
China's domestic and foreign policies have attained world
reputation and won the trust of other countries.
</P>
<P>
Li reiterated China's independent foreign policy of peace,
adding China is willing to develop friendly relations with all
countries, including Oman, on the basis of the Five Principles of
Peaceful Coexistence.
</P>
<P>
"China will never become a superpower, will never seek
hegemony, and will never pursue a sphere of influence," Li said.
</P>
<P>
"We always consider that the stability and development
of China is a contribution to the world peace and stability, " he
added.
</P>
<P>
Al-Harthy said Oman shares similar views in many aspects with
China. Oman, he pointed out, also pursues an opening-up policy and
sticks to the principles of mutual respect and non-interference in
other country's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Al-Harthy, who visited China 19 years ago, received Li's
invitation to visit China again next year to witness the country's
new achievements.
</P>
<P>

and Israel.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Concerned Over Turkey's Nuclear Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot parliament Speaker
Spyros Kyprianou on Thursday called on his foreign counterparts to
exert their influence to dissuade Turkey from constructing two
nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou made the call in a letter to his counterparts of
European Union (EU) member states and Mediterranean nations as
well as chiefs of the international parliamentary organizations
and the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Turkish government has plans to construct two
nuclear reactors in the Akkuyu area in its south coast.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou said "the frequency and extent of the earthquakes
occurring in Turkey serve as a grim reminder of how close the brink
of a nuclear disaster actually is."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that, during the Euro-Mediterranean Speakers'
Conference held in Palma de Majorca in March, a then
deputy-speaker of the Turkish Grand National Assembly stated that
Turkey would not materialize the plan.
</P>
<P>
"The Turkish government's actions, however, have proved to be
inconsistent with that assurance," he added.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou noted that recent statements by Turkish officials,
"far from dismissing our fears," showed that Ankara intends to
press on with its plan for the construction of the Akkuyu nuclear
power plant.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists from Cyprus and other countries in the region
have also expressed concern over the Turkey's plans.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: N.Ireland Sees Hope of Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's new power-
sharing cabinet of Protestant and Catholic ministers began its
first meeting in Belfast, marking the end of the 27-year-old
direct rule of Northern Ireland from London.
</P>
<P>
But a hardline Protestant party, the Democratic Unionists led
by Ian Paisley, refused to join in, saying it would not sit with
Sinn Fein until its Irish Republican Army guerrilla allies
disarmed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, the Irish Government took its most
significant step to Northern Ireland's peace process by ratifying
constitutional changes, ending its decades-old territorial claim
to Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Northern Ireland Secretary Peter
Mandelson and Irish Foreign Secretary David Andrews signed an
agreement on Thursday morning, establishing a north-south
ministerial council, the British-Irish intergovernmental
conference and British-Irish Council.
</P>
<P>
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, backed by his Cabinet,
signed an amendment to the Republic's constitution which formally
revoked articles two and three, which lay claim to the six
counties of the North.
</P>
<P>
He said the twin causes of peace and partnership should be
dedicated to those who had suffered peace and loss, so that the
island should never again be "divided by bitterness and riven by
conflict."
</P>
<P>
In London, Prime Minister Tony Blair said: "This is an historic
day. Power in Northern Ireland has been returned to its people."
</P>
<P>
Dublin's move, designed to ease fears among the province's pro-
British Protestants of being forced into a united Ireland, came a
day after the British parliament approved laws to end a quarter of
a century of direct rule from London.
</P>
<P>
The IRA, which suspended its war against British rule two years
ago, was expected to add a piece to the jigsaw later on Thursday
by opening talks on disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein chief Gerry Adams said the launch of all-Ireland
political institutions showed the failure of the partition of the
island which republicans had always campaigned against.
</P>
<P>
"The five million on this island can do a better job of
governing than any minister from London," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson said he was confident the IRA would disarm, but
warned that the new home-rule government would be suspended if
guns were not handed in.
</P>
<P>
The IRA has accused the Ulster Unionists, Northern Ireland's
most powerful Protestant party, of setting an unacceptable
deadline for disarmament to start by February.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 2 (Xinhua)-- The foreign ministers of
five Central American countries started Thursday in El Salvador a
meeting to seek a solution to the controversy that emerged after
the impregnation of Nicaragua to a limits agreement signed between
Honduras and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The meeting behind closed doors is being held in the Comalapa
airport in El Salvador, attended by the general secretary of the
Central American Integration System (SICA), former Nicaraguan
foreign minister Ernesto Leal, according to reports reaching here
from San Salvador.
</P>
<P>
The Honduran Congress ratified Wednesday a treaty on maritime

<HEADLINE> German Parliament Agrees on Kohl Scandal Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Major political parties in Germany
's lower parliamentary chamber, the Bundestag, approved Thursday
in Berlin to launch a thorough investigation of former Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's "black bank accounts" of millions of marks.
</P>
<P>
Five parties in the Bundestag unanimously agreed to investigate
from whom Kohl received secret party donations, how he used the
funds, whether the donations affected the then German government's
decision, and whether the money should be treated as bribes.
</P>
<P>
The Bundestag is composed of legislators from the ruling Social
Democrats (SPD), its junior partner the Greens, the opposite
Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU), the Party for Democratic Socialism
(PDS), and the Free Democratic Party (FDP).
</P>
<P>
An investigation committee headed by Volker Neumann, a lawmaker
of the SPD, is due to start work on December 16. The probe may
continue for two years.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, who led the CDU from 1973 to 1998 and served as German
chancellor from 1982 to 1998, is still the honorary chairman of
the CDU. Having led German reunification, he is called "the
Chancellor of Unity."
</P>
<P>
But last month, the media reported that Kohl set up a "black
account" of a million marks in 1991. It was said that weapon
dealer Karlheinz Schreiber had secretly donated to the CDU the sum,
which linked with Germany's sale of armored vehicles to Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Kohl's "black accounts" were further alleged to link with
illegal repayments from the privatization of former East German
enterprises, sales of Airbus jet liners, and helicopter deals.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Kohl admitted in the Bundestag that he had
operated the "black accounts" and that he had made mistakes and "
may have offended the federal law." But he stressed he had not
been bribed.
</P>
<P>
Kohl declined to say how much secret money he had received and
how many bank accounts he had run, simply saying the money had
been used to support individual party members and party groups.
</P>
<P>
The SPD said Kohl had "illegally run the accounts" of over 10
million marks, and suggested the donation had affected the
decisions of Kohl's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Neumann told Germany's Pheonix television, "There is great
possibility about the undeclared donators, and there is some
reason why they are hidden."
</P>
<P>
Under Germany's Party Funding Law, political parties should
make public any donation over 20,000 marks with the name and
address of the donator.
</P>
<P>
The CDU may be fined three times as much of its secret funds if
the money is treated as bribes, Thursday's Die Welt newspaper
quoted law experts as saying.
</P>
<P>
Aiming to rescue the party's reputation and avoid fines that
will cause party finance crash, the CDU, now led by Wolfgang
Schaeuble, also voted for the bill.
</P>
<P>
"The affair must be cleared up as quickly and unassailably as
possible," said Schaeuble, "but I am confident that the decision
of Kohl's government, just like those of any government in Federal
Germany's history, was by no way for sale."

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians Fail to Settle Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators ended a new round of talks here Thursday evening,
failing to reach a solution to their differences on the maps about
Israeli second-stage troops redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat
expressed hope that the differences would be settled in the coming
few days ahead of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's
visit to the region, which is slated for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 5 percent land transfer to the Palestinian control in the
second stage has been delayed for two weeks due to the differences
between the two sides over which areas should be handed over.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli side nominated chief negotiator Oded
Eran and Major General Shlomon Ynai co-chairmen of a committee on
the third-phase redeployment, which should be carried out on
January 20, under the latest Palestinian-Israeli peace deal, Erekat
said.
</P>
<P>
Erekat and Oded are scheduled to meet in Gaza on Sunday to
discuss the third redeployment and the implementation of the peace
deal, or Sharm El-Sheikh Memorandum, signed early September.

OTTAWA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Canada has introduced stiffer
laws against drunk driving, which could lead to life imprisonment.

the Criminal Code Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Change extends the previous penalty of up to 14 years to
life imprisonment against any drunk driver causing death.

<HEADLINE> Fake Bank Cards Drain Out 150,000 Canadian Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Thieves have used fake bank
cards to withdraw 150,000 Canadian dollars (about 101,700 U.S.
dollars) from automatic tellers in Quebec, Canada.
</P>
<P>
A news released from Montreal said Thursday that Laurentian
Bank alerted police after it detected in early October an odd
pattern of withdrawals at about five automatic tellers in Montreal
and Quebec City.
</P>
<P>
Up to five suspects have been arrested with 463 counterfeit
cards being seized in the scam, but the bank is still baffled by
how thieves used fake bank cards to steal the large sum of money.
</P>
<P>
As many as 150 customers may have been robbed by the thieves
using the fake cards with stolen personal identification numbers,
according to the bank.
</P>
<P>
There have been at least four bank thefts reported in Quebec
since 1998. Gangs often use video cameras or "skimming machines"
to obtain the confidential PIN information in retail stores, which
record customers' PIN numbers, local police have said.

<HEADLINE> Nicaraguan Army Put in State of Alert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Nicaraguan army was
declared in a state of alert after the ratification by the
Honduran congress of a treaty of maritime delimitation with
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
"It is a joint aggression from Honduras and Colombia, behind
which there could be a military alliance to effect the
safeguarding of what they consider their territories," said
Nicaraguan Army chief of staff Javier Carrion.
</P>
<P>
Carrion, who will assume the command of the army next year,
said "we are in a state of analysis and alert, waiting to see
which activities might affect the sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan government said that the Caribbean Sea Maritime
Limits Treaty between Honduras and Colombia damages its rights
over a maritime area of 130,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
According to the treaty, the border between Honduras and
Nicaragua is in the 15th parallel and not in the 17th, as Managua
maintains, while the border between Nicaragua and Colombia is in
the meridian 82nd, and not in the 78th, as stated by Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
The military chief said the mobilization of Honduran troops to
the northeastern border of Nicaragua, does not mean any threat for
Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Carrion said "we are following up the Honduran military
exercises and at the same time the situation that could occur in
the areas of parallel 15."
</P>
<P>
The general said that the institution lacks the best conditions
to patrol the territorial waters for lack of money.
</P>
<P>
Carrion said that Honduras' air force has more aircraft, but
Nicaragua has more artillery and tanks.
</P>
<P>
He said that Nicaragua's naval force is "more or less well
equipped" in comparision with the other Central American countries.

<HEADLINE> SWAPO Takes Lead in Namibia's Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The South West Africa
People's Organization of Namibia (SWAPO) took lead in the past
two-day polling of presidential and national assembly elections,
the Namibian Press Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by regional coordinators of the
elections, President Sam Nujoma, also leader of the SWAPO, took
the lead with 89 percent of the votes (1,014) in the presidential
election in Ondangwa constituency, Oshana region.
</P>
<P>
Katuutire Kaura, president of the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance
(DTA), got six percent of the votes (68), while Ben Ulenga,
president of the newly- formed Congress of Democrats (COD), got
five percent (55).
</P>
<P>
Justus Garoeb, president of the United Democratic Front (UDF),
received the least from that constituency, with only three votes.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that although the results given were from the
Ondangwa Town Council Polling Station and not from the Ondangwa
constituency, such a pattern might be a pointer to what the final
election results could be.
</P>
<P>
All the 80 international observers tasked to observe Namibia's
third national elections were scattered among the 102
constituencies throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The final results are expected to be announced on Saturday or
Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan President Cancels Trip to Miami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez canceled his visit next week to Miami, the United States,
because of an alleged plot of Cuban government's opponents to
assassinate him, authorities said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel told the press
that the existence of a plot to assassinate Chavez was considered
credible as stated recently by Cuban President Fidel Castro in
Havana.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan president had planned to travel to the United
States on Dec. 8 to attend the 23rd Miami Entrepreneurial
Conference on the Caribbean and Latin America, to be held on
December 7 to 10.
</P>
<P>
The forum foresees the attendance of some 12,500
entrepreneurial and political leaders as well as some heads of
state.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban American National Foundation, with headquarters in
Miami, opposed the Cuban regime and considered "ridiculous" Castro
's accusation that it is involved in some plan to kill the
Venezuelan president.
</P>
<P>
Chavez said on November 14 that foreign and Venezuelan groups
are involved in a plan to do away with him.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan chief of state has expressed on several
occasions his support for and friendship with Fidel Castro, which
earned him the rejection of the Cuban community residing in Miami,
that opposes the Havana government.

BEIRUT, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Four Lebanese civilians,
including a four-year-old boy, were wounded Thursday in a
military clash between Israeli forces and Lebanese guerrillas,
security sources said.
</P>
<P>
The four Lebanese were injured when their Bayada village in
the western sector of the Israeli occupied border in south
Lebanon was hit by mortar fire.

<P>
There has been no group claiming responsibility for the

<P>
Earlier in the day, two Israeli soldiers, including an
officer, were wounded by Lebanese guerrillas' mortar attacks
inside the border zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north
from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting
to oust Israelis out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Novartis, AstraZeneca to Create World's Leading Agrochemical Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Swiss chemical company Novartis
and its British-Swedish competitor AstraZeneca will join force to
create a leading agrochemical firm in the world, announced
Novartis Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The new firm is to be called Syngenta, with combined sales of 7.
9 billion U.S. dollars based on 1998 results. Based in the Swiss
city of Basel, it will be the world's No. 1 firm in crop
protection and No. 3 in seeds.
</P>
<P>
AstraZeneca and Novartis said a merger was seen as the best
possible option, because it would allow them to cut duplicate
administrative, marketing and manufacturing costs.
</P>
<P>
Heinz Imhof, currently head of Novartis Agribusiness, will
become chairman of Syngenta. Michael Pragnell, presently chief
executive officer of Zeneca Agrochemicals, will be chief executive
officer. Novartis will own 61 percent and AstraZeneca 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
The deal is subject to approvals from Novartis and AstraZeneca
shareholders and receipt of regulatory clearances. The companies
expect to complete the merger and spin-off in the second half of
2000.
</P>
<P>
Novartis said it was still unclear at this stage how many jobs
would be cut in Switzerland but claimed that lay-offs would be
implemented in a "socially responsible way" and with "appropriate
compensation."

<HEADLINE> World Bank: Vietnam Makes Big Progress in Reducing Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has made tremendous
progress in reducing poverty, with the number of people with
inadequate consumption of food and other essential items dropping
from 58 percent in 1993 to 37 percent in 1998, according to a new
World Bank report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report, "Vietnam: Attacking Poverty," will serve as a basis
for discussion at this year's Consultative Group meeting to be
held in Hanoi on December 14 and 15, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The report said that poverty reduction to date has been fueled
largely by economic growth and agricultural diversification which
were stimulated by the "doi moi" reform program launched in the
late 1980s and the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
"But these dramatic gains remain fragile," warned Andrew Steer,
World Bank country director for Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
"Many of the people who have climbed out of poverty are now
just slightly above the poverty line. A disaster, such as the
recent floods in the central coastal provinces, or even the
sickness of a family member, could quite easily push these
households back into poverty," he said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that poverty reduction in the future will be
crucially dependent on stimulating rural off-farm enterprise
growth and the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
It also argued that a new generation of reform, which creates a
supportive environment for these enterprises, is urgently needed
to ensure that Vietnam can replicate in the future the success
that it has had in the past in reducing poverty.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Welcomes Upcoming Cyprus Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Thursday welcomed the proximity talks by the
parties of the two Cypriot communities to be held at the United
Nations from December 3 to 15, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the Security Council was briefed by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's Special Adviser for Cyprus Alvaro
de Soto on the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Soto said the talks would start on Friday morning and U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan would meet them one after the other,
the so-called proximity talks.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Council said this is a matter it continues
to follow with the closest interest, and it has stated repeatedly
that the status quo in Cyprus is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
The Council welcomed the agreement of the parties to start the
talks in New York in order to prepare the ground for meaningful
negotiations leading to a comprehensive settlement.
</P>
<P>
The Council expressed the hope that all concerned would
participate in the talks without preconditions and in a
constructive spirit.
</P>
<P>
The Council commended the efforts of the Secretary-General,
his Special Representative and Special Adviser to facilitate the
talks and conveyed to them the Council's full support.
</P>
<P>
Glafcos Clerides, President of Cyprus and leader of the Greek
Cypriots, and Rauf Denktash, leader of the Turkish Cypriots, have
been in New York for the talks. They are not known to have met
face to face for more than two years. The talks are expected to
last a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been virtually partitioned since 1974 when troops
from Turkey took over the north of the island in reaction to a
coup in Nicosia engineered by then ruling Greece. The two
communities have been estranged since 1963 when a government in
which both were represented broke apart amid violence.

BUCHAREST, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the
South-Eastern European Cooperation Process (SEECP) agreed here
Thursday on the text of the charter of good neighborliness
relations, stability, security and cooperation in South-Eastern
Europe to be signed at the summit in Bucharest next February.
</P>
<P>
At the one-day meeting in the Romanian capital, foreign
ministers from Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Romania and Turkey,
along with a Greek deputy foreign minister discussed the
mechanisms of the Stability Pact and the harmonization of the
positions of the states participating in the SEECP with various
regional projects, such as building roads and energy transport
routes by European Union financing.
</P>
<P>
Several documents were approved in the end, such as the
declaration of the foreign ministers of the SEECP states relative
to the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe, and the joint
declaration of the foreign ministers of the SEECP states.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no final success of the Stability Pact for South-
Eastern Europe without Yugoslavia," Romanian Foreign Minister
Andrei Plesu told reporters after the meeting. Yugoslavia, though
a member state of the SEECP, had not been invited to the meeting.
Moreover, Milan Petrovici, resident correspondent in Bucharest of
the famous Serb daily Politika, was not allowed to attend the
press conference after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The SEECP was designed to follow up on the meetings of foreign
ministers from all the Balkan states, which took place in 1988 in
Belgrade and in 1990 in Tirana and were cut short by the
Yugoslavia conflict. The SEECP participants are Albania, Bulgaria,
Greece, Macedonia, Romania, Turkey and Yugoslavia. Bosnia-
Herzegovina and Croatia attend as observers.

<HEADLINE> Compensation Paid to Sunken Ship Owner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai-based China Pacific
Insurance Company Ltd. (CPIC) has paid 2 million yuan as
compensation to The Yanda Shipping Company, owner of the ferry
Dashun which sank last month in the waters near Yantai.
</P>
<P>
This was the first payment for damages made since the accident
occurred on November 24. The money was for the cargo carried on
board the ship.
</P>
<P>
The Dashun was carrying 61 trucks loaded with cargo, which were
insured at a price of 3.05 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Since the accident, the Yantai Branch of the China Pacific
Insurance Company sent staff to the scene to participate in the
investigation and salvage efforts.
</P>
<P>
An official from the CPIC said the company will provide more
compensation when detailed losses are confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Some 262 passengers and 40 crew were on board the Dashun when
it was forced to reverse its course toward the port of Dalian in
northeast China's Liaoning Province due to gale-force winds and
huge waves.
</P>
<P>
The vessel sent out distress signals when flames were
discovered on the second deck at 4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
About 12 fishing boats, rescue ships, and navy vessels were
dispatched for recovery efforts but none were able to approach the
Dashun because of the strong winds and high waves. The vessel sank
at about 11:50 p.m.

<HEADLINE> Pudong Airport Freight Station Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 3 (Xinhua)-- The Pudong International
Airport freight station, with the joint investment of 479 million
yuan (nearly 55 million U.S. dollars), became operational today in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Funded by two Shanghai enterprises and the German Lufthansa
Cargo AG, which holds 29 percent of the total stock, the station
has become a key investment project of Lufthansa in China.
</P>
<P>
"We firmly believe that the perfect equipment and service of
the station will make Shanghai one of east Asia's major freight
airports," said Wilhelm Althen, board chairman of Lufthansa at the
opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The Pudong airport handles nearly 1,000 tons of freight each
year, 90 percent of which is international airmail. At present,
the station provides services to German, Japanese, American and
three Chinese aviation corporations.
</P>
<P>
The large handling capacity of Lufthansa, which has spread its
service to 450 sites around the world, gives plenty of business to
the freight station. The headquarters of its freight traffic
business has also been moved to Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Two More Bodies Found in Thai Oil Refinery Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Two more bodies were found on
Friday in one of Thailand's biggest oil refineries where fire
resulting from an explosion late Thursday night still rages on,
thus taking the toll to 4.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 other people were injured in the explosion and
fire, Channel 9, the state television station, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
So far, the fire has destroyed four of nine gasoline storage
tanks in the 220,000-barrel-a-day refinery, which is located in
Sri Racha in the eastern province of Chonburi.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 million liters of gasoline have been destroyed, causing
Thai Oil Co. Ltd., the country's largest refiner, some 500 million
baht (12.9 million U.S. dollar) losses.
</P>
<P>
Officials said they are trying to save the remaining 30 million
liters of gasoline by siphoning them off to safety.
</P>
<P>
Thai Oil has shut down the refinery indefinitely for safety
reason.
</P>
<P>
The police is mobilizing more fire engines to sustain the foam
spraying to prevent the fire from spreading further.
</P>
<P>
Officials on the site said that chances of the other tanks
catching fire are quite high because of the accumulating heat of
the four burning tanks and winds.
</P>
<P>
The initial investigation found that the explosion was caused
by fire sparks.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai inspected the site and
asked the firemen to put out the fire as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
According to Channel 9, a Thai army plane has been sent to
Singapore to ship back 52 tons of protective foam to boost the
supplies.

<HEADLINE> China to Spare No Effort in Oceanic Industry Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, December 3 (Xinhua) -- China plans to reform its
oceanic industry, giving more emphasis to scientific and
technological development, vice-minister of science and technology
said today.
</P>
<P>
Deng Nan made the announcement at today's conclusion of the
third experience exchange conference on oceanic industry
development.
</P>
<P>
She said that the key issue for expanding the industry is
finding a way to balance rapid growth with ecological protection.
</P>
<P>
China's entry into the World Trade Organization will bring
fiercer competition into the field, so the domestic companies must
develop their own special products to occupy the market. At the
same time, WTO entry will enable the domestic firms to learn
modern technology and operational experience from foreign
countries in the oceanic industry sector, Deng said.
</P>
<P>
Supportive industries are yet to be further developed, and the
main industries, including aquatics, require constant attention,
she added.
</P>
<P>
Increased funding for the industry at all government levels,
related technological breakthroughs, and fast growth of salt-water
aquatics have all pushed the progress of the industry in the past
few years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the output value increased from 1994's 17.
07 million to 330.6 billion yuan (about 39.67 billion U.S. dollars)
in 1998, and seven Chinese provinces' output value in the field
have already exceeded 30 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Rice, Corn Output Expected to Grow in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Rice and corn production in the
Philippines in 1999 is expected to rise by 38 percent to 11.8
million metric tons (MT) and 19.8 percent to 4.58 million MT,
respectively, from last year's record, the government said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Bureau of Agricultural Statistics (BAS) data indicate rice
output from January to September already reached 7.53 million MT,
the highest since 1994.
</P>
<P>
The BAS attributed the achievements to early plantings brought
about by better weather condition and sufficient water supply.
</P>
<P>
It also said that higher rice production will be sustained
until the first quarter of next year, with about 1.02 million
hectares intended for planting, from which around three million MT
rice may be harvested.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, corn production in 1999 will still manage to
grow by about 20 percent despite the expected decline in output
during the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
The expected decline in output may be attributed to the
continuous rainfall during planting and harvesting seasons which
may bring about a 7.7 percent reduction.
</P>
<P>
The same data show that corn output of 1.24 million MT is
expected during the first quarter of 2000 should the 672,000
hectares intended for planting will materialize in the fourth
quarter of 1999.

HELSINKI -- Finland, the rotating presidency of the European
Unions (EU), said Friday it is improper for the EU to request its
Eastern European applicants to close their nuclear stations built
by the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Finnish Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen said it is out of concern
for political reasons instead of security that the European
Council and some EU members asked for rapid closure of the nuclear
stations in the Eastern European countries applying for EU
membership.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the current EU members are not required to
close their nuclear stations and the applicants cannot be forced
to abide by the energy policy adopted by a certain EU member. (

<HEADLINE> First ATR72 Plane Tail Handed Over to Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, December 3 (Xinhua)-- Production of the first ATR72
airplane tail was finished and delivered to Italian Alenia
Aerospazio Co.(AAC) today by Xi'an Aircraft Industry Co.(AIC).
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that AIC has provided key airplane
parts to AAC since the production of ATR42 external wing boxes
last year.
</P>
<P>
The 5.71-meter-long and 2.87-meter-wide tail is made of 1,200
parts. The complex structure and assembly techniques are quite
challenging, said AIC experts.
</P>
<P>
The production agreement of a total of 140 tail parts of the
ATR72 aircraft was signed between the two sides in 1997. Today's
product is the first to be finished since the project was launched
in November the same year.
</P>
<P>
Developed by Alenia Aerospazio, the ATR turboprop series, with
two types -- ATR42 and ATR72 -- are the key models of the world's
branch line civil aircraft.
</P>
<P>
"We will further our cooperation with China in the ATR project
and we hope to give the production of the entire ATR72 airplane
body to China," said Salvatorc Grasso, the AAC manager of Asia-
Pacific Region.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- China will investigate mineral,
land environmental and geological resources in the western region
to create a scientific basis for the development strategy of
western China.
</P>
<P>
During a national teleconference today, Zhou Yongkang, minister
of land resources, said that policies will be made to encourage
investigating and exploiting mineral resources in the western
region next year.
</P>
<P>
China's western region, including ten provinces, municipalities
and autonomous regions such as Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Xinjiang
and Tibet, covers a vast area of 5.4 million square kilometers,
with a population of 285 million.
</P>
<P>
The western region has plenty of mineral resources, but the
economic level of the region lags far behind the southeastern
region.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders including Jiang Zemin and Zhu Rongji have
recently stressed the importance of stepping up exploitation of
the west.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Yongkang said today that China will further investigate
the cultivation areas on slopes and will offer information for
policy-making on returning slope farmland to forest and grassland.
</P>
<P>
China will also make more efforts to look for water in the
western region to solve the pressing water shortage, and will
focus on controlling desertification and ecological protection,
Zhou added.

<HEADLINE> Thai Tourism Records Robust Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's tourism industry has
recorded a robust growth in the first nine months of 1999 with
total tourist arrivals increasing 11.1 percent from the same
period in 1998 to 6.2 million, a press release of the Tourism
Authority of Thailand (TAT) said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
TAT said the performance is quite strong considering the fact
that May and June are low season months for the industry.
</P>
<P>
The country is now about to meet its target of 8.28 million
tourist arrivals for the year 1999, the release said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the growth of tourists visiting the country should
mainly be attributed to the strong economic performance in North
America and Europe, the economic recovery in Asia-Pacific
countries and the value for money offered by the Thai baht.
</P>
<P>
The growth in the first nine months of this year was also
marked by the increase of female, first-time and business
visitors, the release said.
</P>
<P>
Asia-Pacific travelers recorded a growth of 13.9 percent to
3.83 million in the period, marked by a surge of 115.5 percent in
arrivals from Indonesia and a 86.6 percent rebound in tourists
from South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Japan remained Thailand's biggest market with more than 802,453
arrivals during the nine months, or a 7.4 percent increase over
the same period last year. Malaysia ranked second with 722,112
arrivals.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan Sticks to Multi-Polarization Stand: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh President Nursultan
Nazarbayev stressed Friday the country's multi-polarization stand
and called for better performance of the U.N. in dealing with
international ties.
</P>
<P>
Compared with "the mono-polarization pattern" led by the
superpower and a few developed countries, "the multi-polarization
world" based on international laws and multilateral diplomacy is
an "ideal basis" to establish a firm, safe and harmonious
international order, said Nazarbayev when meeting foreign
diplomats and delegates from international organization.
</P>
<P>
He meanwhile called for strengthened function of the U.N.,
portraying it as a "unique" institution that could promote the
sound development of the relations among countries in the coming
21st century.
</P>
<P>
On foreign policy, Nazarbayev said the country will adopt the "
pluralism" policy and take precedence over its relations with the
CIS countries. He urged some CIS countries to abandon the "
national egoism" and push forward the process of economic
integrity.
</P>
<P>
Noting Asian countries' increasing status in global politics,
the president also emphasized the importance of developing
bilateral ties with those countries.

<HEADLINE> Russian Military Official Accuses Peacekeeping Operation in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, December 3 (Xinhua) -- A top Russian military official
Friday criticized the West's peacekeeping operation in the
Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot say today that the international presence in Kosovo
is successful," head of the International Cooperation Department
of the Russian Defense Ministry Leonid Ivashov said at a press
conference here.
</P>
<P>
Over 400 non-Albanians have been killed and more than 500
wounded since the international peacekeeping contingents were
deployed in Kosovo, Ivashov said.
</P>
<P>
More than 40,000 houses of Serbs, Gypsies and other non-
Albanians were ruined, looted or captured in Kosovo, and 50
Orthodox churches were destroyed, he added.
</P>
<P>
An exodus of non-Albanians continues and 250,000 refugees have
moved to Serbia, Montenegro and other regions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ivashov said NATO should be responsible for the current
situation in Kosovo, noting that "NATO (the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization) carried out an aggression against Yugoslavia and
usurped the right to establish a new world order."
</P>
<P>
NATO "is pursuing a purposeful policy aimed at Kosovo's
separation not only from Serbia but also from Yugoslavia," he said,
"NATO countries are doing all they can to back Kosovo's
independence."
</P>
<P>
Russia does not plan to fully restore relations with the
alliance, which were frozen around six months ago. "Russian
President Boris Yeltsin has not withdrawn his decision to keep
relations with NATO frozen," Ivashov said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Russia is not considering withdrawing its
peacekeeping group from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Russia is not going to weaken its role in any Kosovo
settlement, he said. "We are full-fledged participants in this
process. We will make every effort toward strict compliance with U.
N. Security Council Resolution 1244 by all sides without exception,
" he stressed.
</P>
<P>
In regard of ongoing reports that NATO might station nuclear
arms in its new members' territories, such as in Hungary, Ivashov
said "if such attempts are made, Russia's reaction will be tough."
</P>
<P>
If NATO continues to pursue its new strategic concept, " the
western group of the Russian army will certainly be strengthened,"
he warned.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Rate Remains at 4.1 Percent in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Department said
Friday that U.S. unemployment rate held steady at 4.1 percent in
November, as 234,000 workers found new jobs.
</P>
<P>
November's rate matched October's rate, the lowest since a 3.9
percent rate set in January 1970, the Department reported.
</P>
<P>
Employers added 234,000 jobs in November, slightly higher than
the 210,000 range some analysts were expecting. Workers found jobs
at bars and restaurants, day care centers, health care
establishments and in construction that overwhelmed a small loss
in factory and other jobs. The gain in payroll jobs in November
was in line with the average monthly increase over the last 12
months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation
pressures, grew by tiny 0.1 percent to 13.41 dollars in November.
That compared with a 0.3 percent gain in October, higher than the
scant 0.1 percent increase the government previously thought.
</P>
<P>
Although strong job growth is a good development for workers,
economists and members of the Federal Reserve worry that it could
be a recipe for inflation.
</P>
<P>
Despite the moderate gain in payroll jobs, manufacturing lost
just 2,000 jobs in November, an improvement from earlier this year.
Government analysts said that the recent downward trend in factory
jobs, which began in April 1998, has slowed dramatically over the
past several months.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that the number of factory jobs has fallen by
an average of 9,000 per month over the last five months, compared
with average losses of 36,000 during the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
U.S. manufacturers have seen foreign demand for their products
rebound somewhat from a global financial crisis that began in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In November, construction companies added 55,000 jobs,
reflecting good weather conditions for most of the country. Over
the past year, 283,000 workers have found jobs at construction
companies.
</P>
<P>
The service sector, the driving force of job creation in the
United States, added 181,000 jobs in November, with businesses
services leading the way with workers finding 120,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
Even though they are heading into the busy holiday shopping
season, retailers added just 1,000 jobs in November. Bars and
restaurants added 23,000 jobs, the first gain since July. This
increase and a small gain in employment at car dealerships were
offset by declines in jobs at clothing, furniture and other retail
stores.

billion rubles (around 32 billion U.S. dollars) and revenues be
797.2 billion rubles (about 29.9 billion dollars) next year.

The gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated at 5.350 trillion

2000.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government will use 220 billion rubles (8.2 billion
dollars) to repay the state debt.
</P>
<P>
During Friday's debate, the Duma returned the budget plan to
the third reading in order to adopt the amendments proposed by a
conciliation commission on financing the closed administrative
territories, known as ZATO.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the State Duma, Russian First Deputy Prime
Minister Viktor Khristenko said that after several days of
deliberations, the commission is proposing three main norms in the
2000 budget, called ZATO, which said largely closed cities of
military or nuclear importance will be financed.
</P>
<P>
He said an additional 2.6 billion rubles (about 10.4 million U.
S. dollars) would be allocated in next year's federal budget for a
development program for ZATO, Of which 2 billion rubles (about 8
million dollars) will come from the atomic energy ministry and 60
million rubles (about 2.4 million dollars) from the defense
ministry.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Trade Deficit to Reach 1 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, December 3 (Xinhua) - Bulgaria's trade deficit will
reach 1 billion U.S. dollars this year after achieving a trade
balance last year, according to the statistics bureau of Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's export declined 4 percent while import increased 13
percent in the first three quarters this year, the bureau was
quoted by a local newspaper as saying on Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, the textile export increased 30 percent in the same
period, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
The sharp tariff reduction on products from the European Union
and Bulgaria's joining the free trade zone of Central Europe led
the imports from EU and Central Europe in the same period to rise
by 18 percent and 20 percent relatively, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, because Bulgaria pushed forward its de-
nationalization plan to attract foreign investment, Bulgaria's
foreign exchange reserves are expected to climb to 3.1 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> China Proves to Be Marketplace Paradise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- China's transition to a market
economy received a major boost as the number of open marketplaces
in the country rose to some 56,000 by mid-year.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the National Bureau of
Statistics (NBS) today, there were 55,997 marketplaces of various
commodities around the country by the end of June, with a total
trade volume of more than 2.1 trillion yuan (250 billion U.S.
dollars) in 1998. In other words, every 100 Chinese people have a
stall or booth in the marketplaces,
</P>
<P>
The NBS and the State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC)
conducted a joint survey of all marketplaces at and above township
level around the country from May to July.
</P>
<P>
Results of the survey showed that marketplaces for trade of
commodities grew quickly in recent years. In 1998, trade volume of
the marketplaces increased by over 16 percent over 1997. In the
first half of this year, trade volume exceeded 1.12 trillion yuan,
reaching a record high.
</P>
<P>
Marketplaces in coastal areas and regions of ethnic groups grew
faster than in other places of the country.
</P>
<P>
Foodstuffs, apparel and daily necessities are the top three
categories in the marketplaces. Over 80 percent of the
marketplaces are retail markets.
</P>
<P>
According to NBS figures, a total of 9.2 million booths have
been leased in the markets, yielding more than 20 billion yuan in
rent every year. The government collects 16 billion yuan of taxes
from these booths every year.

<HEADLINE> Congo Peace Mediator to Be Named </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity will choose a facilitator to help put the nearly derailed
peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) back
on track, Ugandan State Minister for Regional Cooperation Amama
Mbabazi told reporters here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Although the Lusaka cease-fire agreement called for national
dialog within the DRC, the work had been greatly hampered due to
lack of a facilitator like in the Burundi peace process, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the alleged cease-fire violations in the central
African country had already been reported to the Joint Military
Commission, which is responsible for the implementation of the
Lusaka agreement. "You know, if any party is tired of peace and
wants to fight, war can erupt any time, " Mbabazi said.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed Uganda's commitment to the Lusaka peace accord
and appealed for stakeholders to contribute to the peace process
which is still very fragile.
</P>
<P>
Uganda appreciates any efforts aimed at restoring everlasting
peace to the war-ravaged country, he added.
</P>
<P>
The civil war in the DRC broke out in early August of 1998 with
 Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia sending troops to support DRC president
Laurent Kabila's government forces fighting against rebel groups
backed by Uganda and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire agreement was signed in Lusaka, Zambia on July
10 by all countries involved in the conflict and by the rebels at
the end of August.

<HEADLINE> Public Facilities to Be Installed for Disabled Filipinos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
decided to install supplementary facilities in public buildings to
provide the physically-handicapped easy access to these edifices,
Philippine News Agency (PNA) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The PNA quoted a latest administrative order as saying that the
Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) has been asked to
take the lead in this work.
</P>
<P>
Such disabled-friendly facilities include access ramps,
handrails, parking spaces, and toilet and restroom facilities, the
PNA added.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Education, Culture and Sports and the
Commission on Higher Education were also required to coordinate
with the DPWH in implementing the order.
</P>
<P>
This order was reportedly signed by Philippine President
Estrada in time for the observance of the International Day for
the Disabled on December 3.
</P>
<P>
"My administration fully supports the promotion of the rights
of disabled persons to participate fully in social life and
equalize the enjoyment of opportunities available to other
agencies," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
He also tasked the Department of Budget and Management to draw
funds to bankroll the installation of these facilities from
available sources.

BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese senior high schools
will use new Chinese textbooks when school starts next September,
shedding the current ones that have been on the shelves for the
past two decades.
</P>
<P>
Educational experts here say this means that China is aiming
for higher-quality education.
</P>
<P>
Gu Zhenbiao, senior editor of the People's Education Publishing
House, said that the new textbooks stress cultivation of students'
cultural understanding, aesthetic taste and literature
appreciation, adding that the ultimate goal is to improve students
' overall Chinese literature and language skills.
</P>
<P>
Gu said the new Chinese textbooks have many merits: senior high
schools can choose from two sets of new texts; two-thirds of the
texts of both sets were first tested for student approval; they
include reading, writing and oral Chinese exercises; a large
portion of the texts are devoted to ancient Chinese prose, and
they emphasize writing skills.
</P>
<P>
"All of the above efforts aim to give the younger generation a
solid Chinese language and literature foundation," Gu noted.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese education during the middle school period should help
students build up a kind of mental grounding which includes
aesthetic taste and literature quality," said Qian Liqun, a
professor from the Chinese Department of Beijing University.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Military Concerned Over Shell House Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine military showed
concern over the attack by rebels on the Pilipinas Shell House
here Thursday but did not see it as a signal of more attacks in
the urban center, the Philippine News Agency said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Armed Forces Chief of Staff Angelo Reyes was quoted as saying
that the military was concerned over the attack, but was confident
that the Philippine National Police (PNP) can handle the security
situation in Manila and other cities in the country.
</P>
<P>
Reyes said the attack was triggered by the increase of oil
prices, "so I would think that if this issue subsides, this thing
would not have happened."
</P>
<P>
The Alex Boncayao Brigade (ABB), a branch of the rebel group of
New People's Army (NPA), has reportedly claimed responsibility of
the attack, in which a security man was injured.
</P>
<P>
Police are looking for a "mystery woman" who can shed light on
the identity of the suspects.
</P>
<P>
A day after the attack, police failed to arrest the 10
suspects, including two women believed to be members of ABB.
</P>
<P>
The government has offered a 200,000 pesos (5,000 U.S. dollars)
reward for anyone who can lead the police to arrest the bombing
suspects.
</P>
<P>
The armed group used a rifle grenade in the Shell House
attack. They also sprayed automatic rifle before escaping on board
a taxi.

<HEADLINE> Senior High Schools to Adopt New Chinese Textbook (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gu said that the present Chinese textbook was compiled in 1979
and has been revised three times, but with little change.
</P>
<P>
Due to the frequent urging to update the present Chinese
textbook, People's Education Publishing House started in 1993 to
work on new senior high school texts.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education issued an outline of the new Chinese
textbooks and curriculum plans for trial operation in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The MOE will promote the use of the new textbook around the
country starting next autumn.
</P>
<P>
An official from the MOE said that new textbook will not affect
the national college entrance examination.
</P>
<P>
Chinese education departments have invited experts to discuss
revision of the Chinese textbook for primary and junior middle
school students. These experts also called for reform of the
Chinese textbooks for primary and middle schools in order to make
the pre-university Chinese education cohesive.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the MOE said that the Chinese government has spent
100 million yuan to reform curriculum in primary and middle
schools since the beginning of this year.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Is Y2K-Ready: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Ejercito Estrada said Friday that his country is ready to shield
critical sectors from the possible problems when the Y2K bug
strikes at the onset of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The president told reporters at the presidential palace that he
received this assurance from Secretary Filemon Uriarte of the
Department of Science and Technology, who is in charge of Y2K
preparations.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary of Science and Technology has already assured us
that we're already almost 100 percent compliant," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
Uriarte recently assumed the post of chairman of the
Presidential Commission on Year 2000 Compliance, which the
president tasked to coordinate efforts to prepare the country for
the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
Estrada's assurance came following reports quoting the
Philippine Central Bank as saying that the banking sector is ready
for the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
The president said the mission-critical sectors, which cover
finance, manufacturing, health care, government and
transportation, are ready for the bug when it strikes.
</P>
<P>
For his part, National Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre said
a contingency plan is in place should the preparations prove
insufficient.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre, who is also chairman of the National Y2K Contingency
Task Force, said the contingency plan is geared to restore
disrupted services, maintain law and order, and help provide
effective governance to agencies which may be affected by the Y2K
problem.
</P>
<P>
The contingency plan is the country's response to the Y2K
problem in case there will be some disruptions in some business
and basic services before, during and after the rollover period.

<HEADLINE> China Continuing Search for Bigfoot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have begun a
new campaign to search for the legendary half-man, half-ape
creature known as China's "Bigfoot" in the central forest region.
</P>
<P>
Wang Fangcheng, head of the Committee for Search for Rare
Animals and Plants, said that paleoanthropologists from the
prestigious Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and local experts
are on the hunt in Shennongjia Natural Reserve in central China's
Hubei province, believed to be the creature's home.
</P>
<P>
"After repeated frustrations in previous searches, many people
have become disappointed in finding Bigfoot, however, a few
scientists believe the possibility exists that such an animal is
still there," he said.
</P>
<P>
A team of scientists, reporters and local officials entered
Shennongjia in October this year after receiving reports that the
creature was sighted by a hunter in August.
</P>
<P>
According to the hunter, the animal was 2.5 meters tall,
covered with long, red hair, and moved very fast.
</P>
<P>
The scientists have discovered 40-cm-long footprints, brown
hair and chewed corn cobs at the spot where the hunter said he
encountered the strange beast.
</P>
<P>
After examining the evidence, Yuan Zhenxin, an established
paleoanthropologist from the CAS, excluded the possibility that
the animal was a bear.
</P>
<P>
"There are abundant forests, food and water in the Shennongjia
Natural Reserve which have a warm climate that quite suits the
Wild Man," Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have unearthed hundreds of fossilized teeth of the
extinct giant ape in the area, proving that Shennongjia was a home
to big primates.
</P>
<P>
Some scientists theorize that Bigfoot might be the offspring of
a giant ape, while many others doubt it even exists.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that tens of millions of life forms existed in
ancient China. Although some are now extinct, a few have survived
the global changes -- the giant panda, for example.
</P>
<P>
Yuan said that it is not easy to discover a new species.
Chinese books have for thousands of years recorded the existence
of the giant panda and called it a "colorful bear." However, the
animal was not found until 1895 by a French priest.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of local people have reported Bigfoot sightings over
the past decades. China has organized several high-profile
searches for the unidentified animal through the 1980s to 90s, but
no hard evidence was obtained.
</P>
<P>
Wang revealed further investigations will be done in the coming
year to make a conclusion that the creature is new species or just
a figment of the imagination.

<HEADLINE> Seventh National Polio Immunization Campaign Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
went to the Jieru Nursery in western Beijing today to unveil the
seventh national polio immunization campaign.
</P>
<P>
In the nursery, Li heard reports on China's efforts to
eradicate polio in various parts of the country. Later in his
visit, he spoon-fed oral polio vaccine (OPV) pills to babies.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization (WHO) has adopted the proposal to
eradicate polio worldwide by the year 2000. In line with this
action, the Chinese government has organized yearly campaigns for
expanded immunization since 1993. Leading Party and government
officials including Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Zhu Rongji and Li
Ruihuan participated in previous campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary data obtained from the WHO indicate that the number
of new polio cases reported worldwide dropped to just over 3,200
in 1998 -- the lowest count on record.
</P>
<P>
China successfully protects millions of children each year with
vaccinations, and no polio cases have been reported in China for
more than two years.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,600 immunization agencies and 64,000 township hospitals
have been included in the Chinese network since it was set up in
1978.
</P>
<P>
The vaccination rate among children was 85 percent in 1995 and
is supposed to surpass 90 percent by the year 2000, and China says
it will eradicate polio nationwide by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health has decided to carry out a larger
national immunization in all parts of the country in the winter-
spring period.

<HEADLINE> Maryland Apologizes for Honoring Falun Gong Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. state of Maryland
recently sent a letter of apology to the Chinese Embassy in the U.
S. for granting Li Hongzhi, leader of the illegal Falun Gong cult,
a certificate of honorary citizenship.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, sent to the Chinese Embassy in the U.S. from the
governor's office of Maryland, director of Federal Relations
Elizabeth R. Pyke expressed the "humblest and most sincere apology
" for doing it.
</P>
<P>
The letter explained the "governor personally is not aware of
the issuance of these certificates" for honorary citizenship,
which is routinely issued to a foreign visitor to the state upon
the request of a Maryland constituent while the visitor's
background is "not usually investigated."
</P>
<P>
"We do not use these token gestures to comment on the internal
political affairs of other nations," said the letter.
</P>
<P>
"No statement of support for any illegal activities in China
was intended by the issuance of this honorary citizenship which
conveys no legal or official status in any way," it added.
</P>
<P>
As a result of this incident, it said, procedures will be put
in place to ensure that such an action doesn't happen again.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Vietnamese Leaders Hail Progress in Solving Boundary Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Both Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
and General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Le Kha
Phieu hailed an agreement on bilateral land boundary issue reached
Friday as a "great achievement."
</P>
<P>
At their meeting held here Friday, Phieu said the agreed-upon
hopeful signing of a land boundary treaty later this month will be
a key milestone in the bilateral relations and a manifestation of
mutual trust between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Zhu attributed the achievement much to the political promotion
by Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Communist Party of China,
and Phieu. The two leaders reached an important consensus in
Beijing last February on the signing of a land boundary treaty
within this year and settle the delimiting of boundaries in the
Beibu Gulf next year, thus setting a guideline for the boundary
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the land boundary negotiation teams
will speed up their preparation for the signing of the treaty
within this year so that the two countries can enter the 21st
century with a common land boundary of peace, friendship and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier, who is on the third day of his four-day
visit to Vietnam, said the relations between the two communist
parties and the two countries have developed smoothly since the
normalization of relationship eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
A constant exchange of high-level visits means the
Sino-Vietnamese relations are becoming closer and closer, he said.
</P>
<P>
What is of special importance, Zhu said, is that Jiang and
Phieu have set up a framework for bilateral relations in the new
century -- with an overall point of view which features strategic
perspective and bilateral friendship.
</P>
<P>
This shows that the relations between the two parties and the
two countries have entered a new historical phase of development,
he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Phieu said Vietnam will never forget the immense help China
gave it during its course of national liberation and construction.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the guiding principle he set with Jiang in
Beijing last February, that is, the principle of building a
future-oriented relationship of long-term stability,
good-neighborliness and all-round cooperation.
</P>
<P>
This bespeaks a deep mutual trust between the two parties and
the two countries, to which nothing can cause harm, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu and Phieu agreed that their countries can make up their own
deficiencies by learning from each other and they should all the
more strengthen their cooperation in the context of the
complicated and complex regional and world situation nowadays.

<HEADLINE> Finland Describes Demand for Nuke Station Closure Improper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Finland, the rotating
presidency of the European Unions (EU), said Friday it is improper
for the EU to request its Eastern European applicants to close
their nuclear stations built by the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Finnish Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen said it is out of concern
for political reasons instead of security that the European
Council and some EU members asked for rapid closure of the nuclear
stations in the Eastern European countries applying for EU
membership.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the current EU members are not required to
close their nuclear stations and the applicants cannot be forced
to abide by the energy policy adopted by a certain EU member.
</P>
<P>
During Lipponen's visit to Austria on Tuesday, Austrian Prime
Minister Viktor Klima stressed his country's demand for immediate
closure of the nuclear stations in Slovakia and Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
Lipponen said the EU has never taken closure of the nuclear
stations as a precondition for the applicants to join the
organization.
</P>
<P>
The two reactors at the Loviisa Nuclear Station in Finland were
also built by the former Soviet Union, similar to the Bohunice
Nuclear Station in Slovakia, but none of the EU members had ever
asked Finland to close the nuclear reactors before its entry into
the EU.
</P>
<P>
Lipponen said the nuclear station issue will not hinder the EU
expansion and principles set at the Tampere meeting earlier, which
allows the second wave of EU applicants to participate in the
negotiations, will be reaffirmed in the upcoming EU summit here.

<HEADLINE> Bureau Director in Hunan Given Death Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Lin Guoti, former director of
the Machinery Industry Bureau of Hunan Province, was sentenced to
death today following his conviction on charges of bribery.
</P>
<P>
His son, Lin Ruhai, was sentenced to life in prison, and his
wife, Zhao Youjuan, to six years in jail.
</P>
<P>
According to the judgment of the first ruling, Lin Guoti
colluded his son and wife in accepting total bribe payments of 5.
27 million yuan in the years from 1992 to 1998, when he served as
bureau director. Lin's wife attempted to cover up the activities
by hiding money and purchases made with the bribes.
</P>
<P>
Lin and his son appealed the first ruling to the Higher People'
s Court. Further investigations revealed the bribes taken by Lin
Guoti individually and with others totaled 4.87 million yuan.
Though the amount verified in the second ruling was slightly less
than the first figure, it did not alter the original judgment.
</P>
<P>
The Hunan Higher People's Court said that execution was the
proper punishment for Lin's crimes. It rejected Lin's appeal and
affirmed the original judgment.

<P>
MOSCOW, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian troops have liberated
the third largest Chechen town of Argun, a top Russian military
official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
General Valery Manilov, first deputy chief of the Russian
General Staff told reporters that the Russian federal units have
driven Chechen militants out of Argun, five kilometers east of
Grozny, capital of the breakaway republic, and a mopping-up
operation is now underway in the town.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the headquarters of the Chechen militants also
admitted the loss of Argun.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters said their units left Argun because "a long-
term defense in several places of major combat is now impossible."
</P>
<P>
On Thursday evening, the eastern group of the Russian federal
force blocked all traffic from the town to Shali, Gudermes and
Grozny. Then Russian armored columns entered Argun from east and
south, but no significant clashes were reported in the town during
the night, said the Chechen command.

BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid, together with hundreds of Chinese Muslims,
attended this afternoon's service in the 1,000-year-old Niujie

The mosque is located on Niujie Street, an area mainly
inhabited by Muslims. It has received more than 30,000 visitors
from more than 100 countries and regions, including heads of state
of southeast Asia, west Asia and north Africa, over the past two
decades.

<HEADLINE> China Willing to Help Vietnam in Economic Development: Zhu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji said here Friday that China is willing to help Vietnam in
its economic course of overall development, readjustment of
structure and improvement of performance.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Du Moi, former secretary general of the
Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) and now the advisor to the CPV
Central Committee, Zhu said China also wants to share experience
and increase exchanges with Vietnam as a way to promote the
bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said he had a good meeting with his Vietnamese counterpart
Phan Van Khai Thursday and reached an agreement in principle on
bilateral relations, especially on the development of economic and
trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Moi told Zhu that Vietnam will never forget the disinterested
help rendered by China in the past.
</P>
<P>
He said he was pleased and gratified to see the great
achievements made by China in socialist construction and in its
foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
At a separate meeting with Zhu earlier Friday, Nong Duc Manh,
chairman of Vietnam's National Assembly, expressed his
satisfaction with the rapid development of the bilateral relations
between Vietnam and China in various fields.
</P>
<P>
China's experience in reforms and economic construction is very
important to Vietnam, and Vietnam's National Assembly will further
increase its exchanges with the National People's Congress of
China, he said.

<HEADLINE> India Raises Crude Oil Royalty by 30 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government Friday
announced a 30 percent increase in royalty on crude oil, raising
it from 578 rupees (13.44 U.S. dollars) per ton to 750 rupees
(17.44 dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
An official release said that the decision, requested from the
states, will benefit all the Indian oil producing states.
</P>
<P>
The new rate of ad-hoc royalty was to be effective from June
this year and a new scheme of royalty would be evolved in the next
six months in consultation with the concerned states.
</P>
<P>
The new royalty regime has also been necessitated due to phased
dismantling of the Administered Pricing Mechanism in the petroleum
sector and the substitution of cost plus pricing by import parity.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Eliminate "Ghost Soldiers" from Payroll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- A head-count of military
personnel is imminent to ascertain the actual number to eliminate
"ghost soldiers" from the payroll, Nigerian Defense Minister
Theophilus Danjuma has said.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to organize a census to establish the actual
number of military officers and men," Danjuma said in Abuja
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The move is obviously in regard of the planned rationalization
in the armed forces, the Guardian newspaper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the "ghost soldier" phenomenon, which means
that some soldiers actually do not exist yet the officers still
count them so as to get extra salaries, is wide spread in the west
African nation's armed forces
</P>
<P>
Speaking in July of the planned rationalization, he had said
the army would be pruned to 30,000; Navy, 10,000; and Air Force,
10,000.
</P>
<P>
Danjuma noted that the Nigerian military has adjusted to and
accepted its new role as specified by the Constitution.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladesh Vulnerable to Y2K Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- With less than one month left
before the year 2000 arrives, Bangladesh is still unsure whether
all its computers have been made "millennium bug-free."
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is among the 12 "worst-prepared" countries in the
world to handle the millennium bug, or the Y2K problem, although
it formed a national committee in as early as May 1998 to tackle
the millennium problem, according to the Britain-based
International Monitoring, a technology consulting group.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar organized by the Bangladesh Computer Samity and
others recently, State Minister for Planning Mohiuddin Khan
Alamgir said the Y2K problem was unlikely to unleash any
catastrophic damage in Bangladesh since the country had very
limited use of computers.
</P>
<P>
Sirajul Islam, the Y2K coordinator of the Bangladesh Computer
Samity, said the country's energy sector had achieved 97 percent
of compliance, banking sector 95 percent, and telecommunications
90 percent.
</P>
<P>
But computer experts said that without 100 percent compliance,
any major breakdown could affect large-scale industries. They said
it was difficult to predict what would happen to Bangladesh when
the country greets the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The American Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Bangladesh has
warned its members to leave Dhaka with a view to avoid the
millennium glitch.
</P>
<P>
A recent editorial in The Financial Express daily newspaper
said there was a strong probability that the Bangladesh Power
Development Board could be hard hit by Y2K because it made
extensive use of computers and its computer systems in greater
part had been hardly screened for Y2K adaptation and compliance,
and consequently, water supply in urban areas could be similarly
affected by disrupted electricity.
</P>
<P>
As a preventive measure, Bangladesh's national airlines, Biman,
has decided to recall all its aircraft from midnight December 31
to 7 a.m. the next day and the flights would remain suspended
during the period to avoid any eventualities due to the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
Biman officials said a rollover test was quite expensive
because it had a limited number of aircraft, and a single rollover
test involved a huge amount of dollars. A rollover test means
changing dates of all chips in advance and carrying out a test run
to see how they function.
</P>
<P>
The Dhaka Stock Exchange, one of the country's two bourses,
would carry out mock automated trading in mid-December by changing
internal dates of computers to December 31 and rolling over to
year 2000 to ensure a smooth transition to the new millennium,
while the Chittagong Stock Exchange would try to bypass the
millennium bug by going back the manual trading system in case its
automated procedure was bogged down.
</P>
<P>
But the stock exchanges, with their members dialing in to the
system and trading on-line, could not consider themselves to be
free from such glitches unless the Bangladesh Telegraph and
Telephone Board declared itself fully Y2K-ready.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Express editorial called on the authorities in
various utility bodies to brace themselves on an emergency basis
to try to prepare as much as possible within the short time
available to achieve as much Y2K compliance as possible.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K problem is caused by the common programming practice of
using the last two digits in a date to represent a particular
year, such as 98 for 1998, and with the onset of the new century,
the year digits will show 00, which may be interpreted by the
computer as 1900, giving erroneous results which may halt normal
operations of the computer systems.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Crossed Swords With U.S. Over WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 3 (Xinhua) -- South African Trade and
Industry Minister Alec Erwin publicly crossed swords with U.S.
President Bill Clinton over how to make the World Trade
Organization (WTO) more accountable, a South African newspaper
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Erwin, in a toughly-worded statement to the WTO plenary, blamed
Tuesday' s unrest in Seattle on the U.S. government for failing to
generate a public consensus on the institution, the Business Day
reported.
</P>
<P>
The South African trade minister came close to suggesting that
the United States was using the protests to force issues such as
labor and environmental standards onto the WTO's agenda, which
many developing countries fear will become an excuse for rich
country protectionism.
</P>
<P>
The workings of the WTO could not be "held hostage" by the
"incoherent response of the U.S. to their own domestic pressures,"
Erwin said.
</P>
<P>
"It is not clear to us whether this whole badly managed
exercise was designed to give us some insight into the pressures
the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, the European Union (EU) are
facing," Erwin said.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries viewed the WTO as a "platform on which we
can build a fairer and more equitable trading system", the
newspaper reported.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Abuja Exchange Gets Take-off Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Securities and Exchange
 Commission has given promoters of the Abuja Stock Exchange a
40-day ultimatum to begin business.
</P>
<P>
Director-General of the commission, Malam Ndanusa, disclosed
this in Nigeria's commercial hub Lagos Thursday. But he was
silent on the penalty that awaits the exchange if it fails to meet
the deadline.
</P>
<P>
The provisional registration earlier granted for the Abuja
Stock Exchange expired on November 30,1999, the Guardian newspaper
Friday quoted Ndanusa as saying.
</P>
<P>
"However, in consideration of the enormous infrastructure
outlay and understandable take-off requirement which it has to
provide, we have granted four months extension to the exchange,"
the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the Abuja exchange promoters are at present
shopping for software that would adapt to international
requirements when trading eventually begins.
</P>
<P>
Ndanusa noted that members of the House of Representatives
Sub-committee on Government Investment and Insurance had contended
that the establishment of the Abuja exchange is unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government had, while unveiling this year's
budget, promised an early take-off of the exchange in the capital
city.
</P>
<P>
However, some other members of the House sub-committee said the
decision to establish exchange in Abuja "is inconsistent with
government's resolve to privatize public enterprises."
</P>
<P>
The legislators pointed out that since the exchange in Lagos is
only about 10 percent utilized, there is no need to have dual
exchange in the country when other exchanges in the world are
merging.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian PM Orders to Probe Court Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun
Sen Friday urged authorities concerned to step up the enforcement
of the law to enhance the reform of nation's judicial system.
</P>
<P>
In a decree to the ministries of justice, interior, defense,
and national police as well as provincial governors and mayors,
Hun Sen orders them to arrest the suspects allegedly released by
Phnom Penh municipal court by illegal procedures and to bring them
to justice.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen's decree was a response to the complaint of Phnom Penh
Governor Chea Sophara, who on Tuesday made a blistering attack on
the Municipal Court, charging officials with systematic corruption
and bribe taking.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sophara said he had evidence to prove that municipal court
officials accepted massive bribes to release some of the country's
most dangerous criminals.
</P>
<P>
The governor also sent a letter of protest to King Norodom
Sihanouk, Prime Minister Hun Sen and Justice Minister Uk Vithun,
in connection with the court's recent release of suspects.
</P>
<P>
"In order to stop the illegal acts in the enforcement of the
law and to improve the social order and security," Hun Sen said,
"authorities concerned must make a thorough investigation and find
out the reason why the criminals were illegally released or
exempted from prosecution."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that a special task team must be sent
at once to investigate the case and report the results to him as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"We respect the independence of the court, but we'll never
allow anyone to use their position and power to undermine the
interests of the nation and the people," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to find out those bad people in the judicial
authorities in an effort to guard the sanctity of the law," the
prime minister said.

<HEADLINE> HK Govt Welcomes Ruling by Court of Final Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region Friday welcomed the ruling
which upholds the legality of the interpretation of provisions of
the Basic Law related to the right of abode by the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Security Regina Ip made these remarks Friday
immediately after the court handed down its judgment on a case
involving 17 Chinese mainland persons claiming the right of abode
in a judicial review of the removal orders issued against them by
the Director of Immigration.
</P>
<P>
"The court's judgment confirms that the interpretation of
Article 22(4) and 24(2) and (3) of the Basic Law made by the NPC
Standing Committee on June 26 this year is legal and
constitutional," Ip said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary said that the government would continue to deal
with overstayers and illegal immigrants in accordance with the
Immigration Ordinance and the Court of Final Appeal's decision.
</P>
<P>
In terms of immigration control, the most significant aspect of
the judgment is that it confirms the constitutional basis for
regulating entry of eligible persons in the mainland in accordance
with the Certificate of Entitlement and One-Way Permit Schemes, a
government spokesman said early Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the government's decision to seek interpretation,
the spokesman said the court had confirmed that the government had
acted entirely constitutionally and legally.
</P>
<P>
"The course we have taken in resolving the right of abode issue
has the support of a majority of members of the Legislative
Council and the public," he added.
</P>
<P>
Law Officer Ian Wingfield stressed that the NPC Standing
Committee's interpretation did not affect the right of abode
acquired under the judgment of the Court of Final Appeal on the
relevant cases dated January 29, 1999 by the parties concerned in
the relevant legal proceedings.

<HEADLINE> OAU Hails Mandela as New Burundi Peace Mediator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim has
expressed optimism on the new development of Burundi peace process
after retired South African President Nelson Mandela was named as
the new mediator.
</P>
<P>
Mandela would become an effective facilitator of the stalled
peace talks just like his predecessor, former Tanzanian President
Julius Nyerere, Salim said in Tanzania's northern town of Arusha
where the the Great Lakes Summit was held Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I'm more optimistic than pessimistic," Tanzania's Guardian
newspaper Friday quoted Salim as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It is true there is a sense of fatigue on the part of the
international community but it is also true that considerable
progress had been made," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Mandela had been contacted and agreed to the
terms of reference before his appointment as the new Burundi peace
facilitator, Salim said he had been in touch with him over the
issue and already knew of Mandela's commitment and concern on the
situation in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
However, the OAU leader insisted that Africa should not expect
miracles form Mandela after his new assignment.
</P>
<P>
"Mandela cannot produce any miracle. The everlasting peace in
Burundi will be brought about by Burundians themselves not
outsiders," Salim pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that there was a general feeling that the Burundi
peace process was taking too long amid continued killings inside
the strife-torn country.

<HEADLINE> Nujoma Holds on to Lead as Namibia Counts Votes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 70-year-old Nujoma had gathered more than three times the
votes of his nearest challenger, Ben Ulenga, 47, from the
10-month-old Congress of Democrats (COD), spokesman Peter Mietzner
for Electoral Commission of Namibia said.
</P>
<P>
"Nujoma is an icon in this country, as much as Mandela is in
South Africa," Mietzner was quoted by reports as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma has been expected to win a third term, possible after a
controversial amendment was made to the constitution that allowed
a president only two terms.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma's SWAPO was leading the parliamentary vote with over
57,500 votes, compared to the COD's over 11,000 votes, Mietzner
said.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, the official opposition in
the past parliament, was lagging in third place, with smaller
parties mustering only a few hundred votes each.
</P>
<P>
Officials expect to officially announce the winners of the poll
on Monday but the victors were expected to be clear before then.
</P>
<P>
Ballot counting in the vast and sparsely populated country's
103 constituencies started Thursday after voting on Tuesday and
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The poll was marked by a good turnout, which authorities said
could exceed the 73 percent turnout in 1994. A record 878,000
voters registered out of a population of 1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
SWAPO led the Atlantic Ocean country to independence from South
Africa's former apartheid rulers after a bitter bush war.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predict it will keep the bulk of the 72 seats in the
constitutional assembly but could lose its two-thirds majority,
perhaps to the COD, formed in March by disillusioned SWAPO
members.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR to Assist Tanzania Punish Refugee Outlaws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has assured that it, in
collaboration with the Tanzanian government, would take legal
actions against refugees who contravened national or international
laws.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to receive genuine refugees but those who break
the law will be punished accordingly," said Vincent Parker, UNHCR
Senior External Relations Officer.
</P>
<P>
Both the UNHCR and the Tanzanian government have been very keen
on the issue of security in the refugee camps in the country, and
some refugees have been arraigned for breaking the law, the
Guardian newspaper Friday quoted Parker as saying.
</P>
<P>
All together, 306 unruly refugees were sentenced last September
in west Ngara District and Kigoma Region after they were proved
guilty, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. official, Tanzanian police and security
personnel have been working very actively to ensure that refugee
camps keep the purpose for which they were established.
</P>
<P>
"UNHCR is interested in a durable solution of the conflict so
that refugees are repatriated to their homes," Parker said.
</P>
<P>
Due to insecurity and suspension of non-essential U.N.
operations outside Bujumbura, the UNHCR in Tanzania halted
repatriation of refugees to Burundi in mid-October.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Asked to Choose Between COMESA, SADC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Some member countries of the
Southern African Customs Union (SACU) are asking Zambia to quit
either the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA)
or the Southern African Development Community (SADC) before it
joins the SACU.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed countries said that Zambia cannot be a member of
both COMESA and SADC while trying to join SACU to enjoy duty-free
export to SACU member countries, the Times of Zambia reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The new condition is the major obstacle blocking Zambia from
entering SACU, sources from the Zambian Commerce Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Zambia is still negotiating on the issue with SACU, the sources
added.
</P>
<P>
SACU members are South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Lesotho and
Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that the 21-member COMESA and the 14-member
SADC seems to increasingly become rivals in economic terms as
their steps of integration quicken up.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Diet Enacts Bills to Tighten Control of AUM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Diet, or parliament,
Friday enacted two bills aimed at tightening control of AUM
Shinrikyo, which was responsible for the 1995 sarin nerve gas
attack on the Tokyo subway system, and facilitating redress to the
cult's victims.
</P>
<P>
The bills, which were approved by the House of Representatives
or lower house on November 18, cleared the House of Councilors (
upper house) with the support of the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party (LDP) and its coalition partners, the Liberal Party (LP) and
the New Komeito party, as well as the major opposition Democratic
Party of Japan (DPJ).
</P>
<P>
The legislation is expected to take effect on December 27, two
days earlier than originally planned, Japanese government
officials said.
</P>
<P>
One of the bills, submitted by the Japanese government, will
allow the Public Security Investigation Agency to regularly
supervise or restrict the activities of AUM followers.
</P>
<P>
The bill does not specifically name AUM, but says the purpose
of the legislation is to impose controls on any group whose
members have carried out or attempted "indiscriminate mass-murder,
including ones using sarin, during the past 10 years," in effect
limiting its scope exclusively to AUM.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government drafted the bill after receiving
complaints from local governments, asking for measures against
increasing cases of friction between local residents and AUM. The
cult has been trying to expand its presence nationwide and has
encountered local resistance in the process.
</P>
<P>
Many AUM members, including its founder, Shoko Asahara, are on
trial or have been found guilty of a series of crimes including
the subway gassing which killed 12 people and injured more than 5,
000.
</P>
<P>
The other bill, submitted by the LDP and its two coalition
partners, is aimed at facilitating the seizure of AUM's hidden
assets so that they can be distributed to victims of crimes
committed by AUM as compensation.

the Indonesian and Chinese governments have committed themselves
to promoting bilateral trade and economic relations, according to

Wahid said at the China-Indonesia Economic and Trade Seminar
sponsored by the China Council for the Promotion of International
Trade (CCPIT) that bilateral economic ties, based on mutual
respect, have broad prospects. He also promised that the
Indonesian government will provide convenience to help facilitate
bilateral economic and trade flow.
</P>
<P>
CCPIT President Yu Xiaosong said that the two economies feature
strong complementarity, adding that the visit by Wahid immediately
after he assumed presidency has shown his determination to promote
Sino-Indonesian relations, and has undoubtedly provided
opportunities for cooperation between entrepreneurs of both
countries.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Indonesian trade volume had risen by threefold to 4.51
billion US dollars in 1997 since the resumption of bilateral
relations in 1990. The trade volume dropped though in 1998 due to
the impact of the Asian financial crisis, but reported a recovery
this year with a 34.1 percent increase in the first ten months
compared to the same period last year.

nations and there must be a solution that does not contravene or
undermine the principles on which the United Nations itself was

BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- East China's Mount Wuyi and the
1,000-year-old Dazu Rock Carvings in southwest China's Chongqing
Municipality have become the latest additions to the 21 Chinese
cultural and natural sites listed on UNESCO's World Heritage List.

Mount Wuyi in Fujian Province is described as "an outstanding
conservation area" and "a refuge for a large number of animals and
plants".
</P>
<P>
The Dazu Rock Carvings in the steep hillsides of Dazu County
contain an exceptional number of rock carvings dating from the 9th

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Reiterates His Stand on Condom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi has reiterated his stand on condom use in the face of the AIDS
disaster, the East African Standard newspaper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
A furious storm has raged over condom use since Monday when Moi
openly nodded condom use as one way of preventing HIV/AIDS
infection.
</P>
<P>
Catholic Church is strongly opposed to the practice, claiming
that the improvement of morals is the way of stopping the spread
of the fatal disease.
</P>
<P>
But President Moi said Thursday that the clergy should be
realistic and support the use of condoms as one way of combating
the AIDS pandemic.
</P>
<P>
He added that he would willingly tell Kenyans to abandon
condoms if he was assured that all were genuinely devout
christians.
</P>
<P>
The president said that professing Christianity is not enough
to protect Kenyan Catholics from the ravage of the killer disease.
</P>
<P>
Moi told an archbishop in central Kenya that while Catholic
Church leaders may be telling their followers not to use condoms,
he as a president is responsible for all Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
"I'm responsible for all," Moi said. "I say use condoms."

<HEADLINE> Tourism Industry Rebounds in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The tourism industry in the
Philippines has rebounded from the slump triggered by the Asian
economic crisis starting in 1997, the government said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Secretary Gemma Araneta said as of September this year,
visitor arrivals in the country totaled 1.58 million, receipts
totaling 1.75 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that the Philippines will have 2.4 million
tourists by the year 2000," Araneta said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines only attracted 1.6 million tourists in 1997 due
to the financial crisis in Asia and other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
According to the secretary, tourism contributed 8.7 percent to
the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) while capital investment
in tourism accounted for 10.5 percent of the total investment in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The growing industry also generated 2.3 million jobs, which is
8.7 percent of the entire Philippine workforce.
</P>
<P>
"I am hopeful that by the year 2004, there will be at least 4.4
million (arrivals) and increased tourist spending by five percent
in order to reposition the Philippines as a major destination in
Asia," Araneta said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Tourism Department is focusing on eco-tourism
program which aims, among others, to further increase the
country's tourist arrivals, Araneta said.
</P>
<P>
The government will formulate a national eco-tourism plan to
promote self-regulations against abusive form of tourism, and to
maximize the potential of tourism in the country, she added.

TOKYO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed mixed in
Tokyo Friday on profit-taking following their early gains.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 146.27 points, or 0.79

<HEADLINE> Tanzania-Zambia Railway Advised to Strengthen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania-Zambia Railway
Authority has been advised to strengthen its marketing strategies
in face of the increasing competition from the road transport
sector, Times of Zambia newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
President of the Zambia Institute of Marketing, Hapenga Kabeta,
said that the railway authority needs to change its concept that
its market is a guaranteed one prior to the implementation of the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) zero
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
"With the removal of tariff barriers in the COMESA region next
year, there is a likelihood of increased commercial traffic from
the east African region to the southern African region," Kabeta
said, commenting on the reported fall in the amount of cargo
transported by the railway company in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
It is important for the Tanzania-Zambia railway to work on the
customers' need and constantly re-define who constitutes the
market in order to be abreast of the shifts in the market, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Turn-around time needs to be improved in order to cut delays
which are an additional cost to customers, Kabeta added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Tanzanian Minister for Communications and
Transport Ernest Nyanda said that the volume of cargo moved by the
railway has declined in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The 663,000 tons of cargo transported by the company in the
1995/96 financial year has not been equalled up to now.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian Institute of Marketing has been working closely
with the railway authority for some time and has put forward
suggestions aimed at strengthening the operations of the company's
marketing directorate.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Police exchanged fire
with heavily-armed Somali militiamen who raided Diff police
station in Warji District in Kenya's North Eastern Province
Wednesday, the Daily Nation reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
About 20 men in military fatigue of the former Somali National
Defence Forces armed with AK-47 assault rifles attacked the
police post in the morning, said North Eastern provincial police
chief Jeremiah Matagaro.
</P>
<P>
A Kenya police squad fought off the raiders, sending them
fleeing into bush, Matagaro said, adding that his security forces
are tracking down the Somali militiamen and also on alert along
the common border with Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The attack came hours after Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
told members of the warring Somali factions resident in Kenya to
go back to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
Moi also said his government would not allow any threat to the
country's security as refugees had brought firearms into the
country and contributed to increased insecurity.
</P>
<P>
In August, President Moi closed the Kenya-Somalia border and
banned all flights between the two countries, citing security
reasons.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Open Telecoms Industry Further: Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Singapore will move to
deregulate its telecommunications industry further to secure its
place as one of the premier info-communications hubs in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said this
Friday at the official inauguration of the Info-communications
Development Authority of Singapore (IDA).
</P>
<P>
The new statutory board was formed from the merger of the
Telecommunications Authority of Singapore and the National
Computer Board.
</P>
<P>
Lee said Singapore must adapt to a new environment featured by
the fast application and renovation of information technology in
various fields.
</P>
<P>
The founding of IDA was part of the Singapore government's
integrated approach responding to the rapid convergence of
technologies and the changing environment, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that an open and fully competitive environment for
info-communications is profoundly in Singapore's economic
interests.
</P>
<P>
"It will spur the industry to strive for a quantum leap in
quality of services, competitive pricing, and creative
exploitation of emerging technology," he added.
</P>
<P>
The IDA will continue to act vigorously to remove any obstacles
to greater competition and faster pace of innovation, while at the
same time ensuring inter-connectivity between competitors for the
benefit of consumers, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We aim to emerge a winner in the digital future, IDA will play
a key role in leading Singapore to meet these challenges of
succeeding as an information economy and society," Lee said.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Telecoms to Be Disconnected in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- All business telecommunication
centers in Zambia operating without a licence after January 18,
2000 will be disconnected, the Zambian communications authority
has warned.
</P>
<P>
Lotty Kakubo, Assistant Controller of Licensing and Customer
Affairs, said in a press release lately that a number of people
and companies have set up telecommunication centers illegally.
</P>
<P>
According to Section 11 of the Telecommunication Act of 1999,
anyone operating a telecenter without a licence is supposed to be
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
"Any person who is not a holder of an operators licence
authorizing him to do so establishes or provides, or offers to
provide a telecommunication service shall be guilty of an
offence," the Zambia Daily Mail newspaper Friday quoted Kakubo as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He said a telecenter includes any point of reselling telephone,
internet and fax services anywhere in the country whether a house,
shop, market or hotel premises.

<HEADLINE> Scores of Kenyans Smuggled into Britain Each Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Scores of Kenyans are smuggled
into Britain as refugees by an international syndicate every year,
the British High Commission in Kenya has revealed.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi-based syndicate smuggles its willing victims
through Tanzania, Italy and France by using forged or stolen
documents like birth certificates and passports, the East African
Standard daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Investigations by the daily staff showed that the charge was
as high as 400,000 shillings (about 5,350 U.S. dollars) for air
tickets, fake documents and accommodation in transit countries.
</P>
<P>
Press Attache at the British High Commission, Rufus Drabble,
confirmed the existence of the scam, adding that several
undeserving people have landed in Britain and got "political
asylum".
</P>
<P>
The British government is fully aware that the channel
continued to be used for clandestine entry and is in close contact
with European partners to combat the smuggling, Drabble said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Banks Consider to Unify Bourse Share Types </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's banks are considering
to unify their different share types in the Beirut Stock Exchange
(BSE) in an attempt to make it easier for investors to buy and
sell stocks in the sector.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Banks in Lebanon sent a draft law to the
Central Bank last week that would eliminate the A, B and C
categories and the restrictions associated with each, the Daily
Star newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Shares in the A category are only available to Lebanese
investors and must account for at least 33 percent of a bank's
total shares.
</P>
<P>
They are often held by the controlling management of the banks
or their families and representatives.
</P>
<P>
The B category is open to both foreign and domestic investors.
The C category was created to enable banks to list on the Beirut
bourse after its reopened in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Regulations allow banks to list only 30 percent of their stock
on the exchange in the form of C shares. The remaining A and B
shares are not publicly traded and can only change hands with the
permission of the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
"We want to remove the obstacles to trading bank shares. That's
the main task," said Makram Sader, the association's
secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
The current version of the proposal would mean all the shares
in a particular bank would be traded in the same way, either
over-the-counter or on a stock exchange, said Marwan Nsouli, a
vice-governor of the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
That means shares in the five banks already listed on the BSE
would in theory all be tradable on the exchange.
</P>
<P>
That might translate into higher turnover and new bank
listings on the dormant Beirut bourse, which has lost more than 30
percent since the start of this year amid ever-decreasing volume,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The BSE reopened in 1996 after the country's 1975-1990 civil
war. A total of 12 companies, mostly banks, are currently listed
on the bourse.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Residential Gateway Market to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Bringing Internet
connectivity throughout the household will allow the emerging
market for residential gateway hardware to reach 4.7 billion U.S.
dollars worldwide by 2005, according to a report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The rollout of broadband and home networking solutions will
converge to produce this significant new category of products,
said the report from the U.S. technology research think-tank
Allied Business Intelligence, Inc. (ABI).
</P>
<P>
The residential gateway is an intelligent hardware device
connecting home devices and appliances to the Internet. It may
also incorporate the network access interface. In many cases such
devices will be primarily marketed as access devices with
integrated home networking functionality. These all-in-one boxes
will allow service providers to deliver multiple services by
deploying a single box on the customer premises.
</P>
<P>
The rollout of broadband access devices will also allow service
providers to deliver integrated services such as data, video and
voice to the home, said the report. By 2005, over 23 million North
American households will subscribe to broadband service, according
to ABI's prediction.
</P>
<P>
North America is expected to be the leading market for
residential gateway deployment, ABI said, because of higher
multiple PC penetration into the home and greater penetration of
non-PC Internet appliances. This market will account for a 59
percent annual increase in units shipped from 2002 to 2005.
</P>
<P>
In other regions, the report said, utility-centric service
gateways will be deployed aggressively. Europe, for example, will
realize a 64 percent increase annually in these shipments between
2002 and 2005. In these markets, residential gateways will be
driven by deregulated utilities seeking to provide automated meter
reading, security monitoring and remote appliance management.

<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- China and Indonesia issued a
joint press communique here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Following is the full text of the communique:
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of His Excellency Jiang Zemin, president of
the People's Republic of China, His Excellency K. H. Abdurrahman
Wahid, president of the Republic of Indonesia, paid a state visit
to the People's Republic of China from December 1 to 3, 1999.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, President Jiang Zemin and President K. H.
Abdurrahman Wahid held productive talks on bilateral relations and
other major regional and international issues of common interest
and reached broad agreement and understanding. Both sides believe
that President Wahid's visit to China is a complete success and of
important significance to the joint efforts to deepen China-
Indonesia relations in the future.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reviewed the progress of the bilateral relations
following the resumption of diplomatic ties in 1990 and expressed
their satisfaction with the progress made in all areas of
cooperation. The two sides maintained that the friendly relations
and cooperation on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, mutual
understanding and respect between the two countries conformed to
the fundamental interests of the two nations. The two sides
believed that the strengthening of the friendly relations and
cooperation would further contribute to peace, stability and
prosperity both in the region and the world.

<HEADLINE> More Americans Use Credit Cards Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The number of U.S. adults
using credit cards to purchase goods and services online more than
doubled between 1998 and 1999, according to a report released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
By the third quarter of 1999, 19.2 million adults used their
credit cards to make online transactions, compared to 9.3 million
in 1998 and only 4.9 million in 1997, said the report from Cyber
Dialog, a U.S. market research and data marketing firm.
</P>
<P>
Cyber Dialog's findings come as part of its survey on American
Internet usage, which consists of random interviews with 1,000
Internet users and 1,000 non-users.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found out that Visa is used by nearly 70
percent of adults, who complete purchase transactions online.
</P>
<P>
The findings suggest that credit cards have established
themselves as the new online currency when it comes to buying
goods and services of any value, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Other studies, however, indicate that credit card security has
been one of the major concerns of online purchasers. A survey
conducted by the research firm Intermarket Group in October found
that only one-third of U.S. Internet users have actually made
online purchases. The most frequently cited barriers of online
shopping include product pricing, potential return hassles,
concerns about credit card security and personal privacy issues
such as worries about junk e-mail. Sixty-five percent of the
Internet users surveyed cited credit card security as their
concern.

<HEADLINE> China Weeds Out Incompetent Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, December 3 (Xinhua) -- In the coastal city of Dalian in
northeast China's Liaoning Province, more than one-tenth of the 52,
000 primary and middle school teachers have been asked to leave
because they were deemed unqualified.
</P>
<P>
"Incompetent teachers cannot meet the demands of the more
quality-oriented education system proposed by the central
government," said Jia Julin, director of the Dalian Education
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Last year Dalian started to review teachers' performance on the
basis of self-evaluation, and evaluations made by colleagues and
students. As a result, more than 6,800 teachers were asked
recently to leave their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Teaching was once considered a stable profession in China. A
normal school graduate who was assigned to be a teacher could
spend the rest of his or her career at one school.
</P>
<P>
But the extremely low pay has turned some educators away from
their chosen profession to higher-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
Alarmed by this trend, the central government moved to uplift
teachers' status and implemented the long-term strategy of
revitalizing China through science and education. In recent years,
teachers have witnessed obvious improvements in income, housing
and social status.

<P>
China currently has 10 million teachers, 35,900 of them are
college professors.
</P>
<P>
But the pay hikes and other benefits have brought closer public
scrutiny of teaching ability.
</P>
<P>
Middle school authorities found that some teachers had not
received any higher education, which was required by the country's
Law of Teachers. Other teachers, though academically qualified,
were proved not suitable for teaching at school because of flaws
in moral character.
</P>
<P>
"Ten percent of the teachers lost their jobs, but the other 90
percent are encouraged to perform better," said Song Lanchun,
principal of Taoyuan Elementary School.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Eastman Company, a leading U.S.
chemical products provider, is confident in expanding its business
operations in China, particular in the realm of plastic products
and housing decoration materials.
</P>
<P>
As one of the world's renowned paint producers, Eastman expects
to see paint sales in China alone increase by 10 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
Eastman is encouraged by massive housing construction in China
which intends to expand per-capita living space nationwide from 9.
3 sq to 13 sq m. The burgeoning indoors decoration market is
expected to reap in huge profits for Eastman.
</P>
<P>
Sales worldwide for Eastman in 1998 was nearly 4.5 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Eastman established its first company in China based
in Nanjing, the capital of east China's Jiangsu Province. The
company is expected to go into operation by late 2000. Eastman has
representative offices in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- An inland container depot,
designed and implemented by Myanmar engineers, was partially
opened here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Botahtaung container depot at the Yangon Port was
commissioned into services after 75 percent of its construction
work was completed, official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The project began in December 1997 and the remaining project is
expected to be completed in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The overall project covers 6.6 hectares of land and the
container depot takes up 6.04 hectares, the report said, adding
that a total of 11.793 billion Korean won and about 430 million
kyats (1.43 million U.S. dollars) are used for the project.
</P>
<P>
Construction material and machinery for handling containers
were purchased from the Samsung Corporation of South Korea, it
said.
</P>
<P>
On completion of the container depot, 1,962 containers with
goods, 800 empty containers and 60 cold storage containers can be
kept at the same time, it added.

There are also two other container wharves, the Bo Aung Kyaw
and the Ahlone, along the Yangon Port, built with the cooperation
of China's Yunnan Machinery and Equipment Import and Export
Corporation and the Asia World Co., a local private company,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Yangon Port is traditionally Myanmar's main gateway to the
world, handling all of its imports and over 90 percent of its
exports.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Bank to Prepare List of Defaulters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Bank, the country's
central bank, will prepare a list of top 100 loan defaulters who
took huge amount of money from the four nationalized commercial
banks (NCBs) of the country, The Bangladesh Observer reported on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The newly-established Special Monitoring Cell of the central
bank, which is going to start functioning next week, will prepare
the list, which would include top 25 defaulters from each of the
four NCBs.
</P>
<P>
Rescheduling of loans and sanctioning of fresh loans to the
sister-concerns of the top 100 defaulters will not be allowed
without consent of the monitoring cell, bank sources were quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June this year, the four NCBs recorded a total
outstanding loan of 131.66 billion taka (2.63 billion U.S.
dollars), according to the report.
</P>
<P>
"The Special Monitoring Cell will try to improve situation by
keeping close supervision on the activities of the NCBs," Deputy
Governor of Bangladesh Bank Khandakar Ibrahim Khalid said.
</P>
<P>
The monitoring cell, which will also prepare and send reports
to the Finance Ministry regularly suggesting proper actions, would
be empowered to take legal actions against the NCBs for
irregularities and wrongdoing, but "will identify the
irregularities and will suggest corrective measures only," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Arranges Festivities to Hail New Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar tourism authorities
are making arrangements to organize festivities to hail the new
millennium with the expectation of more tourist arrivals.
</P>
<P>
The Padonma Gems Trading Co., a local private company, will
organize a festival of lights under the arrangement at the
Myakyuntha Park near the capital's famous Inya Lake on December
10, official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The festival lights will be arranged with the use of 60,000
paper lanterns, 600 lotus-flower-shaped lanterns, 10,000 bowls and
saucers and 20,000 empty bottles, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it is also reported that the country's three special
zones -- Bagan and Mandalay cultural zones in Mandalay division
and Inlay natural zone in Shan state -- are recommended to hold
special festivals for tourists as these are the places to which 20
to 50 percent of the foreign tourists visiting Myanmar are used to
go.
</P>
<P>
Entrepreneurs engaged in tourism are also being urged to grasp
the opportunities to develop tourism industry and tourism-related
business in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, a total of 138,561 foreign
tourists visited Myanmar in the first half of this year, still
producing a drop of 1.57 percent as compared with the same period
of last year.
</P>
<P>
The figures also show that in 1998, a total of 279,335 foreign
tourists came to Myanmar which earned just over 33 million U.S.
dollars from tourism in the year.
</P>
<P>
Up to the end of March this year, there was a total of 492
hotels in operation in Myanmar with 13,984 rooms.
</P>
<P>
There were also 521 licensed tour companies including 508 local
companies, 12 joint ventures and one foreign company.
</P>
<P>
The country hopes to boost the number of tourist arrivals to
500,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
Since Myanmar adopted the open-door economic policy in late
1988, foreign investment in the sector of hotels and tourism
reached 1.04 billion dollars in 41 projects as of July this year.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Is Poorest Performer in Social Sector in South Asia: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Nepal is the poorest
performer in the social sector in the South Asian region,
according to a report on South Asia human development.
</P>
<P>
The Human Development in South Asia 1999 Report available here
Friday said that the rate of people in Nepal without access to
health care, education, safe drinking water, sanitation and child
immunization stands at 58, 72, 52, 80 and 35 percentage
respectively.
</P>
<P>
In economic dimensions, Nepal's public debt to GDP ratio stands
at a shocking 64 percent, said the report prepared by the Mahbub
ul Haq Human Development Center in Islamabad, Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Poverty of Opportunity Index projects Nepal at the top in the
South Asia with 52 percent followed by Bangladesh with 46,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that Nepali judiciary isn't impressive either,
with only one judge available per 85,377 people.
</P>
<P>
But Nepal has the lowest number of cases pending in the courts,
with 364 cases per 10,000 people, while Bangladesh has the highest
with 14 times the rate in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The condition of law and order in Nepal is more encouraging
than in other countries. The country has the lowest reported rape
cases with 0.3 cases per 100,000 women, the least armed robberies
with just 0.6 cases per 100,000 people and the second lowest
murder cases in the region, the report said.

<P>
The Evening Post Friday quoted Miss Clark as saying that
President Clinton phoned her from Air Force One en route from
Seattle to Washington and they discussed issues relating to the
World Trade Organization and the F-16s leasing by New Zealand from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
"He indicated he thought it was a good deal for us and a good
deal for them and I said 'well only time will tell on that, we
have to have a good look at it'," the Wellington-baseeman as warning the incoming New Zealand
Government that
scrapping the F-16 deal would harm defense relations with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"While it is New Zealand's decision, it would set back defense
relations between the two countries and could kill any possibility
of them resuming joint exercises," he said.
</P>
<P>
Miss Clark responded the warning as saying the U.S. view would
be "taken into account", according to the Evening Post.
</P>
<P>
When the Labor Party with Helen Clark as its leader campaigned
for the November 27th general election, the Party criticized the
National-led Government's deal with the United States, which was
signed a year ago. The Party made it clear that it would abolish
the lease-to-buy deal under which New Zealand would get 28 F-16
fighter aircraft from the United States, if it won the election.
</P>
<P>
As late as Thursday, Miss Clark still confirmed that she wanted
to scrap the deal.

<HEADLINE> Chinese College Graduates to Get More Work Experience </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Xuan, an undergraduate of
history at Beijing University who graduated earlier this year, has
decided to postpone her graduate studies until next year.
</P>
<P>
She is now working at a museum and wants work experience before
furthering her studies. A newly issued regulation by Chinese
Ministry of Education (MOE) has given many college undergraduates
like Zhang Xuan the chance to work before continuing graduate
studies.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulation, all those undergraduates who
passed the graduate entrance examination but could not continue
their studies due to limited graduate placements, can find work
and gain valuable work experience before being accepted into their
desired course.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese government departments and enterprises would rather
choose college undergraduates than graduates holding Masters
degrees because graduates are well known for lacking "experience".
</P>
<P>
A MOE official said that working experience will enable college
students to become more marketable in the job market. Many
students who can not afford tuition fees for further study can
first work for two years and then continue their studies without
any financial burden.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen "special graduates" from the Huazhong Science and
Engineering University in central China's Hubei Province are now
working and will enter university next year.
</P>
<P>
Feng Zheng, a teacher at the university, said that the MOE
regulation will help students get enough work experience before
continuing their studies.

<HEADLINE> 2 killed in Oil Tank Explosion in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Oil tanks exploded in
Thailand's eastern province of Chonburi at Thursday midnight,
killing two people and injuring over a dozen, Channel 9, the state
television station reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred within the complex of a refinery of Thai
Oil Ltd, the country's largest refiner, in Bang Pakong Industrial
Zone in Chonburi province, some 200 kilometers southeast of
Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
So far, the fire resulting from the explosion has not been put
out, according to Channel 9.
</P>
<P>
Thai Oil has shut down the 220-barrel-a-day refinery for safety
reason, although the fire has not reached the refinery itself.
</P>
<P>
The police are mobilizing forces to try to extinguish the fire,
which has claimed 500-million-baht (12.9 million U.S. dollars)
losses, the television station said.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary assumption for the cause of the disaster is the
possible oil gas leak.
</P>
<P>
At this stage, Thai Oil will have to stop its production and
refinery operations to check the outcome of the disaster and drain
out the oil from the unharmed tanks.

<HEADLINE> Peruvian President to Attend IDB's 40th Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori will travel to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Friday to
attend the celebration of the Interamerican Development Bank's (
IDB) 40th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori, as the president of the Community of Andean Nations (
CAN), may have a private meeting with IDB President Enrique
Iglesias, a Uruguayan, for economic issues related to the CAN
member countries.
</P>
<P>
He will also discuss several topics with his Brazilian
counterpart Fernando Enrique Cardoso, according to Jose Viegas
Filho, Brazilian ambassador to Lima. The Free Trade Area of
America (FTAA) and the roads in the border zone between Peru and
Brazil will be among the topics, said Viegas.
</P>
<P>
Peru has received 4.5 million U.S. dollars from the IDB since
1992, an amount greater than any obtained by other economies
similar to Peru, said Rosa Villa-Lawson, Peru's former
representative to IDB.
</P>
<P>
She added that during the early years, after relations between
Peru and the IDB started in 1961, this organization had lent only
1.6 million U.S. dollars to Peru. But the situation changed in
1992 because of Peru's integration into the international
financial community.

Citing potential Y2K problems, the airline earlier announced
the cancellation of 20 flights on the eve of the millennium.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Mobilizes Troops to Crack Down on Anti-WTO Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEATTLE, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. military is mobilizing
160 active duty soldiers, including a small number of Special
Forces troops, to break up the protests in Seattle, where the
third ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization (WTO) is
convened.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon is to provide support to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the U.S. Secret Service and other government
agencies responsible for the security in the city, according to
the Cable News Network (CNN).
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of protesters rallied Thursday in front of the King
Jail in downtown Seattle, chanting slogans demanding the release
of more than 400 protesters arrested since the demonstration
started earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon said 131 Army, 27 Air Force, and eight Navy personnel
were sent to Seattle to perform roles from ordnance disposal to
standing by for possible chemical or biological attack by
terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
Troops there are from various military fiefdoms including the U.
S. Special Operations Command, the U.S. Forces Command, the U.S.
Army Biological-Chemical Command, the U.S. Air Force Security
Forces Command and the U.S. Joint Forces Command.
</P>
<P>
U.S. National Guards were also mobilized on Tuesday to remove
the protesters on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The police used tear gas, rubber bullets and batons to disperse
the demonstration and dozens were wounded.
</P>
<P>
The 24-hour-a-day curfew in downtown Seattle announced by Mayor
Paul Schell on Tuesday remains in effect until midnight Friday
after the conference ends.
</P>
<P>
Trade ministers from 135 WTO members are meeting in the city to
define agenda for the next round of global trade talks. Many
delegates failed to reach the venue of the conference on Tuesday
due to the protests.
</P>
<P>
Many delegates complained that their freedom were deprived of
by the protesters who enjoyed their freedom of blocking the
ministers to enter the meeting. An opening ceremony has to be
canceled.

<HEADLINE> S. L. Rebel Suicide Bombers Target Presidential Candidates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Suicide bombers of Sri Lanka's
Tamil rebels have reportedly infiltrated the capital Colombo to
target presidential candidates contesting the upcoming election on
December 21, the media sources said Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to security intelligence reports, four of these
suicide bombers are already in Colombo from east of Batticaloa and
are hiding in a safe house, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Police have warned all presidential candidates and their
supporters to be watchful over their movements as the rebels are
likely to target them at political rallies as having occurred in
the 1994 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the rebels assassinated the then government's
presidential candidate Gamini Dissanayake at a rally in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Following the security report, police and army have intensified
security arrangements and declared a high state of alert in and
around Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Road blocks and check points in the capital, which were beefed
up for the rebel leader Velupillai Prabhakaran's 45th birthday
celebrations and their Hero's Day on November 25, have once again
been activated.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Eye Banks Looking for Corneas Donation: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua)-- China's eye banks urgently need
donated corneas, as a million people in this country are suffering
from corneal blindness, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Mahmood Farazdaghi, administrative director of the
International Federation of Eye Banks (IFEB), was quoted as saying
after his recent inspection of the Shanghai Eye Bank.
</P>
<P>
IFEB is a non-governmental, non-profit organization which aims
to eradicate corneal blindness around world. China's two eye banks,
the Shanghai and Beijing branches, are both facing cornea
shortages.
</P>
<P>
According to Qiu Xiaozhi, director of the Shanghai Eye Bank,
the stock of corneas in the bank has almost run out.
</P>
<P>
A total of 969 Shanghai residents, sponsored by the government
of Xuhui District of the city, signed agreements on Tuesday to
donate their corneas after their death, which inspires Farazdaghi
greatly.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing center has a larger stock, but the total amount of
corneas in the two banks still can not meet the great demands of
the one million patients in China, said Farazdaghi.
</P>
<P>
Farazdaghi said that the disease is especially serious in
developing countries due to the heavy air pollution and poor
working conditions in factories, adding that corneal
transplantation is currently the only way to cure such blindness.
</P>
<P>
Chinese people seem to be too conservative to donate their
corneas compared with the westerners, Qiu said. Every year America
exports surplus donated corneas to needed countries while the cost
of 2,000 U.S. dollars for each cornea is too high for Chinese
patients.
</P>
<P>
Local experts and officials call on education via mass media
and governmental support to give publicity to the donation of
corneas since the tradition here is not amiable towards organ
donation.

YANGON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar Mayflower Bank (MMB)
Ltd., one of the leading private banks in the country, has opened
one more branch in Muse, a border town in northern most part of

</P>
<P>
The opening of the branch on Tuesday has brought the total

</P>
<P>
Addressing the inaugural ceremony of the branch, Myanmar
Northeastern Commander Major-General Tin Aung Myint Oo said border
trade is being encouraged in Muse today and 80 percent of such

He added that the opening of private banks in Muse can
contribute much to the development of the country's border trade.
</P>
<P>
The Muse branch is the fourth of the MMB in Myanmar's Shan
state and one more branch is scheduled to open in the same state
soon, the report said.
</P>

The ceremony was attended by local entrepreneurs as well as
merchants of Shweli and Kyekhaung border towns from the Chinese
side.
</P>
<P>
Besides, another Myanmar private bank -- Myanmar Universal Bank
Ltd. -- also opened a branch in Mogok, northern Mandalay division,
on the same day, bringing the total number of its branches to 13,
the report said, adding that the bank is also planning to add nine
more branches in other towns in the country.
</P>
<P>
There are 19 private banks in Myanmar providing domestic
commercial services and the banks hold about 45 percent of saving
deposits of the banking sector, while their loans account for
about 48 percent of the sector's loans to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures of the Myanmar Central Bank,
domestic currency saving deposits in banks totaled 154.381 billion
kyats (482 million U.S. dollars) at the end of March this year, an
increase of 44.5 billion kyats (139 million dollars) over a year
earlier.

According to the new plan, the provincial-level funding for
education will increase by one or two percent annually, and the

<HEADLINE> China Urges Rich Nations to Increase Technical Aid to Poor Ones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- China on Thursday called on
developed countries to increase technological aid to the
developing world in support of the efforts by the United Nations
Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO).
</P>
<P>
The global economy can maintain a sustained growth only when
the rich and the poor cooperate to achieve common economic
development, Chinese Ambassador Zhang Yishan stressed in his
speech delivered at the eighth conference of UNIDO, a UN
specialized agency aimed to promote industrialization and
industrial development in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, head of the Chinese delegation to the five-day meeting
here, described UNIDO's reforms over the past two years as "
fruitful." Among the results, UNIDO has focused its technological
assistance on the strengthening of industrial capability in the
field of pollution-free and sustainable industrial development.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it has helped more than 30 developing countries
map out comprehensive programs, which, Zhang believed, would help
them promote economy, shake off poverty and speed up
industrialization when being accomplished.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said China hopes that UNIDO will further its reform to
make it work better, particularly in raising funds and increasing
technological assistance to the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted the continuous failures over recent years to carry out
UNIDO's aid projects. Regarding specific project, Zhang said China
expects the organization to consider both the need of the
recipient country and its own funding and service capability, pay
more attention to substantial results of its programs and allow
flexibility in implementation.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from more than 160 member countries attended the
UNIDO meeting are expected to review the organization's reform
efforts and work out future budget and agenda. The conference will
close on December 3 and is held every four years.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Should Join High-tech Production: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Finance Minister
Keat Chhon urged the country to speed up the reform to improve the
productivity and eliminate corruption to attract foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote speech at Thursday's National Conference on
Investment in Cambodia, the minister pointed out that Cambodia
needs to get rid of its negative image as a "high labor costs,
poor productivity" area in order to compete with other rich
countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Earlier upon his return from the informal ASEAN Summit in
Manila, Keat Chhon stressed that high on the list of needed
reforms are agriculture and production of goods for the domestic
market. He also warned that if Cambodia does not join the
high-tech production sector, it could become a "garbage can" of
old machinery from around the world.
</P>
<P>
"Since 1997 we have prepared ourselves to be a member of
ASEAN," the minister was quoted Friday by the Cambodia Daily as
saying. "But we can't catch up with the rich ASEAN group.... We
have to do our best to compete with other ASEAN countries," he
added.
</P>
<P>
High productivit's
economy," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's National Assembly Wednesday passed a provision to
push for the improvement of the quality of domestic products as
part of the new law on Quality of Goods and Services.

<P>
LONDON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- English premier league football
club Aston Villa chairman Doug Ellis has re-affirmed his support
for manager John Gregory and is also hoping the Worthington Cup
defeat of Southampton will mark the start of an upturn in fortunes.
</P>
<P>
Speculation has been rife that Gregory's 21-month reign has
been under threat after Villa collected just three points from
eight Premiership matches.
</P>
<P>
But the 4-0 Cup demolition of the Saints has eased the tension
and now Villa, who will visit West Ham in the quarterfinals, are
looking for an improvement in their league fortunes when they
entertain Newcastle on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ellis said: "I have been supporting the Villa manager. I always
have done. I hope Wednesday's result will turn the tide because it
is something we have wanted for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
"In fairness we have been playing quite well and losing. The
collective spirit within the dressing room has been good but we
haven't had the breaks for one reason or another.
</P>
<P>
"On Wednesday we did everything that was necessary. We worked
terribly hard and got the goals. It will be even better if we can
also win against Newcastle on Saturday," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Raises 5 Proposals for Next Round of Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEATTLE, December 2 (Xinhua) -- China on Thursday put forward
five proposals for the next round of trade talks, stressing that
the interests of developing countries should be respected in the
new round.
</P>
<P>
The proposals were made by Shi Guangsheng, Chinese minister for
foreign trade and economic cooperation, at the third ministerial
meeting of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The five proposals are:
</P>
<P>
-- The economic development objectives of developing countries
and corresponding pattern of gradual market opening should be
fully respected.
</P>
<P>
-- Developed countries should meet their obligations stipulated
in the agreements of the Uruguay Round, and improve the market
access environment for developing countries.
</P>
<P>
-- The formulation of new trade rules must have the full
involvement of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
-- The coordination among developing countries should be
strengthened, and their collective negotiation ability in the
multilateral trading system should be improved.
</P>
<P>
-- The new round of multilateral trade negotiations should
focus on discussing issues related to trade. China holds that
those issues that are not related to the functions of the WTO,
such as labor standards, should not be incorporated into the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
Trade ministers from 135 WTO members are meeting here to
discuss the agenda of the next round of trade talks, the
Millennium Round, and try to launch the round at the end of the
meeting, which is scheduled to close on December 3.

<HEADLINE> Wembley Planners Seek Compromise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Officials at Wembley have
pledged to respond to a report which criticised their proposals
for a new national stadium 'as early as possible' and show critics
their proposed scheme does accommodate athletics.
</P>
<P>
Bosses at Wembley National Stadium were ordered on Wednesday to
go back to the drawing board over the new-look stadium in North
London, and told to incorporate facilities which would enable
Britain to bid for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
But in a fresh press statetement issued today, Wembley
officials claim their current proposals already cater for
athletics usage - and insisted the Government report into their
stadium contained a number of factual inaccuracies,
misunderstandings of the Wembley proposals and misinterpretations
of the Olympic requirements.
</P>
<P>
A compromise deal must be struck over the sight lines and views
of fans, say Wembley chiefs, with the need to consider the
atmosphere inside the stadium also important if the seats were
pushed further back from the pitch.
</P>
<P>
The stern response from WNSL followed a warning by Culture
Secretary Chris Smith that a 120 million pounds Lottery grant
given to the stadium builders could be under threat if the new
Wembley proved unable to host an Olympics.
</P>
<P>
He ordered a review of plans for the stadium, to be completed
by its architects by December 15, in the light of a report
prepared by consultants DLA Ellerbe Beckett.
</P>
<P>
Mr Smith said in a statement to the House of Commons: "My
reluctant conclusion is that this stadium, as designed, or in any
similar configuration, cannot readily provide the central venue
for an Olympic Games bid for London."
</P>
<P>
He raised the possibility of building a separate national
athletics stadium with Wembley reserved for football and rugby -
but possibly losing much of the Lottery cash.
</P>
<P>
The dispute centers on architect Lord Foster's design to allow
the stadium to convert to athletics by inserting a track platform
over the pitch.
</P>
<P>
The report raised fears this arrangement would mean some sight-
lines in the stadium would not meet Olympic standards, with other
concerns over the roof covering parts of the running track and of
poor access for athletes. But WNSL insisted the criticisms were
based on unfair comparisons.

SEATTLE, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The third ministerial
conference of the World Trade Organization (WTO) entered a
critical stage Thursday as representatives from major trading
partners were settling for compromise in order to reach an
agreement on the framework of the next round of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"We really have to push forward negotiations today, not
tomorrow, because tomorrow is too late," Peter Guiford, spokesman
for the European Union, told Xinhua in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Guilford said delegates from 135 WTO members have achieved
agreement on some important issues, such as proposals by developed
nations to the least developed countries, a major outcome of the
conference so far.
</P>
<P>
But, on other issues, differences and gaps still exist,
Guilford said.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody must concentrate its mind today and begin to
compromise. Otherwise, it will be very dangerous for the
conference at all," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the EU is prepared to compromise and creatively
proposes new language, new forms of documents, new ideas as well
as bilateral talks with the United States and Japan in a bid to
narrow the gaps on key issues.
</P>
<P>
The mission of the WTO conference in Seattle is to create a

<HEADLINE> China to Build Bio-Technology Research Base on Small Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The isolated island of
Guanzhou, situated on the Pearl River near this capital of south
China's Guangdong Province, will be home to a bio-engineering
research base for developing gene-modified medicine and products
and trans-genetic plants and animals.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government of Guangzhou has approved Guanzhou New
Oasis Bio-Technological Co. to be the developer of the project,
which should be completed in the next two or three years.
</P>
<P>
The development cost for the base is estimated at some 10
billion yuan (about 1.2 billion U.S. dollars), which is expected
to come from the domestic and international capital markets and
outside investment.
</P>
<P>
The government will work out preferential policies for
attracting investment instead of allocating direct funding.
</P>
<P>
Guanzhou Island, covering 1.8 sq. km., is a safe distance from
industrial pollution coming from the province. Several major
universities in Guangzhou will base their research labs on the
island when the basic infrastructure construction is completed.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou is China's third largest bio-technology industrial
center following Beijing and Shanghai. The industry has witnessed
slow growth in recent years because of redistributed research
powers into over 30 universities and research institutes, said the
Deputy Mayor Lin Yuanhe.
</P>
<P>
The Guanzhou Island Project will help integrate these research
teams and accelerate the transfer of scientific results into final
products, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign gene engineering research institutes and related
companies have expressed their interest in setting up research
offices on the island.
</P>
<P>
The development plan for the island has been entrusted to
Guangzhou Municipal Urban Planning Institute. It will invite
renowned experts from an American bio-engineering project planning
company and Tokyo University to join in the design process.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador's Volcano Eruption Causes Big Damages to Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The eruption of Ecuador's
Tungurahua volcano has caused damages of up to 400 billion sucres
(some 25 million U.S. dollars) in agriculture, Minster of Urban
Development and Housing Teodoro Pena said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The minister told Xinhua that some 23,000 residents living near
the volcano had been evacuated to a safer location before it
erupted.
</P>
<P>
Pena said that 51,261 hectares of cultivated land in Tungurahua
province and neighboring Chimborazo, both in central Ecuador, have
been damaged by daily volcanic ashes.
</P>
<P>
The 5,016-meter high Tungurahua, 125 kilometers south of Quito,
spews at least 5,500 tons of sulfur daily, and its eruption has
caused 31 earthquakes and 46 explosions per day, so far, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said that tourism has been affected by the loss of 1.5
million dollars in Banos city, which is located on the slopes of
the volcano. He added that the eruption is predicted to last at
least six months.

<P>
PYONGYANG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The ruling party of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and a delegation of
Japanese legislators Thursday agreed on the need to resume talks
on establishing diplomatic ties, the Korean Central News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK side, led by Kim Yong Sun, secretary of the
secretariat of the Workers' Party central committee, said the DPRK
's stand on bilateral ties with Japan has been consistent.
</P>
<P>
Relations will be improved so long as Japan can sincerely
apologize and compensate for the atrocities Japan had inflicted on
the DPRK and give up its hostile attitudes toward the DPRK,
Pyongyang said.
</P>
<P>
It said allegations of the DPRK's missile test-firing and
abduction of Japanese nationals by DPRK agents are indication of
Japan's hostility toward the DPRK and will result in the worsening
of relations.

<P>
The Japanese delegation, comprising members of all major
political parties, was led by former Japanese prime minister
Tomiichi Murayama.

<P>
Murayama emphasized the importance for the two governments to

<HEADLINE> U.N. Top Administrator Dissatisfied With Security in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations' top
administrator in Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner, said during a visit to
Macedonia and Albania Thursday that he is not satisfied with the
security and political situation in Kosovo, Yugoslavia,
</P>
<P>
After talks with Macedonian Prime Minister Ljupco Georgievski
in Skopje, the country's capital, Kouchner told a press conference
that assassinations, ethnic enmity and revenge remain rampant in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Although things have somewhat improved, with the weekly number
of people being murdered reduced from 40 to three, he said he is
still upset with the general security and political situation in
the province.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the U.N. special mission in Kosovo has made
great efforts to enhance security and protect minorities in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Kouchner repeated his remarks at a press conference held in
Tirana after meeting with Albanian Prime Minister Ilir Meta. He
said he feels uneasy regarding the circumstances of the minorities
in the troubled Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
Despite various efforts, he said, the situation in places such
as Mitrovic remains unstable.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. administrator admitted that without the local people's
support, it is hard for his mission and the NATO-led international
peace keepers to achieve security, peace and ethnic coexistence in
the province, though they have the mandate to do so.
</P>
<P>
He urged the governments of Macedonia and Albania to back the U.
N. mission's efforts to establish peace and multi-ethnic
coexistence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Kouchner also called on Macedonia to contribute to Kosovo's
economic recovery and development.

MEXICO CITY, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
Thursday announced more sites in Latin America as a Heritage of
Humanity.
</P>
<P>
The sites are scattered from the Patagonia of Argentina, to
Cuba, going through Brazil and Costa Rica, besides some sites in
Mexico, says a report reaching here from Morocco.
</P>
<P>
In Brazil, two natural sites, the Coast of Discovery and the
Atlantic Forest reserve, were chosen and another historical center
of the city of Diamantina was also announced as a cultural site.
</P>
<P>
Argentina's Valdes Peninsula, with its whales and marine
mammals in the Patagonia, and Cave of the Hands, as well as the

<HEADLINE> Basuki to Compete in Prequalifying Round For Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's semi-retired and
now a mother Yayuk Basuki is confirmed to compete in the
prequalifying rounds with junior Wynne Prakusya in the women's
doubles for the Olympics, the Jakarta Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, Indonesian Tennis Association (Pelti) spokesman Benny
Mailili said Pelti would ask the National Sports Council (KONI) to
send a letter requesting wild cards for Indonesian players.
</P>
<P>
"The deadline for the players' qualification for the Olympics
is after Wimbledon on July 10, 2000. While the deadline for those
who will receive wild cards is on March 15. We have requested a
wild card for Wynne in the singles, but I think it's better for us
to ask for another for the doubles," he said.
</P>
<P>
Benny rated Pelti's chances of receiving the wild cards as slim
because it needed approval from the country's National Olympics
Committee, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and the
International Olympics Committee.
</P>
<P>
ITF will also evaluate if the country has few athletes
competing in the quadrennial event and if the region does not have
many countries represented in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Tamarine Tanasugarn of Thailand, Li Fang of China, Ai Sugiyama
of Japan and Janet Lee of Chinese Taipei are the Asian players who
have qualified for the women's tennis competition at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The singles draw is limited to 64 players, with 32 pairings in
the doubles event.
</P>
<P>
Benny said Pelti must be proactive in supporting the country's
former number one women's tennis player Yayuk, particularly by
providing all facilities needed to compete in the prequalifying
rounds.
</P>
<P>
"Pelti must support Yayuk financially and morally. We must
boost her motivation to prepare seriously for the Olympics," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Benny said Yayuk, who gave birth on September 23, held a
special ranking of 16 in doubles in the Women's Tennis Association
(WTA) rankings.
</P>
<P>
"If Yayuk can finish in the top 100 and junior Wynne Prakusya
can reach the world's 150 ranking for the women's doubles, I am
optimistic they can qualify for the Olympics," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yayuk and Wynne reached the quarterfinals of the 1998 Asian
Games in Bangkok, but Yayuk won the gold in the singles event.
</P>
<P>
Wynne is world ranked 180th in singles and 210th in the
doubles while Yayuk has a special singles ranking of 86th. Her
highest WTA singles ranking was 20.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Rewrite History of Vertebrates Origins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
discovered that the 530-million-year-old fish-like fossils they
found in the town of Haikou near Kunming, the capital city of
southwest China's Yunnan Province, are ancestors of vertebrates.
</P>
<P>
This major scientific discovery was made by Chen Junyuan, a
research fellow with the Nanjing Institute of Paleontology and
Geology attached to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, his assistant
Huang Diying and his colleague Lee Chia-wei from the National
Tsinghua University in Taiwan. Their findings are published in the
latest issue of "Nature", a leading international science journal
based in London.
</P>
<P>
Chen and his colleagues discovered over 300 fish-like fossils
in Haikou in early April. After careful examination of the fish-
like fossils, they discovered that these fossils date back some
530 million years and are considered to be the first craniate
chordates with a clear head and a large brain. Chen and his
colleagues have called the fish-like fossils "Haikouella".
</P>
<P>
Haikouella have circulatory and digestive systems replete with
heart, eyes, heterocercal, ventral and dorsal aorta, six pairs of
branchial arches with gill filaments, tooth-like structures,
midgut, hindgut and an anal opening. A well preserved specimen
also shows sexual organs.
</P>
<P>
Haikouella not only has a relatively large brain, it is clearly
divided into three parts: frontal, middle and back lobes. The
finding indicates that the evolutionary history of vertebrates
precedes the origin of backbones.
</P>
<P>
In existing textbooks, lancelets are mentioned as the very
first chordate in the evolution of vertebrates.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Chen and his colleagues discovered what they thought
to be the earliest of vertebrates in Yunnan, the Yunnanzoon (a
primitive chordate). However, the 530 million-year-old Haikouella
they found this April has changed all that.
</P>
<P>
After watching the 300 specimens of Haikouella, Professor
Nicholas Holland, a noted American lancelet specialist from the
University of California at San Diego, said the discovery was "a
spectacular advance in our efforts to reconstruct the history of
life on earth."

<HEADLINE> Significant Progress Emerges From WTO Negotiations, Says Barshefsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEATTLE, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The five working groups of the
third ministerial conference of the World Trade Organization have
made significant progress during Thursday morning sessions,
Charlene Barshefsky, the chairwoman of the Seattle conference said.
</P>
<P>
"All of the groups asked for additional time to produce texts
of consensus on the statement and some may work overnight," she
told reporters at a news briefing by U.S. delegation.
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky, the U.S. trade representative, said a full
transparency has been implemented in Seattle conference and all
the WTO members had been consulted before a particular consensus
was achieved.
</P>
<P>
This process is quite different from the previous conferences
in Singapore and beyond, Barshefsky said, explaining that, at the
previous conference, only selected WTO members, namely 10 to 20
major powers and trade partners, had been consulted, leaving the
small developing countries feeling they had been excluded from the
consultation.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of transparency makes every WTO member to be
included in the process of consultation on the one hand, and more
difficult to achieve consensus among 135 members on the other.
This might be one of reasons behind a slow process of the Seattle
conference so far.
</P>
<P>
"I reiterated to all the ministers today to reach consensus
text," she said, adding that if this goal is not achieved, she, as
the chairwoman of the conference, would follow the previous
process.
</P>
<P>
After that statement, all the working reported progress in
achieving some sort of consensus on the texts, she disclosed,
saying that the "second generation" of consensus of text may come
out during the afternoon consultation.
</P>
<P>
Secretaries of U.S. administration said the U.S. delegation had
quite a number of bilateral and multilateral consultations with
major trade partners on the issues of agriculture, environment and
labor and also achieved some progress.
</P>
<P>
They, however, were reluctant to give details on those
consultations, saying the discussions are still going on and it
would better to wait for the outcomes of those consultations.
</P>
<P>
The mission of the WTO conference in Seattle is to create a
prospering global economy, increasing the flow of goods and
services around the world.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from 135 WTO members are debating on the future
of the world trade inside the Washington State Convention and
Trade Center, and holding bilateral talks on related matters in
the nearby hotels. Everyone wants to get an advantage from the on-
going conference in Seattle.

BELGRADE, December 2 (Xinhua) -- As two bridges in Veliko
Orasje region in Yugoslavia have been repaired, the highway
between the capital city Belgrade and the southern city Niss fully
reopened to traffic on December 2.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister of the Yugoslav Serbian Republic Mirko
Marjanovic said this section of highway is vital to the sustained
development of the Yugoslav economy.
</P>
<P>
The two bridges were totally destroyed in the NATO bombing in
May, but Yugoslav workers built new ones on the ruins.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the Construction Ministry of the Serbian
Republic began to invite international tenders for concessions to
manage and run No. 75 European expressway. Many Yugoslavian
enterprises have participated in the bidding, which will provide
Yugoslavia with large numbers of job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The first phase reconstruction project of Yugoslavia, in which
26 highway bridges and 5 railway bridges reopened to traffic and
about 520 families moved into new houses, ended on November 2.
The second phase will last until July 2000.

<P>
OTTAWA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce (CIBC) is cutting 4,200 jobs, which account for nearly 10
percent of its workforce.
</P>
<P>
The CIBC unveiled its job reduction plan Thursday after
reporting a net loss of 20 million Canadian dollars (about 13.6
million U.S. dollars) in the fourth quarter.
</P>

Many of the country's big banks are moving to slash their

<P>
Bank of Montreal has also said it will cut more than 1,400 jobs,
while Toronto-Dominion Bank plans to lay off 4,900 employees over

<HEADLINE> ECB Says Confident on Stronger Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 2 (Xinhua)--The European Central Bank (ECB)
president Wim Duisenberg Thursday said he was confident that the
single European currency, the euro, would become stronger against
the U.S. dollar, on the same day when the exchange rate of the
euro fell to a record low.
</P>
<P>
The reference exchange rate of the euro on Thursday was 1.0057
dollar, almost hitting the psychological line of 1 to 1. The euro
has lost its value against dollar of about 0.4 dollar since it had
been launched last September.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at ECB headquarters in Frankfurt,
Duisenburg said, "The current monetary policy stance should ensure
a sustainable expansion of non-inflationary economic activity in
the euro area."
</P>
<P>
"In line with its monetary policy strategy, the ECB Governing
Council will remain vigilant with regard to any risks to price
stability arising either from domestic or from external sources
and act in a timely manner," he added.
</P>
<P>
Following a growth of 2 per cent in gross domestic product (GDP)
in this year, the 11 eurolands are expected accelerate their
economies to grow at about 3 per cent in year 2000 and 2001,
faster than the U.S. Duisenberg followed.
</P>
<P>
"Consumer price increases have recently resumed their upward
trend, as expected. In October the annual rate of change in the
overall HICP was 1.4%, up from 1.2% in September and August owing
to higher price increases for food and non-energy industrial goods,
" he quoted statistics.
</P>
<P>
"The impact of higher oil prices on energy prices in the HICP,
which had accounted for most of the upward pressure since June
1999, was countered in October by more moderate increases in other
energy components," added Duisenberg.
</P>
<P>
And the major contribution to this projected growth of the ECB
will be going on successfully with its policy of keeping the price
level in Eurolands stable, stressed Duisenberg.

been strengthened and kept growing and the friendship between the
two peoples has been deeply rooted in their minds, he said.

mutually beneficial cooperative relations between the two
countries.

LONDON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- New Sheffield United manager
Neil Warnock will not allow financial constraints to undermine his
"dream job".
</P>
<P>
The former Bury boss succeeded Adrian Heath who quit Bramall
Lane two-and-a-half weeks ago over a lack of funding.
</P>
<P>
But Blades supporter Warnock, 51 on Wednesday, insists that
there is now more stability in the boardroom with Derek Dooley
installed as club chairman.
</P>
<P>
However, Warnock admits that it is only due to the problems at
the First Division strugglers that he was appointed.
</P>
<P>
Warnock said: "I don't think Neil Warnock would have been in
for it if the club had been in a healthier situation.
</P>
<P>
"Results-wise it's been disappointing and there are some
horrendous fixtures coming up.
</P>
<P>
"But at last I think the club is together and that is the most
important thing. The boardroom now has unity and the fans have got
to realise that" he said.

LONDON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Former England soccer legend
Paul Gascoigne's adviser Mel Stein moved quickly Thursday to deny
speculation that the midfielder is set to quit English football

Gascoigne, 32, has failed to command a regular place in Bryan

client is remaining at the Riverside Stadium.

"It is absolute nonsense. We have had no approaches whatsoever

Middlesbrough have also denied any US link with the England
international.

"It is an old story, and there is no truth in it whatsoever,"

<TEXT>
<P>
Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel told the press
that the existence of a plot to assassinate Chavez was considered
credible as stated recently by Cuban President Fidel Castro in
Havana.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan president had planned to travel to the United
States on Dec. 8 to attend the 23rd Miami Entrepreneurial
Conference on the Caribbean and Latin America, to be held December
7 to 10.
</P>
<P>
The forum foresees the attendance of some 12,500
entrepreneurial and political leaders, as well as some heads of
state.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban American National Foundation (FNCA), with
headquarters in Miami, opposed to the Cuban regime, considered "
ridiculous the Castro accusation that it is involved in some plan
to kill the Venezuelan president.
</P>
<P>
Chavez said November 14 that foreign and Venezuelan groups are
involved in a plan to do away with him.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan chief of state has expressed in several
occasions his support and friendship with Fidel Castro, which
earned him the rejection of the Cuban community residing in Miami,
that opposes the Havana government.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Rally on Technology Strength </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks rose
sharply Thursday as investors grabbed shares of big companies in
technology.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 40.67 at 11,039.06,
expanding its gain of 120.56 points Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP;Poor'
s 500 index rose 11.32 at 1,409.04 and the technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index rose 99.07 at 3,452.78, surpassing the record
closing high of 3,447.81 set on November 26.
</P>
<P>
The market rallied as several investment firms expressed their
optimism about the prospects of computer maker Hewlett-Packard.
The company held a meeting this week on its plans to cut costs and
expand sales of its computer servers.
</P>
<P>
A wide range of technology stocks such as Oracle, Sun
Microsystems, IBM and Hewlett-Packard as well rose, pushing the
Dow index and the Nasdaq composite higher.
</P>
<P>
The enthusiasm about technology shares sidelined the new
report on sign of the hot U.S. economy. The Commerce Department
said new-home sales rose 16.3 percent in October, hitting a record
level despite the higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The rising home sales could prompt the Federal Reserve to
raise interest rates early next year to cool off the economy in an
effort to keep inflation under control. The Federal Reserve has
already raised rates three times this year.
</P>
<P>
The report on home sales hit bonds and sent the yield on the
30-year Treasury to 6.32 percent today up from 6.29 percent
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index 2.39 at 637.16 and the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 6.77 at 460.44. But the American Stock
Exchange index fell 1.22 at 833.36.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues barely outnumbered decliners on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 1,541 up, 1,528 down and 479 unchanged.

NYSE volume increased to 890.70 million shares from 881.52

<HEADLINE> China Says its Entry into WTO Helps World Trade System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEATTLE, December 2 (Xinhua) -- China said on Thursday that its
entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) will be a "great
contribution" to the multilateral trading system and a "strong
support" to the new round of global trade talks.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made by Shi Guangsheng, minister for foreign
trade and economic cooperation, at the third ministerial meeting
of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
China, which applied for accession to WTO's predecessor, the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 13 years ago, last
month concluded its bilateral talks with the United States, last
week with Canada and is now conducting negotiations with other
members.
</P>
<P>
"I can predict that in the near future, China will become a
full member of the World Trade Organization," Shi declared.
</P>
<P>
"After its accession to the WTO, China will fulfill
corresponding obligations and abide by the rules of WTO while
enjoying its legitimate rights as a WTO member," he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of globalization, one of the major topics for the
ministers during the conference, Shi said the process has "obvious
defects."
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government fully affirms the important part the
multilateral trading system has played in the promotion of world
economic and trade development over the past five decades," he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, China also believes that WTO's "failure to fully
reflect the rights, interests and demands of the developing
countries shows how incomplete and unbalanced this organization is.
"
</P>
<P>
The ministers from 135 WTO members are meeting here to launch a
new round of trade talks, the Millennium Round. China attends the
meeting as an observer.
</P>
<P>
"The time of the launching of a new round of negotiations is
also the time when the multilateral trading system has to make
choices," Shi said.
</P>
<P>
"The choice we must make today is whether to allow more
countries, including developing countries, to enjoy the
opportunities and benefits brought about by the economic
globalization, or to widen the gap between rich and poor countries
and even to allow some countries to be marginalized," he affirmed.
</P>
<P>
The choice is also about whether to involve all members in the
formulation of international trade rules for the next century "
through equal participation and consultation, or to allow a small
number of members to dominate and control the process and the
result of the negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
After achieving its WTO membership, China will contribute to
the success of the new round of trade talks. "China will be a
responsible and constructive member in the future multilateral
trading system."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he also put forward five proposals for the new round,
stressing that interests of developing countries should be
respected.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial meeting, which opened November 30 and is
scheduled to close on Friday, is aimed at launching a new round of
trade talks. But sharp differences on the agenda of the round
still remain.

<HEADLINE> World's Forest Protected Areas Face Serious Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- New findings released on
Thursday by the World Bank/WWF Alliance reveal that less than one
quarter of declared national parks, wildlife refuges, and other
protected areas in 10 key forested countries were well managed,
and many had no management at all.
</P>
<P>
What this means is that only one percent of these areas are
secure from serious threats such as human settlement, agriculture,
logging hunting, mining, pollution, war, and tourism, among other
pressures, the alliance said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
In response to these findings from a study conducted by IUCN-
The World Conservation Union, for the World Bank/WWF Alliance for
Forest Conservation and Sustainable Use, World Bank President
James D. Wolfensohn and WWF-U.S. President Kathryn S. Fuller
adopted Thursday a new target for converting these so called "
paper parks" into effectively managed areas.
</P>
<P>
The target calls for 50 million hectares of existing but highly
threatened forest protected area to be secured under effective
management by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this goal, the alliance will continue to work with
governments, conservation organizations, indigenous people and
other stakeholders to identify the world's most threatened parks
and to develop a system for implementation, improving and
monitoring management of these protected areas.
</P>
<P>
"This new research highlights the urgent need to manage these
protected areas more effectively so that they are secure for the
people and wildlife who depend upon them for their survival," said
Fuller.
</P>
<P>
The findings, among others, are outlined in the World Bank/WWF
Alliance's first annual report released Thursday by Wolfensohn and
Fuller.
</P>
<P>
"Alleviating poverty and protecting the environment go hand in
hand," said Wolfensohn. "This alliance will help leverage our
contract with nature, delivering real results on the ground."
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and The World Wide Fund for Nature joined forces
in April of 1998 to protect the Earth's forests in an alliance for
forest conservation and sustainable use.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the alliance has projects in over 22 countries
worldwide and is continuing to form partnerships with other non-
government organizations and governments to make their global
vision for the future of the world's forests become a reality.

<HEADLINE> Rebel Stronghold in S. Leone to be Deployed with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations peacekeeping
force in Sierra Leone is planning to deploy a combat-ready
battalion of Indian Gurkha troops to the most sensitive area of
its operations.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here Thursday said that the Gurkhas are to be
deployed in the diamond mining Eastern region, where rebel
military commander Sam Bokarie -- known as Mosquito -- has his
stronghold.
</P>
<P>
The Gurkha troops are from battle-hardened units that have been
fighting insurgents in Kashmir, top U.N.sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leone government and rebels signed a peace agreement
earlier this year and a 6,000-strong U.N. force is in the process
of being deployed there to monitor and support the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted sources as saying that the rebel commanders
had been informed about the plan and they have, somewhat
reluctantly, accepted it.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is actually sending peacekeepers originating
from outside the West African region to the most sensitive parts
of the country.
</P>
<P>
This is because many of the mainly-Nigerian West African troops
who make up the bulk of the U.N. force have been fighting the
rebels for years as part of a regional intervention army. The West
Africans are therefore open to rebel accusations that they are not
neutral.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, while the Indians will be deployed to the
rebel-held east - - probably in the next few weeks -- Kenyan
soldiers will be sent to the northern town of Makeni, which is
also rebel-controlled.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. commanders, it is almost inevitable that the
peacekeepers will meet some sort of military action mounted by
rebels.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 2 (Xinhua)-- The foreign ministers of
five Central American countries started Thursday in El Salvador a
meeting to seek a solution to the controversy that emerged after
the impugnation of Nicaragua to a limits agreement signed between
Honduras and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The meeting behind closed doors is being held in the Comalapa
airport in El Salvador, attended by the general secretary of the
Central American Integration System (SICA), former Nicaraguan
foreign minister Ernesto Leal, according to reports reaching here
from San Salvador.
</P>
<P>
The Honduran Congress ratified Tuesday a treaty on maritime
delimitation signed in 1986 with Colombia, that according to
Nicaragua, causes it the loss of 130,000 square kilometers of
maritime platform.
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman announced the imposition of
a 35 percent tax to commodities entering his country from Honduras
and Colombia, as a retaliation for the ratification of the treaty
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the treaty, Honduras recognizes Colombia's
sovereignty over the island of San Andres, reclaimed by Nicaragua.
The agreement establishes the maritime border between Honduras and
Nicaragua in parallel 15th and between Nicaragua and Colombia in
the meridian 82th.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua maintains that its maritime border with Honduras is
in parallel 15.

<HEADLINE> First Meeting of High-Level Group for Devising Romania's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The high-level working group
for devising Romania's development strategy on a medium-term met
for the first time on Thursday in Bucharest, presided by Prime
Minister Radu Vasile and director general for economic and
financial affairs of the European Commission Giovanni Ravasio.
</P>
<P>
This joint forum was created at the initiative of European
Union enlargement commissioner Guenter Verheugen who underscored,
on the occasion of a visit to Bucharest, that the European Union
wanted to demonstrate its wish to help Romania in the admission
process both financially and by assistance in the economic field.
</P>
<P>
Giovanni Ravasio emphasized at a press conference that '"
Romania needs this strategy with or without the wish to join the
EU, both for its citizens and for its future development.''
</P>
<P>
This strategy ''is a goal of the Romanians, a Romanian program
that will be established and achieved by the Romanians in their
own interest. It will be imposed neither from Brussels nor from
Washington. We only wish to support Romania and EU, World Bank and
IMF experts will be involved in this project,'' added Giovanni
Ravasio.
</P>
<P>
Ravasio said that this kind of action was not specific to
Romania, as other candidate countries, Poland, Hungary, Slovenia,
had been in similar situations.
</P>
<P>
The EU does not expect immediate results, this strategy is for
a 2-4 year period, underlined the European official. He added that
it was very important for the economic policies of Romania to take
this strategy into account.

<P>
LONDON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Army
Thursday announced it has appointed a representative to liaise
with the arms decommissioning body.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was a key element in moves to implement the
1998 Good Friday peace agreement intended to draw a line under 30
years of violence in the British province, BBC reported.
</P>
<P>
The guerrilla group warned the Ulster Unionist Party's "
conditional" approach to the setting up of a new peace institution
was being "considered."
</P>
<P>
The IRA was unhappy with a decision by pro-British unionists to
delay until February their final approval of a formula to revive
the Good Friday peace accord.
</P>
<P>
But the IRA said in a statement that it was "honoring its
commitment" to appoint a go-between.

<HEADLINE> Authorities: German Neo-Nazi Web Sites Rising in Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 2 (Xinhua)--The number of German far right
extremists is rising continuously in recent years, not only in the
real world but also in the Internet, authorities said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The number of neo-Nazi web sites written in German has grown to
about 320 up from 30 in year 1996 Eckart Werthebach, a senator in
Berlin for interior affairs, was quoted as telling the Deutsche
Presse Agentur (DPA) news agency.
</P>
<P>
There are further some 1,400 web sites in 30 other countries,
said Peter Frisch, president of Federal Office of Constitute
Protection. The office based in Cologne is Germany's domestic
security agency.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, more contents in these web sites are focused
on making explosive ad bombs, deploying violence against political
opposites, and even murder the opposites, said Frisch.
</P>
<P>
These web sites are world wide accessible, making it more
difficult for the office to observe and control, Werthebach added.
</P>
<P>
In year 1998, there were 53,600 far right extremists registered
in Germany, up from 48,400 in 1997, said Frisch. Among them, some
8,200 were recorded as "dangerous violent, " up from 7,600 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Most of the violent neo-Nazis are based in eastern states, and
two-thirds of them are youth or young adults, he said.
</P>
<P>
German authorities are more concerned about those "neo-Nazi
potentials," especially in the capital Berlin.
</P>
<P>
The geographic site of Berlin makes neo-Nazi potentials easier
to be mobilized said Werthebach, quoting that the number neo-Nazi
potentials in Berlin had doubled from year 1990 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
But there are still no signs that Berlin, as the center of
Hitler's Third Reich, has become a symbol character for neo-Nazis,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Divided on Iraq's Oil-For-Food Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council Thursday failed to reach an agreement on Iraq's
oil-for-food program after hours of discussion.
</P>
<P>
The sixth phase of the oil-for-food program, which began on
May 25, 1999 and should have expired on November 20, was extended
last month by the Security Council for two weeks until December 4,
a stopgap of the Council amid its differences.
</P>
<P>
With the expiring date coming, the Council has tried to hammer
out a way to continue the program.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. diplomats, now there are two options for the
program. One is to extend the current phase for another week which
was proposed by the United States and supported by Britain.
</P>
<P>
 The other one favored a six-month period renewal of the
program which was proposed by France and supported by Russia and
China.
</P>
<P>
 Iraq has reiterated that it will reject the one-week
extension of the program, saying the move is aimed to prolong the
sanctions against it.
</P>
<P>
 It is widely seen here that the U.S. recommendation was
designed to push the Council to reach a new comprehensive policy
towards Iraq at an early date.
</P>
<P>
 The diplomats said the Security Council will meet on the oil-
for-food program Friday and it is expected to vote on one of the
options.
</P>
<P>
 Iraq has been under stringent U.N. sanctions since its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The oil-for-food program, which began
to be implemented in late 1996, is aimed to ease the deteriorating
humanitarian situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, Iraq is allowed to sell 5.2 billion U.S.
dollars worth of oil in every six months to buy food, medicine and
other necessities for its people.

<HEADLINE> Greece Wants EU Guarantees for Turkey's Candidacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Greece wanted guarantees from
the European Union (EU) that if it supported Turkey's EU candidacy,
this would not be followed by a rekindling of disputes with the
neighboring country, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis said
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
After talks with his visiting Finnish counterpart, Paavo
Lipponen, Simitis said that his country did not wish to find
itself tomorrow facing obstacles to Cyprus' accession prospects
and its sovereign rights being disputed, without clearly defined
and accepted procedures by all on the most efficient way of
resolving such disputes.
</P>
<P>
Greece wanted to endorse Turkey's candidacy at the forthcoming
EU Helsinki summit, as this would be to the benefit of all, but
would veto it without such guarantees, he said, adding that it was
in the interest of the EU not to become entangled in disputes and
face problems between members or candidates.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Greece hoped for an agreement in Helsinki but the
participation of any country in Europe must guarantee development,
peace and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that clear answers required answers to the
procedures regarding the entry of Cyprus to the EU.
</P>
<P>
Lipponen, whose country currently holds the six-month EU
rotating presidency, said that given the present favorable climate,
which has never existed before, there was an opportunity for
certain encouraging steps on Turkey's part.
</P>
<P>
Lipponen, who arrived here Thursday, said Wednesday that it was
too soon to say whether Turkey would be made a formal candidate
for EU membership at a summit next week.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Demands Return of Boy Taken to United States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cuban Foreign Ministry spokesman Alejandro Gonzalez said that
the little Elian Gonzales must be immediately returned, whose
mother and stepfather died last week off the Florida coast,
together with other nine people when they were trying to reach the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, the United States government will be responsible of
the way the relations between the two countries could worsen,"
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"The scenes of a kidnapped Cuban boy, surrounded with toys,
with which his innocent conscience they want to buy, are revolting,
" said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the possibility that the boy's fate could be decided
by a U.S. Family Court, he said that "this is not a matter of
negotiation, nor of legal procedures in the hands of venal and
corrupted judges such as those of Florida, but a political
question of the highest sensitivity."
</P>
<P>
Elian's father, Juan Manuel Gonzalez, who remains in the island,
asked the Cuban Foreign Ministry to make all the efforts to obtain
the return of the minor, who after being picked up from the sea by
some fishermen, was handed over to some remote relatives residing
in Miami.
</P>
<P>
The father, who is backed by the Cuban government, demands the
return of the infant, whose mother took him from the country
subrepticiously, without having the authorization of the father.
</P>
<P>
"What they are doing is to use him in the policy against Cuba,"
said Juan Manuel Gonzalez, who also responsibilized of the
manipulation the relatives "who maintain the child kidnapped in
the United States."
</P>
<P>
According to the Cuban Family Code, and by dispositions of
international law, if the mother dies, the custody of the child
legally corresponds to the father, who have no impediments to
assume that responsibility.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, all four of Elian Gonzalez's grandparents wanted
him returned to Cuba. They asked Cuban government to help bring
the child back home.

<HEADLINE> Italian FM Hopes EU to Grant Turkey Candidate Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking to a joint session of the parliamentary foreign
affairs committees, Dini stressed that Italy had never ceased to
repeat to Turkey that it cannot hope to join the EU unless it
changes its laws on human rights, freedom of expression and
minorities.
</P>
<P>
Dini said the Italian position had always been "very clear"
although Italy tried not to broadcast it too loudly for fear of a
rebound effect, since "there is a process we believe must be
encouraged and which we are trying not to discourage."
</P>
<P>
On EU enlargement, Dini said he thought the EU would agree to
the Italian idea of setting a fixed date - 2002/2003 - for saying
that the EU was ready to accept new members, once the necessary
internal reforms were completed.
</P>
<P>
But he said it was "unrealistic" to set a date for the end of
membership talks given the differences between countries'
readiness.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) on reform
should end before the end of next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is supposed to open in March, but Rome is prepared to see it
start earlier, he said.
</P>
<P>
Italy believes the IGC should not focus only on the size and
make-up of the European Commission, the re-weighting of votes in
the Council of Ministers and the extension of majority voting, he
said.
</P>
<P>
As for the EU's military autonomy, Dini said a majority of the
EU is in favor of setting goals in Helsinki, such as "the capacity
by the year 2003 to put into the field within 60 days, for at
least a year 50,000 men."
</P>
<P>
These troops would be used for humanitarian missions with or
without NATO, if the Atlantic Alliance did not want to take part.
