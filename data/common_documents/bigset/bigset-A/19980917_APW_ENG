Malaysia restricts Singapore rescue, military flights

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Singapore aircraft conducting
search and rescue operations or military training flights will
require case-by-case approval to enter Malaysian air space from
Friday, the Defense Ministry announced.
	   The practice of giving blanket approval for Singapore fighter
jets to traverse Malaysian air space, and for other aircraft to
conduct search and rescue, will be terminated, the ministry said in
a statement carried by the national news agency, Bernama.
	   No explanation was given for the change.
	   Singapore's Defense Ministry said it had no immediate comment.
Singapore's government television and radio reported the Malaysian
Defense Ministry statement without elaboration.
	   The two countries' relations have grown increasingly acrimonious
over the past two weeks in disputes over the location of a railroad
border post, trading of Malaysian currency and stocks in Singapore,
and competition between the two countries' ports.
	   Malaysian leaders, including the defense minister, have reacted
angrily this week to the launch of memoirs by Singapore's senior
minister, Lee Kuan Yew. The book, ``The Singapore Story,'' is
deeply critical of Malaysian leadership.

A'Hern wins 20k walk; Boldon aims for 100m world record
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Modahl return, Mutola Games record, women's
heptathlon, will be updated by 1400 GMT with finals &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Nick A'Hern pulled away from the
field at the midpoint of the race to win the 20-kilometer walk
Thursday and capture Australia's 41st gold of the Commonwealth
Games.
	   On the day Trinidad's Ato Boldon attempted a world record run in
the 100 meters under pressure from Namibia's Frankie Fredericks and
Obadele Thompson of Barbados, A'Hern was in a class of his own in
the walk around Lake Titiwangsa.
	   After sharing the lead with Canada's Arturo Huerta and another
Australian, Nathan Deaks, A'Hern made his move 45 minutes into the
race and finished some 250 meters clear of Huerta in 1 hour, 24
minutes, 59 seconds.
	   The Canadian won the silver in 1:25.49 with Deakes third in
1:26.06.
	   Maria Mutola, the Olympic bronze medalist from Mozambique, set a
Games record in the heats in the 800 meters, which marked the
return of Diane Modahl of England.
	   The African star clocked 1:59.06, becoming the first runner to
break 2 minutes in the Games and removing Modahl's mark of 2:00.25
from the record books. Modahl's record was at Auckland in 1990 and
that was her last race in the Games.
	   Days before she was due to defend her title, she was pulled out
of the English team at Victoria, British Columbia, in 1994 after
testing positive for high levels of testosterone. Modahl declared
her innocence, arguing that the tests were flawed, and she was
reinstated despite serving 20 months of a four-year ban that was
later quashed.
	   Declaring before the Games that she was still the defending
champion, Modahl ran 2:06.44 to win her heat.
	   England's Denise Lewis, the defending champion, Olympic bronze
medalist and world silver medalist, looked almost certain for a
repeat win in the heptathlon.
	   She won the long jump with a leap of 6.52 meters, her third
victory from five events, and was 162 points clear of second place
Jane Jamieson of Australia with just the javelin and 800 meters to
come later Thursday.
	   The walk medals were the first to be presented on the second day
of athletics. The highlight of the six finals later Thursday in the
100,000-capacity National Stadium at Bukit Jalil was the men's 100
meters in which Boldon, Fredericks and Thompson were expected to
fight over the medals, with European champion Darren Campbell and
Australia's new sprint star, Matthew Shirvington, also in
contention.
	   Boldon has said the heat and humidity in Kuala Lumpur suit him
and are ideal for setting a world record.
	   The Trinidad sprinter, who trains in Los Angeles under respected
American coach John Smith, is targeting the 9.84 seconds set by
Canada's Donovan Bailey at the Atlanta Olympics, where Boldon
finished third behind the Canadian and Fredericks.
	   After his two rounds Wednesday, however, Boldon was not so
certain that the track was fast enough.
	   ``I'm starting to have my doubts about the track,'' he said.
``It's not just me, it's the times the other guys are running.
	   ``I think Frankie should have run faster so I'm having a few
questions about whether it's a world record track.''
	   Fredericks' best time, after a poor start, was 10.15 while
Thompson had 10.09 and Shirvington 10.13.
	   Both the semifinal and final were scheduled for the evening,
when other medals would be presented in the steeplechase, the
women's 100, 400 and 5,000 meters, and the men's discus.

Young takes hat trick as Australia disposes of Kiwis for 58
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be led after Australian innings &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Leg-spinner Brad Young got a
hat-trick Thursday in a deadly Australian bowling conquest that
bundled out New Zealand for 58 in a semifinal of the Commonwealth
Games cricket tournament.
	   Bowling on a fiercely turning wicket, the 25-year-old South
Australian dispatched Matthew Bell, Daniel Vettori and Paul Wiseman
in the 26th over to wipe out part of the tail. He earlier claimed
Adam Parore, and finished with four wickets for four runs off four
overs.
	   The New Zealand downfall began in the third over when opener
Nathan Astle edged medium pacer Damien Fleming's outswinger to give
wicket keeper Adam Gilchrist an easy catch. Fleming took two more
wickets for his final figures of 7-2-23-3.
	   With New Zealand down six wickets and the score at 58, Young
began the over that produced the first hat trick in the
Commonwealth Games, where cricket is being featured for the first
time.
	   Young had Bell caught at backward point by Ricky Ponting. On the
next ball, the left-handed Vettori was caught by Tom Moody in the
first slip, who took the ball as it bounced off Gilchrist's gloves.
The hat-trick ball claimed Wiseman, caught again by Moody in the
same position.
	   New Zealand, now down 9 for 58, lost the final wicket of Alex
Tait in the 27th over to Gavin Robertson without adding any runs.
	   Kiwi captain Stephen Fleming top scored with 20 while Adam
Parore (12) and Bell (11) were the only other batsmen to reach
double figures.
	   Australia's target of 59 runs required it to score at a rate of
1.18 an over.
	   The winner will play South Africa in the gold medal match
Saturday while the loser will face Sri Lanka in a bronze medal
playoff.
	   Australia has made no changes from the side that defeated India
last Tuesday.
	   Teams:
	   Australia: Steven Waugh (capt), Mark Waugh, Adam Gilchrist,
Ricky Ponting, Michael Bevan, Darren Lehmann, Tom Moody, Gavin
Robertson, Brad Young, Damien Fleming, Michael Kasprowicz, Andy
Bichel (12th man).
	   New Zealand: Stephen Fleming (capt), Nathan Astle, Chris Horne,
Craig McMillan, Adam Parore, Chris Harris, Matthew Bell, Alex Tait,
Daniel Vettori, Paul Wiseman, Shayne O'Connor, Geoff Allot (12th
man).

Honduran president proposes abolishing top military post
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FREDDY CUEVAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ President Carlos Flores Facusse has
proposed abolishing the nation's top military post, saying it would
strengthen civilian power in a country long run by soldiers.
	   Congress began debating the measure to amend the constitution
Wednesday night, following the president's announcement.
	   The government created the post of armed forces chief in 1960 at
the demand of the military during a brief period of civilian rule.
	   The army toppled civilian presidents in 1956, 1963 and 1973,
with military leaders ruling for a total of almost 20 years before
turning over power in 1981.
	   Its political power, and troop force, has gradually eroded under
a series of civilian presidents since 1981.
	   ``With this step, the armed forces will ratify their
subordination to the civilians and help to modernize the Honduran
democratic system,'' Flores Facusse told a news conference.
	   The current armed forces chief, Gen. Mario Hung Pacheco, is due
to retire in January. He said the military agreed with the measure.
	   Armed forces chiefs have been elected by the congress from a
list nominated by the military. Hung Pacheco has served since 1996.
	   The position of armed forces chief would be replaced by a
strengthened minister of defense, a post which until now has been
overshadowed by the military leader.

British royals visit two former colonies in Southeast Asia

<TEXT>
	   BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei (AP) _ Two of the world's oldest
ruling dynasties were to gather Thursday as Queen Elizabeth II
prepared to visit the oil-rich kingdom of Brunei.
	   The queen and her husband, Prince Philip, chose Brunei and
Malaysia for their only state visits this year. They have vowed to
stand by the two former British colonies in Southeast Asia during
tough economic times.
	   ``We want to show how much we value links at a time of economic
difficulties and how Britain is no fair-weather friend,'' said a
Buckingham Palace spokesman.
	   Scheduled to arrive Thursday afternoon in this tiny rain forest
on the northern tip of Borneo island, the British royals are making
their first state visit since 1972.
	   That's 12 years before the tiny kingdom gained full independence
from the United Kingdom, which had kept it a British protectorate
for nearly a century.
	   Though Brunei today is one of the wealthiest countries in the
world _ its 312,000 people pay no taxes and medical care and
education are free _ it has not been immune to the Asian contagion
that has gripped the region.
	   Brunei's absolute monarchy is embroiled in a family feud that is
believed to have cost it some dlrs 16 billion with the collapse of
its international flagship company, Amadeo.
	   The company was run by the jet-setting younger brother of Sultan
Hassanal Bolkiah, Prince Jefri Bolkiah, who has since been sacked
and remains in self-imposed exile abroad.
	   Also, the global plunge in the price of oil, which generates 80
percent of Brunei's wealth, has been compounded by the Asian
financial crisis.
	   During their four-day visit, the British royals intend to mingle
with ordinary people, no doubt to emulate the winning style of the
late Princess Diana. The queen will tour an open market, a
centuries old water village along the Brunei River and a health
clinic that caters to women and children.
	   She will also walk through the Jame' Asr Hassanil Bolkiah
Mosque, covering her head and removing her shoes in respect of
Islam, practiced by most indigenous Malays here.
	   The royal couple will also be feted in the grand style befitting
the Bolkiah dynasty, which dates back to the 14th century, and
1,000-year-old British monarchy.
	   On Friday, they will attend a state banquet at the Istana Nurul
Iman, said to be the world's largest palace with 1,788 suites,
hosted by the sultan and his two wives.
	   The sultan _ estimated by Fortune magazine to have a personal
fortune of dlrs 37 billion _ has his own squadron of private jets.
	   Brunei Darussalam, which means Abode of Peace, has been under a
state of emergency since 1962, when parliament was scrapped by
royal fiat after Brunei's first free elections swept an
anti-monarchist party to power.
	   Alcohol is forbidden _ the British commodore of the yacht club
was arrested last month for having smuggled whiskey aboard his boat
_ and criticizing royalty borders on treason.
	   The British royal visit to neighboring Malaysia, beginning
Sunday, could get more feisty as the just-sacked deputy prime
minister there has provoked a groundswell of hostility against the
17-year leadership of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.

Floods force evacuation of hundreds of people in Manila area
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Officials evacuated hundreds of
people Thursday from several villages in the Manila area and nearby
Pampanga province swamped by driving rain and floods.
	   Military helicopters and trucks stood by in case they were
needed to evacuate areas north of the city threatened by mud flows
from Mount Pinatubo, which erupted in 1991, leaving large amounts
of volcanic debris on its slopes.
	   No casualties were reported so far in the flooding, caused by
several days of continuous monsoon rains worsened by a tropical
storm north of the Philippines.
	   About 35 families were moved out of areas of Malabon near Manila
Bay with rubber boats and army trucks to escape rising floodwaters,
said Olive Luces of the Office of Civil Defense.
	   At least eight schools were closed, Luces said.
	   In Pampanga province, north of Manila, about 80 families were
evacuated from two villages near a swollen river where a dike
threatened to break, she said.
	   The Office of Civil Defense said 45 Pampanga villages were under
knee-deep floodwaters.

Sosa catches McGwire again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL;

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Sammy Sosa tied Mark McGwire in grand style.
	   Sosa hit his 63rd home run, a tiebreaking grand slam in the
eighth inning Wednesday night for the Chicago Cubs against San
Diego.
	   With flashbulbs popping and most of the crowd of 49,891 on its
feet, Sosa drove a 1-0 pitch pitch from Brian Boehringer 434 feet
(130 meters) into the second deck in left field to make it 6-2.
	   Sosa and McGwire, tied for the most home runs in a season, each
have nine games left.
	   Sosa had tied McGwire at 62 Sunday when he connected twice in a
stunning performance at Wrigley Field. That gave him four homers in
three days.
	   McGwire went back ahead when he hit his 63rd when he pinch-hit
for the Cardinals in ninth inning of the first game of a
doubleheader Tuesday night.
	   Sosa hit the third grand slam of his career, all of them this
season.
	   It was Sosa's 22nd career homer against the Padres, the most
against any opponent. He went 1-for-9 with six strikeouts in the
first two games of this four-game series.
	   Before the game, Sosa was relaxed as he met with the media on
the field. He had been holding pregame news conferences in the
Chargers' locker room at Qualcomm Stadium, but wanted a change of
scenery after striking out four times Monday night and twice while
going 1-for-5 on Tuesday.
	   He said he spoke with his mother by telephone from the Dominican
Republic on Tuesday night and she told him: ``It's OK. Don't worry.
Tomorrow is another day. Be patient. Take your time.''
	   When reporters ran out of questions, Sosa said: ``Don't go _ you
have any more questions?''
	   Someone asked Sosa what question he might have for the media. He
thought for a minute, looking up at the sky at one point, and said:
``I know _ what did Mark McGwire do today? Did he get 64?''
	   He didn't, so the two are tied. Sosa will have a chance to jump
ahead on Thursday when he faces rookie Stan Spencer. The Cardinals
are off Thursday.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Leg-spinner Brad Young took a hat
trick Thursday to wrap up a deadly Australian bowling conquest that
whipped New Zealand by nine wickets in a semifinal of the
Commonwealth Games cricket tournament.
	   Bowling on a fiercely turning wicket, the 25-year-old South
Australian dispatched Matthew Bell, Daniel Vettori and Paul Wiseman
in the 26th. Young earlier had claimed Adam Parore. He finished
with four wickets for four runs off four overs.
	   Young's performance sealed the rout that paceman Damien Fleming
started by taking three wickets in seven overs for 23 runs.
	   ``I wasn't really thinking about the hat-trick. I was just
trying to ... lob it up from the mark and (see) if something
happens,'' Young said.
	   Chasing a target of 59 in 50 overs _ a run rate of 1.18 _
Australia romped home in the 11th over with only the loss of opener
Mark Waugh.
	   The other opener, left-hander Adam Gilchrist, made short work of
the Kiwi bowlers, scoring 43 in 36 deliveries.
	   He ended the match with a six over the long-on boundary, the
second of his two sixes, and Australia finished at 62 for one. The
match ended in less than three hours before lunch.
	   The bowler who suffered most in New Zealand's humiliating defeat
was Shayne O'Connor.
	   The rot set into the New Zealand innings in the third over when
opener Nathan Astle edged Fleming's outswinger to give Gilchrist
behind the wickets an easy catch.
	   When New Zealand was down six wickets with the score at 58,
Young began the over that produced the first hat trick in the
Commonwealth Games, where cricket is being featured for the first
time.
	   Young had all-rounder Bell caught at backward point by Ricky
Ponting. On the next ball, the left-handed Vettori was caught by
Tom Moody in the first slip, who took the ball as it bounced off
Gilchrist's gloves. The hat-trick ball claimed Wiseman, caught
again by Moody in the same position.
	   New Zealand, now down 9 for 58, lost the final wicket of Alex
Tait in the 27th over to off-spinner Gavin Robertson without adding
any runs. Fast bowler Michael Kasprowicz took one wicket and one
fell to a brilliant run out by Ponting, throwing down the stumps in
a direct hit from backward point.
	   Kiwi captain Stephen Fleming top scored with 20 while Adam
Parore (12) and Bell (11) were the only other batsmen to reach
double figures. Five batsmen scored ducks.
	   Australia will play South Africa in the gold medal match
Saturday while New Zealand will face Sri Lanka in a bronze medal
playoff.
	   Australia has made no changes from the side that defeated India
on Tuesday.

Honduran government delays Viagra sales after man's illness
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Approval of Viagra in this Central
American country has been delayed while the government investigates
the illness of a man who was illegally using the anti-impotency
medicine.
	   ``Viagra still cannot be sold in Honduras because we now have a
Honduran in the hospital as a result of that medicine and we do not
want a compatriot to die due to a state decision,'' Jose Manuel
Matheu, vice-minister of health, said Wednesday.
	   ``That Honduran took two Viagras and they almost caused a heart
attack,'' Matheu said. ``He now suffers serious physical
problems.''
	   He said the 64-year-old man had obtained the medicine illegally.
	   ``The government will not authorize the use of Viagra in the
country until there is an in-depth report by the doctors who make
up the Society of Urology and that of Cardiology here,'' Matheu
said.
	   The government said in July that it expected sales of Viagra to
be legal by September.
	   Some pharmacies, however, have been selling the drug since May,
charging as much as dlrs 20 a pill.
	   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said last month that 69
Americans taking Viagra died between late March and July, with 46
of these cases linked to cardiovascular incidents. It said more
than 3.6 million prescriptions for Viagra were dispensed during
that period.
	   Pfizer Inc., the New York maker of Viagra, has said its product
``is safe and effective when used'' properly.

<TEXT>
	   In Houston, pinch-hitter Todd Hundley homered with two outs in
the 11th inning Wednesday night to give the New York Mets a 4-3 win
over the Houston Astros, concluding four games full of late drama.
	   Mike Piazza hit a three-run homer with two outs in the ninth
that put the Mets ahead 3-2, but Brad Ausmus homered with one out
in the bottom half and sent the teams to extra innings for the
third time in three days.
	   The Mets remained a half-game behind Chicago in the National
League wild-card race. The Cubs defeated San Diego 6-3.
	   New York won three of four from the NL Central champions. In
each game, the Mets hit a home run in the eighth or ninth inning
that either tied the score or put them ahead.
	   The Astros almost won it in the 10th. Mets reliever Greg
McMichael walked the bases loaded with two outs, but came back from
a 3-0 count to strike out Ricky Gutierrez.
	   Hundley hit a 94 mph (150 kph) fastball from Sean Bergman (12-9)
over the center-field fence for his third home run of the season.
	   McMichael (5-4) wound up with the win and Turk Wendell struck
out the side in the 11th for his fourth save. Bergman lost in his
first relief appearance of the season.
	   Piazza hit his 32nd home run of the season and 200th of his
career.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Galaxy-Clash game &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey (AP) _ D.C. United scored three
first-half goals Wednesday and went on to hand the New York-New
Jersey MetroStars their sixth straight Major League Soccer loss
5-0, the most lopsided defeat in club history.
	   Penalty kicks by Roy Lassier and Jaime Moreno in the fourth and
15th minutes, respectively, staked United to an early 2-0 lead and
the pair added assists on Ben Olsen's 36th-minute goal, giving the
two-time MLS champions a 3-0 edge at the interval.
	   The victory snapped a two-game losing streak for Eastern
Conference-leading D.C., which improved its record to an MLS best
23-7, good for 57 points. The MetroStars, who set a team record for
consecutive losses, fell to 14-17. They have 38 points. Their worst
previous losses were by 4-0 scores on several occasions.
 &UR; Colorado 4, Columbus 2
	   In Columbus, Ohio, Joey DiGiamarino's goal from about 25 yards
out broke a 2-2 tie as the Colorado Rapids defeated the Columbus
Crew 4-2 in Major League Soccer.
	   DiGiamarino opened the scoring in the 32nd minute, with
goalkeeper Marcus Hahnemann assisting, and has three goals for the
season, all in the last two games.
	   Wolde Harris clinched the victory by scoring in the 89th minute
from 35 yards into an empty net after Columbus goalkeeper Juergen
Sommer came out to challenge him.
	   The goal was Harris' 12th of the season, breaking the team
record of 11 set by Jean Harbor in 1996.
	   The Rapids' other goal came in the 51st minute, with Paul Bravo
scoring off assists from Tahj Jakins and DiGiamarino.
 &UR; Galaxy 1, Clash 0, SO
	   In San Jose, California, Kevin Hartman earned his sixth shutout
of the season as Los Angeles defeated the San Jose Clash 1-0 in
Major League Soccer.
	   The loss makes San Jose (11-19) the first team mathematically
eliminated from the 1998 MLS playoff race.
	   Cobi Jones, Paul Caligiuri, Welton and Mauricio Cienfuegos each
scored shootout goals as the Galaxy claimed the tiebreaker by a 4-3
margin.
	   After Hartman stopped Victor Mella's first-round shot, Eddie
Lewis, Francisco Uribe and Harut Karapetyan each converted for the
Clash. But Ronald Cerritos, San Jose's leading scorer, sent his
fifth-round attempt wide to the right to give Los Angeles (23-7)
the victory.
	   Hartman withstood a last-minute surge by San Jose. Clash
defender John Doyle hit the crossbar with a point-blank header in
the 77th minute, and Hartman made a diving save to deny Cerritos on
a one-on-one opportunity with 85 seconds remaining.

China smuggling crackdown boosts prices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ A nationwide crackdown on smuggling is
driving prices of many commodities higher, reversing a yearlong
downward trend, the newspaper China Securities Times reported
Thursday.
	   Widespread smuggling had undercut prices for more expensive
Chinese-made products and legal imports. A massive blocking of
channels for illegal imports in southern China has thus pushed
prices higher, the report said.
	   The price of gasoline is about 17 percent higher than two months
ago, at more than 2,000 yuan (dlrs 242) a ton. The price of
polyester has risen 21 percent to 7,000 yuan (dlrs 847) a ton and
polyester fiber prices are up 17 percent to 8,200 yuan (dlrs 993) a
ton, the China Securities Times said.
	   Prices for computers, electrical appliances, photographic film,
urea, phosphates, and other fertilizers have also risen, the paper
said.
	   The government imposes high taxes and quotas on imports to
protect China's domestic producers from intense competition from
overseas companies. The policy inflates the prices of many
manufactured goods and also creates an incentive for smuggling.
	   Since the anti-smuggling campaign was launched in July, police
have cracked 220 smuggling cases and confiscated goods worth 1.3
billion yuan (dlrs 157.4 million), including 320 million yuan (dlrs
38.7 million) in mobile-telecommunication equipment; 170 million
yuan (dlrs 20.58 million) in autos and auto parts; 108 million yuan
(dlrs 13 million) in gasoline and 60 million yuan (dlrs 7.26
million) in chemical materials.
	   Before the new attempt to restrict illegal imports, many Chinese
companies were selling products well below their manufacturing
costs.
	   With state banks trying to avoid lending to money-losing
enterprises, state producers of raw commodities, including steel,
rubber, copper, and oil, were facing bankruptcy pressure because of
mounting losses. Some of these companies are among China's biggest
employers.
	   The new import restrictions are helping many of these companies
stay in business, analysts say.

Congolese rebels use hijacked pilots, planes to fly troops
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels, in a hurry to conquer this
vast country, hijacked pilots and planes at the beginning of their
rebellion to ferry troops and weapons.
	   Seven weeks later, the pilots are still flying for the rebels _
often at gunpoint.
	   ``I can't leave. I can't escape, otherwise they'll get me,''
said the captain of a Boeing 727, who is forced to fly across front
lines. ``I am not even paid for flying soldiers.''
	   During the 1996 rebellion that toppled longtime dictator Mobutu
Sese Seko and installed Laurent Kabila in power, it took Kabila's
rebels six months to walk from the eastern town of Goma to
Kinshasa, 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) away, taking this vast
country town by town.
	   This time, rebel commanders boast of having an air bridge of
troops and supplies that shortened their advance from east to west
to less than week.
	   Declaring their revolt Aug. 2, the rebels commandeered private
and commercial aircraft on routine flights from the capital of
Kinshasa to Goma.
	   The rebels were beaten back by Kabila's allies from Angola,
Zimbabwe and Namibia, but came within miles (kilometers) of
Kinshasa from the Atlantic Ocean air base of Kitona, where almost
hourly flights from Goma unloaded more than 10,000 rebel fighters.
	   The rebels still control a string of eastern towns and rely on
aircraft to deliver fresh troops and supplies to Kisangani, the
last navigable Congo River port.
	   The aircraft flown by one captive pilot is owned by
Kinshasa-based Blue Aviation. Armed soldiers seized the white,
unmarked plane shortly after it landed in Goma on Aug. 2, said the
former pilot. He insisted on anonymity, fearing reprisals against
his family in Kinshasa.
	   In addition to his Boeing 727, also hijacked were at least two
Antonov transport aircraft and one Ilyushin-76, plus their Russian
or Ukrainian crews, witnesses said. Most of the aircraft were
leased by Congolese managers from Russia, Ukraine or other
countries, they said.
	   The pilots and the crews have been staying in Goma's hotels and
are not kept under guard. But they said escape was impossible
because borders and transportation are tightly controlled.
	   ``Where can I go? If I go to Rwanda, they'll catch me. If I go
to Uganda, they'll catch me,'' one pilot said. ``There is nothing I
can do but comply with their demands.''
	   For the rebels and neighboring Rwanda and Uganda, the stories
the pilots tell are damaging.
	   Although Rwanda and Uganda have repeatedly denied Kabila's
accusations that they sponsored the revolt of ethnic Tutsis,
disenchanted members of Kabila's army and opposition politicians,
the Boeing captain said he has flown troops and ammunition from
Rwandan and Ugandan airports to rebel-held towns.
	   ``I couldn't distinguish between the soldiers. They all wear
more or less the same uniforms,'' he said. ``But we've been flying
regularly between Kigali, Entebbe and Congo.''
	   Supplied by fuel from Rwanda and Uganda, the hijacked pilots
said they had no idea how long they will be needed.
	   ``I want to go home. This war could be going on for a long time.
I don't want to be part of it,'' the Boeing pilot said.

Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore fall after Greenspan comments
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore
were sharply lower early Thursday as U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan dashed hopes of a much-awaited U.S. interest rate
cut.
	   Other Asian markets gained, with the Philippines' key PSE index
rocketing 7.9 percent _ the sharpest gain in three months _ lifted
by a 25-percent rally in shares of the Philippines Long Distance
Telephone amid rumors of possible merger or takeover.
	   On Wednesday, Greenspan said in closely-watched testimony in
Congress that ``at the moment there is no endeavor to coordinate
interest rate cuts'' among Group of Seven industrialized countries.
	   Following the news, Hong Kong's key Hang Seng Index, which had
gained 3.7 percent in the past three sessions, fell sharply. In
Singapore, the Straits Times Index was also lower, after
Wednesday's 5-percent rally.
	   By midday Hong Kong recovered somewhat, shedding 2.3 percent
while Singapore lost 1.3 percent.
	   In Tokyo, share prices, especially those of major Japanese
trading houses and other companies doing business with Russia, were
also knocked lower on worries over the chaotic Russian economy.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average extended
Wednesday's 0.21 percent drop, closing the morning session 156.19
points lower, or 1.09 percent, at 14,041.51.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar bought 134.14 yen in
midday trading, down 0.78 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also
below its late New York rate of 134.90 yen overnight.
	   Despite Greenspan's remarks, most market players remain upbeat
about a U.S. rate cut, saying he still hasn't ruled one out this
year.
	   ``It's increasing likely that we're going to get a rates cut
this year,'' as a way to buffet the still robust U.S. economy from
the fallouts in Asia and other emerging markets, said Abhilit
Chakrabortti, regional strategist at HSBC Securities Asia in Hong
Kong.
	   A substantial U.S. interest rate cut, besides making the dollar
less attractive, would ``turn on the liquidity tap'' in Asia, thus
giving regional markets a much-needed boost, he said.
	   Chakrabortti, said the region's outlook remains worrying unless
Japan speeds up efforts to reform its debt-ridden banking system.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's ruling party and
opposition forces are nearing an agreement on key components of
bank reform bills, including a plan to rescue the Long-Term Credit
Bank of Japan, media reports said.
	   Elsewhere, Thailand's index opened up 1.6 percent on the back of
Wall Street's fourth session of gains Wednesday. Malaysia gained
1.2 percent, and Indonesia was up 0.64 percent.

Prodding from Washington on economy stirs up Japanese ire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY199 &QL; 
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ When Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi meets with U.S.
President Bill Clinton next week, the word from Washington will be
loud and clear: Get your economy back on track, and do it quickly.
	   At home, Obuchi is hearing a different message.
	   For many Japanese, the United States' calls for Tokyo to lift
its economy out of a nearly decade-long slump are like those of a
pushy big brother whose demands are far easier made than met.
	   ``Americans are only thinking about what's convenient for
them,'' Yoshihiro Nakamura, a 65-year-old retired civil servant,
said in an increasingly heard get-off-my-back refrain.
	   ``Americans are different from Japanese,'' he said. ``They can't
really understand us.''
	   But America's concerns are real.
	   Japan desperately needs to restart its economy if Asia is to
come out of its deepening financial crisis. If it doesn't, the
problems across the Pacific could set off a global recession,
dragging down the U.S. economic boom.
	   Obuchi _ the epitome of the quiet, consensus-building Japanese
politician _ realizes this, and has been careful not to show any
annoyance with the haranguing from Washington.
	   The meeting with Clinton next week in New York will be the
highest-profile trip abroad Obuchi has taken since assuming office
in July, and he very much wants it to be a harmonious meeting of
allies, not a showdown over the economy.
	   American officials want Japan's government to take a stronger
role in bailing out banks saddled with bad debt, to spend more on
public works projects and to implement tax cuts.
	   Obuchi has vowed to do so. But he has been bogged down by
opposition in Parliament, and Japanese officials are concerned that
the growing U.S. impatience with his lack of progress may damage
relations between the two nations.
	   Even so, harmony did not appear to top the agenda of two senior
U.S. officials in Tokyo this week to pave the way for the summit.
	   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky _ who last week
slammed Japan for its ballooning trade surpluses _ was expected to
do more of the same in her two days of talks here.
	   And Stuart Eizenstat, U.S. undersecretary of state for economic,
business and agricultural affairs, said after a round of talks
Wednesday, ``It's urgent that Japan act quickly.''
	   He was careful to add, however, that he saw Japan as an equal
ally.
	   ``We speak respectfully. We speak without condescension,'' he
said. ``We are speaking as your partners. We are speaking as your
friends.''
	   Japan's ambassador to the United States, Kunihiko Saito, said
the United States was making the demands only because it is
concerned.
	   ``Reacting with an emotional backlash would be a mistake,'' he
told the Asahi, a leading Japanese newspaper, this week.
	   But not all are so sanguine about Washington's intentions.
	   ``Japan is not making its own decisions,'' said opposition
lawmaker Nobuto Hosaka. ``We've entered a stage in which
U.S.-Japanese relations need to change.''
	   Such anti-American resentment amid economic friction is hardly
new _ in the 80s, many Japanese felt humiliated by the so-called
``Japan-bashing'' spawned by their country's growing trade surplus.
	   But Japan's economy was strong then. Not so now, and nerves are
especially raw because of the general mood of helplessness and
frustration _ which is easily redirected at America.
	   And in doing that, the tabloid press has been happy to oblige.
	   Recent inroads by U.S. companies _ exemplified by Merrill
Lynch's takeover of the outlets of failed brokerage giant Yamaichi
Securities _ have been portrayed as the start of an American
corporate invasion.
	   ``America's reoccupation of Japan,'' said a recent headline in
Shukan Gendai, a tabloid-style magazine read by hundreds of
thousands of Japanese each week.
	   The article accused the United States of trying to run Japan's
financial institutions and of seeking ``gold rush'' profits by
exploiting the nation's economic woes.

Japan's NEC to install microwave system in China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Japan's NEC Corp. said Thursday it has received
an order through trading house Marubeni Corp. to install a
microwave system worth 2.5 billion yen (dlrs 18.64 million) in
northern China's Hebei province.
	   The project is to install a 1,400 kilometer (875 mile)
synchronous digital hierarchy, or SDH, microwave transmission
system linking the main towns and cities of Hebei, NEC said in a
statement.
	   It would be the first such large-scale trunk system to be used
in China, the electronics giant said.
	   Under China's ninth five-year plan, started in 1996, the
government plans to upgrade provincial telecommunication networks
to SDH microwave lines.
	   NEC has received orders to install a total of 5,000 kilometers
(3,125 miles) of SDH microwave networks in China, the company said.

Arabs support Libya's call for guarantees for Lockerbie suspects
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BASSEM MROUE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya's calls for guarantees before handing
over two suspects in a 1988 plane bombing gets the backing of the
Arab League which also urges the United States and Britain to hold
dialogue with Tripoli, a draft resolution says.
	   But the league stops short of accepting a Libyan call to ignore
U.N. sanctions on Libya and says the embargo will be totally lifted
when the suspects stand trial.
	   However, the Arabs will suspend the sanctions as soon as an
agreement is reached on the hand over of the suspects, the draft
resolution says.
	   The decision of the 22-member Arab League was announced in a
draft resolution quoted by Egypt's Middle East News Agency late
Wednesday.
	   Arab foreign ministers, who began their twice yearly meetings
here Wednesday, will issue the final communique later Thursday.
	   ``The Arab League confirms its continued support for Libya's
demand of guarantees for a fair trial for the two suspects,'' the
draft resolution says.
	   It also calls on the United States, Britain and the Netherlands
to hold direct talks with Libya or through the offices of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to discuss the guarantees.
	   The sanctions, which ban air travel to and from the country,
were imposed in 1992 to force Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to
surrender the two Libyans suspected in the bombing of the Pan Am
passenger plane over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
	   Libya has accepted to hand over the suspects for trial in the
Netherlands conducted by Scottish judges under Scottish law. But
Britain and the United States have rejected Libyan demands for
guarantees before the suspects are handed hand over.
	   Washington has threatened to increase the sanctions to include a
ban on oil sales if Libya does not accept to surrender the men.
	   The Arab League draft resolution describes the U.S. threat as
``total disregard for Libya's positive cooperation with Security
Council resolutions.''
	   The communique is also expected to touch on Arabs' stand on last
month's U.S. missile attack on a factory in Sudan and the
eight-year U.N. economic sanctions Iraq.

Democracy campaigner detained by Chinese police
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Chinese democracy campaigner who publicly
lobbied for political change has been detained, but police won't
tell his family why or where he is being held, a human rights group
reported Thursday.
	   Fang Jue's family does not even know how long the middle-aged
government bureaucrat-turned-dissident has been in custody. His
sister saw him July 25, the last family member to do so, said the
New York-based Human Rights in China.
	   When she went to file a missing-person report three weeks later,
Beijing police claimed to not know his whereabouts and refused to
file a report or help search for him, the group said.
	   On Sept. 7, more than six weeks after his disappearance,
Beijing's Public Security Bureau notified the sister, Liu Jing, to
provide Fang Jue with money, Human Rights in China said. It gave
the following account of her contacts with police:
	   When she went to the Half-step Bridge detention center in
Beijing as directed, police refused to provide any information
about Fang. When she angrily accused them of violating rules on
family notification, police replied: ``For eight, 10 years, we can
keep him like this. It doesn't matter.''
	   Human Rights in China speculated that the treatment given Fang
and his family suggests he may be held for a long time. It noted
that prominent dissidents Wei Jingsheng, Wang Dan and Liu Nianchun
were all held in secret for periods of a year or so before their
families were notified. Wang and Wei are now in exile. Never put on
trial, Liu is in a Beijing labor camp, 3 1/3 years after his
arrest.
	   A former vice director for economic planning in southeastern
Fuzhou city, Fang captured the attention of China's domestic and
exiled democracy movement last winter by outlining his lobbying
campaign.
	   He called for direct elections, freedom of speech and stronger
civilian control of the military. He maintained that many mid-level
and senior Communist Party officials shared his views on the need
for political reform.
	   After spending much of the 1980s in the Beijing and Fuzhou
bureaucracies, Fang quit the government two years ago. He set up a
trading company, which he claimed in a July interview was merely
intended to fund his lobbying.
	   In the weeks before his disappearance, he circulated another
open letter calling on the Communist Party leadership to take
tentative steps toward democracy. Fang wanted mayoral elections and
approval for non-state newspapers in China's largest cities.

Right wing Israelis attempt settlement on disputed Jerusalem site
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a move to force the government to begin
construction, Supporters of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
placed two tents and a mobile home early Thursday at the site for a
new Jewish neighborhood in Jerusalem which is fiercely opposed by
the Palestinians.
	   Police evicted the settlers after a few hours. The settlers did
not not resist and were detained for questioning.
	   About 35 members of the Betar youth group planted the Israeli
flag and the flag of their organization at the Har Homa site. They
carried placards saying ``next year in a built-up Har Homa.''
	   The incident occurred after Netanyahu told a gathering of
supporters that Israel will not carry out the long-delayed second
troop withdrawal in the West Bank unless Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat puts a stop to incitement against Israel in the Palestinian
news media and educational system.
	   ``If you do not stop these practices immediately, there will not
be an agreement,'' Netanyahu declared, in a rhetorical warning to
Arafat. .
	   The Palestinians, who wish to establish their capital in east
Jerusalem, say the Har Homa project is part of an Israeli plan to
cut off the Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem from their
hinterland in Bethlehem and the southern West Bank.
	   Israel maintains that Jerusalem must be under exclusive Israeli
sovereignty.
	   Ground-breaking at the Har Homa site began in March 1996,
sparking off violent Palestinian demonstrations and international
criticism. The United States was among the countries which
criticized the project.
	   Since then the ground-leveling and infrastructure has been
completed, but the government has refrained from starting
construction of the houses, apparently for fear of fresh
disturbances and criticism.
	   Netanyahu has been attacked by the more right wing elements in
his coalition government for delaying the start of construction.
	   A leader of the youth group, Danny Danon, told Israel Radio
``This morning the Betar movement came to the Har Homa site to
establish a settlement, and to send a clear message to the
government and the Jewish people that in the new year there will be
construction on Har Homa ... We intend to stay here until we
receive a date for the issuing of the tenders for the building.''
	   By ``the new year'' Danon meant the Jewish new year which begins
Sunday evening.
	   Netanyahu and Jerusalem's Mayor Ehud Olmert both said they are
in favor of building on Har Homa, but they condemned the settlers'
action and said they had no advance knowledge of it.
	   Netanyahu said that ``any action on Har Homa must be strictly in
the framework of the law. In any case, the prime minister believes
that already in the year 2,000 we will see the first buildings
there,'' his spokesman Aviv Bushinsky told The Associated Press.
	   Cabinet secretary Danny Naveh said only the government will
decide when construction will begin.

Sosa catches McGwire again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sosa quotes, final score &QL; 
 &UR; By BERNIE WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Sammy Sosa tied Mark McGwire in grand style.
	   Sosa hit his 63rd home run, a tiebreaking grand slam in the
eighth inning Wednesday night for the Chicago Cubs against San
Diego.
	   With flashbulbs popping and most of the crowd of 49,891 on its
feet, Sosa drove a 1-0 pitch from Brian Boehringer 434 feet (130
meters) into the second deck in left field, highlighting a 6-3
victory.
	   Sosa and McGwire, tied for the most home runs in a season, each
have nine games left. In Sosa's previous at-bat, he hit a two-run
double.
	   ``I think 62, 63 are pretty good for me,'' Sosa said. ``Now I
want to take my team to the playoffs.''
	   ``Right now, I feel great,'' he said. ``The game tonight was
unbelievable.''
	   Sosa had tied McGwire at 62 Sunday when he connected twice in a
stunning performance at Wrigley Field. That gave him four homers in
three days.
	   McGwire went back ahead with his 63rd when he pinch-hit for the
Cardinals in ninth inning of the first game of a doubleheader
Tuesday night.
	   Sosa's bases-loaded double in the seventh inning gave the Cubs a
2-0 lead over the Padres.
	   The slam was Sosa's 22nd career homer against the Padres, the
most against any opponent. He went 1-for-9 with six strikeouts in
the first two games of this four-game series.
	   Before the game, Sosa was relaxed as he met with the media on
the field. He had been holding pregame news conferences in the
Chargers' locker room at Qualcomm Stadium, but wanted a change of
scenery after striking out four times Monday night and twice while
going 1-for-5 on Tuesday.
	   He said he spoke with his mother by telephone from the Dominican
Republic on Tuesday night and she told him: ``It's OK. Don't worry.
Tomorrow is another day. Be patient. Take your time.''
	   When reporters ran out of questions, Sosa said: ``Don't go _ you
have any more questions?''
	   Someone asked Sosa what question he might have for the media. He
thought for a minute, looking up at the sky at one point, and said:
``I know _ what did Mark McGwire do today? Did he get 64?''
	   He didn't, so the two are tied. Sosa will have a chance to jump
ahead on Thursday when he faces rookie Stan Spencer. The Cardinals
are off Thursday.

Sosa grand slam keeps Cubs ahead in wild card race
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Sammy Sosa matched Mark McGwire in grand
slammin' style.
	   Sosa hit his 63rd home run, a tiebreaking grand slam in the
eighth inning, and drove in all of Chicago's runs as the Cubs beat
the San Diego Padres 6-3 Wednesday night.
	   Sosa, who hit a bases-loaded double in the seventh, helped the
Cubs hold their half-game lead over New York in the National League
wild-card race.
	   McGwire and Sosa, tied for the most home runs in a season, each
have nine games left.
	   With flashbulbs popping and most of the crowd of 49,891 on its
feet, Sosa drove a 93 mph (149 kph) fastball from Brian Boehringer
into the second deck in left field with two outs.
	   Sosa had tied McGwire at 62 Sunday when he connected twice in a
stunning performance at Wrigley Field. That gave him four homers in
three days.
	   McGwire went back ahead when he hit his 63rd for the Cardinals
in the ninth inning of the first game of a doubleheader Tuesday
night.
	   The crowd went wild when Sosa's ball settled inside the foul
pole, setting off a mad scramble for the souvenir, and he was
summoned back onto the field for a curtain call. Mark Grace stepped
out of the batter's box and Boehringer stepped off the mound during
the ovation.
	   Sosa hit the third grand slam of his career, all of them this
season. He tied his career high with six RBIs in a game, and took
over the major league lead with 154 RBIs.
	   Terry Mulholland (5-5) was the winner and Rod Beck got his 48th
save. Dan Miceli (10-5) took the loss.
 &UR; Cardinals 4, Pirates 0
	   In St. Louis, Jason Christiansen barely avoided giving up Mark
McGwire's 64th home run, too.
	   McGwire, who hit homer No. 63 off Christiansen the previous day,
flied out to the warning track against the Pittsburgh reliever.
	   On Tuesday, McGwire ended his six-game, 18 at-bat homerless
drought with a pinch-hit shot in the ninth inning.
	   This time, McGwire hit a high fly ball that fell short for the
final out in the seventh, stranding two runners.
	   McGwire was 0-for-3 with a walk, his 155th of the season. He
needs 15 walks in the final nine games to tie Babe Ruth's 1923
major league record.
	   McGwire walked in the first, took a called third strike in the
third, and also flied out to center in the sixth.
 &UR; Mets 4, Astros 3, 11 innings
	   In Houston, pinch-hitter Todd Hundley homered with two outs in
the 11th inning Wednesday night to give the New York Mets a 4-3 win
over the Houston Astros, concluding four games full of late drama.
	   Mike Piazza hit a three-run homer with two outs in the ninth
that put the Mets ahead 3-2, but Brad Ausmus homered with one out
in the bottom half and sent the teams to extra innings for the
third time in three days.
	   The Mets remained a half-game behind Chicago in the NL wild-card
race.
	   New York won three of four from the NL Central champions. In
each game, the Mets hit a home run in the eighth or ninth inning
that either tied the score or put them ahead.
	   The Astros almost won it in the 10th. Mets reliever Greg
McMichael walked the bases loaded with two outs, but came back from
a 3-0 count to strike out Ricky Gutierrez.
	   Hundley hit a 94 mph (150 kph) fastball from Sean Bergman (12-9)
over the center-field fence for his third home run of the season.
	   McMichael (5-4) wound up with the win and Turk Wendell struck
out the side in the 11th for his fourth save. Bergman lost in his
first relief appearance of the season.
	   Piazza hit his 32nd home run of the season and 200th of his
career.
 &UR; Giants 6, Diamondbacks 5, 10 innings
	   In Phoenix, Barry Bonds hit an RBI triple and scored on Jeff
Kent's single in the 10th inning as the San Francisco Giants beat
the Arizona Diamondbacks.
	   Bill Mueller was 4-for-5 with two doubles as the Giants avoided
a three-game sweep at the hands of the expansion Diamondbacks and
stayed 4 1/2 games behind Chicago in the NL wild-card chase with 10
games to play.
	   Mueller led off the 10th with a single off closer Gregg Olson
(2-4). Bonds followed with a triple off the wall in deep center
field, then scored on Kent's single for a 6-4 lead.
	   David Dellucci's two-out single off Robb Nen drove in Travis Lee
in the bottom of the 10th to cut the lead to 6-5, but Jay Bell
struck out to end the game.
	   John Johnstone (5-5) got the victory. Nen, who blew a save
opportunity on Tuesday, got his 37th save.
 &UR; Braves 5, Phillies 1
	   In Atlanta, John Smoltz, tuning up for the postseason, pitched
six shutout innings and Eddie Perez hit a two-run homer as the
Atlanta Braves maintained the best record in the National League
with a victory over the Philadelphia Phillies.
	   Smoltz allowed only three hits before turning over the big lead
to the bullpen. Atlanta came within one out of its second straight
shutout against the Phillies, who managed only three runs in the
three-game series.
	   Perez went 3-for-3 with a single, double and home run and
Chipper Jones hit his 34th homer against Carlton Loewer (6-8).
	   Smoltz (16-3) has won 11 of his last 12 decisions and leads the
league with an .842 winning percentage.
 &UR; Brewers 2, Reds 0
	   In Cincinnati, Bill Pulsipher and four relievers combined on a
five-hitter as Milwaukee posted its second shutout of the season.
	   Pulsipher (3-2) allowed five hits in six innings, struck out
three and walked two. Bob Wickman pitched the ninth for his 25th
save.
	   Fernando Vina singled off Brett Tomko (12-12) to lead off the
third and scored on an RBI groundout by Jeff Cirillo. Milwaukee
added another run in the eighth when Cirillo doubled and scored on
Darrin Jackson's two-out, ground-rule double.
 &UR; Expos 3, Marlins 2
	   In Montreal, if it was their curtain call, the Montreal Expos
bowed out in style.
	   In what might have been their last game in Montreal, the Expos
rallied for two runs in the ninth inning on pinch-hit RBIs.
	   Robert Perez hit a pinch RBI single with two outs and Jose Vidro
drove in the winning run with a double to rally the Expos.
	   The Expos' ownership group has set a Sept. 30 deadline to decide
whether sufficient financing is available to build a $165 million
downtown stadium in time for the 2001 season. If they do not
proceed with the project, the team will likely be sold and moved,
possibly before the beginning of next season.
 &UR; Dodgers 2, Rockies 0
	   In Los Angeles, Brian Bohanon allowed five hits in eight shutout
innings as the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Colorado Rockies.
	   Bohanon (7-10) struck out a career-high 10 and walked two.
	   The Dodgers helped Bohanon by turning four double plays _ in the
first, fifth, sixth and seventh innings. Jeff Shaw also got a
double play in the ninth before getting his 44th save.
	   Jamey Wright (9-13) was the loser.

Corpses found in Cambodia raise questions about recent violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo PHN104 of Sept. 16 &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Cambodia &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBIN McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PONG PEAI, Cambodia (AP) _ With scarves covering their noses and
mouths, villagers in this rural suburb of the capital looked on
silently as the bloated body of an unidentified man was heaved on
the back of a wagon and carted off to a nearby pagoda.
	   The bullet-ridden body _ gagged and weighted down with a bag of
bricks _ was found floating in a small fishing pond several days
after villagers said they heard a gunshot followed by a man's
desperate cries for help. Three more muffled shots were followed by
silence, they said.
	   The body, recovered Wednesday, was one of 18 that United Nations
human rights workers say were discovered in recent days around the
capital, the scene last week of anti-government demonstrations
violently put down by police.
	   Though it is too early to say the deaths are linked to the
political unrest, human rights workers believe the discovery of the
bodies _ in irrigation ditches, in shallow graves and floating in
rivers _ is no coincidence.
	   Thomas Hammarberg, the Special Representative of the U.N.
Secretary General for Human Rights in Cambodia, expressed ``grave
concern'' Wednesday evening about the corpses, which he linked with
unacknowledged arrests and reported disappearances.
	   ``Many of the bodies bear signs of torture or other violence,
including bullet wounds and strangulation marks,'' Hammarberg said
in a statement. ``Several of the bodies had their hands tied behind
their backs and were gagged and blindfolded.''
	   The only corpse identified so far is that of a high school
student who had reportedly taken part in the protests. Hammarberg
said witnesses reported he was executed by military police.
	   Thousands of demonstrators had taken to the streets calling for
the resignation of Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, whose party won
parliamentary elections in July. The opposition believes the polls
were marred by fraud.
	   Only four protesters are known to have been killed when police
broke up demonstrations.
	   The government has acknowledged the arrests of 22 people, said
Hammarberg's statement. But U.N. human rights workers have received
``credible reports of scores of demonstrators being arrested,
including students and Buddhist monks,'' he said.
	   ``Numerous other people have been reported missing by
relatives,'' he added.
	   Hammarberg called on the government to publicly acknowledge all
instances of arrests and detention, list prisoners' names and
whereabouts and clarify the charges against them.
	   Widespread rumors about disappearances have contributed to a
climate of fear among some protesters.
	   The government has said that the newly-discovered dead may not
be linked to the opposition protests.
	   ``Even before the demonstrations took place, we the authorities
have found bodies which have been shot dead, victims of robbery and
kidnapping and looting and so on,'' said Interior Ministry
spokesman Khieu Sopheak. ``So it's too early to say they are
demonstrators.''
	   But there is a precedent for extra-judicial executions.
	   Last year, after Hun Sen ousted Prince Norodom Ranariddh as his
co-premier in a coup d'etat, as many as 100 of the prince's
supporters were killed in mysterious circumstances.
	   Most were found in shallow graves just outside of Phnom Penh,
many with clear signs of torture. Human rights workers collected
substantial evidence that Hun Sen's security forces were
responsible for the killings, but no one has been prosecuted for
any of them.

Key Japan stock index finishes at new 12-year low, dollar falls
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Nikkei close, mid-afternoon dollar and bond

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's key stock index tumbled to a new 12-year
closing low amid pessimism over Japan's economy and renewed worries
about Russia. The U.S. dollar fell against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 338.56 points,
or 2.37 percent, closing at 13,859.14. On Wednesday, the Nikkei
closed down 29.67 points, or 0.21 percent.
	   Thursday's finish was below the previous 12-year closing low of
13,915.63 set on Aug. 28.
	   In mid-afternoon trading, the dollar bought 134.16 yen, down
0.76 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New
York rate of 134.90 yen overnight.
	   On top of domestic economic factors, traders said shares of
major Japanese trading houses and other companies doing business
with Russia were among the day's losers.
	   Shares of TDK Corp., a major maker of electronic parts, sank 580
yen (dlrs 4), or 5.8 percent, to 9,320 yen (dlrs 69) per share from
Wednesday's close.
	   On Wednesday, TDK said it may face delays in the redemption of
16.31 billion yen (dlrs 121 million) that it had invested in
Russian euroyen bonds, because of the recent economic turmoil.
	   It was not clear how long the repayment delay might be, or how
much of the investment may be lost, the company has said. The bonds
were slated to be redeemed Sept. 31.
	   Earlier in the session, share prices were moderately higher on
hopes that Japan's government will soon agree on a plan to reform
the ailing banking system. But stocks moved into negative territory
toward the morning close on the Russian worries.
	   ``While the bank reform bills may bring some transparency to the
financial industry, it will not repair the basic state of the
economy,'' said Kenji Karikomi, general manager of the equity
department at Daiwa Securities.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's ruling party and opposition forces
are nearing an agreement on key components of bank reform bills,
including a plan to rescue the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan,
media reports said.
	   LTCB shares, which tumbled 13 yen or 34 percent Wednesday, fell
3 yen to 22 yen Thursday. Ruling and opposition parties are likely
to agree to temporarily nationalize the troubled bank, the reports
said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 18.44 points, or 1.69 percent, to 1,069.06.
On Monday, the TOPIX closed up 3.34 points, or 0.31 percent.
	   Meanwhile, the dollar was under selling pressure amid optimism
over the apparent progress on the banking bills.
	   Investors are now speculating on whether the U.S. Federal
Reserve Board will give any indication on interest rates when its
Open Market Committee meets on Sept. 29, traders said.
	   On Wednesday, Fed Chariman Alan Greenspan told Congress that the
United States was increasingly at risk of deflation because of the
global economic crisis, but said no interest rate cuts are planned
to halt the damaging effects.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.665 percent from 0.755 on Wednesday, driving its
price up to 115.60 from 114.92 yen.

Japanese companies raided over alleged incinerator bid-rigging
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's anti-monopoly watchdog on Thursday raided
more than 10 companies nationwide suspected of rigging bids for
contracts to build incinerators, news reports said.
	   The companies, including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., are
suspected of cooperating in choosing winners and fixing prices on
contracts for local government incinerator projects, national
broadcaster NHK reported.
	   A Mitsubishi Heavy Industries spokesman confirmed raids were
conducted at the company's head office in Tokyo and three branches
in Osaka, Nagoya and Sendai. The spokesman, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, refused to discuss details.
	   Other companies raided by officials from the Fair Trade
Commission included Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co., a
major heavy-machinery maker, NHK said.
	   A Fair Trade Commission spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the agency could not comment on ongoing raids.
	   The market value of the nation's incinerator facilities is
reportedly worth at least 300 billion yen (dlrs 2.24 billion).
	   In June, the commission searched more than 20 companies for
alleged bid-rigging on contracts to build new systems to measure
dioxins _ toxic chemical compounds produced when waste is burned.
	   Bid-rigging, known as ``dango,'' is reputedly rife in Japanese
industry. The United States has accused Japanese companies of using
the practice to block American construction firms from competing in
Japan.
	   Under Japanese law, the maximum fine for bid-rigging is 100
million yen (dlrs 746,000).

Strike-ravaged Philippine Airlines considering proposal to close
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Officials of strike-ravaged
Philippine Airlines met Thursday to discuss a recommendation that
they close down Asia's oldest airline, a senior airline official
said.
	   Airline officials said efforts to rebuild the ailing carrier
were badly damaged by a decision Wednesday by its largest union to
reject a proposal aimed at helping the company survive.
	   The senior PAL official said the board is considering the
recommendation of a five-person internal committee to close the
heavily indebted airline.
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
airline's liabilities now almost equal its assets, and the company
is losing between 40 million and 60 million pesos (dlrs 930,000 and
dlrs 1.4 million) a day pending a rehabilitation plan.
	   On Wednesday, the PAL Employees Association, which represents
ground staff, reversed an earlier decision and rejected the
proposal by company chairman and majority owner Lucio Tan.
	   The offer would have given workers three board seats and PAL
stock in exchange for a 10-year suspension of their collective
bargaining agreement. The proposal had been described as a
last-ditch move to prevent the closure of the 57-year-old airline.
	   Union president Alex Barrientos said Wednesday its members
``were prepared to face the consequence of this action.''
	   Barrientos had faced criticism from union members and leaders of
other unions for initially going along with the proposal.
	   Under the proposal made last week, Tan offered to give 20
percent ownership of the company to its employees. Each employee
would receive 60,000 shares of stock worth 300,000 pesos (about
dlrs 6,900) from the Tan group's shareholdings in PAL.
	   The company also pledged to refrain from cutting salaries, and
to rehire retrenched union members who have not received separation
pay.
	   The airline lost 2.2 billion pesos (dlrs 51 million) in the
first three months of the fiscal year beginning April 1, mainly
because of work stoppages.
	   A 22-day pilots' strike in June caused the heaviest damage,
creating revenue losses of about 200 million pesos (dlrs 4.6
million) a day, PAL says.
	   In the previous fiscal year, the carrier reported a loss of 8.08
billion pesos (dlrs 185 million).

Man attacks Chinese village students with cleaver
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A jilted lover apparently seeking revenge
attacked Chinese elementary students during a flag-raising
ceremony, injuring 23 children, eight of them seriously, state
media reported Thursday.
	   The man, holding vegetable cleavers in each hand, suddenly began
slashing out at students Monday morning as they stood in the
schoolyard in Hejiang village, southwestern Sichuan province.
	   When the students tried to escape, he chased after them,
injuring several more before he was overpowered by teachers, the
Beijing Morning Post reported.
	   It said the man, a former soldier and teacher from coastal
Guangdong province, decided to attack the school because he
believed he had been cheated and spurned by a woman from that
village.
	   All the injured children were in stable condition; many others
were traumatized by the bloodshed, the report said.
	   In another attack, a man in the Guangdong village of Magui went
on a rampage Tuesday. After failing to find a job, the man knifed
seven people to death and injured five others, the newspaper
Yangcheng Evening News reported Wednesday.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a move to force the government to begin
construction, supporters of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
placed two tents and a mobile home early Thursday at the site for a
new Jewish neighborhood in east Jerusalem which is fiercely opposed
by the Palestinians.
	   Police evicted the protesters after a few hours. They did not
resist and were detained for questioning.
	   About 35 members of the Betar youth group planted the Israeli
flag and the flag of their organization at the Har Homa site. They
carried placards declaring ``Next year in a built-up Har Homa.''
	   The incident occurred after Netanyahu told a gathering of
supporters that Israel will not carry out the long-delayed second
troop withdrawal in the West Bank unless Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat puts a stop to incitement against Israel in the Palestinian
news media and educational system.
	   ``If you do not stop these practices immediately, there will not
be an agreement,'' Netanyahu declared, in a rhetorical warning to
Arafat.
	   The Palestinians, who wish to establish their capital in east
Jerusalem, say the Har Homa project is part of an Israeli plan to
cut off the Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem from their
hinterland in Bethlehem and the southern West Bank.
	   Israel maintains that Jerusalem must be under exclusive Israeli
sovereignty.
	   Ground-breaking at the Har Homa site began in March 1996,
sparking off violent Palestinian demonstrations and international
criticism. The United States was among the countries which
criticized the project.
	   Since then ground-leveling and infrastructure work has been
done, but the government has refrained from starting construction
of the houses, apparently for fear of fresh disturbances and
criticism.
	   Netanyahu has been attacked by the more right-wing elements in
his coalition government for delaying the start of construction.
	   A leader of the youth group, Danny Danon, told Israel Radio,
``This morning the Betar movement came to the Har Homa site to
establish a settlement, and to send a clear message to the
government and the Jewish people that in the new year there will be
construction on Har Homa.''
	   By ``the new year'' Danon meant the Jewish new year which begins
Sunday evening.
	   Netanyahu and Jerusalem's Mayor Ehud Olmert both said they are
in favor of building on Har Homa, but they condemned the settlers'
action and said they had no advance knowledge of it.
	   Netanyahu said that ``any action on Har Homa must be strictly in
the framework of the law. In any case, the prime minister believes
that already in the year 2000 we will see the first buildings
there,'' his spokesman Aviv Bushinsky told The Associated Press.
	   Cabinet secretary Danny Naveh said only that the government will
decide when construction will begin.

Aussies crush Kiwis at cricket; Mutola's mark spoils Modahl return
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be updated with swim, track finals &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC;

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australia crushed neighbor New
Zealand by nine wickets to advance to the first Commonwealth Games
cricket final Thursday while track star Maria Mutola spoiled Diane
Modahl's return by taking her Games 800-meter record in the heats.
	   Susie O'Neill looked set to beat Mike Wenden's Games record of
10 swimming titles and Nick A'Hern won Australia's 41st gold by
winning the 20 kilometer walk.
	   The highlight of Thursday's action in Kuala Lumpur was the men's
100 meter track final with Ato Boldon of Trinidad threatening to
break Donovan Bailey's world record of 9.84 and likely to be
challenged by old rivals Frankie Fredericks of Namibia and Obadele
Thompson of Barbados.
	   But in terms of results, the ``Friendly Games'' turned a little
nasty.
	   With a final against South Africa beckoning on Saturday, the
Australians _ easily the most powerful team in the 16-nation
competition _ bowled the Kiwis out for only 58 at the Kilat Club
with leg spinner Brad Young taking a hat-trick.
	   Then Adam Gilchrist scored 43 off only 36 balls, ending the
match with a six, to see the Australians through to modest victory
target for the loss of only Mark Waugh.
	   On the track Modahl, withdrawn from the 1994 Games after testing
positive for high levels of testosterone, returned for the first
time since her 1990 victory to win her opening heat in a slow time
of 2 minutes 06.44.
	   Modahl, who always maintained her innocence and had a 4-year ban
quashed when she successfully argued the drug test procedure was
flawed, spent a few minutes celebrating a successful return before
Mutola gave her a shock in the very next heat.
	   Taking the lead from the gun, the Mozambique star ran away from
the field to break Modahl's record, set in 1990, by more than a
second. She clocked 1:59.06 to become the first athlete to run
under 2 minutes at the Games.
	   The 800 semifinal is Friday and the final on Saturday.
	   On the road around Lake Titiwangsa, A'Hern pulled away from the
field at the midpoint of the race to win the 20-kilometer walk.
	   After sharing the lead with Canada's Arturo Huerta and another
Australian, Nathan Deaks, A'Hern made his move 45 minutes into the
race and finished some 250 meters clear of Huerta in 1 hour, 24
minutes, 59 seconds.
	   The Canadian won the silver in 1:25.49 with Deakes third in
1:26.06.
	   O'Neill, who has won five golds here to go with one in 1990 and
three at the '94 Games in Victoria, British Columbia, cruised into
the 200 meter butterfly final, her favorite event and her Olympic
title distance.
	   She was only second fastest behind behind Canada's Jessica
Deglau but ahead of her main Aussie rival, Petria Thomas, who beat
O'Neill for the 100-meter butterfly gold.
	   On the shooting range, India's Roopa Unnikrishnan won the
women's individual sports rifle prone while England's Chris Hector
triumphed in the men's air rifle.

Barred from last Commonwealth Games, English gold medal runner is
</HEADLINE>
back &QL;

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Thrown out of the 1994
Commonwealth Games in a drug controversy, English runner Diane
Modahl was denied the chance to defend her 800-meter gold medal.
	   The 1990 winner is back. Still locked in a legal battle with the
sporting body that banned, and then reinstated her, the 32-year-old
Modahl says she wants to defend her old title.
	   ``It's great to be running,'' Modahl said Thursday after winning
a two-lap heat at the National Stadium in Kuala Lumpur before a
sparse, but enthusiastic crowd.
	   ``There are not many people in here, but they certainly made
enough noise,'' she said. The women's 800-meter semifinal is Friday
and the final Saturday.
	   Modahl's saga began in 1994, when she tested positive for 42
times the legal amount of the male hormone testosterone while
competing at a meet in Portugal.
	   The British Athletic Federation and the International Amateur
Athletic Federation banned her. But Modahl maintained the urine
samples had been contaminated at the laboratory in Lisbon and that
testing procedures were flawed.
	   She later won an appeal against her four-year ban and is
currently taking legal action against the BAF for compensation.
Forced out of action and unable to run in financially lucrative
meets for 20 months, she had to sell her home to pay legal bills.
	   Results of the drug test were released as Modahl was about to
defend her Commonwealth Games title at Victoria, Canada. She was
withdrawn from the team and sent home.
	   Out of competition for two seasons as she fought to get
reinstated, she has not won any major races since she began
competing again.
	   Coached by her husband Vicente, Modahl conserved energy in her
heat, lagging behind the pack before bursting ahead in the second
lap to finish in 2:06.44.
	   She said she was pleased to be back at the Commonwealth Games,
and was enjoying the camaraderie at the ``village,'' a condominium
complex where thousands of athletes are staying.
	   ``It's nice. My first run was in 1986, and I loved it then and
I'm still loving it now,'' she said.
	   But it was a bitter-sweet return for the English runner.
	   Minutes after her run, the Commonwealth Games 800-meter record
of 2.00:25 that Modahl set at Auckland, New Zealand in 1990 fell.
Maria Mutola of Mozambique, a three-time world indoor champion,
Olympic bronze medalist and former world titlist outdoors, clocked
1:59.06,

Philippine stocks rise sharply on record PLDT gain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks posted their
biggest gain in three months Thursday on the back of a record surge
in Philippine Long Distance Telephone shares.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index jumped 92.70
points, or 7.9 percent, to 1,269.24 after Wednesday's 36.14-point
gain.
	   Thursday's rally, which brings the index's total gains since
Monday to 187.06 points, was the most significant advance of the
market in three months.
	   PLDT shares rose 205 pesos (dlrs 4.68), or 25 percent, to 1,015
pesos (dlrs 23.17), their biggest single-session gain.
	   Traders said PLDT shares dominated market action, accounting for
1.6 billion pesos (dlrs 38 million), or 73 percent of the total
value of trades.
	   ``Don't ask me for an explanation for PLDT shares' movement.
Nobody knows. It's just pure speculation right now in the market,''
said Ian Kane, trader for Anscor-Hagedorn Securities Inc.
	   Kane said market players were convinced something is going on in
PLDT and that the company should come up with an explanation soon.
	   The market has been awash with rumors after PLDT implemented
early this month a plan to ward off possible hostile takeovers.
	   One rumor involves an alleged plan by Spain's Telefonica S.A. to
acquire a stake in PLDT with the help of political allies of
President Joseph Estrada. Another is a rumored alliance between
PLDT Chairman Antonio Cojuangco and his uncle, Eduardo Cojuangco,
to thwart outsiders from taking a substantial stake in PLDT.
	   Eduardo Cojuangco is chairman of San Miguel and another Estrada
ally.
	   Traders said another rumor circulating in the market Thursday
was that the government may finally sell its 9 percent stake in
PLDT to raise revenues to bridge a budget deficit seen reaching
dlrs 40 billion pesos (dlrs 930 million) by the year's end.
	   PLDT's gain spilled over to other blue-chip stocks. Overall,
gainers trounced decliners 65 to 22, while 31 issues were
unchanged.
	   While Thursday's market surge was a welcome surprise, traders
weren't convinced it would be sustained.
	   They said the regional economic weakness and Asian currency
crisis will continue to preoccupy investors.
	   In currency trading, the peso weakened against the dollar,
pressured by corporate demand for the U.S. currency.
	   Dealers said even relatively light demand for dollars was having
a significant impact on rates, especially with the extremely thin
foreign-exchange inflows.
	   At midday the dollar averaged 43.790 pesos, up from 43.746 pesos
on Wednesday.
	   Dealers saw corporate demand for dollars for the payment of
debts. But despite the demand, the relatively stable Japanese yen
helped underpin the peso and some other regional currencies.
	   Comments overnight by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin leaving open the
possibility of a cut in U.S. interest rates were also broadly
supportive to the peso.

Crowley out of Australian side to play Fiji
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Prop Dan Crowley pulled out of the
Australian rugby union team for Friday's World Cup qualifying match
against Fiji and has been replaced by Richard Harry.
	   A hamstring injury forced Crowley out of the side. He hopes to
be fit for Australia's other two qualifiers against Tonga and
Western Samoa.
	   Harry last played a test against New Zealand in Melbourne
earlier this year but suffered a dislocated knee cap and lost his
place to Crowley.
	   Harry came in from outside the initially announced squad of 22,
so no change is necessary to the Wallaby bench for Friday's game.
	   Tonga plays Western Samoa in the first game of Friday night's
first test doubleheader in Australia at Parramatta Stadium in
western Sydney. (djp)

Sailor to face trial on assault charge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Brisbane Broncos rugby league winger
Wendell Sailor will stand trial next month on charges of assaulting
a nightclub patron last year.
	   Sailor, 28, was charged with assault causing bodily harm to
Marcus Christian O'Sullivan on Aug. 11, 1997.
	   Police allege the pair had an altercation and that Sailor
punched O'Sullivan, a 28-year-old concreter, in the eye, causing a
wound which needed nine stitches. Sailor entered a not guilty plea
Thursday to the charge and was committed to trial in the District
Court beginning Oct. 19.
	   Sailor is in the Brisbane lineup for Saturday's National Rugby
League semifinal playoff match against Sydney City in Brisbane.

Pakistani shells damage Indian barracks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ Pakistani shells hit three Indian army
barracks along the troubled border in Kashmir overnight, a military
spokesman said.
	   The barracks were empty at the time and there were no
casualties, said Major. P. Purshotam, speaking at army headquarters
in the Kashmir state summer capital of Srinagar. The shells hit
near Kargil, 225 kilometers (140 miles) northwest of Srinagar.
	   He said Indian troops fired back in response to the Pakistani
attack.
	   Further south in Kashmir, Indian border forces reported
heavier-than-normal firing from Pakistan in the last few days, but
no casualties. A spokesman for the Border Security Forces, speaking
on customary condition of anonymity, accused Pakistan of using the
shelling to cover the infiltration of guerrillas into India.
	   India accuses Pakistan of arming and training Muslim militants
who have waged a nine-year separatist campaign in Indian-held
Kashmir, predominantly Hindu India's only Muslim-majority state.
Pakisan says it is only providing morale support to the rebels.
	   Firing across divided Kashmir is routine and rarely causes
casualties. But in July and August, hundreds of people in Pakistan
and India, most of them civilians, were killed in one of the
heaviest and most prolonged peacetime border duels between the two
countries.
	   Pakistan and India have fought two wars over Kashmir in the 51
years since the two countries were formed out of a British empire.
The region is divided between them, and both countries claim it
all.

Barshefsky urges Tokyo to take quick action to restore confidence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Warning that delay will only worsen Japan's and
Asia's economic woes, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky
Thursday urged Tokyo to take quick action to open its markets and
revive its recession-bound economy.
	   In talks to lay the ground work for a meeting Tuesday in New
York between President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi, Barshefsky said that only prompt action would restore the
confidence of financial markets spooked by Asia's and Japan's
inability to solve their economic problems.
	   Barshefsky, who leaves Friday after two days of talks with top
Japanese officials, made a broad plea for Tokyo to import more to
help the rest of Asia as well as demands aimed at benefiting
specific U.S. exporters.
	   ``Delay makes economic recovery for Japan's Asian neighbors very
difficult,'' Barshefsky told a news conference.
	   U.S. officials have pressed Japan to import more from the rest
of Asia to help lift it out of its current economic crisis.
	   Japanese officials said that, despite appearances, they
recognized the urgency of the situation and are taking action, such
as banking reform legislation now being debated in Parliament.
	   ``I'm afraid that this is a perception gap,'' said Masahiko
Hosokawa, head of the American division at the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry.
	   He added that Tokyo ``recognizes the importance'' of helping
Asia and will soon send Kaoru Yosano, the trade minister, to Asia
for talks on Japanese assistance to exporters in the region.
	   Barshefsky outlined a number of broad areas where she said Japan
should act: opening its markets to competition, cleaning up its
bad-debt-ridden banking system and spending more to stimulate its
economy.
	   But she stopped short of offering specific prescriptions in most
of these areas, saying that Japan already knew the necessary
remedies.
	   Rather, she said what Japan needed was to act decisively to
reassure financial markets.
	   ``Japan has the resources ... what it needs is decision and
action,'' she said.
	   She did, however, raise specific problems dear to U.S.
companies. She said the United States would hand Japan a list of
new deregulation measures later this month aimed at opening its
telecommunications, drug, energy and housing markets.
	   She also said she had asked that Tokyo's economic stimulus plan
include increased purchases from foreign companies and urged Japan
to further open its fish, forestry and rice markets.

Girl survives three days in floodwaters; death toll expected to

	   TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) _ She saw her mother and three brothers
swallowed by floodwaters sweeping across her village in southern
Mexico. Then, for three days, she clung to debris in the torrents
before a stranger pulled her to safety.
	   Hundreds in southern Mexico have apparently died in the worst
floods in memory, yet 9-year-old Yeri Hilda Navarro _ her shoulder
and other bones broken _ miraculously survived.
	   Yeri recounted her story from a hospital bed in Tapachula, the
southern city being used as a base for rescue workers trying to
reach isolated villages like Guadalupe Victoria, where she once
lived.
	   Just before dawn Sept. 8, the Navarro family fled their
low-lying house and tried to cross the rising Rio Novillero. The
family had waited to try to save their chickens before fleeing.
	   ``We did not have time to leave and the water reached us,'' said
her father, Jose, who stood beside Yeri's hospital bed.
	   The floods last week tore through an area the size of Belgium,
leaving residents without food, water or power. By Wednesday, 119
bodies had been recovered.
	   With many villages still isolated from the outside world _ and
television pictures showing towns where the few remaining buildings
are buried to their roofs in mud _ the death toll is expected to
rise far higher.
	   The Roman Catholic bishop of Tapachula, Felipe Arizmendi, said
as many as 1,000 may be dead.
	   More rain is forecast _ and likely to further complicate
faltering relief efforts.
	   Hunger is increasing among flood victims. Dozens of villagers in
Soconusco, 65 kilometers (40 miles) northwest of Tapachula, swarmed
an army helicopter dropping off rations and grabbed everything
inside, the daily Reforma reported Wednesday.
	   ``People are starving to death here,'' a local leader, Leobardo
Broca, was quoted as telling the soldiers. ``See for yourselves.''
	   Jose Navarro, Yeri's father, managed to fight his way across the
river. But the waters were too strong for the rest of the family to
follow and surging too quickly for him to return.
	   ``We went to the house of a neighbor, but the water was tearing
it down,'' Yeri said. ``We left and went into a pigsty. The water
continued tearing down the sty until it fell.''
	   The water started to carry the family away but the family
managed to climb a mango tree. ``The water, which came very strong,
also knocked down the tree and again the current took us,'' Yeri
said, coughing and crying as she spoke.
	   The girl said the family grabbed bits of wood, ``but then my
mama and my brothers disappeared.''
	   She held on to scraps of wood, sometimes spinning, sometimes
tossed beneath muddy waves in the floodwaters which swept far out
over usually dry farmland.
	   ``What I did was ask for God to save me, that he would bless my
mama,'' she said.
	   Yeri was entangled on a pole sticking from the water when a
stranger pulled her from the water three days later. A woman in the
nearby village of Los Cerritos cared for her until a helicopter
brought her to the hospital.
	   She hopes now for a second miracle.
	   ``I want my mama and my little brothers to be alive,'' she said.

Tijuana man emerges from pack with Sosa's No. 63 home run ball

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ A Tijuana man hoping to celebrate Mexican
Independence Day by seeing Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa hit a home run
got his wish _ and a lot more.
	   Fabian Perez Mercado, 32, emerged Wednesday night from a wild
scramble in the second deck of left field with the ball Sosa hit
for his 63rd home run. The grand slam in the eighth inning tied
Mark McGwire for the major league record for homers in a season.
	   Mercado, his pregnant wife, 2-year-old daughter and 4-year-old
son were quickly ushered out of the stands for their protection.
Others who left empty-handed either groused about their near-miss
or sounded happy just to see history.
	   ``We saw it, man! We saw it!'' Joshua Taylor, 19, shouted as he
gave a high-five to friend Matthew Donnegan.
	   ``We were this close,'' he said, spreading his arms open about
two feet (60 cms).
	   Reporters crammed into a hallway outside the Chicago locker room
hoping for a chance to talk to Mercado.
	   Cubs spokeswoman Sharon Pannozzo said Mercado wanted to get his
wife, who is two months pregnant, and his children home because of
the late hour.
	   She said Mercado said he wanted to give the ball back to Sosa,
and said the two will speak at a news conference before Thursday
afternoon's game between Chicago and San Diego.

Cambodia opposition leader meets king for crisis talks
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ Rival party leaders have agreed to
meet next week to try to end Cambodia's political crisis, King
Norodom Sihanouk said Thursday.
	   The talks, which will bring together strongman Hun Sen and his
foes Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, will be held early
Tuesday under the king's auspices in the northwestern province of
Siem Reap, he said.
	   It will be Hun Sen's first meeting with Ranariddh since he
ousted the prince in a violent coup d'etat in July last year.
	   Junior opposition leader Sam Rainsy met with Sihanouk Thursday,
leaving his sanctuary at the United Nations office in Phnom Penh
for the first time in more than a week. Ranariddh consulted with
the king on Wednesday.
	   After a four-hour meeting, Sam Rainsy said that he would attend
the meeting and that his party would be present for the convening
of parliament on Sept. 24.
	   On Monday, the ruling party and its two opposition rivals
reached a tentative three-point agreement including cessation of
demonstrations, the summit meeting and the convening of the
National Assembly, Cambodia's legislature, as scheduled.
	   Opposition leaders, protesting alleged fraud in July's
parliamentary elections, had previously threatened to boycott the
parliamentary session, which would have made it impossible to form
a new government.
	   Sam Rainsy accepted protection from the office of the U.N.
secretary-general's personal representative in Cambodia after he
was accused by Hun Sen of being behind a Sept. 7 grenade attack on
his home.
	   Hun Sen was not home and no one was hurt. Opposition leaders
denied they were behind the attack and accused Hun Sen of staging
the attack as a pretext to crack down on anti-government protests.
	   Police violence against the largely peaceful protesters began
the day after the grenade incident.
	   Ranariddh said Thursday he would demand a guarantee for the
safety of opposition politicians before officially agreeing to the
summit meeting.
	   He also called on the government to lift a travel ban Hun Sen
placed on 64 opposition members following the grenade incident.
	   ``They must lift the travel ban before anything else because
this is unconstitutional,'' said Ranariddh Thursday. ``It is
something that makes us feel we cannot trust each other.
	   ``If we want an effective negotiations, we have to talk on equal
footing, not between ruling party and hostages.''
	   Hun Sen's ruling party won a slight majority in July 26
parliamentary elections, but not the two-thirds needed to form a
government by itself. Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy accused Hun Sen of
winning through fraud.
	   Last week police violently suppressed opposition-backed
demonstrations calling for Hun Sen's ouster.
	   On Tuesday, seeking an end to the bloodshed, Ranariddh appealed
for his supporters to stop demonstrating, and on Wednesday, after
meeting the king, the prince agreed that his FUNCINPEC party would
attend the new National Assembly.
	   Just before leaving Phnom Penh for Siem Reap, Sam Rainsy lit
incense sticks before a wreath in front of a hotel marking where a
demonstrator had been killed by police.
	   ``I have always to be optimistic,'' he said wearily, when asked
for his assessment of the political situation.
	   While directly under U.N. protection, he has agreed to avoid
public political statements.

Arabs support Libya's call for guarantees for Lockerbie suspects
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with details on Libya's demand for
guarantees. &QL; 
 &UR; By BASSEM MROUE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya's calls for guarantees before handing
over two suspects in a 1988 plane bombing gets the backing of the
Arab League which also urges the United States and Britain to hold
dialogue with Tripoli, a draft resolution says.
	   But the league stops short of accepting a Libyan call to ignore
a six-year U.N. air embargo on Libya.
	   However, the Arabs will suspend the sanctions as soon as an
agreement is reached on the hand over of the suspects, the draft
resolution says.
	   The U.N. Security Council voted last month to suspend sanctions
against Libya once it hands over the two men for trial in the
Netherlands..
	   The decision of the 22-member Arab League was announced in a
draft resolution quoted by Egypt's Middle East News Agency late
Wednesday.
	   Arab foreign ministers, who began their twice yearly meetings
here Wednesday, will issue the final communique later Thursday.
	   ``The Arab League confirms its continued support for Libya's
demand of guarantees for a fair trial for the two suspects,'' the
draft resolution says.
	   It also calls on the United States, Britain and the Netherlands
to hold direct talks with Libya or through the offices of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to discuss the guarantees.
	   Under the U.S.-British plan, the suspects cannot not be
extradited once they have arrived in the Netherlands and, if
convicted, they would serve their sentences in a British prison.
	   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has accepted the principle of a
trial in the Netherlands, but has called for negotiations with the
United States and Britain on the details of the trial and the
suspects' care once they have been transferred to Dutch custody.
	   He also wants to know if the suspects would be able to appeal
the court's decision.
	   Washington and London have rejected the Libyan demands for
guarantees.
	   The sanctions, which ban air travel to and from the country,
were imposed in 1992 to force Libya to surrender the two Libyans
suspected in the bombing of the Pan Am passenger plane over
Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
	   Washington has threatened to increase the sanctions to include a
ban on oil sales if Libya does not accept to surrender the men.
	   The Arab League draft resolution describes the U.S. threat as
``total disregard for Libya's positive cooperation with Security
Council resolutions.''
	   The final communique is also expected to touch on Arabs' stand
on last month's U.S. missile attack on a factory in Sudan and the
eight-year U.N. economic sanctions Iraq.

Bowler Honeychurch calls games' golds `sweetest victory'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS item about Australian bowler Honeychurch &QL; 
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Asian champion tenpin bowler Cara
Honeychurch wasn't exactly welcomed to Malaysia, which had high
hopes for a big medal haul in that sport in the Commonwealth Games.
	   As hosts, the Malaysians had succeeded in adding tenpin bowling
to the games' program. Then the press took up ``Operation Cara,'' a
call by Malaysian coach Sid Allen for local fans to heckle the
Australian star.
	   The idea backfired. Honeychurch won in every event she entered _
women's singles and doubles and mixed doubles _ and outscored the
men's gold medalist, Malaysian Kenny Ang, with an average of 241 to
228 in the singles finals.
	   The sweep was ``the sweetest victory I've ever had,'' said the
26-year-old quality services consultant.
	   ``At the outset of the tournament I wasn't sure if I was going
to be able to mentally deal with everything that was thrown at
me,'' she said. ``But it gives me a great deal of satisfaction that
Operation Cara failed.
	   ``All it did was get me so fired up, all I wanted was to beat
the Malaysian team so badly that I didn't care what else
happened,'' she said.
	   By the end, she was a heroine even to the Malaysians, who
captured two tenpin golds, in men's singles and doubles.
	   ``It's been incredible here,'' Honeychurch said. ``We've been
mobbed in shopping centers. I can't imagine what it's like to be a
rock star and have it happen wherever you went in the world.
	   ``But we're just lapping it up, because it probably won't last
when we get home.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   TRACK TREAT: Some of the world's fastest sprinters think Kuala
Lumpur's new track lacks zip.
	   But that doesn't matter, said a Malaysian newspaper, because
Thursday's 100-meter race in Bukit Jalil stadium would be the
fastest ever on Malaysian soil.
	   ``The first ever sub-10-second 100m on Malaysian soil,'' said a
caption in Thursday's Star daily.
	   No Malaysian has ever run the 100 in less than 10 seconds and
the host nation did not qualify for the semifinals of the event.
	   On Wednesday, Ato Boldon, the Trinidad sprint star, turned
pessimistic about his chances of breaking Canadian Donovan Bailey's
world mark of 9.84 in Thursday's final.
	   But Boldon and two other sprinters _ Namibia's Frankie Fredricks
and Obadele Thompson of Barbados _ were expected to run under 10
seconds.
	   ``I'm starting to have my doubts about the track. It's not just
me, it's the times the other guys are running,'' said Boldon, due
to run both the semifinals and final on Thursday.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   HURT BOXER: Australian middleweight hope Danny Green has been
forced to withdraw from the Commonwealth Games boxing after failing
to recover from a hand injury.
	   Green hurt his hand in winning a decision against Nauruan Y'Vain
Agir on Monday. He was scheduled to fight Thursday in the
quarterfinals.
	   Team manager George Turner said the boxer was unaware of the
extent of the injury immediately after Monday's fight.
	   ``Unfortunately he sustained a crack in a bone in his hand, so
even though he won his bout he was unable to continue in the
competition,'' team doctor Brian Sando said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   JINXED RIDER: A Malaysian cyclist thinks he is jinxed.
	   Rosman Ali, 37, who was planning a much-delayed debut at the
1998 Commonwealth Games, was down with a fever that could keep him
from competing.
	   Rosman had been scheduled to race in Thursday's sprint event at
the Kuala Lumpur velodrome.
	   The cyclist also had been chosen for the 1986 Commonwealth Games
in Edinburgh, Scotland. But Malaysia withdrew from those games.
	   ``My son is just unlucky when it comes to Commonwealth Games,''
said Rosman's father and coach, Alwi Ahmad.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ROOKIE SWIMMER: Lori Munz swam the 50-meter freestyle for
Australia on Thursday in place of Sarah Ryan, who had to fly home
for her father's funeral.
	   The 19-year-old Munz celebrated with Ryan on Monday after they
won gold with Rebecca Creedy and Susan O'Neill in the 4x100m
freestyle relay.
	   But she then had to commiserate with Ryan, who wasn't told until
after the relay about her father's death from multiple sclerosis
last Saturday. Ryan flew home Tuesday.
	   Munz had won two gold medals here as a member of freestyle relay
teams, but failed by .14 second to qualify for Thursday's night
final in the 50 freestyle. Creedy was the fifth-fastest qualifier.

Yeltsin says Cabinet formation needs more time; ruble falls again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo planned. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ One month after Russia's crisis hit, the new
government's economic policy remains a mystery and the ruble was
again falling fast on Thursday. President Boris Yeltsin said it
could take another week to install the full Cabinet.
	   Yeltsin, who has made few comments about the economic problems,
met Thursday in the Kremlin with Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev.
The president said the heads of the government's security
ministries, including Sergeyev, would not change, but more time was
needed to fill other posts.
	   The key job of Finance Minister and other Cabinet positions were
still under discussion, the president said.
	   ``We will need an extra week to fully form the Cabinet,''
Yeltsin told reporters before his meeting with Sergeyev.
	   Meanwhile, the embattled ruble continued its plunge.
	   The Russian currency was trading at around 15 at the Moscow
currency exchange after recovering to 7.5 to the dollar earlier
this week. The Russian currency stood at around 6 to the dollar
before the crisis began in mid-August.
	   Yeltsin and new Prime Minister Yevgney Primakov have moved
cautiously in building the Cabinet and have been offering posts to
politicians across the spectrum, including Communists.
	   Primakov has yet to detail his economic program, saying only
that he will continue reforms while trying to protect Russian
citizens from the painful effects of the crisis.
	   The government says its top priority will be paying off debts to
millions of workers and pensioners who haven't been paid in months.
However, the government is broke, and the only way it can quickly
get the funds is by printing money, a move that's likely to
increase inflation.
	   Prices were rising less than 1 percent a month before the crisis
hit. They have gone up 43 percent in the first half of September,
the government said Wednesday.
	   Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko has said he favors
printing money _ a policy that contributed to hyperinflation during
his previous tenure in office from 1989-1994.
	   The new government also includes several moderate reformers,
such as Alexander Shokhin, a deputy prime minister in charge of
financial issues. Shokhin has spoken against printing money and
called for other ways to control the money supply that are less
likely to trigger inflation.
	   But it remains unclear which argument will carry the day when
the government settles on a policy.
	   Amid the uncertainty, Primakov has told government officials not
to speak to the media until the new Cabinet is in place.
	   That has angered Russian journalists who have spoken about
return to the Soviet-era censorship.
	   ``The introduction of such practices would turn the government
into a secret service and only feed rumors instead of trustworthy
information,'' Alexei Venediktov, the head of the popular Echo
Moscow radio station said, according to the business daily
Kommersant.
	   Primakov defended himself Thursday, saying he stands for freedom
of information.
	   However, ``openness doesn't have anything in common with
attempts at biased coverage and misinterpretation of statements
made by government members,'' he was quoted as saying by Russian
news agencies.

Australia media chasing Monica Lewinsky visit rumor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ The tenacious Australian media pack
sprang into action Thursday to chase a rumor that Monica Lewinsky
was vacationing at the Port Douglas resort in far north Queensland.
	   Mike Berwick, the mayor of Douglas Shire, sparked the media
feeding frenzy by telling Radio 4CA he had heard a rumor that the
24-year-old former White House intern was visiting.
	   ``I've heard that it is correct that she is in town and I heard
that last night,'' he said.
	   At least two Australian TV stations claimed to have a video of a
young dark-haired woman bearing a slight resemblance to Lewinsky
boarding a boat for a trip to the Great Barrier Reef. However, the
woman in the Channel 10 TV video was not Lewinsky _ a fact
reporters discovered Thursday afternoon when the boat returned to
port.
	   Confirmation of the rumors proved elusive throughout the day.
	   One rumor had Lewinsky staying at the Sheraton Mirage in Port
Douglas, where U.S. President Bill Clinton and first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton stayed during their 1996 presidential visit. An
alternative version had Monica staying at an apartment in the area
owned by her father.
	   Lewinsky was said to have slipped into town to escape the media
glare over her liaison with Clinton.
	   The manager of Port Douglas Real Estate, Tim Ferrier, said
Lewinsky was seen eating at the exclusive Nautilus Restaurant on
Wednesday night _ a claim restaurant manager Carmel Forrest denied.
	   ``Honestly, neither I nor the staff know anything about her
being here,'' Forrest said. ``I would be very surprised in the
circumstances if she did because this is where Bill Clinton dined
when he was here. She would hardly be likely to return here given
what the president is going through.''

Report: Basque separatist group announces cease-fire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with early reaction &QL; 
 &UR; By KERNAN TURNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ After a bloody 30-year fight for an
independent homeland in northern Spain, the armed Basque separatist
group ETA has announced a cease-fire.
	   ETA's four-page statement announcing the indefinite truce was
made public late Wednesday by the radical Basque daily Euskadi
Informacion.
	   The group set no conditions on the cease-fire, which it said is
to begin Friday, but warned it would end the truce in the event of
a ``confrontation'' with the government.
	   The report comes days after Basque nationalists urged the
militant group to renounce bloodshed to help foster a political
solution to the conflict. ETA has killed nearly 800 people since
1968.
	   Pressure on ETA to declare a unilateral cease-fire has escalated
since Saturday, when Basque nationalists and other political groups
_ including the ETA-allied Herri Batasuna party _ called for peace
talks and a permanent end to the violence.
	   The statement, dubbed the Lizarra Declaration, was signed by 23
political parties, labor unions and grassroots groups. The forum
was boycotted by Spain's two most powerful political parties, the
ruling Popular Party and the opposition Socialists.
	   There was no immediate reaction from the government. Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar was on an official visit to Peru.
Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja was meeting with Socialist
party leaders, and was expected to hold a press conference later
Thursday.
	   Mayor, in control of national security forces, had said before
the ETA announcement that the Basque militant group might declare a
cease-fire to draw more votes for its allied Herri Batasuna party
in the Oct. 25 Basque region elections. He warned it would be a
``trick truce.''
	   Spain's major opposition party, the Socialists, urged caution.
	   ``One has to analyze this communique with prudence and
caution,'' party spokesman Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba told the
state-run news agency EFE late Wednesday. ``In that it (the ETA
statement) talks of an indefinite and unilateral truce, the
democratic parties are facing an opportunity, but also a risk.''
	   The Socialists and Aznar's more conservative Popular Party have
long maintained they would not negotiate with ETA unless it
renounced violence and put down its arms.
	   There was a more euphoric reaction in the Basque country itself,
where the regional government spokeswoman Mari Carmen Garmendia
urged the Socialists and Popular Party to join others in peace
negotiations.
	   ``Peace demands the participation and collaboration of everyone
without exception,'' Garmendia told the Spanish news agency Europa
Press late Wednesday.
	   ETA has called cease-fires before but they were of limited
duration; in 1996, for example, it observed a one-week truce. This
is the first time it has announced an open-ended cease-fire.
	   ETA, the Basque language initials for Basque Homeland and
Freedom, and Basque political parties seek an independent nation
carved out of pieces of northern Spain and southern France.
	   Most Basque politicians, while supporting ETA's goal, have urged
the rebels to stop the killing.
	   The longest cease-fire ETA has observed came in 1989 during what
were supposed to be secret peace talks with the Spanish government,
held in Algiers. The talks went nowhere and ETA resumed its violent
campaign for independence.
	   The last ETA attack came on June 25 when it killed a town
councilor of the Popular Party in the Basque town of Renteria. He
was the sixth person killed by ETA this year.

Israeli hardliners attempt settlement on disputed Jerusalem site
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quote from demonstrator, EDITS to tighten &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Dozens of Israeli hardliners planted tents and
a mobile home on the site of the planned Jewish neighborhood of Har
Homa in disputed east Jerusalem Thursday in hopes of forcing the
government to begin construction.
	   Palestinians claim east Jerusalem as a future capital and
fiercely oppose construction at the site they call Jabal Abu
Ghneim.
	   The demonstrators were evicted by police after about five hours
without resistance. Several were detained for questioning.
	   The 35 members of Betar, the youth branch of Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party, raised an Israeli flag and hung
large signs reading, ``Next year on Har Homa.''
	   They pitched their tents on a hillside between Jerusalem and the
West Bank city of Bethlehem in the middle of the night. Danny
Danon, a Betar leader, told the Associated Press, ``We are sure
that the majority of the Jews in Israel want Har Homa to be built.
We came here to remind people that Har Homa is not being built.''
	   The Betar protest appeared to be symbolic and the group members
had no serious plans to stay on the hillside for a longer period.
	   There was no stockpile of food. A few backpacks lay on the
ground next to the mobile home. The youths lay on iron beds in the
army-style tents, their sides rolled up for air on a hot desert
morning.
	   The Palestinians say Har Homa is part of an Israeli plan to cut
off the Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem from their
hinterland in the West Bank.
	   Israel maintains that all of Jerusalem, including the eastern
sector it captured from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war, must be
under exclusive Israeli sovereignty.
	   Ground-breaking at Har Homa began in March 1996, sparking
violent Palestinian demonstrations and international criticism,
including from the United States.
	   Since then, the ground has been leveled and access roads paved,
but the government has refrained from starting construction of the
houses, apparently for fear of fresh disturbances and criticism.
	   Netanyahu has been attacked by hardliners in his coalition for
delaying the start of construction. Netanyahu and Jerusalem's
mayor, Ehud Olmert, said they favor building on Har Homa, but
opposed Thursday's demonstration.
	   Netanyahu's spokesman, Aviv Bushinsky, said construction would
begin soon and that the first homes would be completed by 2000.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Chinese democracy campaigner who lobbied for
political change has been detained, but police won't tell his
family why or where he is being held, human rights groups reported
Thursday.
	   Fang Jue's family does not even know how long the middle-aged
government bureaucrat-turned-dissident has been in custody. His
sister saw him July 25, the last family member to do so, said New
York-based Human Rights in China.
	   His sister, Liu Jing, later found his home had been ransacked
and essays and notebooks were missing, the group said. Another
proponent of political change, Peng Ming, said he went looking for
Fang and found his office swarming with police.
	   When Liu went to file a missing-person report in mid-August,
Beijing police claimed to not know his whereabouts and refused to
file a report or help search for him, the group said.
	   On Sept. 7, more than six weeks after his disappearance,
Beijing's Public Security Bureau notified Liu to send Fang money,
Human Rights in China said. It gave the following account of her
contacts with police:
	   When she went to the Half-step Bridge detention center in
Beijing as directed, police refused to provide any information
about Fang. When she angrily accused them of violating rules on
family notification, police replied: ``For eight, 10 years, we can
keep him like this. It doesn't matter.''
	   The Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China group cited unidentified sources as
saying prosecutors had already filed undisclosed charges against
Fang.
	   Human Rights in China speculated that the treatment given Fang
and his family suggests he may be held for a long time.
	   It noted that prominent dissidents Wei Jingsheng, Wang Dan and
Liu Nianchun were all held in secret for periods of a year or so
before their families were notified.
	   Wang and Wei are now in exile. Never put on trial, Liu is in a
Beijing labor camp, 3 1/3 years after his arrest.
	   A former vice director for economic planning in southeastern
Fuzhou city, Fang captured the attention of China's domestic and
exiled democracy movement last winter by outlining his program for
political change.
	   He called for direct elections, freedom of speech and stronger
civilian control of the military. He maintained that many mid-level
and senior Communist Party officials shared his views on the need
for political reform.
	   After spending much of the 1980s in the Beijing and Fuzhou
bureaucracies, Fang quit the government two years ago.
	   He set up a trading company, which he claimed in a July
interview was merely intended to fund his lobbying.
	   In the weeks before his disappearance, he circulated another
open letter calling on the Communist Party leadership to take steps
toward democracy. Fang wanted mayoral elections and approval for
non-state newspapers in China's largest cities.

Major expansion for Jewish settlement in West Bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Israeli government has approved the 10-fold
expansion of a Jewish West Bank settlement where two settlers were
killed by Palestinian militants last month, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's adviser said Thursday.
	   Under the plan, 600 new apartments are to be built in the
Yitzhar settlement near the Palestinian town of Nablus, the largest
in the West Bank, said the adviser, David Bar-Illan.
	   According to Israeli peace activists monitoring settlement
construction, half of the 136 apartments in Yitzhar stand empty and
the settlement is home to only 60 families.
	   The Yediot Ahronot newspaper said the new houses are to be built
on land seized from four nearby Palestinian villages.
	   Bar-Illan said there was a big demand for housing from new
settlers who want to move into Yitzhar.
	   However, Mossi Raz, leader of the Israeli group Peace Now,
denounced the expansion plans. ``This plan involves cruel land
confiscations and is nothing but revenge for the killings,'' he
said.
	   In August, two Yitzhar residents were killed in a drive-by
shooting by Palestinian militants. In response to the killing,
Netanyahu pledged to build new homes in the settlement.
	   ``There is no restriction to building in Yitzhar,'' Netanyahu
told the Yediot daily Thursday. ``I urge the settlers in Yitzhar to
start building because this is another response of mine to
terrorist perpetrators.''

Dubbers deny accord has been reached and continue strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian dubbers on Thursday denied they had reached
an accord to end a two-month-old strike which has caused delays in
the release of Hollywood films and forced TV stations to use
subtitles or voice-overs.
	   In a statement sent to the Italian news agency ANSA early
Thursday, the dubbers said reports that an agreement had been
reached were false. Annalisa Allegretti, a manager at the Rome
dubbing studio Sound Art 23, said no dubbers had showed up to work
Thursday.
	   ANSA reported late Wednesday that the strike had been called
off.
	   Italians are accustomed to seeing all their films and TV shows
dubbed. So when a network began showing the ``The Bold and the
Beautiful,'' known here as just ''Beautiful,'' with voice-overs,
viewers inundated the network with protests.
	   The strike has also put off the release in Italy of films
including ``Saving Private Ryan.''
	   The dubbers' main demand is a collective contract, but they also
want more money and royalties.
	   Elisabetta Bucciarelli, a spokeswoman for dubbing companies,
said they were ''very close'' to an agreement with the dubbers and
expected they would return to work Monday.

Yeltsin, EU officials to meet in Vienna Oct. 27
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin is going
ahead with plans for an Oct. 27 visit to Vienna for a meeting with
top European Union representatives to discuss the Russian financial
crisis, the Austrian government said Thursday.
	   A spokeswoman for the Chancellor's office said details of the
meeting will be discussed Monday, but she expects participants to
include Chancellor Viktor Klima, whose government currently holds
the EU's rotating presidency, and EU Commission President Jacques
Santer.
	   Separately, Finance Minister Rudolf Edlinger hasn't yet decided
when he will visit Moscow in his capacity as head of the EU council
of economics and finance ministers.
	   A ministry spokesman said the visit will probably take place
early next week. Edlinger had originally planned to join Thursday's
visit to Moscow by the foreign ministers of Austria and Germany and
a foreign ministry official from the U.K. but postponed his visit,
saying it is still too early, as Russia's economic plans aren't yet
ready to be discussed.

2,500 minks freed from farm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ONNELEY, England (AP) _ Police issued an alert Thursday after as
many as 2,500 minks were set free from a breeding farm.
	   The animals, bred for their pelts, were freed just before 6 a.m.
(0500 GMT) from the farm in Onneley, Staffordshire, 250 miles (400
kms) northwest of London, police said, and ``dispersed into the
neighboring area.''
	   Animal rights activists were believed to be responsible.
	   In August, supporters of The Animal Liberation Front, an
extremist group linked to past acts of violence, smashed cages and
cut wire at a fur farm near Ringwood, 100 miles (160 kms) southwest
of London, freeing 2,000 mink.
	   Many of those were recaptured but not before killing owls at a
nearby wildlife sanctuary.
	   Similarly, thousands of minks were set free from a farm near
Helsinki, Finland, this month. Many of them were hit by cars or
killed each other, authorities said.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian markets opened mixed Wednesday, with news
about U.S. interest rates and Japanese banking reforms boosting
some stocks and local issues depressing others. By midday, Tokyo
shares had gained 0.32 percent on hopes for an agreement on
urgently needed legislation to clean up Japan's ailing banking
system. In Tokyo, the Nikkei average closed at midday up 47.01
points at 14,274.38. Singapore's key index surged 2.3 percent as
two major banks cut their prime lending rates, and Hong Kong's Hang
Seng Index was 1.4 percent higher. Indonesia's key JSX Composite
index, however, dropped 1.9 percent to a five-year low on continued
foreign selling and speculation that the government will implement
Malaysian-style capital controls. Although the Indonesian
government announced that the rupiah would be allowed to float
freely, foreign investors dumped shares, waiting to see what will
happen to the country's already battered economy, dealers said.
Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar rose against the Japanese currency amid
speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve Board will not cut
interest rates anytime soon. The dollar bought 134.38 yen in early
trading, up 1.80 yen from late Monday in Tokyo. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Five days after his confirmation, Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov was still cautiously assembling a new Cabinet on
Wednesday as the Russian currency displayed new signs of weakness.
Primakov has spoken only in broad terms, saying he is committed to
economic reform to stave off an economic crisis. He has moved
carefully in putting together a new Cabinet, offering posts to a
wide range of political and economic factions, including the
Communist Party. Meanwhile, Russia's currency again appeared
unstable. The ruble reached about 7.5 to the dollar early Tuesday _
only slightly off its rate a month ago, when the crisis hit. But
the ruble then reversed course Tuesday afternoon and was down to
about 11-12 to the dollar in street trading Wednesday. The currency
swings reflect concern that the new government will print more
money to pay back wages, which could increase inflation that was at
36 percent in the first week of September. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's attorney general plans to
question ex-President Suharto over claims that the former leader's
family used corruption to make a fortune during his 32 years in
power. Attorney General Muhammad Andi Ghalib told reporters
Wednesday he would head a three-member team to meet Suharto soon.
He gave no date or venue for the questioning, which is also to
cover allegations that Suharto stashed millions of dollars overseas
before he quit office five months ago. In a recent and rare
television appearance, Suharto, 77, denied allegations that he had
squirreled millions of dollars overseas during his three decades in
office while his six children built huge business empires under his
unchallenged patronage. The claim has been greeted with disbelief
by many Indonesians, struggling to make ends meet amid soaring
inflation, mass unemployment and growing poverty resulting from the
worst economic crisis in 30 years. (INDONESIA-CORRUPTION)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ President Bill Clinton made his most forceful
comments yet about the global financial crisis, and Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan is signaling a willingness to cut interest
rates to prevent a U.S. recession. Financial markets, always on
edge when Greenspan speaks, will be even more alert this time
around, waiting to see if the Fed chief hints further on when the
central bank might decide to cut interest rates to give the U.S.
economy a boost. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, the Clinton
administration's economic crisis manager, and Greenspan were to
appear Wednesday before the House Banking Committee to provide
their latest views on what more can be done. Some Republicans in
Congress, upset that more than dlrs 100 billion in bailouts
organized by the International Monetary Fund have not been enough
to stabilize the situation, charge that the administration and
global monetary officials have bungled the containment effort.
(US-FINANCIAL CRISIS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The United States is prepared to suffer massive
trade deficits with Asian nations, including Japan, to help the
ailing region cope with its yearlong financial turmoil, U.S.
Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat said Wednesday. ``We're
prepared to bear that responsibility. It is a severe
responsibility. We're prepared to bear it because we think that's
one of the contributions we can make,'' he said while visiting
Tokyo with U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky.
Barshefsky began talks with Japanese trade officials Wednesday to
pressure Tokyo to import more and rein in its ballooning trade gap
with the United States, expected to reach dlrs 70 billion this
year. The purpose of the U.S. officials' visit is to discuss such
trade issues ahead of a meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi set for next Tuesday in
New York. (US-JAPAN-TRADE)

Rolling Stones, Bulgaria and former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell.

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Gennifer Flowers took her first step toward
what she hopes will be a singing career on the Las Vegas Strip, and
the songs were anything but subtle.
	   Flowers, who nearly derailed President Bill Clinton's bid for
the White House in 1992, sang ``Who's Got the Last Laugh Now?'' and
``Why Haven't I Heard From You?'' during her performance Tuesday
night at the Electronic Retailing Association's annual conference
at the MGM Grand Hotel.
	   She said she moved to Las Vegas about a month ago and dreams of
becoming a headliner on the Strip.
	   ``I want to see my name up in those lights, up on those
billboards,'' Flowers said.
	   She declined to answer specific questions about Clinton's affair
with former White House volunteer Monica Lewinsky because she said
she has no interest in generating any more publicity on the issue.
	   During the 1992 presidential campaign, Clinton denied having had
an affair with Flowers. However, in his deposition in the Paula
Jones case, he acknowledged having sexual relations with Flowers
once in 1977.
	   ___
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Barbara Sinatra, widow of singer Frank
Sinatra, is being honored by the National Italian American
Foundation for her work on behalf of abused and neglected children.
	   Liza Minnelli will present the foundation's Hope for Children
Award during a gala Oct. 17 at the Washington, D.C., Hilton.
	   The Sinatras opened the Barbara Sinatra Children's Center at
Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage in 1986 to treat and
counsel abused children.
	   ``Nothing got up Frank's ire faster than hearing about young
people in difficult circumstances,'' Mrs. Sinatra said in a
statement released Wednesday.
	   ___
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ It took a generation for Rolling Stones
fans in Greece to get some satisfaction: an encore performance from
the British rockers 30 years after they were hustled off the stage
by military rulers.
	   More than 60,000 fans, including some top members of the
government, welcomed back the Stones on Wednesday on the final leg
of their ``Bridges to Babylon'' tour.
	   It was quite a different reception during the Stones' last
performance in Greece in 1967, just months after a coup that began
a seven-year military dictatorship in Greece. The Stones' lead
singer, Mick Jagger, was dragged off the stage by police when he
tried to toss red carnations to the audience.
	   The ultra-right military junta interpreted the color of the
flowers as a pro-Communist gesture.
	   ___
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Parliament agreed on a draft resolution
banning tobacco from radio and television on Wednesday, including
cigarette commercials and indirect advertising such as sponsorships
of sports events.
	   The ban is part of rules restricting the advertising of alcohol
and other addictive substances on broadcast media.
	   It is part of a law on radio and television expected to be
completed and passed by parliament later this year. Passage is a
virtual certainty, considering government parties hold the majority
of seats in the legislature.
	   The law prohibits alcohol advertising that addresses
adolescents, or that claims that the product can solve personal
problems.
	   ___
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell parted with her
pop diva wardrobe and other memorabilia at a Sotheby's auction
Wednesday, raising almost 145,000 pounds (dlrs 242,150) for a
children's cancer charity.
	   The famous Union Jack dress worn by Halliwell, aka Ginger Spice,
for a performance at last year's Brit Awards was the highlight,
fetching 41,320 pounds (dlrs 69,000).
	   Halliwell, 26, who quit the group in June, stood by the
auctioneer to see the dress sold to Peter Morton of the Hard Rock
Hotel in Las Vegas.
	   Other items sold included an 1967 MGB roadster, bought by
Halliwell with her first royalty check, which fetched 8,050 pounds
(dlrs 13,440). An Elvis-style rhinestone-studded outfit worn at the
1997 Billboard awards brought 4,140 pounds (dlrs 6,910), and a pair
of stars-and-stripes platform ankle boots were bought for 2,990
pounds (dlrs 4,990).
	   Proceeds from the sale of the 88-item lot will benefit Sergeant
Cancer Care for Children.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Japan's NEC Corp. said Thursday it has received
an order through trading house Marubeni Corp. to install a
microwave system worth 2.5 billion yen (dlrs 18.64 million) in
northern China's Hebei province.
	   The project is to install a 1,400 kilometer (875 mile)
synchronous digital hierarchy, or SDH, microwave transmission
system linking the main towns and cities of Hebei, NEC said in a
statement.
	   It would be the first such large-scale trunk system to be used
in China, the electronics giant said.
	   Under China's ninth five-year plan, started in 1996, the
government plans to upgrade provincial telecommunication networks
to SDH microwave lines.
	   NEC has received orders to install a total of 5,000 kilometers
(3,125 miles) of SDH microwave networks in China, the company said.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia's Pioneer International Ltd.,
a building materials company, said Thursday it has agreed to a
joint venture with Malaysia's Sungei Way Holdings Bhd. to operate
Sungei Way's 17 quarries and 19 asphalt plants in Malaysia.
	   Pioneer said its equity investment will cost around 80 million
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 48 million), giving it a 50 percent
interest in Malaysia's largest aggregates and asphalt operator.
	   The new joint venture will be called Sunway-Pioneer Quarry Sdn.
Bhd.
	   Sungei Way Holdings is part of the Sungei Way Group. Pioneer is
Malaysia's second largest pre-mixed concrete supplier.
	   ___
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Fujitsu Ltd., NEC Corp. and Toshiba Corp. said
Thursday they have reached an agreement on the specifications for a
stacked multi-chip package.
	   The multi-chip package stacks ``NOR'' type flash memory and
static random access memory on a single package and achieves space
reduction compared to standard packages, the companies said.
	   ``While each company will manufacture and market the chips
independently, common specifications will promote stacked MCP's
market penetration and allow the three to act as secondary sources
for one another, ensuring stable supply,'' they said in a
statement.
	   Seiko Epson Corp., Hyundai Electronics Industries Co. and
Samsung Electronics Co. have also endorsed the specification and
will support the efforts of Fujitsu, NEC and Toshiba in promoting
the multi-chip package as the standard package for flash memory and
static random access memory, the three companies said.

	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Incomes of China's rural residents are
forecast to grow by an average 4 percent this year, despite
stagnant growth in the first half, the official newspaper China
Securities News said Thursday.
	   For the past three years, incomes in the countryside have grown
an average of 5.4 percent, stimulating economic growth by creating
new demand, the paper said.
	   Last year, more than a quarter of China's 8.8 percent gross
domestic product growth was driven by rural demand. This year,
increased rural demand is expected to help compensate for sagging
export growth and falling foreign direct investment.
	   China's rural residents have about 1.62 trillion yuan (dlrs
196.13 billion) in cash and savings, a powerful source of consumer
demand, the paper said.
	   Rural Chinese had an average per capita income of 1,926 yuan
(dlrs 232) in 1996, compared with urban average incomes of 4,839
yuan (dlrs 583).
	   The gap between the cities and the countryside is growing due to
the difficulty of improving farm productivity, the unlikelihood of
increases in farm product prices already high by world standards,
and the lack of a social security system for farmers.
	   ___
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's Anam Semiconductor Inc.
said Thursday it's in talks with a number of foreign financial
institutions seeking their investments.
	   ``For the past few months, we've been talking with several
foreign financial institutions including Salomon Smith Barney and
Merill Lynch,'' said a senior spokesman at Anam Semiconductor.
``Many visited our company and proposed to invest around dlrs 1.7
billion in Anam.''
	   However, he said that nothing has been finalized yet including
the type of investment.
	   ``We expect the deal to finalize when our president returns from
the U.S. in a couple of weeks,'' the official said.
	   Funds raised from the deal will be mainly used in paying back
the company's debts, the official said.
	   Many local companies are trying to draw foreign investment this
year as part of their restructuring efforts.

Political crisis builds in Albania; Berisha's arrest considered
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS with overnight attack on police station,
parliament commission meeting delayed &QL;

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania's political crisis moved toward a
possible showdown Thursday, with former President Sali Berisha
staging another protest against the government and Parliament
deliberating on whether to clear the way for Berisha's arrest.
	   Western powers fear a violent confrontation between Berisha and
Prime Minister Fatas Nano could worsen if Berisha is arrested on
charges of seeking to overthrow the government.
	   As lawmakers prepared to meet to consider whether to lift
Berisha's immunity from arrest, the opposition leader's party was
going ahead with another protest in downtown Tirana on Thursday.
	   Meanwhile, new unrest was reported in northern Albania, where
Berisha has strong support.
	   Police said a gang of about 80 people armed with grenades and
automatic rifles attacked a bank and police station late Wednesday
night in Lezha, 55 kilometers (35 miles) north of Tirana, the
capital. Three of the attackers were killed in gunbattles with
police and several were wounded, according to Artan Bizhga, the
Interior Ministry spokesman.
	   The identities of the attackers was unknown, but Bizhga said
some were believed to have come from other towns in the area. An
explosion in Lezha two weeks ago damaged the office of Nano's
Socialist Party.
	   A parliament committee scheduled to decide Thursday morning
whether to lift the parliamentary immunity of Berisha and five
other Democratic Party members delayed its session until midday. It
said the prosecutor recommending the charges was unable to attend
the morning session.
	   If the committee lifts his immunity, parliament could order
Berisha's detention on charges of seeking to overthrow the
government.
	   European Union special envoy Herbert Grubmayr arrived in Tirana
on Wednesday to try to defuse the standoff.
	   The EU appears to be worried that Berisha's arrest would
radicalize his supporters and worsen the crisis and increase Balkan
instability.
	   In rioting Sunday and Monday, Berisha's supporters damaged the
parliament and prime minister's office, briefly took over the state
television station, burned cars and looted some shops.
	   On Tuesday, Nano said Berisha must ``take responsibility for
what happened in Albania in the last days.''
	   Berisha told several hundred people at his Democratic Party
headquarters on Wednesday that he would continue to defy Nano's
``dictatorship,'' even if from prison.
	   Despite Berisha's rhetoric, he faces an elected government
backed by Western powers desperate to prevent the Albanian unrest
from influencing other crisis points in the region, such as
neighboring Kosovo province in Yugoslavia.
	   Since the rioting ended, Nano's government has strengthened its
grip on power. Parliament gave the Interior Ministry temporary
control of military police and some special commando units,
allowing the government to use them without having to call out the
army. The government also increased the pay of police by 50 to 100
percent and awarded them special bonuses to ensure loyalty.
	   ``The government has decided to solve the political crisis with
an iron hand,'' a red-faced Berisha shouted to chanting supporters
outside his party headquarters on Wednesday. ``We will respond with
a collective sacrifice.''
	   But the small crowd _ about 1,500 people when it gathered in the
main square _ showed Berisha's support in Tirana was limited.
	   Under Western pressure, Berisha initially complied with Nano's
demand Tuesday that his supporters hand over their heavy weapons.
Two army tanks seized by protesters Monday were given back Tuesday.
	   But another demand by Nano for Berisha's men to hand over all
automatic rifles was ignored. Guards carrying the rifles were seen
inside Democratic Party headquarters Wednesday.
	   The second major crisis in Albania in 18 months began after the
slaying Saturday of popular politician Azem Hajdari, a close aide
to Berisha, who immediately blamed Nano.
	   Demonstrations degenerated into rioting that lasted two days and
left three people dead and dozens injured.
	   Berisha has been seeking to return to power, tapping not only
outrage over Hajdari's killing but also widespread disappointment
with the government's inability to revive the economy and restore
confidence in the nation's future.
	   Berisha has demanded that Nano resign in favor of a ``technical
government'' to arrange new elections. The crisis has raised fears
of nationwide unrest reminiscent of the months of anarchy that
struck Albania last year following the collapse of shady pyramid
schemes that cost many people their life's savings.
	   Berisha was president during the pyramid investment crisis.
Elections in its aftermath led to his ouster from power and the
rise of Nano's former Communists in the Socialist Party.

Hospital doctors extend strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Hospital doctors in the Athens area
announced Thursday a five-day extension of a strike that has halted
all but critical care at public hospitals.
	   The doctors' national union is scheduled to meet Monday to
determine whether hospitals from the rest of the country will join
the strike that began last week, said a statement from the Athens
and Piraeus Hospital Doctors' Union.
	   Doctors are protesting a plan to abolish a system that rotates
emergency room duty among hospitals. The government wants each
major hospital to have a permanent and fully functioning emergency
room by the end of the year.
	   Doctors don't disagree with the proposal, but argue hospital
resources are stretched thin and extra staff and funds are needed
for the new system.

Tokyo market's main index falls to new 12-year low, dollar lower

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Fears about the Japanese and Russian economies sent
Tokyo's main stock index tumbling to a new 12-year closing low
Thursday. The U.S. dollar fell against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 338.56 points,
or 2.38 percent, closing at 13,859.14.
	   It was the Nikkei's lowest finish since March 5, when it closed
at 13,807.46, and the second consecutive day of falls after a
29.67-point decline or 0.21 percent on Wednesday.
	   In late afternoon trading, the dollar bought 134.30 yen, down
0.62 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New
York rate of 134.90 yen overnight. The dollar ranged from 133.60
yen to 134.74 yen in Thursday's trading.
	   Although there were no fresh bearish news about the economy,
traders said the strong rally in the Japanese government bond
market underlined the gloomy economic outlook.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to a record low of 0.665 percent from 0.755 on Wednesday,
driving its price up to 115.60 yen from 114.92 yen.
	   Shares of major Japanese trading houses and other companies
doing business with Russia were among the day's losers, traders
said.
	   Shares of TDK Corp., a major maker of electronic parts, sank 580
yen (dlrs 4), or 5.8 percent, to 9,320 yen (dlrs 69) per share from
Wednesday's close.
	   On Wednesday, TDK said it may face delays in the redemption of
16.31 billion yen (dlrs 121 million) that it had invested in
Russian euroyen bonds, because of the recent economic turmoil
there.
	   It was not clear how long the repayment delay might be, or how
much of the investment may be lost, the company said.
	   Other losers included real estates issues, banks and securities
issues.
	   Stocks started higher following an overnight rise on Wall Street
and on hopes that political parties will soon agree to a plan to
reform Japan's ailing banking system.
	   But share prices quickly dropped after a round of buying.
	   ``While the bank reform bills may bring some transparency to the
financial industry, it will not repair the basic state of the
economy,'' said Kenji Karikomi, general manager of the equity
department at Daiwa Securities Co.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's ruling party and opposition forces
are nearing an agreement on key bank reform legislation, including
a plan to rescue the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan.
	   LTCB shares, which tumbled 13 yen or 34 percent Wednesday, fell
3 yen to 22 yen Thursday.
	   About 411 million shares changed hands on the first section, up
from Wednesday's 385 million shares. Declines outnumbered advances
912 to 239, with 130 issues unchanged.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 18.44 points, or 1.69 percent, to 1,069.06.
On Monday, the TOPIX closed up 3.34 points, or 0.31 percent.
	   Meanwhile, the dollar was under selling pressure amid optimism
over the progress on the banking bills in Japan.
	   Traders said investors are also closely watching whether the
U.S. Federal Reserve Board will give any indication on interest
rates at its Sept. 29 meeting.

Ukraine tries to avert financial crisis with new formula for bonds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Seeking to stave off a financial crisis,
the government has offered foreign investors new conditions for
converting domestic bonds into longer-term paper, bankers said
Thursday.
	   Ukraine's financial system has been badly shaken by the turmoil
in neighboring Russia. Ukraine's budget revenues are insufficient
to cover all its debt obligations, and the new plan is intended to
postpone at least some of its debt payments.
	   Under the plan, foreigners can redeem 20 percent of their
Ukrainian bonds immediately and change the rest into Eurobonds with
a 20 percent annual interest rate. The new bonds are to be redeemed
in September and December 2000.
	   Foreign investors are estimated to be holding a total of 1.8
billion hryvna (dlrs 630 million at the current exchange rate) in
Ukrainian bonds, originally slated to mature by August 1999.
	   The government and the central bank were forced to come up with
a new offer after foreign investors largely dismissed the earlier
conversion plan, under which they were to receive longer-term bonds
denominated in Ukraine's hryvna currency.
	   Analysts said the new plan is likely to be more attractive to
foreigners.
	   The government on Tuesday invited more than 10 foreign banks,
who hold the largest portion of the Ukrainian bonds, for individual
consultations on the plan.
	   Finance Ministry officials said Thursday that consultations were
continuing. They declined to say how many investors have accepted
the plan.
	   Last week, the government ordered mandatory conversion of bonds
held by domestic banks, but was forced to abandon this plan after
it enraged bankers.
	   The hryvna, which has been falling steadily since the start of
the crisis in Russia, has quickened its plunge this week, falling
to 2.86 to the dollar on Wednesday from 2.14 in mid-August.
	   In another sign of growing instability in Ukraine's financial
market, the U.S. bond rating agency Moody's downgraded the
country's credit rating and expressed fear that Ukraine may not be
able to meet its foreign debt obligations next year.

8,000 minks freed from farm
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with 8,000 released; 5th graf, warning &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ONNELEY, England (AP) _ Police issued an alert Thursday after as
many as 8,000 minks were set free from a breeding farm.
	   The animals, bred for their pelts, were freed just before 6 a.m.
(0500 GMT) from the farm in Onneley, Staffordshire, 250 miles (400
kms) northwest of London, police said, and ``dispersed into the
neighboring area.''
	   Police believe the animals _ known as fearsome predators _ were
released deliberately, but no organization has claimed
responsibility.
	   Initially, police reported some 2,500 minks were set free.
	   Police warned local residents to keep doors and windows closed
because the minks will attack pets, and said motorists should avoid
the area.
	   In August, supporters of The Animal Liberation Front, an
extremist group linked to past acts of violence, smashed cages and
cut wire at a fur farm near Ringwood, 100 miles (160 kms) southwest
of London, freeing 2,000 mink.
	   Many of those were recaptured but not before killing owls at a
nearby wildlife sanctuary.
	   Similarly, thousands of minks were set free from a farm near
Helsinki, Finland, this month. Many of them were hit by cars or
killed each other, authorities said.

Kuwaiti girl accidentally left in locked car dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ A 6-year-old girl died in a locked car as
temperatures soared 42 degrees, Al-Watan newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   It said the girl had been accidentally left locked in her
uncle's van after he had driven her and his children to school on
Wednesday.
	   The girl, who was not named, apparently fell asleep on the way
to school and the uncle failed to notice that she had not left the
car when they arrived at the school.
	   He then drove to work and parked his car in the sun. The
temperature was about 42 Celcius (107 Fahrenheit) in the shade.
	   When he went back to pick up the children from school at least
five hours later, they discovered the girl in the back seat of the
van. She died on the way to hospital, apparently from asphyxia and
heat exhaustion, the paper said.
	   It did not identify the uncle.

Wakanohana suffers upset
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Yokozuna (grand champion) Wakanohana suffered his
first upset, driven out by No. 2 maegashira (senior wrestler)
Kotonowaka Thursday, the fifth day of the 15-day Autumn Grand Sumo
Tournament.
	   The result left a seven-way tie for first place, including the
three yokozunas, Wakanohana, Takanohana and Akebono. Also tied for
the lead are Hawaiian-born ozeki (champion) Musashimaru and three
maegashira wrestlers _ Wakanosato, Tochinonada and Ganyu, all at
4-1.
	   Wrestling at Tokyo's Ryogoku Kokugikan Sumo Arena, Kotonowaka
fought off Wakanohana's leg trick and arm throw attempts and sent
him out for his third victory against two defeats.
	   In the day's final bout, Akebono, or Chad Rowan from Hawaii, was
jolted three times by komusubi (junior champion second class)
Musoyama's slaps but resisted the charge and sent him out. Musoyama
falls to 2-3.
	   Takanohana grabbed winless No. 2 maegashira Minatofuji's belt
and drove him out easily.
	   Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani, forced out No 1 maegashira
Kaio. The two grappled with each other for 2 minutes, 30 seconds in
the ring, a stark contrast to most matches that end in 10 seconds.
	   In other major bouts, ozeki Takanonami downed komusubi Dejima
with a leg trick for his third victory against two defeats. Dejima
is 2-3.
	   No. 4 maegashira Wakanosato pushed down No. 3 maegashira
Asahiyutaka (2-3), No. 6 maegashira Tochinonada sent out No. 8
maegashira Mitoizumi (2-3) and No. 11 maegashira Ganyu forced out
No. 14 maegashira Tokitsuumi (3-2).
	   No. 5 maegashira Kyokushuzan, or Mongolian Batbayar Davaa,
crushed out No. 3 maegashira Tamakasuga for his second victory
against three defeats. Tamakasuga is 1-4.
	   In the 26-member juryo division, just below the senior makuuchi
division, No. 13-ranked Hoshitango, or Argentine Imach Marcelo
Salomon, slapped down No. 7-ranked Daihisho, leaving both wrestlers
at 3-2.
	   No. 5-ranked Kyokutenho, or Mongolian Tsevegnyam Nyamjav, was
driven out by No. 1-ranked Kinkaiyama (2-3) for his fourth defeat
against one victory.
	   In makushita, the top junior division, No. 12-ranked Kaishinzan
(2-1), or American Henry Armstrong Miller, sent out No. 11-ranked
Tatsuhikari.
	   No. 45-ranked Kitaazuma (2-1), or Brazilian Tetsuya Takeda from
Sao Paulo, pushed down No. 44-ranked Tamanohana.
	   No. 49-ranked Yamato (2-1), or American George Kalima, was
thrown down by No. 46-ranked Masunobori.
	   In sandanme, the second highest junior division, No. 2-ranked
Ikemori (2-1), or Brazilian Luis Go Ikemori from Sao Paulo, was
slapped down by No. 5-ranked Tochinoyama.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
15-day tournament.

Military imposes curfew in Indonesian town after riots
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The military has imposed a curfew in a
riot-torn fishing town on Sumatra island where mobs burned more
than 400 homes and shops, Indonesia's official news agency said
Thursday.
	   There were no reports of injuries, although a 72-year-old man
died of a heart attack during the disturbance, the Antara report
said. Thirty-one people were arrested, it said.
	   Most of the damaged buildings were owned by members of the
Chinese minority who have often been targeted recently as
scapegoats for Indonesia's worst economic crisis in three decades.
	   In the capital of Jakarta, dozens of police and troops blocked
major roads leading to the national Parliament after days of
anti-government student protests.
	   Antara quoted Lt. Col. Sutan Lubis, a military commander, as
saying that the curfew was ordered Wednesday night after troops
restored order in the town of Bagansiapi-api, about 1,125
kilometers (700 miles) northwest of Jakarta.
	   Soldiers and police patrolled the streets on Thursday.
	   Indonesia has been grappling with soaring inflation and mass
unemployment. Food prices, particularly of rice, have skyrocketed,
prompting outbreaks of looting.
	   Ethnic Chinese make up only 4 percent of Indonesia's 202 million
people, but are resented by many for their success in commerce and
industry.
	   On Wednesday, thousands of people stole tons of shrimp from a
fish farm in Tegal, about 300 kilometers (190 miles) east of
Jakarta, Antara reported. Twelve people were arrested.
	   Hard times have also stirred up protests against President B.J.
Habibie. He became head of state in May after rioting that killed
1,200 people forced former President Suharto to quit, ending 32
years of his autocratic rule.

Despite threats, Anwar takes tour to Malaysia's east coast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Fired deputy prime minister Anwar
Ibrahim took his campaign for political reform and self-vindication
to Malaysia's east coast Thursday, but he was uncertain whether
police would allow him to speak.
	   Police have threatened to press charges against Anwar if he
holds public rallies without a police permit, and it was uncertain
whether his request to speak Thursday night in Kuantan, in the
state of Pahang, had been approved.
	   Although Anwar has not been formally charged with any crime, he
has been accused of leaking state secrets, having illicit sexual
affairs and tampering with police investigations.
	   Anwar says his three-state political road show will include
rallies at private homes, a stadium and mosques, despite official
warnings to keep politics out of mosques.
	   Anwar has said he believes he will not be arrested until the
Commonwealth Games end on Sept. 21, or perhaps after the visit of
Queen Elizabeth II on Sept. 23.
	   He has been making public appearances, criticizing Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad, his former mentor who engineered Anwar's
ouster from the ruling United Malays National Organization.
Mahathir has said Anwar is morally unfit for office.
	   ``The only sin I committed? I happened to be a strong, viable
alternative to Dr. Mahathir,'' Anwar said Wednesday night, shouting
through a microphone.
	   A crowd of 1,500, mostly ethnic Chinese, chanted ``Reform,
Reform.''
	   ``If you want to accuse me of corruption, then you should first
investigate the other ministers, starting with Dr. Mahathir,''
Anwar said. ``You have chosen the wrong guy to pick a fight with.
... Mahathir is scared because his popularity has declined.''
	   Anwar's tour ends in Kota Bharu, stronghold of the
fundamentalist Islamic Party of Malaysia, which has been courting
him since he was deposed Sept. 2.
	   Five of Anwar's aides have been arrested as part of the police
investigation against Anwar. The inspector-general of police, Abdul
Rahim Noor, has said that more of his associates are likely to be
arrested in the next few days.

Strike-ravaged Philippine Airlines announces closure

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with closure announced, PAL, union comments;

 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Strike-ravaged Philippine Airlines
announced Thursday it will halt operations next week, ending the
57-year history of Asia's oldest airline.
	   Airline officials said efforts to rebuild the ailing carrier
were no longer feasible following a decision by its largest union
to reject a proposal to help the company survive.
	   ``We're going to close. It's final,'' PAL vice president Rolando
Estabillo said.
	   He said the closure was approved by the airline's board and will
be effective at midnight next Wednesday.
	   The closure of the Philippines' largest airline will leave the
country with only a handful of very small carriers, most with
severe economic or operating problems of their own.
	   ``It is not easy to preside over the demise of a great Filipino
institution that has been a partner in nation building for over
half a century,'' PAL said in a statement.
	   ``Sadly, our sincere efforts to keep PAL flying and serve the
riding public have not been matched by a similar commitment from
our employees' unions,'' it said.
	   A spokesman for President Joseph Estrada said the government may
intervene in PAL's decision. Among possible measures is a
referendum among union members on the airline proposal, he said.
	   On Wednesday, the board of the PAL Employees Association, which
represents ground staff, reversed an earlier decision and rejected
the proposal by company chairman and majority owner Lucio Tan.
	   The offer would have given workers three board seats and PAL
stock in exchange for a 10-year suspension of their collective
bargaining agreement.
	   The proposal had been described as a last-ditch move to prevent
the closure of the 57-year-old airline.
	   Union vice president Gerardo Rivera said it rejected the
airline's proposal because ``we cannot just wholesale surrender our
right to collective bargaining.''
	   ``We will all suffer because of this, most especially the
workers,'' he said of the decision to close the airline.
	   Under the proposal, Tan offered to give 20 percent ownership of
the company to its employees, with each employee receiving 60,000
shares of stock worth 300,000 pesos (about dlrs 6,900).
	   The company also pledged to refrain from cutting salaries and to
rehire many workers.
	   In June, PAL cut most of its routes, laid off 5,000 of its more
than 13,000 workers. The airline said it would dispose of most of
its 54 planes in response to a crippling 22-day pilots' strike and
the impact of Asia's currency crisis.
	   The airline is mired in debts to local and foreign creditors
totaling dlrs 2.1 billion, but has secured a debt moratorium while
a survival plan is considered by regulators and creditors.
	   PAL officials said creditors refused to agree to the
restructuring plan unless new capital is infused into the airline.
But prospective investors were driven away by recurring labor
disputes, they said.
	   The airline lost 2.2 billion pesos (dlrs 51 million) between
April and June, mainly because of the work stoppages.
	   The PAL official said the airline's liabilities now almost equal
its assets, and the company is losing between 40 million and 60
million pesos (dlrs 930,000 and dlrs 1.4 million) a day.

Nigerian youths stage protest in Shell office
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ About one hundred young men stormed the
regional offices of Shell Oil in the southeastern Nigerian city of
Port Harcourt to demand compensation from the petroleum giant,
police said Thursday.
	   At least 64 people were arrested after authorities moved late
Wednesday to break up the protest, a police spokesman in Port
Harcourt said.
	   Chanting war songs and demanding to meet with Shell executives,
the protesters came from two local communities from the oil-rich
Niger River delta.
	   Shell, the largest foreign oil company working in Nigeria, has
been accused by local ethnic leaders of exploiting their country's
natural wealth and polluting the environment.
	   On Tuesday, more than a thousand ethnic Ogoni people staged a
demonstration rally against Shell. That protest centered around
rumors that Shell was secretly trying to restart its operations on
Ogoni lands in the delta.
	   A spokesman for Shell's Nigerian joint venture said the rumors
were unfounded.
	   ``They are accusing us of trying to return through the back
door,'' Shell communications officer Bisi Ojediran said. ``It has
never been our plan to return to Ogoniland without a broad based
agreement with all those concerned.''
	   Tensions between local communities and Shell have lingered since
mass rioting in 1994 led to a government crackdown on anti-Shell
protests and the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa _ a leading Ogoni
author and environmental activist.
	   Shell was forced to halt work at its facilities in Ogoni
territory following the unrest.
	   Nigeria's late dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, accused Saro-Wiwa of
treason and sentenced the outspoken critic to death by hanging.
	   Wednesday's protests at Shell's Port Harcourt office echoed
Saro-Wiwa's call for compensation and more local control over
earnings from Nigeria's lucrative oil industry.
	   The government, meanwhile, plans to apply tough new environment
regulations on foreign oil companies operating in Nigeria. A series
of minor oil spills in recent months has raised concerns over
safeguards.
	   The Department of Petroleum Resources plans to impose new
penalties for oil spills and is increasing safety inspections,
Thisday newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Many minor oil spills in past years have been caused by sabotage
on transit pipelines from drilling rigs to relay stations, Shell
authorities maintain.
	   Hoping to win compensation from western oil firms, villagers in
the past have created small leaks along the pipelines using
hacksaws and drills.

Philippine stocks rise sharply on record PLDT gain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with peso closing lower &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks posted their
biggest gain in three months Thursday on the back of a record surge
in Philippine Long Distance Telephone shares.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index jumped 92.70
points, or 7.9 percent, to 1,269.24 after Wednesday's 36.14-point
gain.
	   Thursday's rally, which brings the index's total gains since
Monday to 187.06 points, was the most significant advance of the
market in three months.
	   PLDT shares rose 205 pesos (dlrs 4.68), or 25 percent, to 1,015
pesos (dlrs 23.17), their biggest single-session gain.
	   Traders said PLDT shares dominated market action, accounting for
1.6 billion pesos (dlrs 38 million), or 73 percent of the total
value of trades.
	   ``Don't ask me for an explanation for PLDT shares' movement.
Nobody knows. It's just pure speculation right now in the market,''
said Ian Kane, trader for Anscor-Hagedorn Securities Inc.
	   Kane said market players were convinced something is going on in
PLDT and that the company should come up with an explanation soon.
	   The market has been awash with rumors after PLDT implemented
early this month a plan to ward off possible hostile takeovers.
	   One rumor involves an alleged plan by Spain's Telefonica S.A. to
acquire a stake in PLDT with the help of political allies of
President Joseph Estrada.
	   Another is a rumored alliance between PLDT Chairman Antonio
Cojuangco and his uncle, Eduardo Cojuangco, to thwart outsiders
from taking a substantial stake in PLDT.
	   Eduardo Cojuangco is chairman of San Miguel and another Estrada
ally.
	   Traders said another rumor circulating in the market Thursday
was that the government may finally sell its 9 percent stake in
PLDT to raise revenues to bridge a budget deficit seen reaching
dlrs 40 billion pesos (dlrs 930 million) by the year's end.
	   PLDT's gain spilled over to other blue-chip stocks. Overall,
gainers trounced decliners 65 to 22, while 31 issues were
unchanged.
	   While Thursday's market surge was a welcome surprise, traders
weren't convinced it would be sustained.
	   They said the regional economic weakness and Asian currency
crisis will continue to preoccupy investors.
	   In currency trading, the peso weakened against the dollar,
pressured by corporate demand for the U.S. currency.
	   Dealers said even relatively light demand for dollars was having
a significant impact on rates, especially with the extremely thin
foreign-exchange inflows.
	   The dollar averaged 43.780 pesos for the day, up from 43.746
pesos on Wednesday.
	   Dealers saw corporate demand for dollars for the payment of
debts. But despite the demand, the relatively stable Japanese yen
helped underpin the peso and some other regional currencies.
	   Comments overnight by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin leaving open the
possibility of a cut in U.S. interest rates were also broadly
supportive to the peso.

Record-breakers' names to be put on games' stadium wall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australian swimmer Ian Thorpe's
name is likely to be up on a ``wall of fame'' in Kuala Lumpur's new
Bukit Jalil Stadium, built for the 1998 Commonwealth Games.
	   Athletes who set world or Commonwealth records at the 10-day
games may have their names engraved on honor plaques for the
stadium wall, the chief organizer of the games, Hashim Mohammad
Ali, said Thursday.
	   When the athletes bring their grandchildren to see it, ``the
grandchildren can say `our granddad broke the record here,''' said
Hashim.
	   He said the plans were not yet definite, but he hoped a small
ceremony involving the athletes who set records could be arranged
before the games close next Monday.
	   The team of Thorpe, Daniel Kowalski, Matt Dunn and Michael Klim
swam the 4x200-meter freestyle relay in 7 minutes, 11.86 seconds,
breaking the world record of 7:11.95 set by the Unified Team that
competed at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.
	   Thorpe, 15, set a Commonwealth record in the individual
200-meter race but missed the world mark by .01 second.
	   Many of the names on the wall of honor are likely to be of
Australians, who have won the most medals in swimming.
	   But Hashim was irritated by persistent questions by Australian
reporters about suspected cases of the potentially fatal dengue
fever at the games.
	   ``There is talk that the disease came from Australia,'' he
replied.
	   A New Zealand team doctor, Nick Chamberlain, was hospitalized
with dengue fever on Tuesday. Two Australians _ a team official and
the wife of another official _ also have been hospitalized with
symptoms like those of the disease.
	   Hashim said the woman had not been a resident of the athletes
village and might have contracted her illness before she arrived in
Kuala Lumpur.
	   Hashim said he had heard that there had been an alarming rise in
dengue cases in northern Australia.
	   Dengue fever is carried by mosquitoes, and is not contagious.

 &UR; Russian journalists accuse new government of censorship &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on
Thursday parried accusations of censorship that followed his order
to government officials to avoid speaking to the media until his
new Cabinet is in place.
	   ``I have been and remain a staunch proponent of the freedom of
speech and media independence,'' Primakov said, according to
Russian news agencies.
	   However, ``openness doesn't have anything in common with
attempts at biased coverage and misinterpretation of statements
made by government members,'' he added.
	   President Boris Yeltsin said on Thursday it would take an extra
week to complete formation of the new Cabinet. Meanwhile, the
Russian media have been abuzz with speculation about possible
appointments and policies, adding to the confusion about the new
government's intentions.
	   Moving to squelch a wave of rumors, Primakov on Wednesday banned
officials from speaking to journalists without permission from his
chief of staff, Adm. Yuri Zubakov, a veteran of Soviet foreign
intelligence.
	   Government spokesman Andrei Korotkov said the order was only
valid for the reorganization period and said media could get all
the necessary information from press officers at the government
headquarters and various ministries.
	   Some journalists, however, have assailed the move as an attempt
to return to Soviet-era control of the media. They accused Primakov
of trying to introduce the same secretiveness that surrounded
Russia's spy agency he headed in 1991-1995.
	   ``The introduction of such practices would turn the government
into a secret service and only feed rumors instead of trustworthy
information,'' Alexei Venediktov, the head of the popular Echo
Moscow radio station said, according to the business daily
Kommersant.
	   ``It's a very dangerous signal. We may go to court to appeal
that,'' he said.
	   Some said Primakov's order signalled the government's weakness.
``By saying that, he openly admits that his candidates aren't smart
enough and relish in speculations about their possible
appointments,'' said Vladislav Borodulin, the editor of the
Kommersant Vlast (Power) weekly.
	   Others believe it's too early to panic. ``Unconfirmed
information and rumors generoulsy spread by officials have only
added to public nervousness,'' said Oleg Dobrodeyev, head of the
NTV television network. ``Primakov's intention to set up a single
structure is understandable.''

Crowley out of Australian side to play Fiji
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: adds four starting teams, adds Australian coach quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Prop Dan Crowley pulled out of the
Australian rugby union team for Friday's World Cup qualifying match
against Fiji and has been replaced by Richard Harry.
	   A hamstring injury forced Crowley out of the side. He hopes to
be fit for Australia's other two qualifiers against Tonga and
Western Samoa.
	   Harry last played a test against New Zealand in Melbourne
earlier this year but suffered a dislocated knee cap and lost his
place to Crowley.
	   Tonga plays Western Samoa in the first game of Friday night's
first test doubleheader in Australia at Parramatta Stadium in
western Sydney.
	   Fijian playmaker Waisale Serevi will attempt to orchestrate
Australia's downfall for the second time in a week when he lines up
against the Wallabies.
	   Five-eighth Serevi inspired Fiji to a 28-14 semifinal win over
Australia at the Commonwealth Games Sevens tournament in Kuala
Lumpur on Monday.
	   Australian coach Rod Macqueen, who offered qualified support for
a South Pacific team in the Super 12s tournament, rated Western
Samoa the strongest of the challengers.
	   ``You'd have to say Samoa are rated something like fifth or
sixth in the world at the moment and I look at Fiji and see they've
performed extremely well this year,'' said Macqueen.
	   The teams for Friday night's matches:
	   TONGA: Pierre Hola, Semi Taupeaafe, Sarn 'Alatini, Salesi Finau,
Taunaholo Taufahema, Brian Wooley, Sione Tu'ipulotu, Sione Latu,
Holani Pohiva, Sonatane Koloi, Ben Hur Kivalu, Falamani Mafi, Sione
Fa, Fe'ao Vunipola (captain), Ngalu Ta'u. Reserves: Sililo Marten,
Sione Ngauamo, Pita Tanginoa/Semisi Faka'osifolau, Fololsi Masila,
Uiniati Moa, Mat Te Pou, Hingan Fakatou/David Edwards.
	   WESTERN SAMOA: Mike Umaga, Afato So'oalo, George Leaupepe, Terry
Fanolua, Brian Lima, Stephen Bachop, Steven So'oilao, Pat Lam
(captain), Kalolo Toleafoa, Sene Ta'ala, Lama Tone, Opeta Palepoi,
Fosi Pala'amo, Trevor Leota, Kepi Faiva'ai.
	   --
	   AUSTRALIA: Joe Roff, Jason Little, Daniel Herbert, Tim Horan,
Damian Smith, Stephen Larkham, George Gregan, Willie Ofahengaue,

Whitaker, Nathan Grey, Mitch Hardy, Toutai Kefu, Owen Finegan,
Glenn Panoho, Jeremy Paul.
	   FIJI: Opeti Turuva, Manasa Bari, Sale Sorovaki, Lemeki Koroi,

Joblessness continues to fall in the Netherlands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Registered Dutch unemployment
dropped to an unadjusted 4 percent in the three-month period ending
Aug. 31, down from 5.5 percent in the same period a year ago, the
government announced Thursday.
	   The total number of unemployed people sank to 273,000, down
sharply from 379,000 in the same period in 1997, the CBS said.
	   Adjusted for seasonal influences, the total number of unemployed
dipped to 279,000 in the three months ended August, from 384,000
unemployed in the same period a year earlier.
	   The annual influx of new graduates into the job market pushed
the number of registered unemployed up slightly to 273,000 in
June-August, from 270,000 in May-July but adjusted for this
seasonal effect, unemployment fell by 6,000 from the May-July
period.

Left Party's leader criticized for untaxed home-cleaning
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Wrriter &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Just four days before national
elections in which the Left Party appears poised to make big gains,
a newspaper reported Thursday that party leader Gudrun Schyman made
untaxed payments to a girl who cleaned her apartment.
	   The report was potentially embarrassing to Schyman, who strongly
supports Sweden's high-tax welfare state.
	   Schyman acknowledged that she had paid around 2,500 kronor (dlrs
300) to a friend of her daughter's for cleaning work and that she
had not reported the payments to tax authorities.
	   But she denied that the payments constituted what Swedes call
``black work.''
	   ``This is not black work, black work is when someone takes a
lower payment in order to avoid declaring it'' for taxes, Schyman
said on Swedish Radio, hours after the report appeared in the
newspaper Dagens Nyheter.
	   At a later news conference, she said she paid the girl just as a
way of helping her get pocket money for going to the movies or
other recreation.
	   ``A lot of parents will recognize this situation as quite
normal,'' she said.
	   Although the payments to the girl were far less than the
8,700-kronor (dlrs 1,100) limit for untaxed work, the law requires
that any payments over 1,000 kronor (dlrs 125) be reported to tax
authorities.
	   Sven Carlstedt, an official at the Swedish Tax Administration,
was quoted by the news agency TT as saying ``This is nothing that
the tax authorities are considering poking around in.''
	   The Left Party has been performing strongly in opinion polls
ahead of Sunday's national elections, attracting the support of
12-13 percent of poll respondents, about double its current
representation in the parliament.
	   With support for the governing Social Democrats languishing
under 40 percent, the Left is seen as a potential key to forming a
government.

Share prices end sharply lower as investors cash in
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong shares closed sharply lower Thursday
as investors cashed in after gains in the last three consecutive
sessions, traders said.
	   Expectations of a rise in the unemployment rate, announced later
in the day after trading closed, also gave investors an excuse to
sell.
	   The unemployment rate for the three months through August
climbed to 5.0 percent from 4.8 percent in the three months ended
July, the government said.
	   A massive sell-off of market heavyweight HSBC Holdings's shares
also dragged the market down, brokers said.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index plunged 284.11 points, or 3.6
percent, to 7,576.57. It had gained 1.6 percent Wednesday and 0.9
percent Tuesday.
	   Volume was worth 4.88 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 629.7
million), compared to 4.98 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
642.6 million), in the previous session.
	   Profit-taking, particularly for China-related shares, which rose
substantially over the past several weeks amid persistent rumors of
an interest rate cut, accelerated the Hang Seng's fall, said Alex
Wong, research manager of OSK Asia Securities Ltd.
	   Tom Leventhorpe, sales trading director at Indosuez W.I. Carr
Securities Ltd., said investors dumped HSBC shares, taking cue from
several securities firms' reports saying the HSBC was over-priced.
	   One estimate by Vickers Ballas Hong Kong says its earnings per
share will drop 15 percent this year due to deteriorating overseas
business and provisions in Southeast Asia.
	   The firm values HSBC about 20 Hong Kong dollars less than its
Thursday closing price of 141.50 dollars, which was down 6.50
dollars from Wednesday's close.
	   Worsening unemployment means people may not be able to pay their
mortgage installments, which in turn, dragged the property shares,
said Dickson Au, sales manager at Sassoon Securities Ltd.
	   Property giant Henderson Land closed down 1.70 Hong Kong dollars
to 26.25. Conglomerate Cheung Kong Holdings closed down 1.50
dollars to 32.90. Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 1.40 dollars to
close at 24.90.
	   Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong's flagship carrier, bucked the
downward trend to close 77 cents higher at 6.55.

Ukrainian government sets broadcast quota for domestic movies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The domestic film industry may be flat on
its back, but the government announced Thursday that about
one-third of films shown on Ukrainian television and in cinemas
must be domestically produced.
	   A Cabinet order introduced the concept of national screen time,
directing that no less than 30 percent must be devoted to
``national films,'' said the order, reported by the Interfax news
agency.
	   Ukraine, like many other ex-Soviet republics, has been trying to
revive its national culture, protect it from foreign influences and
give a boost to domestic artists.
	   However, it was not immediately clear how the broadcast quota
would be implemented _ unless broadcasters and movie theater owners
are to regard Soviet-era films made in Ukraine as domestic
productions.
	   Ukraine had at least three large film studios during the Soviet
era, but since independence in 1991 it has experienced a marked
economic decline and has produced only a handful of movies.
Ukrainian television and cinemas now are dominated by American and
other foreign films.

Arafat only to meet Netanyahu if Israel agrees to U.S. peace plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES BC-Israel-Settlers and BC-Israel-Settlement &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will only heed
a call by the United States to meet with Benjamin Netanyahu in New
York next week if the Israeli prime minister accepts a U.S. plan
for a West Bank troop withdrawal, Arafat's adviser said Thursday.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton is trying to arrange a three-way
summit with Arafat and Netanyahu in hopes of concluding an elusive
deal on a West Bank pullback. At the time, all three will be in New
York for the U.N. General Assembly. Netanyahu is ready to attend
such a meeting, his aides said Thursday.
	   As Washington tried to salvage its Mideast peace mission,
tensions rose over Israeli construction plans on disputed land.
	   Israel approved the ten-fold expansion of the Jewish West Bank
settlement of Yitzhar where two residents were killed last month in
a drive-by shooting by Palestinian militants, said Netanyahu's
senior adviser, David Bar-Illan.
	   Netanyahu told the Yediot Ahronot daily that he approved the
construction ``as another response to terrorist perpetrators.''
	   The United States has urged Israel to halt settlement expansion.
Israel says it is trying to accommodate natural growth while the
Palestinians say the construction is part of an illegal land grab.
	   ``This expansion policy is the bomb that will explode all the
efforts to put the peace process back on track,'' said Ahmed Abdel
Rahman, the secretary-general of the Palestinian Cabinet.
	   Yitzhar, located near the Palestinian town of Nablus, is
currently home to 60 families and several homes in the settlement
stand empty, according to Peace Now, an Israeli group that opposes
settlement expansion and monitors construction.
	   Yediot said Israel would confiscate land from four Palestinian
villages for the new construction.
	   In disputed east Jerusalem, some 35 members of Betar, the youth
movement of Netanyahu's Likud Party, set up two tents and a mobile
home at the site of the planned Jewish neighborhood of Har Homa.
The demonstrators said they wanted to push Netanyahu to begin
construction of the 6,500 homes planned at the site, known in
Arabic as Jabal Abu Ghneim.
	   After five hours, police dismantled the tents and ordered the
demonstrators to leave. Several were detained for questioning.
	   The Palestinians hope to establish a future capital in east
Jerusalem, the sector captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967
Mideast war. They broke off peace talks with Israel in March 1997,
when Netanyahu broke ground for Har Homa.
	   While preliminary work has been completed, Netanyahu has not
approved the start of construction, apparently fearing this would
trigger renewed Palestinian protests and international criticism.
	   The renewed tension came as Clinton's Mideast envoy, Dennis
Ross, wound down his weeklong shuttle mission aimed at trying to
narrow the gaps on a West Bank troop pullback.
	   The United States has proposed that Israel will withdraw from 13
percent of the land and has formulated a blueprint for a tougher
Palestinian campaign against Islamic militants.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the plan, but Israel has
expressed reservations.
	   Ross met Wednesday evening with Arafat, but did not mention a
possible summit, Palestinian officials said.
	   Arafat would only go under certain conditions, said his adviser,
Nabil Abourdeneh. ``If the situation is as it is now, in which
there is no intention by Netanyahu to agree to the American
initiative, then there will be no summit,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu, meanwhile, said he was in no hurry to negotiate a
permanent peace accord which according to previous agreements is to
be concluded by May 1999.
	   Netanyahu said that unless Arafat made an immediate effort to
fight Islamic militants and stop incitement against Israel in the
Palestinian media, ``there will not be an agreement.''
	   Arafat, in turn, reiterated Wednesday that he was determined to
declare statehood on May 4, 1999, regardless of whether the two
sides have negotiated a final peace accord. Arafat claimed that the
Israeli army has ``already begun training to storm the Palestinian
territories'' should a state be declared.

China making no promises to review cases of jailed '89 activists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Despite urging by the U.N. human rights chief,
China said Thursday it has no plans to release dissidents jailed
from the 1989 democracy movement or loosen conditions on talks with
the Dalai Lama.
	   U.N. Human Rights High Commissioner Mary Robinson, who ended a
visit to China on Tuesday, urged Chinese leaders to re-examine some
dissident cases and open talks with the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan
spiritual leader who lives in exile.
	   Asked at a routine briefing on Thursday whether the government
plans to set free any political prisoners, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao said, ``That will be conducted in accordance
with the law of China.''
	   The government has long asserted that the cases of all
imprisoned democracy activists have been handled properly under the
law.
	   As for the Dalai Lama, China's policy is ``quite clearcut,'' Zhu
said.
	   He repeated the government's demands: the Dalai Lama must
renounce Tibetan independence, stop trying to ``split the
motherland'' and publicly announce that Tibet and the island of
Taiwan are parts of China and that Beijing is the country's sole
legitimate government.
	   Only then will the central government be willing to negotiate,
he said.
	   The Dalai Lama has said he seeks only cultural autonomy, not
independence, but Beijing has not been satisfied.
	   It viewed a trip the Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader took to
Taiwan last year and a pledge to open a representative office there
as encouraging separatism on the island, which Beijing also claims.
	   Robinson's visit to China this month was the first official
mission by a U.N. human rights chief. She appeared largely
conciliatory, hoping to dispel rancor between China and U.N. bodies
over human rights and nurture a dialogue with Beijing.
	   U.S.-based Human Rights Watch said Robinson should only visit
China again if Beijing allows access to U.N. human rights
investigators on torture, religious freedom and other issues, and
if it takes steps to implement key international rights treaties.
	   ``The first visit can be aimed at establishing a relationship,''
Human Rights Watch's Asia director Sidney Jones said in a
statement. ``The second must be aimed at results.''

U.S. trade official praises Thailand for keeping trade open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ U.S. Undersecretary for Commerce David
Aaron praised Thailand on Thursday for keeping its trade open and
not succumbing to protectionism despite a deepening economic
crisis.
	   ``There are temptations to protectionism, but if you take steps
which discourage people from investing in your country, you're
going to lose out,'' Aaron told reporters while visiting Bangkok.
	   ``Thailand's route in the end will be much more advantageous,''
he added, in an oblique reference to recent capital controls
instituted by neighboring Malaysia.
	   Malaysia recently pegged its currency to the dollar and imposed
draconian capital controls that effectively eliminated offshore
trading in the ringgit.
	   Although expected to face an economic contraction of some 8
percent this year, Thailand has repeatedly said it will not follow
Malaysia's example.
	   Thailand is battling its worst economic crisis in recent
history. It is receiving a dlrs 17.2 billion bailout from the
International Monetary Fund.
	   Aaron, who was in Bangkok to lead a U.S. trade mission, said
U.S. exports to Asia were down 30 percent in the first half of this
year and ``we are extremely concerned about it.''
	   He added that Thailand was a key U.S. trading partner and
reaffirmed the country's importance as an export market.
	   ``We believe Thailand has a great economic future and we want to
be part of it,'' he said.
	   Although keen to promote U.S. exports to the region, Aaron also
encouraged free trade between Asian countries as a key to lifting
the present economic gloom.
	   ``It is very important that ASEAN countries keep their borders
open to each other,'' Aaron said. ``Asia can't recover from this
crisis without trading with itself.''
	   The Association of Southeast Asian Nations plans to set up the
ASEAN Free Trade Area by 2003 in Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand,
the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei. The remaining members
Vietnam, Myanmar and Laos are to join by 2008.
	   But Malaysia and Indonesia are considering pulling out of the
tariff reduction program due to unprecedented economic slumps,
according to a senior Thai official quoted in the Nation newspaper
Thursday.

 &UR; Bosnia election supervisors deny withholding pro-extremist results &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS throughout with international officials
denying holding back results because of who's winning, results
expected to be released Sept. 23-24 &QL; 
 &UR; By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ International officials in
charge of Bosnia's elections denied Thursday that they are holding
back vote results because extremists won, saying the count remains
inconclusive.
	   Nicole Szulc, spokeswoman for the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, which supervised last weekend's nationwide
elections, declined comment on who is leading in races deemed
crucial to Bosnia's rebuilding process after 3 1-2 years of war.
	   ``We are not going to make judgments based on 60 percent, or 40
percent of counted ballots. The only results that will matter are
the final results,'' and those are expected in a few days, she
said.
	   A strong showing by the extremists would be an embarrassing
setback to international efforts to build a stable, multi-ethnic
state in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
	   It could also raise doubts about the effectiveness of the
international effort which has sought to rebuild Bosnia after the
1995 Dayton peace accords.
	   The most closely watched contest, involving the re-election bid
of Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic _ a moderate backed by
the West _ has generated conflicting claims about whether she won
or lost.
	   Hundreds of flag-waving Radical Party supporters took to the
streets of Pale and other towns in the Serb half of Bosnia on
Wednesday night to celebrate what they said was Plavsic's defeat by
extreme radical Nikola Poplasen.
	   But sources in the Bosnian Serb town of Banja Luka, speaking on
condition of anonymity, claimed Thursday that final results will
show a Plavsic triumph.
	   A Western diplomat in Sarajevo who declined to be named said
both sides are creating circumstances to declare the elections void
in case of their defeat.
	   Szulc dismissed reports spread by various parties in Bosnia of
their victory. She said the ballot counting is complicated and
there are some 200,000 ballots in envelopes that have not been
opened yet.
	   Robert Barry, head of the OSCE in Bosnia, said results will
probably be announced next Wednesday or Thursday.
	   ``Releasing preliminary figures would only add to the dispute
about who really won,'' said Barry, speaking at a news conference
in Banja Luka.
	   In a statement carried by the Bosnian Serb SRNA news agency on
Wednesday, two extremist parties accused the OSCE of deliberately
delaying the planned release of preliminary results because of the
hardliners' strong showing.
	   ``The results are known but OSCE is silent,'' said the joint
statement by the Bosnian Serb Radical Party and Serb Democratic
Party.
	   In Sarajevo, state radio said Wednesday night it will not
broadcast any purported results given by the competing parties. It
said conflicting claims, added together, would reflect 118 percent
of voters casting ballots.
	   Looming in the background while the vote count proceeds is the
possibility the OSCE may disqualify top vote-winning nationalists
because of violations of election rules prior to the vote.
	   An OSCE meeting is scheduled for Friday to determine whether to
punish the Radicals for broadcasting an interview with their
Serbian leader Vojislav Seselj during the pre-election blackout.
	   The strongest punishment would be the disqualification of Nikola
Poplasen, a Radical who ran for the presidency of the Serb-run
entity against Plavsic.
	   Poplasen's party was sending signals such a decision might
trigger civil unrest.
	   Plavsic's party, according to the Sarajevo daily Oslobodjenje,
indicated it might request the elections to be declared viod
because of serious violations by the Radicals. It claimed the
Seselj broadcast caused many people to vote for the extremists.
	   Poplasen and Momcilo Krajisnik, a candidate for the joint
Bosnian presidency, are supporters of war-crimes suspect Radovan
Karadzic and his policies of ethnic hatred and division. They are
against the Dayton peace accord that envisaged a unified Bosnia.
	   Analysts believe that nationalist sentiment among Bosnian Serbs
has been rekindled because of the clashes in the Serbian province
of Kosovo against largely Muslim ethnic Albanians. Western pressure
on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic over Kosovo also played
against the pro-Western Plavsic, they said.
	   According to sources in Sarajevo, another Western favorite,
Kresimir Zubak, also was faring poorly. Zubak has recently split
from the Bosnian Croat hard-liners and formed a new, more moderate
party.

Arabs support Libya's call for guarantees for Lockerbie suspects
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BASSEM MROUE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Arab countries will suspend U.N.-imposed
sanctions against Libya once an agreement is reached on handing
over two Libyans for trial in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner
over Scotland, according to a draft resolution considered by the
22-member Arab League.
	   The resolution stopped short of accepting a Libyan call to
ignore the six-year U.N. air embargo, but supported Libya's demand
for certain guarantees before the two suspects are handed over for
trial. The draft resolution also urges the United States and
Britain to hold a dialogue with Tripoli.
	   The U.N. Security Council voted last month to suspend the
sanctions once Libya actually hands over the two men for trial in
the Netherlands.
	   Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported on the draft resolution
late Wednesday. It was expected to be part of the final communique
to be issued later Thursday by the Arab League at the conclusion of
a two-day meeting of foreign ministers.
	   ``The Arab League confirms its continued support for Libya's
demand of guarantees for a fair trial for the two suspects,'' the
draft resolution said.
	   The United Nations banned air travel to and from Libya in 1992
to try to force Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to surrender the two
Libyans suspected in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
	   Libya claimed the two men could not get a fair trial in England
or the United States. In an effort to resolve the impasse,
Washington and London last month offered to accept a trial before a
Scottish tribunal in the Netherlands.
	   Under the U.S.-British plan, the suspects could not be
extradited once they arrive in the Netherland. But if convicted,
they would have to serve their sentences in a British prison.
	   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has accepted the principle of a
trial in the Netherlands, but has called for negotiations with the
United States and Britain on the details of the proceedings and the
suspects' treatment once they are in Dutch custody.
	   He also wants to ensure that thee suspects would be able to
appeal the court's decision.
	   Washington and London have rejected the Libyan demands for
guarantees and said their proposal is not negotiable,
	   Washington has threatened to push for more sanctions, including
a ban on oil sales, if Libya does not accept the plan for a trial
in the Netherlands and surrender the suspects.
	   The Arab League draft resolution described the U.S. threat as
showing a ``total disregard for Libya's positive cooperation with
Security Council resolutions.''
	   The final communique was also expected to express the Arab
League's stand on economic sanctions against Iraq and last month's
U.S. missile attack on a pharmaceuticals factory in Sudan. The
United States claimed the factory was involved with chemical
weapons and had links with a Saudi millionaire suspected of
sponsoring the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   The Organization of African Unity decided at its June summit to
no longer abide by the sanctions when travel was required for
humanitarian activities or official business. Several African
leaders have violated the sanctions since then.

Sammy's slam ties the home run race at 63
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more quotes from Sosa, other players &QL; 
 &UR; By BERNIE WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Slammin' Sammy evened the home run race again,
fittingly, with a grand slam.
	   With a mighty swing at a dramatic moment, Sammy Sosa hit his
63rd homer to a place balls rarely go at Qualcomm Stadium, the
second deck in left field. Just like that, after struggling for two
games, Sosa pulled back into a tie with Mark McGwire in the
greatest home run derby ever.
	   ``It was something exciting, I have to say, especially with the
game on the line,'' Sosa said after driving in all his team's runs
in the Chicago Cubs' 6-3 win over the San Diego Padres on Wednesday
night. ``I never thought I would get No. 63 with the bases
loaded.''
	   Or with two outs and the scored tied 2-2. In that situation, he
said, he didn't want to strike out. Instead, he continued to make
history.
	   With cameras flashing from all around the stadium and most of
the crowd of 49,891 on its feet, Sosa drove a 93 mph (149 kph)
fastball from Brian Boehringer an estimated 434 feet (130 meters).
	   The crowd went wild when Sosa's ball settled inside the foul
pole, setting off a mad scramble for the souvenir, and Sosa was
summoned back onto the field for a curtain call. Mark Grace stepped
out of the batter's box and Boehringer stepped off the mound during
the ovation.
	   The cheering continued after the inning ended, and Sosa doffed
his cap to the crowd when he went to right field.
	   ``I'm back. I have a lot of confidence in myself. I wanted to be
patient,'' Sosa said.
	   ``People are excited about the home run race, and rightfully
so,'' winning pitcher Terry Mulholland said. ``There's no telling
if they'll ever see it again.''
	   Sosa and McGwire, tied for the most home runs in a season, each
have nine games left. Sosa said he didn't care who wins the
thrilling race for the single-season homer record.
	   ``I got to the point that everybody wanted me to go, and
whatever happens from now on is a gift. Now I want to go to the
playoffs.''
	   Sosa, who hit a two-run, bases-loaded double in the seventh,
helped the Cubs hold their half-game lead over New York in the
National League wild-card race.
	   ``Right now, I feel great,'' he said. ``The game tonight was
unbelievable.''
	   Boehringer wasn't worried about his place in history.
	   ``Nobody's going to remember it when he hits 69,'' the
right-hander said.
	   ``I tried to go inside, but I left it ...,'' said Boehringer,
who then asked reporters if they saw where the pitch was. ``It went
off the bat too quick,'' Boehringer said.
	   Fabian Perez Mercado, 32, of Tijuana, Mexico, ended up with the
ball. He was at the game with his pregnant wife and two children.
He is expected to present the ball to Sosa before the Thursday
afternoon game, the Padres said.
	   Sosa tied McGwire at 62 Sunday when he connected twice in a
stunning performance at Wrigley Field. That gave him four homers in
three days.
	   McGwire went back ahead when he hit his 63rd when he pinch-hit
for the Cardinals in ninth inning of the first game of a
doubleheader Tuesday night.
	   The historic home run race has fostered goodwill throughout
baseball, except, it seems, in the Padres' clubhouse.
	   The Padres clinched the NL West title Saturday night and are
fighting an uphill battle for home-field advantage in the playoffs.
	   ``It's a joke,'' pitcher Sterling Hitchcock said. ``We're out
there fighting for home-field advantage and they're rooting for the
guy.''
	   Sosa finished 3-for-5 with six RBIs as Chicago won its second in
a row and fourth in five games. He had been 1-for-9 with six
strikeouts in the first two games of the series.
	   Sosa tied a career high with six RBIs in a game, and took over
the major league lead with 154 RBIs this season, the highest total
in the National League since Joe Medwick in 1937.
	   Sosa hit the third grand slam of his career, all of them this
season. None of his first 246 homers in the majors were slams _ of
his last 24 home runs, three have come with the bases loaded.
	   ``We needed that and Sammy came through for us,'' said
Mulholland (5-5). ``It was probably one of his bigger home runs for
us, considering the time of year.''

Ten years after Myanmar coup, exiles say rights abuses increasing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ On the eve of the 10th anniversary of a
military coup in Myanmar, the country's government in exile said
Thursday that atrocities and human rights abuses by the military
are increasing.
	   ``The military has dramatically escalated its repression. We are
now experiencing the biggest crackdown on pro-democracy supporters
since the military seized power ten years ago,'' said Thein Oo,
Justice Minister for the National Coalition Government of the Union
of Burma.
	   The military has renamed the country Myanmar, but democracy
activists still refer to it as Burma.
	   Thein Oo was speaking at a news conference in Bangkok where the
NCGUB released ``Burma Human Rights Yearbook 1997-98,'' a massive
volume detailing military abuses against democracy activists and
atrocities committed against the country's ethnic groups.
	   ``Since May the military has detained more than 1,200
pro-democracy activists,'' Thein Oo said.
	   He included the 783 members of opposition leader Aung San Suu
Kyi's party the National League for Democracy. Among them are 196
members of parliament.
	   The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in parliament in a 1990
election the military refused to honor. The recent arrests were
intended to foil an NLD plan to convene the assembly despite
warnings from the military it would be illegal.
	   The military has ruled Myanmar in one form or another since 1962
when Gen. Ne Win ousted a democratically-elected government in a
coup d'etat.
	   Under his harsh and repressive rule, he isolated the country
from the outside world and forced a severe brand of socialism on
the population that turned the resource-rich land into one of the
poorest in the world.
	   In 1988, persistent student protests forced Ne Win to resign,
but it was clear a rapid series of successors were handpicked by
the general who still controlled the levers of power from behind
the scenes.
	   Ne Win's resignation only fueled the people's desire for
democracy, and the army crushed a nationwide uprising in 1988 by
gunning down more than 3,000 people.
	   On Sept. 18 of that year, the military announced the formation
of the State Law and Order Development Council and a committee of
21 generals formally seized power.
	   It is commonly referred to as a coup, but according to most
historians, the military was already in charge. It simply sacked
its civilian front men.
	   Upon taking over, the army sent its troops into the streets to
gun down any protesters. Hundreds, if not thousands, died.
	   Ne Win was also believed to be behind the SLORC takeover, and
was pictured in state-run newspapers laughing with the generals.
	   The SLORC was dissolved in November 1997 and replaced with the
State Peace and Development Council, but the top four generals
remain the same. Government opponents say there has been no real
change.
	   Upon taking power in 1988, military leaders said their rule
would be short and the army would return to the barracks as soon as
order was restored.
	   Ten years later, they still refuse to negotiate with the
opposition and show no signs of relinquishing power.

Arizona, Nagoya share lead in men's competition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TANAKURA, Japan (AP) _ Men's team from Arizona State University
took a three-stroke lead Thursday in the first round of the 16th
annual Topy Cup, a U.S.-Japan intercollegiate golf championship.
	   In the women's competition, Senshu University was two strokes
ahead of second-place ASU, spearheaded by Grace Park, winner of the
U.S. Women's Amateur Championship last month.
	   The men's squad of ASU had a 4-over-par 292 total as Jeff
Quinney shot a 69, the day's best score, Paul Casey carded a 74,
Brad Cannon also a 74 and Grex Padilla a 75.
	   Quinney, winner of the Oregon Amateur Golf Tournament and also
the Pacific Northwest Golf Association Men's Amateur Championship
in July, scattered five birdies and two bogeys over the 7,050-yard
(6,416-meter), par-72 Tanakura Country Club course.
	   Nihon University and Tohoku Fukushi University tied for second
at 295, followed by Kinki University's 300 and University of
Arizona's 302.
	   Among other American teams, UCLA was in a two-way tie for
seventh at 307 and UNLV placed 11th at 312.
	   In the men's contest, four U.S. and eight Japanese teams are
entered. In the women's, two U.S. and four Japanese teams are
competing.
	   The three-round event has been shortened to 36 holes because of
Typhoon Stella and floods that hit central Japan Wednesday.
	   In the team event, each team has five players with the best four
scores counted. There also are individual contests both for men and
women based on their scores in the two rounds of stroke play.
	   In the women's round, held at the same course but covering a
shorter length of 6,061 yards (5,512 meters), Senshu had a 10-over
298 total, ASU was at 300, and Nihon University and University of
Arizona shared third at 304.
	   Jenna Daniels from UA shared the day's lowest score of 1-under
71. The day's second-best round of 73 was shared by park, UA's
Dannielle Bayer, and Senshu's Misato Nishikawa and Ai Horiuchi.
	   In 15 previous championships, U.S. men's teams have won nine
trophies, while U.S. women's teams won a majority of eight.

Russia, South Korea end diplomatic row
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Russia and South Korea have officially
settled a diplomatic row over alleged spying that resulted in the
expulsion of diplomats on both sides, Seoul's foreign minister said
Thursday.
	   Hong Soon-young also said he will meet with his new Russian
counterpart, Igor Ivanov, next week in the United Nations to
discuss mending the strained ties, possibly through a state visit
to Moscow by President Kim Dae-jung.
	   ``Both countries agreed not to raise any issues any more
regarding the expulsions of diplomats,'' Hong said.
	   He unveiled the agreement after meeting with Russian Ambassador
Yevgeny Afanasyev on Thursday.
	   The Moscow-Seoul spat began July 4 when Russia expelled a South
Korean diplomat in Moscow after he was reportedly caught accepting
classified documents from a Russian contact.
	   Seoul retaliated four days later by expelling a Russian
diplomat, saying he had engaged in ``activities that go against his
status as a diplomat.''
	   Then, on July 20, South Korea was forced to withdraw five more
officials from Russia under an agreement to limit the number of
intelligence agents each country assigns to its diplomatic
missions.
	   Russia later claimed that South Korea agreed to allow the
expelled Russian diplomat to return to Seoul. Seoul immediately
denied there was such a humiliating deal. Nonetheless, public anger
soared and President Kim fired Hong's predecessor, Park Chung-soo,
in August.
	   On Thursday, Hong indicated that the Russian diplomat will not
return to Seoul. He said ``the whole matter will be frozen in its
current state.''
	   Hong travels to New York next week to attend the United Nations
general assembly.

Thai politician will surrender over corruption charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai politician accused of stealing
money intended for poor farmers will turn himself in for police
questioning, a spokesman for his party said Thursday.
	   Adisorn Piangket has been accused of pocketing part of the 363
million baht (dlrs 8.85 million) that was supposed to compensate
farmers left homeless by dam construction.
	   He said his party leader, former Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh, has pledged to share responsibility and turn himself
in to police as well, according to The Nation newspaper.
	   He dared the police to send Chavalit to jail, saying public
outrage over imprisoning the unpopular former premier would bring
down the present government of Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai.
	   Chavalit, who resigned last November after public protests over
his inept handling of Thailand's economic crisis, appeared dazed
and confused when confronted outside Parliament by dozens of
reporters on Thursday about Adisorn's comment.
	   ``What? When?'' Chavalit muttered.
	   A little later, more than a hundred of the displaced farmers
stormed past police guards at the gates of Parliament demanding the
government speed up compensation payments.
	   They were allowed to meet with a deputy minister of agriculture.
	   Chavalit, the leader of the New Aspiration Party, was prime
minister when Adisorn, then deputy science minister, was assigned
to supervise the compensation pay-outs to farmers affected by the
construction of the Rasi Salai dam in Sisaket province, 430
kilometers (267 miles) northeast of Bangkok.
	   Adisorn, along with five members of the Forum of the Poor, a
grassroots organization that lobbied for the compensation, have
been summoned to give their side of the story to the police, said
party spokesman Suraporn Danaitangtrakool.
	   Adisorn said he would not seek bail if charged, warning that
hundreds of thousands of people will converge on the streets to
denounce the government for arresting him.

Hong Kong defends intervention
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The territory's financial secretary on Thursday
defended his government's recent foray into stock markets in
response to criticism from U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan.
	   Donald Tsang told reporters the government had ``absolutely no
other option'' but to step into the markets.
	   ``We had to defend the linked exchange rate of Hong Kong,
otherwise it would have triggered off another round of devaluation
in the whole of Asian region and probably greater disasters outside
the region.''
	   Greenspan, in testimony Wednesday, said Asian economies, in
general, shouldn't turn their backs on open markets and shouldn't
think their actions can be easily reversed.
	   He singled out the Hong Kong government's stock and futures
market intervention in August for criticism.
	   ``I don't think it can succeed,'' Greenspan said. ``The
consequences of doing that erodes some of the extraordinary
credibility that the Hong Kong monetary authorities have achieved
over the years.''
	   Tsang said he wasn't going to overreact to Greenspan's comments,
adding that he planned to write a letter to Greenspan to explain
the government position.
	   ``We do understand that from an idealistic position of a free
market, what we did is probably rather exceptional,'' Tsang said.
	   Last month, the Hong Kong government took on currency and stock
speculators, ultimately intervening and changing market rules to
close the door on what it called market manipulation.
	   The government is believed to have spent 15 percent of its U.S.
dlrs 96 billion foreign reserves on a two-week buying spree to prop
up share prices and defend the Hong Kong currency, which is set at
7.80 to the U.S. dollar.
	   Tsang has called for international cooperation to battle
speculative activities harming smaller economies like Hong Kong.
	   He is scheduled to meet with financial ministers and central
banks on a three-week visit this month Germany, Holland, Britain
and the United States. A government spokesman said he's not sure
whether Tsang will meet Greenspan.

UNCTAD criticizes IMF, urges adoption of U.S. bankruptcy laws
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund needs to reform
the way it helps countries in financial trouble, the U.N. trade and
development agency said Thursday.
	   The East Asian financial crisis has laid bare certain weaknesses
in the international approach to management of crises involving
sudden withdrawal of foreign capital and mass attacks on
currencies, the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development said in a
229-page report.
	   Financial help coordinated by the IMF to troubled economies in
East Asia in recent years has usually come only after the collapse
of the currency of the country concerned, according to the study.
	   The help, in the form of bailouts designed to meet the demands
of creditors and prevent defaulting, protects lenders from bearing
the cost of their decisions, the report said.
	   ``More importantly, the sums required have been increasing and
are reaching the limits of political acceptability in countries
providing them,'' it said.
	   The IMF's action hinders the creation of methods to stabilize
currency markets and avoid the transformation of attacks on a
country's currency into solvency crises, according to the report.
	   A failure to provide enough liquidity to an economy before
counter attacks on its currency cause it to collapse will
eventually lead to widespread defaults and bankruptcies, UNCTAD
warns.
	   The report says such bankruptcies could be avoided by
international adoption of insolvency principles contained in U.S.
bankruptcy law.
	   They address financial restructuring rather than liquidation and
give the debtor country a period of breathing space from its
creditors, thus preventing a so-called ``grab race'' for assets by
creditors.
	   ``Procedures of this kind would meet the need once again evident
in the East Asian crisis to safeguard debtor countries from the
over-reaction of financial markets,'' the study said.
	   On Sunday, IMF Deputy Director Stanley Fischer said record
lending last year to handle financial crises in Asia and Russia has
dropped IMF reserves to historically low levels.
	   Only dlrs 5 billion to dlrs 9 billion remains left for the IMF
to lend from its regular reserve fund, after dlrs 26 billion in
loans in the past year.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin said Thursday it could take another
week to put together a new government even though Russia has been
in economic crisis for a month and the currency continues to fall.
	   Yeltsin, who has made few comments about the economic problems,
met Thursday in the Kremlin with Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev to
discuss conditions in the military. The president said the heads of
the government's security ministries, including Sergeyev, would not
change, but more time was needed to fill other posts.
	   The key job of Finance Minister and other Cabinet positions were
still under discussion, the president said.
	   ``We will need an extra week to fully form the Cabinet,''
Yeltsin told reporters before his meeting with Sergeyev.
	   The president also signed an order on security preparations for
a nationwide protest that trade unions have organized for Oct. 7.
	   The economic turmoil has left many Russians angry and frustrated
with the government, but there has not been unrest. There have been
scattered strikes across the country.
	   A poll released Thursday reported that 92 percent of Russians
said the crisis had affected their lives, with 50 percent saying
the impact had been drastic. The poll by Public Opinion, an
independent group, did not report its margin of error.
	   Meanwhile, the embattled ruble continued its plunge.
	   The Russian currency was trading at around 15 at the Moscow
currency exchange after recovering to 7.5 to the dollar earlier
this week. The Russian currency stood at around 6 to the dollar
before the crisis began in mid-August.
	   The government said Thursday it would delay controversial plans
to restructure some dlrs 40 billion in loans. Deputy Prime Minister
Alexander Shokhin said a decision was being delayed until Sept. 25
to try to work out a more acceptable deal for foreign lenders, who
face huge losses.
	   Yeltsin and new Prime Minister Yevgney Primakov have moved
cautiously in building the Cabinet and have been offering posts to
politicians across the spectrum, including Communists. Primakov
held talks Thursday with nationalist leader Alexander Lebed, who
said he would support the government's policies.
	   Primakov has yet to detail his economic program, saying only
that he will continue economic reforms while trying to protect
Russian citizens from the painful effects of the crisis.
	   The government says its top priority will be paying off debts to
millions of workers and pensioners who haven't been paid in months.
However, the government is broke, and the only way it can quickly
get the funds is by printing money, a move that's likely to
increase inflation.
	   Prices were rising less than 1 percent a month before the crisis
hit. They have gone up 43 percent in the first half of September,
the government said Wednesday.
	   Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko has said he favors
printing money _ a policy that contributed to hyperinflation during
his previous tenure in office from 1989-1994.
	   The new government also includes several moderate reformers,
such as Shokhin, a deputy prime minister in charge of financial
issues. Shokhin has spoken against printing money and called for
other ways to control the money supply that are less likely to
trigger inflation.
	   But it remains unclear which argument will carry the day when
the government settles on a policy.
	   Controversial financier Boris Berezovsky, seen by some observers
as a major political force, warned Thursday against any attempt to
renationalize businesses sold off by the state after the Soviet
collapse. ``Any nationalization leads to civil war,'' he was quoted
as saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   Amid the uncertainty, Primakov has told government officials not
to speak to the media until the new Cabinet is in place.
	   That has angered Russian journalists who have spoken about a
return to Soviet-era censorship.
	   ``The introduction of such practices would turn the government
into a secret service and only feed rumors instead of trustworthy
information,'' said Alexei Venediktov, the head of the popular Echo
Moscow radio station, according to the business daily Kommersant.
	   Primakov defended himself Thursday, saying he stands for freedom
of information.
	   However, ``openness doesn't have anything in common with
attempts at biased coverage and misinterpretation of statements
made by government members,'' he was quoted as saying by Russian
news agencies.

Fundamentalists demand trial of author
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA , Bangladesh (AP) _ Several Muslim religious leaders have
demanded immediate arrest and trial of author Taslima Nasrin, who
they accuse of offending Muslims.
	   In a joint statement published Thursday, the leaders warned the
government of serious consequences if she was not put on trial for
reportedly suggesting the Koran, the Muslim holy book, should be
revised.
	   The controversial author left the country in 1994 after Muslim
fundamentalists offered a 200,000 taka (dlrs 5,000 ) reward to
anyone who killed her. Top police officers said on condition of
anonymity that Nasrin is back home and in hiding. She reportedly
slipped back into the country Sunday with her ailing mother, who
had undergone treatment for colon cancer in New York.

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Former President Sali Berisha called
Thursday for a nationwide protest against the government and
lawmakers opened deliberations on whether to clear the way for his
arrest.
	   Staying defiant even as a political noose appeared to be
tightening around him, Berisha assailed Prime Minister Fatos Nano
as ``the champion of corruption in Europe'' and led another
opposition protest rally in the capital.
	   Some 2,000 or more Democratic Party supporters gathered downtown
to denounce the government. Others were prevented from joining it
by police roadblocks at key intersections, purportedly intended to
check weapons.
	   Western powers fear that the violent confrontation between
Berisha and Nano that has erupted in the past week could worsen if
Berisha is arrested on charges of seeking to overthrow the
government.
	   As a parliamentary committee convened Thursday afternoon to
consider whether to lift Berisha's immunity from arrest, an
unidentified source said there was pressure from international
officials to come up with a lesser charge against Berisha in order
to avoid further instability.
	   Five other Democratic Party members of Parliament also were
faced with having their immunity lifted along with Berisha. If the
committee lifts immunity, Parliament could order them jailed.
	   Prosecutor Arben Rakipi was presenting his case to lawmakers. It
was unclear when a decision would be made or what it would be.
	   Meanwhile, new unrest was reported in northern Albania, where
Berisha has strong support.
	   Police said a gang of about 80 people armed with grenades and
automatic rifles attacked a bank and police station late Wednesday
night in Lezha, 55 kilometers (35 miles) north of Tirana, the
capital. Three of the attackers died in gunbattles with police and
several were wounded, according to Artan Bizhga, the Interior
Ministry spokesman.
	   The identities of the attackers was unknown, but Bizhga said
some were believed to have come from other towns in the area. An
explosion in Lezha two weeks ago damaged the office of Nano's
Socialist Party.
	   In rioting Sunday and Monday, Berisha's supporters damaged the
parliament and prime minister's office, briefly took over the state
television station, burned cars and looted some shops.
	   On Thursday, he called for nationwide protests on Friday, saying
they would be peaceful. Speaking at a news conference before the
rally, he called Nano ``the most dangerous leader, staying in power
only by arresting, by murdering, by executing ... the opposition.''
	   He accused Nano's secret police of cutting off access in Albania
to independent media, forcing people to rely on state media which
he claims is sending out false, biased information. He said
Albanians must listen to foreign or independent media in order to
understand what's going on.
	   ``Fatos Nano is keeping the Albanians in darkness,'' he said,
accusing him of being ``a high prosecutor in the old years of
Albania.''
	   Despite Berisha's rhetoric, he faces an elected government
backed by Western powers desperate to prevent the Albanian unrest
from influencing other crises in the region, chief among them in
neighboring Kosovo province in Yugoslavia.
	   The second major crisis in Albania in 18 months began after the
slaying Saturday of popular politician Azem Hajdari, a close aide
to Berisha, who immediately blamed Nano.
	   Demonstrations degenerated into rioting that lasted two days and
left three people dead and scores injured.
	   Berisha has been seeking to return to power, tapping not only
outrage over Hajdari's killing but also widespread disappointment
with the government's inability to revive the economy and restore
confidence in the nation's future.

	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Riot police and paramilitary
commandos clashed with protesters Thursday in several parts of the
Ivory Coast's commercial capital, where the shooting death of a
taxi driver has triggered growing unrest.
	   Firing tear gas canisters and beating back some demonstrators,
authorities took up positions along a number of main roads in the
Abobo and Adjame districts on Abidjan's west side.
	   In impoverished neighborhoods in Abobo, several thousand people
crowded the streets, where police had set up roadblocks to check
traffic. Glass from shattered car windshields littered the ground
in several spots.
	   One surging crowd scattered in all directions when police
launched tear gas into the area.
	   Police over the weekend shot and killed a taxi driver who failed
to stop at a routine checkpoint, sparking a city-wide taxi strike
that has slowly grown violent.
	   Checkpoints are often used by Ivorian police to extort money
from drivers.
	   The head of Abidjan's taxi union said police on Saturday shot at
Assane Sanogo's cab when he failed to stop and continued shooting
until the driver was dead.
	   On strike since Monday, anger among cab drivers is boiling over.
A group of drivers attacked a police station with rocks and bottles
on Wednesday and set several cars on fire.
	   No serious injuries were reported in that clash, which erupted
during a funeral procession for Sanogo that stopped at the police
station in the Abidjan neighborhood of Yopougon.
	   Eventually, the police barricaded themselves inside the station
and fired tear gas canisters into the crowds.
	   A government statement read on state radio apologized for
Sanogo's death and said the officers responsible had been arrested.
The government has appealed to taxi drivers to return to work.
	   Normally packed with orange and yellow taxis, Abidjan's streets
have been quiet since Monday, when the drivers began a mass strike
over Sanogo's death. Buses are jammed and many commuters are forced
to walk miles (kilometers) to work and back.

Gun battle in volatile area of South Africa leaves six dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Six people were killed in shootouts
between political rivals in a township near the Indian Ocean City
of Durban, police said Thursday.
	   One person was injured and three houses also were burned down in
the attack Wednesday night in the Lindelani township, police said.
	   Witnesses attributed the violence to feuding factions of the
Inkatha Freedom Party, a Zulu-based party that is the dominant
force in KwaZulu-Natal Province, SABC television said.
	   Over the past decade in the province, more than 10,000 people
have died in fighting between Inkatha and the rival African
National Congress.
	   In recent months, scores of killings have been attributed to
fighting between ANC supporters and a sympathizers with a new
opposition party on the scene, the United Democratic Movement,
which has attracted disaffected ANC supporters.
	   One of Wednesday's victims was the head of a local Inkatha
women's branch, South African Press Association said.
	   Inkatha said it had sent leaders to the area to quell tensions,
and called on the police ``to act without fear or favor and ensure
that the culprits are brought before the courts.''

O'Neill wins record 10th gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with finals. Will be updated with later
races &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australia's Susie O'Neill became
the greatest gold medal winner in Commonwealth Games swimming
history Thursday, doing it in style with the second fastest
200-meter butterfly race of all time.
	   O'Neill, the Olympic and world champion in the event, blew away
compatriot Petria Thomas to claim her 10th gold medal in her third
Commonwealth Games.
	   Her tally surpassed fellow Australian Mike Wenden's total of
nine and equaled Canadian Graham Smith's record total for a single
games of six in 1978.
	   Winning in 2 minutes, 6.60 seconds, O'Neill smashed her own
Commonwealth record of 2:7.29, which she set in 1995. The time was
second only to United States swimmer Mary T. Meagher's 1981 mark of
2:05.96 _ the oldest swimming record.
	   The feat was remarkable considering she had complained of
feeling listless after Thursday's heats and it was her eighth event
of the meet.
	   She finished the competition with six golds and two silver
medals.
	   ``During the day I was thinking about the 10 gold medals and my
coach had a big talk to me and made me get it out of my mind and
focus on the job at hand, and that really helped tonight,'' O'Neill
said. ``He made me realize it's the 200 fly I'm here to swim, not
the 10 gold medals.
	   ``I'm glad it's over. It was probably the best feeling in my
life when I finished it.''
	   O'Neill's 10 golds are believed to be the greatest haul by any
athlete in any games sport, but the Commonwealth Games Federation
is unable to confirm this because of poor record keeping taking.
	   Thomas has not beaten O'Neill in the 200 since 1993, and won
silver medals behind her at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and January's
world championships.
	   Australia's Matthew Dunn gave Australia the first gold on
Thursday when he broke a Commonwealth record in the 200-meter
individual medley.
	   Dunn clocked 2:00.26, breaking the record of 2:01.13 held by
Canada's Atlanta Olympic medalist Curtis Myden. Myden missed the
meet because of study commitments.
	   England's 200-meter butterfly gold medalist James Hickman led
Dunn through the fly and backstroke legs but the Australian hit the
front halfway through the breaststroke. He turned with a winning
margin and powered home on the freestyle.
	   Hickman finished second in 2:01.87, with Robert Van Der Zant
taking bronze in 2:02.73.
	   ``Everything went perfect: my warm-up went perfect, my swimming
went perfect, even my lunch went perfect,'' said Dunn.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed sharply lower
on concerns over U.S. interest rates, renewed economic turmoil in
Russia, and a host of negative local market news. Japan's main
stock index plunged to a new 12-year low. But shares in the
Philippines bucked the region's trend. The key PSE index rocketing
7.9 percent _ the sharpest gain in three months _ lifted by a
25-percent rally in shares of the Philippines Long Distance
Telephone amid rumors of possible merger or takeover. Japan's
benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 338.56 points, or
2.38 percent, closing at 13,859.14, on escalating worries over the
economies in Russia and Japan. It was the Nikkei's lowest finish
since March 5, 1986, when it closed at 13,807.46. In late afternoon
trading, the dollar bought 134.30 yen, down 0.62 yen from late
Wednesday in Tokyo. The monthlong confusion over Russia's economy
escalated Thursday, as President Boris Yeltsin said it would take
an extra week to complete formation of the new Cabinet, and Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov ordered officials to avoid speaking to
the media until then. Apart from Russia, investors also were
confused over whether the United States would cut interest rates,
which analysts say would give Asian economies the much-needed
liquidity and reassurance that the economic giant is ready to act
to prevent a global economic fallout. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ One month after Russia's crisis hit, the new
government's economic policy remains a mystery and the ruble was
again falling fast on Thursday. The Russian currency was trading at
around 15 at the Moscow currency exchange after recovering to 7.5
to the dollar earlier this week. President Boris Yeltsin said it
could take another week to install the full Cabinet. The president
said the heads of the government's security ministries, including
Sergeyev, would not change, but more time was needed to fill other
posts. The key job of Finance Minister and other Cabinet positions
were still under discussion, the president said. The president also
signed an order on security preparations for a nationwide protest
that trade unions have organized for Oct. 7. Workers have gone on
strike throughout the country, but the protests so far have not
been coordinated and have not been a major factor in the economic
problems. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ After weeks of deadlock, Japan's ruling party and
opposition came closer to a compromise Thursday on key banking
legislation designed to shore up the country's ailing financial
system. Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and Naoto Kan, leader of the
main opposition party, are expected to meet Thursday evening to
negotiate an agreement. The governing party is trying to pass bank
legislation to clean up the bad loans strangling the financial
sector. The bills include plans to rescue ailing Long-Term Credit
Bank. Obuchi is eager to get the bills passed before his summit
with U.S. President Bill Clinton next Tuesday, since Washington has
prodded Tokyo to act more quickly to fix the bad loan problem. And
the impasse over the bill has set off fears of a deepening of
Japan's recession that threatens to hurt the global economy.
(JAPAN-BANK BILLS)
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong announced Thursday that its
unemployment rate climbed to a 15-year high _ about 5 percent _ in
the three-month period ending Aug. 31. Officials said continued
weakness in retail, the restaurant and construction trades
accounted for most of the latest job losses. The entry of new
graduates in the labor market has aggravated the problem. Analysts
say the problem is unlikely to be solved as the 14-month financial
turmoil in Asia has shown no signs of abating. ``The overall trend
is that things will deteriorate even further and (the unemployment
rate) may reach 7 percent by May next year,'' predicted Anthony
Chan of HSBC Securities Asia Ltd. Hong Kong's once-robust economy
shrank 5 percent in the second quarter, and is expected to shrink 4
percent in 1998. High interest rates _ the government's main tactic
in defending the territory's currency link to the U.S. dollar _ are
stifling the all-important property sector, responsible for one in
10 jobs here. (HONG KONG-JOBLESS)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Strike-ravaged Philippine Airlines
announced Thursday it will halt operations next week, ending the
57-year history of Asia's oldest airline. Airline officials said
efforts to rebuild the ailing carrier were no longer feasible after
its largest union rejected a proposal to help the company survive.
The airline said the closure will be effective at midnight next
Wednesday. The closure of the Philippines' largest airline will
leave the country with only a handful of very small carriers, most
with severe economic or operating problems of their own. A
spokesman for President Joseph Estrada said the government may
intervene in PAL's decision. Among possible measures is a
referendum among union members on the airline proposal, he said.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ Rival party leaders have agreed to
meet next week to try to end Cambodia's political crisis, King
Norodom Sihanouk said Thursday. The talks, which will bring
together strongman Hun Sen and his foes Prince Norodom Ranariddh
and Sam Rainsy, will be held early Tuesday under the king's
auspices in the northwestern province of Siem Reap, he said. It
will be Hun Sen's first meeting with Ranariddh since he ousted the
prince in a violent coup d'etat in July last year. Junior
opposition leader Sam Rainsy met Thursday with Sihanouk and
Ranariddh consulted with the king on Wednesday. Opposition leaders
are protesting alleged fraud in July's parliamentary elections, but
have agreed not to boycott the parliamentary session needed to form
a new government. (CAMBODIA)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will only meet
with Benjamin Netanyahu in New York next week if the Israeli prime
minister accepts a U.S. plan for a West Bank troop withdrawal,
Arafat's adviser said Thursday. U.S. President Bill Clinton is
trying to arrange a three-way summit with Arafat and Netanyahu in
hopes of concluding an elusive deal on a West Bank pullback. At the
time, all three will be in New York for the U.N. General Assembly.
Netanyahu is ready to attend such a meeting, his aides said
Thursday. As Washington tried to salvage its Mideast peace mission,
tensions rose over Israeli construction plans on disputed land in
the Jewish West Bank settlement of Yitzhar. The United States has
urged Israel to halt settlement expansion. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania's political crisis moved toward a
possible showdown Thursday, with former President Sali Berisha
staging another protest against the government and Parliament
deliberating on whether to clear the way for Berisha's arrest.
Western powers fear a violent confrontation between Berisha and
Prime Minister Fatas Nano could worsen if the former president is
arrested on charges of seeking to overthrow the government.
Lawmakers prepared to consider lifting Berisha's immunity from
arrest, which would enable parliament to order his detention on
charges of seeking to overthrow the government. New unrest was
reported in northern Albania, where Berisha has strong support.
Police said a gang of about 80 people armed with grenades and
automatic rifles attacked a bank and police station late Wednesday
night in Lezha, 55 kilometers (35 miles) north of Tirana, the
capital. Three of the attackers were killed in gun battles with
police and several were wounded, according to an Interior Ministry
spokesman. (ALBANIA)
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ On the eve of the 10th anniversary of a
military coup in Myanmar, the country's government in exile said
Thursday that atrocities and human rights abuses by the military
are increasing. ``We are now experiencing the biggest crackdown on
pro-democracy supporters since the military seized power ten years
ago,'' said Thein Oo, Justice Minister for the National Coalition
Government of the Union of Burma, Myanmar's former name. He said
the government had arrested 1,200 pro-democracy activists since
May, including 783 members of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi's
party the National League for Democracy. Among them are 196 members
of parliament. The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in parliament in
a 1990 election the military refused to honor. The recent arrests
were intended to foil an NLD plan to convene the assembly despite
warnings from the military it would be illegal. (MYANMAR-COUP
ANNIVERSARY)
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ International officials in
charge of Bosnia's elections denied Thursday that they are holding
back vote results because extremists won, saying the count remains
inconclusive. Nicole Szulc, spokeswoman for the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, which supervised last weekend's
nationwide elections, declined comment on who is leading in races
deemed crucial to Bosnia's rebuilding process after 3 1/2 years of
war and said results would be available within days. A strong
showing by the extremists would be an embarrassing setback to
international efforts to build a stable, multiethnic state in
Bosnia-Herzegovina. It could also raise doubts about the
effectiveness of the international effort which has sought to
rebuild Bosnia after the 1995 Dayton peace accords.

Australia's Brown, Canada's Groulx win two golds each
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australia's Damian Brown and
Canada's Sebastien Groulx each won two gold medals Thursday in
weightlifting competition at the Commonwealth Games.
	   India's Satheesa Rai and Malaysia's Muhad Hidayat each won one.
	   Brown had to come from behind in the 77-kilogram division after
a snatch of 140 kilograms that was good for only a bronze medal.
	   Rai took the gold with 147.5 and David Morgan of Wales won the
silver with 145.
	   Brown more than made up for that with a lift of 187.5 in the
clean and jerk for one gold medal, and his total of 327.5 gave him
another.
	   Rai took silvers for his clean and jerk of 175 and total of
322.5.
	   Canada's Alain Bilodeau won bronze in those two categories with
167.5 and a total of 305.
	   Groulx gained his first gold thanks to lighter body weight as
he, England's Stuart Cruikshank and Tony Morgan of Wales all lifted
130 in the snatch. Cruikshank won the silver and Morgan the bronze.
	   Then Groulx's silver medal clean and jerk of 167.5 gave him a
gold medal total of 297.5.
	   Hidayat also lifted 167.5 in the clean and jerk, but took the
gold because of lighter body weight. Govindaswamy won the bronze
with 162.5.
	   For total, Hidayat won the silver with 295 and India's Sandip
Kumae the bronze with 285.0.

Asian markets tumble on U.S., Russian worries

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed sharply lower
on concerns over U.S. interest rates, renewed economic turmoil in
Russia, and a host of negative local market news. Japan's main
stock index plunged to a new 12-year low.
	   But shares in the Philippines bucked the region's trend. The key
PSE index rocketing 7.9 percent _ the sharpest gain in three months
_ lifted by a 25-percent rally in shares of the Philippines Long
Distance Telephone amid rumors of a possible merger or takeover.
	   Japan's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 338.56
points, or 2.38 percent, closing at 13,859.14, on escalating
worries over the economies in Russia and Japan.
	   It was the Nikkei's lowest finish since March 5, 1986, when it
closed at 13,807.46. It had fallen 0.21 percent Wednesday.
	   In late afternoon trading, the dollar bought 134.30 yen, down
0.62 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New
York rate of 134.90 yen overnight.
	   Shares of major Japanese companies doing business with Russia
tumbled, following the announcement of TDK Corp., a major maker of
electronic parts, that it may face delays in the redemption of
16.31 billion yen (dlrs 121 million) that it had invested in
Russian euroyen bonds, because of the recent economic turmoil
there.
	   The monthlong confusion over Russia's economy escalated
Thursday, as President Boris Yeltsin said it would take an extra
week to complete formation of the new Cabinet, and Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov ordered officials to avoid speaking to the media
until then.
	   The Russian media have been abuzz with speculation about
possible appointments and policies.
	   Apart from Russia, investors also were confused over whether the
United States would cut interest rates. Analysts say that would
give Asian economies reassurance that the economic giant is ready
to act to prevent a global economic fallout.
	   On Wednesday, Greenspan said in closely-watched testimony in
Congress that ``at the moment there is no endeavor to coordinate
interest rate cuts'' among the Group of Seven industrialized
countries.
	   Greenspan's comments, coupled with profit-taking and
expectations that the unemployment figure, announced later in the
day, will show a rise sent Hong Kong shares sharply lower.
	   The Hang Seng Index plunged 3.6 percent to close at 7,576.57
after three straight session of gains.
	   The government announced after trading closed that unemployment
in the three months ending Aug. 31 reached a 15-year high of 5
percent.
	   In Singapore, the Straits Times Index fell 0.6 percent at
941.42, also on Greenspan's comments and profit-taking from
Wednesday's 4.9 percent gain.
	   In Indonesia, the key JSX index plunged 1.9 percent to 286.475
points on fears of growing demonstrations in the capital city, and
uncertainties over the future ownership of some listed companies
whose owners are facing huge financial liability.
	   In Malaysia, the key Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange closed down 1.9
percent at 394.04, as more retail investors pulled out amid
continued talks of a capital gains tax.
	   Elsewhere:
	   BANGKOK: The SET index closed up 0.6 percent at 220.05 on Wall
Street's fourth consecutive session of gains Wednesday.
	   SEOUL: The Kospi index fell 0.7 percent, with no particular
market news to boost shares.
	   SYDNEY: The All Ordinaries Index was 0.4 percent lower at
2,542.9, as investors stayed sidelined ahead of the local federal
election.
	   TAIPEI: The technology-heavy Weighted Price Index was up 0.4
percent at 7,000.52 on rotational buying of technology stocks.
	   WELLINGTON: The NZSE-40 capital index was 0.8 percent higher at
1,762, boosted by a strong gain by Telecom Corp. of New Zealand
Ltd.

Germany reports more Bosnian refugees going home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Almost three-quarters of the 350,000
Bosnians who fled to Germany during the 1992-95 war in their
homeland have left, most of them going back to Bosnia, officials
said Thursday.
	   The federal government's commissioner for Bosnian refugees,
Dietmar Schlee, said 103,000 returned to Bosnia voluntarily so far
this year, 1,435 were deported and 11,500 moved to other countries.
	   He said another 50,000 of the approximately 100,000 remaining
Bosnian refugees in Germany were expected to leave by the end of
1998.

Basque separatist group announces cease-fire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reaction from government &QL; 
 &UR; By KERNAN TURNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The armed Basque separatist group ETA has
announced a unilateral cease-fire to its bloody 30-year campaign
for an independent homeland in northern Spain.
	   The Spanish government's first reaction was skepticism, while
acknowledging people welcomed the announcement with ``happiness and
relief.''
	   ``Time will be the judge of the sincerity, authenticity, the
depth of this decision,'' Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja said
in a formal statement read on a live national television broadcast.
	   ``While there is a truce, there will be no tragedy, no deaths,''
Mayor Oreja, who controls national security forces, said.
	   He urged ``caution and prudence'' and said the government would
be meeting with all democratic forces in the country to analyze the
ETA action.
	   Mayor Oreja said earlier in the week that if ETA declared a
cease-fire before the Oct. 25 Basque region elections, it would be
a ``trick truce'' intended to gain support for its allied Herri
Batasuna party.
	   The minister had met in the morning with opposition Socialist
Party leader Joaquin Almunia, who told reporters later he regretted
that ETA had not categorically renounced violence forever.
	   There was no immediate comment from Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar, who was on an official visit to Peru. He was to give a press
conference later in the day.
	   ETA's four-page statement announcing the indefinite truce was
made public late Wednesday by the radical Basque daily newspaper
Euskadi Informacion.
	   The armed group set no conditions on the cease-fire, which it
said would begin Friday, but warned it would end the truce in the
event of a ``confrontation'' with the government.
	   The statement came as Basque nationalists were clamoring for the
militant group to renounce bloodshed to help foster a political
solution to Basque nationalist aspirations. ETA has killed nearly
800 people since 1968.
	   ``One has to analyze this communique with prudence and
caution,'' Socialist party spokesman Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba was
quoted as saying by the state-run news agency EFE. ``In that it
(the ETA statement) talks of an indefinite and unilateral truce,
the democratic parties are facing an opportunity, but also a
risk.''
	   There was a more euphoric reaction in the Basque country itself,
where government spokeswoman Mari Carmen Garmendia urged the
Socialists and Aznar's more conservative Popular party to join
other democratic forces in peace negotiations.
	   The two most powerful political parties in Spain have long
maintained they would not negotiate with ETA unless it renounced
violence and put down its arms.
	   ``Peace demands the participation and collaboration of everyone
without exception,'' Garmendia was quoted as saying by Spanish news
agency Europa Press.
	   Pressure on ETA to declare a unilateral cease-fire has escalated
since Saturday, when Basque nationalists and other political
groups, including Herri Batasuna, called for peace talks and a
permanent end to the violence.
	   The statement, dubbed the Lizarra Declaration, was signed by 23
political parties, labor unions and grassroots groups. The forum
was boycotted by the governing Popular Party and the Socialists.
	   The cease-fire followed by a week the jailing a former Socialist
interior minister and his top aide for their involvement in a 1983
kidnapping, the first act of a dirty war against ETA attributed to
the self-styled Anti-Terrorist Groups, or GAL. The death squad
killed 27 people over the next five years, many of them mistaken
targets.
	   ETA has called cease-fires before but they were of limited
duration; in 1996, for example, it observed a one-week truce. This
is the first time it has announced an open-ended cease-fire.
	   ETA, the Basque language initials for Basque Homeland and
Freedom, and Basque political parties seek an independent nation
carved out of pieces of northern Spain and southern France.
	   Most Basque politicians, while supporting ETA's goal, have urged
the rebels to stop the killing.
	   The longest cease-fire ETA has observed came in 1989 during what
were supposed to be secret peace talks with the Spanish government,
held in Algiers. The talks went nowhere and ETA resumed its violent
campaign for independence.
	   The last ETA attack came on June 25 when it killed a town
councilor of the ruling Popular Party in the Basque town of
Renteria. He was the sixth person killed by ETA this year.

Fighting resumes in north as Western efforts intensify
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As the United States and its
European allies intensified efforts to end the crisis in Kosovo,
fighting resumed Thursday in the north of the province with both
Serbs and ethnic Albanians reporting casualties.
	   Meanwhile, in an apparent testing of the ethnic Albanian public,
a newspaper close to the moderate leadership published Thursday the
text of a U.S.-proposed interim agreement for Kosovo that would
grant the region a level of self-rule.
	   A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed the authenticity of the text Thursday but downplayed it
as ``only a starting point.''
	   The three-year accord, published in the daily Koha Ditore, does
not specify a political status for the province. It refers to
Kosovo as a ``territory'' which would have its own parliament and
executive powers, local police and judicial system.
	   Kosovo would be represented in the Serbian government and the
Yugoslav parliament, but federal authorities could not influence
the work of local officials, the daily claimed of the proposal made
by U.S. envoy Christopher Hill.
	   Publication of the document could represent an attempt by the
pacifist Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova, to test public sentiments
about cutting a deal that falls short of independence from Serbia.
	   Like most ethnic Albanians, Rugova also wants independence. But
the idea has been ruled out by the West and by Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, who stripped the province off autonomy in 1989.
	   The rebel ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which is
fighting the Serbs to gain independence of Kosovo, rejected on
Wednesday any deal that does not end Serb rule over the
predominantly ethnic Albanian region.
	   Clashes between the defiant guerrillas and Serb security forces
resumed Thursday north of the capital Pristina, a day after the
government launched an offensive to push the rebels out of their
stronghold in the area.
	   The pro-government Media Center reported that four policemen
were wounded Wednesday, two seriously.
	   The ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Information Center said 13 ethnic
Albanians were injured. It claimed four villages were burned to the
ground, and two others were under fire while advancing Serb forces
looted ethnic Albanian houses. Some 10,000 people have been
reported on the run.
	   The region, some 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the capital,
has in the past several months been largely peaceful. It is
believed to be one of the two remaining rebel strongholds, after
their defeat in much of Kosovo. The other one is in the central
Drenica area.
	   Fearing a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo as winter approaches,
the United States and its European allies again raised the
possibility of NATO action to end the fighting.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said in Washington that NATO
planning and consulting have advanced, while State Department
spokesman James Foley said resolve among member countries is
increasing.
	   ``There is a growing sense of urgency,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, diplomatic sources reported that Britain and France
have begun preliminary discussions with Security Council members
about a resolution on Kosovo, with the aim of ending the crisis
peacefully.
	   Details of the resolution were sketchy, particularly about the
use of force, but it still indicated renewed Western resolve to act
about Kosovo, where hundreds of people have been killed in the past
several months and more than 300,000 displaced.
	   So far, little action has been taken on Kosovo because of
divisions among the U.N. Security Council over the use of force.
Russia, a permanent member with veto rights, opposes it.

Israeli motorists open fire, killing Palestinian teen-ager
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Palestinian student dying of injuries &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli motorists opened fire on
Palestinian high school students Thursday, killing one and wounding
another, witnesses and doctors said.
	   The witnesses said the motorists shot without provocation. In
the past, Israelis driving in the West Bank have opened fire to
repulse Palestinian stone throwers.
	   The shooting occurred around noon in the West Bank village of
Beitunia. Witnesses said a group of about 10 high school students
was walking along the main road on their way home from school when
a Ford with Israeli license plates pulled up next to them.
	   Passengers in the Ford rolled down their windows and began
firing from a pistol and a submachine gun, said Raed Abdel Rahman,
17, one of the students who escaped injury.
	   ``Everybody started to jump and take cover,'' said Abdel Rahman.
	   The wounded were taken to nearby Ramallah Hospital.
	   Iyad Hashem, 17, who was hospitalized in critical condition with
a stomach wound, died at the hospital about an hour later, said
hospital director Shauke Harb.
	   Fifteen-year-old Issa Jabarin was in stable condition with a
stomach wound, hospital officials said.

	   VAN, Turkey (AP) _ Three gunmen opened fire at a mosque during
morning prayers Thursday, wounding three people, the Anatolia news
agency said.
	   The masked men raided the mosque in this southeastern city,
ordering people to lie down, Sevket Taskiran, the mosque's imam,
told the agency.
	   ``They started shooting randomly when the citizens did not obey
them,'' Taskiran said. ``They escaped into the back streets.''
	   The motive of the attack was not immediately clear.
	   According to the Anatolia, some of the people in the mosque
suggested that loan sharks could be involved. Officials were not
available for comment.
	   In the past, Kurdish rebels have targeted village mosques in the
area to punish villagers who do not support them.

 &UR; Yeltsin orders security steps before October protest &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday ordered
stepped up security in anticipation of nationwide mass protests
next month and approved plans to set up fast-reaction police units.
	   Yeltsin met with Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin and signed
an order on security preparations for a nationwide protest that
trade unions have organized for Oct. 7 together with Communists and
other hardliners. Labor groups have held an annual protest day in
October in recent years.
	   Stepashin told reporters the steps were intended to prevent mass
disturbances in view of the current economic crisis. He said the
orders specifically ban blockades of railways and roads and any
protests in military units.
	   There were a wave of scattered protests earlier this year by
workers protesting unpaid wages, including blockades of the
Trans-Siberian railway and other routes.
	   Yeltsin also ordered Stepashin to create additional mobile
police squads. At the same time he issued a directive to cut the
number of Interior Ministry troops by 54,000 by next year in an
apparent money-saving measure.
	   Also on Thursday, Yeltsin met with Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev and promised to pay off wage arrears to the military by
the end of the month, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said,
according to Russian news agencies.
	   The government has issued similar pledges for years, but failed
to solve wage debts to the military and other state workers because
of a chronic shortfall in revenues.
	   Russian media reported that the current fund shortage had
already forced the military to sharply cut food rations.

Arafat only to meet Netanyahu if Israel agrees to U.S. peace plan

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will only meet
with Benjamin Netanyahu next week if the Israeli prime minister
accepts a U.S. plan for a West Bank troop withdrawal, Arafat's
adviser said Thursday.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton is trying to arrange a three-way
summit with Arafat and Netanyahu in hopes of concluding an elusive
deal on a West Bank pullback. All three will be in New York for the
U.N. General Assembly.
	   Netanyahu is ready to attend such a meeting, his aides said
Thursday. He has repeatedly, however, rejected the U.S. plan that
calls for an Israeli withdrawal from 13 percent of the disputed
territory.
	   He has said will hand over 10 percent in full and 3 percent with
some conditions, such as temporary restrictions on Palestinian land
use.
	   Israel, meanwhile, approved the tenfold expansion of the Jewish
West Bank settlement of Yitzhar, where Palestinian militants killed
two residents in a drive-by shooting last month. Netanyahu told the
Yediot Ahronot daily he approved the construction ``as another
response to terrorist perpetrators.''
	   Yediot said Israel would confiscate land from four Palestinian
villages for the new construction in Yitzhar, near the Palestinian
city of Nablus.
	   In disputed east Jerusalem, some 35 members of Betar, the youth
movement of Netanyahu's Likud Party, set up two tents and a mobile
home at the site of the planned Jewish neighborhood of Har Homa.
The demonstrators said they wanted to push Netanyahu to begin
construction of the 6,500 homes planned at the site, known in
Arabic as Jabal Abu Ghneim.
	   Police dismantled the tents after five hours and ordered the
demonstrators to leave.
	   The Palestinians hope to establish a future capital in east
Jerusalem, the sector captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967
Mideast war. They broke off peace talks with Israel in March 1997,
when Netanyahu broke ground for Har Homa.
	   While preliminary work has been completed, Netanyahu has not
approved the start of construction, apparently fearing that would
trigger renewed Palestinian protests and international criticism.
	   The renewed tensions came as Clinton's Mideast envoy, Dennis
Ross, attempted to win a breakthrough before the U.N. meeting.
	   Arafat would attend a three-way summit, but only under certain
conditions, said his adviser, Nabil Abourdeneh.
	   ``If the situation is as it is now, in which there is no
intention by Netanyahu to agree to the American initiative, then
there will be no summit,'' Abourdeneh said.

Official: Kazakstan not suffering from Russia's crisis _ for now
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALMATY, Kazakstan (AP) _ While inflation is soaring in Russia,
prices in the neighboring former Soviet republic of Kazakstan will
remain unchanged until the end of this year, a senior official
pledged Thursday.
	   ``There is absolutely no reason for buying up anything,'' said
Nikolai Radostovetz, chief of the State Committee for the
Regulation of Natural Monopolies and the Protection of Competition.
	   Inflation in Russia was 43.3 percent in the first two weeks of
September, up from less than 1 percent a month before economic
crisis hit in August. Prices of some goods have tripled and even
quadrupled, and many Russians were stocking up on staple goods.
	   Radostovetz told a news conference that the Kazak government has
taken measures to ensure that the largest monopolies, including
telecommunications company Kazakhtelekom, state railway company
Temir Zholy, and national electricity provider KEGOC, will not
raise their prices.
	   He also said the government has signed an agreement with
Kazakstan's three oil refineries _ Atyrau, Chimkent and Pavlodar _
that bans an increase in prices for oil products until the end of
the year.
	   Kazakstan's financial markets have long been separated from
those of Russia, and experts did not expect Russia's turmoil to hit
the Central Asian nation too hard.
	   However, experts also warned that Kazakstan may feel more
long-term effects.
	   Radostovetz conceded Thursday that the government may not be
able to prevent price increases next year.
	   ``I cannot say that the tariffs will be stable and unchanged in
1999. I can only say that until the end of the year, there will be
practically no change in prices,'' Radostovetz said.

German central bank leaves key interest rates unchanged
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The German central bank, the
Bundesbank, left its key interests rates unchanged Thursday at its
regular central council meeting.
	   The 4.5 percent Lombard rate and 2.5 percent discount rate
remained as set in April 1996, while the securities repurchase rate
stayed at 3.3 percent as set last October.
	   Recent statements by Bundesbank members had indicated the rates
would likely remain steady.
	   The Bundesbank normally holds its regular policy-making council
meetings in Frankfurt every two weeks. The council is made up of
eight directorate members and the nine chairmen of the regional
central banks.

 &UR; Yeltsin orders security steps before October protest &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday ordered
stepped up security in anticipation of nationwide mass protests
next month and approved plans to set up fast-reaction police units.
	   Yeltsin met with Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin and signed
an order on security preparations for a nationwide protest that
trade unions have organized for Oct. 7 together with Communists and
other hardliners. Labor groups have held an annual protest day in
October in recent years.
	   Stepashin told reporters the steps were intended to prevent mass
disturbances in view of the current economic crisis. He said the
orders specifically ban blockades of railways and roads and any
protests in military units.
	   There were a wave of scattered protests earlier this year by
workers protesting unpaid wages, including blockades of the
Trans-Siberian railway and other routes.
	   Yeltsin also ordered Stepashin to create additional mobile
police squads. At the same time he issued a directive to cut the
number of Interior Ministry troops by 54,000 by next year in an
apparent money-saving measure.
	   Also on Thursday, Yeltsin met with Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev and promised to pay off wage arrears to the military by
the end of the month, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said,
according to Russian news agencies.
	   The government has issued similar pledges for years, but failed
to solve wage debts to the military and other state workers because
of a chronic shortfall in revenues.
	   Russian media reported that the current fund shortage had
already forced the military to sharply cut food rations.

Pakistani foreign minister in Iran for Afghanistan talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Pakistan's foreign minister arrived here
Thursday for talks with Iranian officials on tensions with
Afghanistan, Iranian television reported.
	   Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz is to deliver a message to Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami from Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif during his ``short and unexpected'' visit to Iran, Iranian
television said. The TV report, which was monitored by the British
Broadcasting Corporation, gave no further details.
	   Iran accuses Pakistani intelligence forces of helping
Afghanistan's Taliban militia to storm the Iranian consulate in
northern Afghanistan last month and capturing 10 Iranian diplomats
and a reporter.
	   The Taliban admitted last week to killing nine of the 11
captured Iranians.
	   Pakistan has denied involvement in the attack on the Iranian
mission.
	   Tensions between Iran and Afghanistan's Taliban militia have
been running high over the Taliban's killing of the Iranians.
	   Iran has massed tens of thousands of troops on its border with
Afghanistan, and Taliban leaders have said they've rushed troops to
the border region to repulse any Iranian attack.
	   Pakistan is widely believed to provide military and other
support to the Taliban, which controls 90 percent of Afghanistan,
while Iran is suspected of backing the opposition which represents
Afghanistan's minority Shiite Muslims.

Croatian artist freed of vandalism charge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SPLIT, Croatia (AP) _ An artist accused of vandalism for marking
up a historic pavement in the coastal city of Split had his case
thrown out of court Thursday.
	   Igor Grubic, 29, was charged with damaging public property after
drawing an 8-meter (26-foot) -diameter tar circle in January on
Peristil Square located in front of an ancient palace first built
by the Roman Emperor Diocletian.
	   The painting, named the Black Peristil, earned the artist a
prestigious contemporary art award, but also criminal charges that
could have landed him in prison for a year.
	   He said the act was intended as a protest against ``a persistent
unchangeable society'' _ reflecting the artists' disparagement of
Croatian authorities who promote certain artists while suppressing
new ideas.
	   A county magistrate said the artist had no intent to damage
public property, as the circle, painted with non-stainable
material, was erased and did not leave any traces on the precious
cobblestones.

Nigerian exile returns to his country
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ With Nigeria's transition to democracy
under way, another leading dissident has returned to his native
country, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Ralph Obioha, a prominent member of the National Democratic
Coalition, a leading opposition group, returned quietly to Nigeria
last week after four years in England, the Lagos-based This Day
newspaper said.
	   Obioha told the newspaper that he decided to come back after
being given assurances by Nigeria's military ruler, Gen.
Abdulsalami Abubakar. He gave no details on those assurances,
though he said he would play an active role in the country's shift
to civilian rule.
	   Obioha is the latest in a string of exiles who have returned to
Nigeria. However, the country's most prominent exile, Nobel
Prize-winning writer Wole Soyinka, has refused to come home until a
sweeping security decree is repealed.
	   Abubakar, who came to power in early June after the sudden death
of dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, has repeatedly asked Nigeria's exiles
to return home. Insisting he will return the country to democracy,
he has also freed many of the country's political prisoners and set
a timetable for elections early next year.
	   But hardened by decades of military rule and broken democratic
promises, many Nigerian opposition figures remain deeply suspicious
of Abubakar and worry that the transition will not go as planned.

O'Neill wins record 10th gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with women's 50 freestyle. Will be updated with later
races &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australia's Susie O'Neill became
the greatest gold medal winner in Commonwealth Games swimming
history Thursday, doing it in style with the second fastest
200-meter butterfly race of all time.
	   O'Neill, the Olympic and world champion in the event, blew away
compatriot Petria Thomas to claim her 10th gold medal in her third
Commonwealth Games.
	   Her tally surpassed fellow Australian Mike Wenden's total of
nine and equaled Canadian Graham Smith's record total for a single
games of six in 1978.
	   O'Neill smashed her own Commonwealth record of 2 minutes, 7.29
seconds, which she set in 1995, and it was second only to United
States swimmer Mary T. Meagher's 1981 mark of 2:05.96 _ the oldest
swimming record.
	   Her time of 2:06.60 was remarkable considering she complained of
feeling listless after Thursday's heats and it was her eighth event
of the meet.
	   She finished the competition with six golds and two silver
medals.
	   ``During the day I was thinking about the 10 gold medals and my
coach had a big talk to me and made me get it out of my mind and
focus on the job at hand and that really helped tonight,'' O'Neill
said. ``He made me realize it's the 200 fly I'm here to swim, not
the 10 gold medals. I'm glad it's over. It was probably the best
feeling in my life when I finished it.''
	   O'Neill's 10 golds are believed to be the greatest haul by any
athlete in any games sport, but the Commonwealth Games Federation
is unable to confirm this because of poor record keeping.
	   Thomas has not beaten O'Neill in the 200 since 1993, and won
silver medals behind her at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and January's
world championships.
	   Australia's Matthew Dunn gave Australia the first gold Thursday
when he broke a Commonwealth record in the 200-meter individual
medley.
	   Dunn clocked 2:00.26, breaking the record of 2:01.13 set by
Canada's Atlanta Olympic medalist Curtis Myden. Myden missed the
meet because of study commitments.
	   England's 200-meter butterfly gold medalist James Hickman led
Dunn through the fly and backstroke legs but the Australian hit the
front halfway through the breaststroke. He turned with a winning
margin and powered home on the freestyle.
	   Hickman finished second in 2:01.87, with Robert Van Der Zant
taking bronze in 2:02.73.
	   ``Everything went perfect: my warm-up went perfect, my swimming
went perfect, even my lunch went perfect,'' said Dunn.
	   England's Sue Rolph dug deep to win her second gold of the meet
in the 50-meter freestyle, but wasn't satisfied.
	   ``I'm not that happy with that. It was pretty slow really,''
said Rolph, who touched in 25.82 seconds, ahead of Scottish rival
Alison Sheppard (25.92) and New Zealand's Toni Jeffs (26.07).
	   ``It's been a long six days and I think my batteries have gone a
bit low.''
	   Rolph's win ended Australia's hopes of matching its record
swimming haul of 25 golds from the 1994 games.
	   With three events to swim, Australia had 21.

Israeli motorists open fire, killing Palestinian teen-ager
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli motorists opened fire
Thursday on Palestinian high school students, killing one and
wounding another, witnesses and doctors said.
	   The witnesses said the motorists shot without provocation. In
the past, Israelis driving in the West Bank have opened fire to
repulse Palestinian stone throwers.
	   The shooting occurred around noon in the West Bank village of
Beitunia. Witnesses said about 10 high school students were walking
along the main road on their way home from school when a Ford with
Israeli license plates pulled up next to them.
	   The passengers rolled down their windows and began firing from a
pistol and a submachine gun, said Raed Abdel Rahman, 17, one of the
students who escaped injury.
	   ``Everybody started to jump and take cover,'' said Abdel Rahman.
	   The wounded were taken to nearby Ramallah Hospital.
	   Iyad Hashem, 17, who suffered a stomach wound, died at the
hospital about an hour later, said hospital director Shauke Harb.
	   Fifteen-year-old Issa Jabarin was in stable condition with a
stomach wound, hospital officials said.

Nigerians fly to Tripoli in violation of U.N. sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Arab League &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A delegation of Nigerian cabinet ministers
flew to Libya on Thursday, violating a U.N. ban on flights to the
North African country, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
	   Nigeria's foreign and water ministers, along with other
officials, were the latest to fly into the Libyan capital Tripoli
since the Organization of African Unity last June decided to ignore
the sanctions.
	   Earlier this month, five African presidents flew to Tripoli for
celebrations marking the anniversary of the 1969 coup that brought
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to power.
	   The Nigerians' visit is expected to last several days, MENA
said.
	   The United Nations imposed sanctions on Libya in 1992 to try to
force Gadhafi to surrender two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a
Pan Am passenger jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270
people.
	   In addition to the flight ban, the sanctions also bar arms
sales, freeze some foreign assets and limit sales of oil industry
equipment.
	   Libya this week asked the Arab League in Cairo to join the OAU
in ignoring the sanctions.
	   But the 22-member league late Wednesday said it would not agree
to suspend the sanctions until an agreement is reached with Libya
on handing over the suspects.
	   The United States and Britain last month said they would accept
a trial of the suspects in the Netherlands with Scottish judges.
Libya agreed in principle, but has demanded negotiations to ensure
the suspects' legal rights and safety.
	   The United States and Britain have said the offer is
non-negotiable.
	   The U.N. Security Council said the sanctions would be lifted
when the suspects were turned over for trial.

Unemployment rate marches upward to 5 percent

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong announced Thursday that its
unemployment rate climbed to a 15-year high of about 5 percent in
the three-month period ending Aug. 31.
	   A slowdown in retail and the restaurant and construction trades
accounted for most of the job losses, officials said. The entry of
new graduates in the labor market also aggravated the problem.
	   The 5 percent jobless rate, up from 4.8 percent for the three
months through July, was the worst since it hit 5.2 percent in
1983.
	   Analysts said the problem is unlikely to be solved as the
14-month financial turmoil in Asia shows no signs of abating. But
the figure was lower than the expected 5.2 percent.
	   ``The overall trend is that things will deteriorate even
further,'' said Anthony Chan of HSBC Securities Asia in Hong Kong.
Chan said the unemployment rate may reach 7 percent by May next
year.
	   ``As Hong Kong is still in the midst of difficult economic
adjustment ... high unemployment will inevitably remain with us for
some time,'' Joseph Wong, secretary for education and manpower,
said in a statement.
	   Although Wong later told a news conference the increase in
unemployment has been slowing down, he refused to say whether that
meant better times ahead.
	   ``Although there is stabilization in the unemployment rate, it
is too early to draw any conclusions,'' government economist Tang
Kwon-yiu said.
	   Hong Kong's once-robust economy shrank 5 percent in the second
quarter, and is expected to shrink 4 percent in 1998.
	   High interest rates _ the government's main tactic in defending
the territory's currency link to the U.S. dollar _ is stifling the
property sector, responsible for one in 10 jobs here.
	   About 175,000 of the 3.3 million work force are unemployed,
according to government figures.
	   The latest figure came as more companies announce massive
layoffs.
	   On Wednesday, two investment banks, Nikko Securities and Warburg
Dillon Read, said they were cutting almost 100 jobs.
	   Late Thursday, Hong Kong Telecommunications said it will impose
10 percent pay-cuts on all its employees beginning Nov. 1, Dow
Jones Newswires reported.
	   ``I think we haven't seen the worse yet,'' said T.S. Chow, an
executive at the quasi-government Employment Retraining Program.
	   On Thursday, dozens of people were flipping through job notices
on boards at a government employment service office.
	   Men and women, from their 20s to 60s, wrote down contact numbers
for jobs offering as low as 5,000 Hong Kong dollars a month (U.S.
dlrs 645) _ much lower than the median income of 9,000 Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 1,154) before the Asian financial crisis hit.
	   ``The unemployment problem in Hong Kong is too serious,'' said
Chiu Hok-men, a 25-year-old former shipping clerk who has been out
of work for a year.
	   ``The government should do more,'' he said while checking out
job postings.
	   Union leaders criticized the government for not doing enough.
	   ``The tax dollar has been spent. But where are the new jobs?''
asked activist Leung Kwok-hung.
	   Officials have pledged to create 110,000 new jobs by
accelerating infrastructure projects, but the government appears to
have run out of ideas.
	   On Tuesday, the government approved the U.S. dlr 8.2 billion
West Rail project, expected to create 13,000 jobs in the next few
years.
	   The government has also approved a program to train the
unemployed as maids and a volunteer program for recent graduates
who cannot find jobs.

Anderlecht fires coach after latest bad result
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgium's troubled soccer power
Anderlecht fired Dutch coach Arie Haan Thursday after a string of
bad results continued with a 0-2 UEFA Cup defeat by Grasshoppers
Zurich.
	   Anderlecht's home loss to the Swiss team Wednesday comes on the
heals of a 6-0 Belgian league mauling by Westerlo and a 3-2 loss to
archrival FC Brugge.
	   The humiliation proved too much for the directors of Belgium's
richest and most-famous club. ``When the team starts to play this
poorly, something has to give,'' said club chairman Roger Vanden
Stock.
	   Vanden Stock said assistant trainers Jean Dockx and Frankie
Vercauteren will jointly replace Haan for the moment while the club
looks for a new coach. ``We're going to take our time, we're not
going to rush into anything,'' Vanden Stock said.
	   Anderlecht has won the Belgian league 24 times and won the
European Cup twice. Two decades ago, it was one of Europe's leading
clubs. The loss to Westerlo was Anderlecht's heaviest league loss
in 60 years.
	   With an annual budget of some 800 million francs (dlrs 25
million), by far the biggest in the Belgian league, Anderlecht now
trails clubs that survive on a tenth of that total.
	   The Brussels club did manage a 0-3 win Saturday against Germinal
Ekeren but remains 4th from bottom of the first division.

Trial hopes to crack enigma of Florence Rey
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With APPhotos &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLAS MARMIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A young woman went on trial Monday for the murder
of four people -- three of them police officers -- during a
dramatic chase through eastern Paris that included two shootout and
a hostage-taking and ended only when her accomplice was shot.
	   Four years later, Florence Rey, now 23, remains an enigma to
investigators who have failed to turn up a motive for the deadly
Oct. 4, 1994, episode that stands as one of the bloodiest common
crimes in a decade in France.
	   Rey's companion in crime, Audry Maupin, then 22, died a day
later.
	   A second person, Abdelhakim Dekhar, 33, accused of being the
``third man'' described by eyewitnesses in the episode also was
being tried. Dekhar denies any involvement.
	   Rey, then a haggard-looking literature student, daughter of a
plumber and a school teacher, is accused of murder and attempted
murder.
	   The trial, likely to last two weeks, is expected to shed light
on extreme-left movements to which Rey and Maupin had allegedly
gravitated. It was not clear whether that connection could help
explain the origin of the drama. Only the events that unfolded that
night four years ago are clear:
	   Rey and Maupin, armed with rifles, try to hold up a car lot in
northeast Paris, allegedly tear gassing two police officers and
taking their pistols.
	   The two then commandeer a taxi, taking the driver and passenger
hostage. The driver, frightened, purposely rams a police car,
prompting an initial shootout. Two police officers and the taxi
driver are killed and two passersby wounded.
	   Rey and Maupin then commandeer a second car. Police give chase
and the driver is ordered to accelerate. But the car is suddenly
blocked by a motorcyclist who lays his cycle across the road to
stop the pair.
	   A second shootout erupts: one police officer is killed and
Maupin seriously injured. Rey throws down her rifle and surrenders.
	   Psychiatrists, according to the prosecution, describe Rey as
having a ``good intellectual level'' but living with an
``idealization of the future cut off from social reality.''
	   Ballistics experts determined that the fatal shots came from
Maupin's weapons. But Rey confessed to firing, too, numerous times.
	   The prosecution claims she ``participated by her presence and
her action, her support and her encouragement of her friend, in all
of the acts perpetrated during this murderous escapade.''
	   Still, no one seems to know why.

Thomas, Baulch in cheeky chat in finish straight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Not satisfied with finishing first
and second in their 400-meter semifinal at the Commonwealth Games,
Iwan Thomas and Jamie Baulch decided to chat about it in the dash
to the line.
	   Entering the finishing straight ahead of the field, the two
Welshmen had a conversation of sorts even though they were two
lanes apart.
	   With 80 meters to go, European champion Thomas turned his head
left and pulled his tongue out at his teammate. Baulch responded
with a wave of the hand.
	   With 50 to go, Thomas again looked left, shouted something, gave
a thumbs-up sign of enouragement and had a long look at Baulch, who
looked back. The two stared and smiled at each other. Then Baulch
stuck out his tongue and sort of shrugged his shoulders as if
gaining the final of the Commonwealth Games was easy.
	   Thomas won the heat in 44.61 seconds, with Baulch second in
44.83. The two Welshmen will run against each other again on
Friday.
	   ``I said I would talk to him if he was up there and I did,''
Thomas said. ``I looked over at him and said `Come on, thumbs
up.'''
	   Thomas said his actions were ``gestures of encouragement.''

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnamese officials are still gathering
evidence and have set no date for the trial of Nguyen Hoang Linh, a
former editor of the state-controlled newspaper Enterprise, a
Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Thursday.
	   The trial was originally scheduled for Sept. 10 but has been
delayed.
	   Linh was arrested last October on charges of disclosing state
secrets and abusing freedom and democracy to violate the interests
of the state, organizations and individuals.

Left Party's leader criticized for untaxed home-cleaning
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS two grafs at end with Carl Bildt reaction &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Wrriter &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Just four days before national
elections in which the Left Party appears poised to make big gains,
a newspaper reported Thursday that party leader Gudrun Schyman made
untaxed payments to a girl who cleaned her apartment.
	   The report was potentially embarrassing to Schyman, who strongly
supports Sweden's high-tax welfare state.
	   Schyman acknowledged that she had paid around 2,500 kronor (dlrs
300) to a friend of her daughter's for cleaning work and that she
had not reported the payments to tax authorities.
	   But she denied that the payments constituted what Swedes call
``black work.''
	   ``This is not black work, black work is when someone takes a
lower payment in order to avoid declaring it'' for taxes, Schyman
said on Swedish Radio, hours after the report appeared in the
newspaper Dagens Nyheter.
	   At a later news conference, she said she paid the girl just as a
way of helping her get pocket money for going to the movies or
other recreation.
	   ``A lot of parents will recognize this situation as quite
normal,'' she said.
	   Although the payments to the girl were far less than the
8,700-kronor (dlrs 1,100) limit for untaxed work, the law requires
that any payments over 1,000 kronor (dlrs 125) be reported to tax
authorities.
	   Sven Carlstedt, an official at the Swedish Tax Administration,
was quoted by the news agency TT as saying ``This is nothing that
the tax authorities are considering poking around in.''
	   The Left Party has been performing strongly in opinion polls
ahead of Sunday's national elections, attracting the support of
12-13 percent of poll respondents, about double its current
representation in the parliament.
	   With support for the governing Social Democrats languishing
under 40 percent, the Left is seen as a potential key to forming a
government.
	   Carl Bildt, leader of the conservative Moderates who favor
slashing taxes, did not criticize Schyman for failing to report the
payments, but used the incident do get in a dig.
	   ``It's the tax legislation that's wrong. Our proposals would
make it possible for Gudrun Schyman to be legal,'' he said.

 &UR; Russia's premier, EU delegation to discuss Russia's crisis &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia needs a ``kill-or-cure remedy'' to resolve
its economic crisis, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said
Thursday as he prepared for a meeting with new Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov.
	   Kinkel and senior diplomats from Austria and Britain _ the
``troika'' of nations that are the former, current and next leaders
of the European Union _ were to meet with Primakov on Thursday to
discuss the EU's response to Russia's financial crisis.
	   ``We want to find out how things go on Russia. We want to hear
it from the prime minister himself,'' Kinkel told reporters who
accompanied him on the flight to Moscow.
	   ``We are not friends in fair weather only,'' Kinkel said.
However, he added that no additional financial aid for Russia would
be discussed.
	   Kinkel said he thought Primakov would be able to tackle the
crisis because of the support he enjoys from various political
factions.
	   Primakov was selected for the prime minister's job as a
compromise candidate acceptable both to the Kremlin and
Communist-led opposition in parliament, and his appointment has
quelled bitter political feuding. But Primakov's government has yet
to develop a program for resolving the economic crisis.
	   ``Russia needs a kill-or-cure remedy, but one that it prescribes
itself,'' Kinkel said.
	   Russian liberals and media have warned that the appointment of a
Communist lawmaker and a former chief Soviet banker to the Primakov
Cabinet signaled the end of free-market reforms and a return to a
command economy. But Primakov has dismissed such speculations and
pledged to continue reforms.
	   ``We firmly believe that reforms in Russia will continue,
because you can't turn back the clock,'' Kinkel said.
	   Upon arrival in Moscow, the EU delegation _ which also included
Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel, British deputy
foreign secretary Joyce Quin and European Commission member Hans
van der Broek _ met with Russia's Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.
	   No details of the closed-door talks were released. But Kinkel
earlier said the EU wanted to discuss the situation in Kosovo and
try to bring Russia closer toward accepting a United Nations
resolution for Western intervention in the southern Serbian
province.
	   ``We want to make clear that Russia has a part in the common
responsibility for the Kosovo situation,'' he said.
	   Russia has adamantly opposed the use of force to end fighting in
Kosovo, whose mainly Albanian population seeks independence. Moscow
supports broad autonomy for Kosovo, but not secession from Serbia,
a longtime ally.

Jordan's new prime minister urges Israeli withdrawal from Syria,
</HEADLINE>
Lebanon

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan's new prime minister urged Israel
Thursday to withdraw from Syrian and Lebanese territories to pave
the way for a regional settlement.
	   Fayez Tarawneh's remarks to the 80-member Chamber of Deputies
came in a one-hour speech outlining his policy prior to a
parliamentary vote of confidence.
	   The 23-member Cabinet, appointed by King Hussein last month, is
expected to receive a majority vote in the Chamber of Deputies,
which is dominated by pro-government politicians.
	   The vote will follow a three-day debate beginning Tuesday.
	   Jordan supports the Palestinians until ``they establish their
independent state on their national soil,'' Tarawneh told the
Cabinet session.
	   He said Jordan, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994,
was eager for a swift settlement between Israel and its Arab
neighbors, namely Syria and Lebanon.
	   ``We call on Israel to withdraw from the Syrian Golan to the
June 4, 1967 borders and to implement U.N. Security Council
resolution 425 by withdrawing from south Lebanon unconditionally,''
he said.
	   Israel captured the strategic Golan Heights in the six-day
Middle East War in 1967.
	   Israeli forces also occupy a narrow strip in southern Lebanon.
	   On Iraq, Tarawneh repeated a Jordanian call for dialogue between
Baghdad and the United States.
	   On the domestic front, Tarawneh vowed to consolidate political
reforms launched in 1989 and which led _ among other things _ to an
end to four decades of martial law rule and the revival of a
multi-party system banned since a 1956 leftist coup attempt.
	   He promised decentralization, a transparent policy, and to fight
bureaucracy and blatant poverty and unemployment _ which is
officially set at 15 percent of the 950,000-strong labor force.
	   He said he hopes to improve Jordan's economic performance by
attracting more investments through tax-free and customs
incentives, reaching free trade agreements with the Arabs and
closer economic ties with the United States and Europe.
	   Tarawneh, 50, is a liberal politician who has served as
ambassador to the Washington and led the Jordanian negotiating team
with Israel that culminated in the peace treaty.
	   He took office Aug. 20, a day after his predecessor, Abdul-Salam
Majali, resigned amid a public outcry over polluted drinking water
in the capital, Amman, and parliamentary accusations that the
government had misled the country about economic growth.

Yeltsin meets with Hashimoto, pledges to boost ties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday met with
former Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and pledged to
carry out earlier promises to improve ties.
	   ``We have good relations and I'm sure that ... the specific
proposals we signed will be carried out,'' Yeltsin told reporters
after the meeting in a reference to agreements he signed with
Hashimoto during previous meetings.
	   Yeltsin and Hashimoto developed friendly relations during two
informal summits, one in Russia last November and one in Japan in
April. The meetings were hailed as a breakthrough in relations
strained by a territorial dispute over the Kuril Islands off the
southern Japanese coast.
	   The two countries have never signed a peace treaty formally
ending World War II, mainly because of a disagreement over control
of the islands, claimed by Japan but held by Russia since the end
of the war.
	   Hashimoto resigned as prime minister last month and was named
special foreign policy advisor by his successor, Keizo Obuchi.
	   Obuchi, who served as foreign minister under Hashimoto, said
last month that he wanted to sign a peace treaty and normalize
relations with Russia by 2000.
	   Hashimoto's visit to Russia is paving the way for one by Obuchi
scheduled for November, the first official trip to Moscow by a
Japanese prime minister since 1973.

Daley: Kenya, Tanzania bombing compensation package in preparation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The Clinton administration is drawing up
legislation to present soon to Congress to provide compensation for
the victims of the Aug. 7 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania, U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley said Thursday.
	   Daley said he didn't have a figure for the compensation package
but said he thought it would be ``very substantial'' for both Kenya
and Tanzania.
	   The U.S. official was to have led a trade mission to Kenya and
Tanzania this month, but it has been postponed until December.
	   Daley said 100 companies had originally applied to join the
mission, and 20 had been selected. They were still planning to come
in December, he said.
	   In the nearly simultaneous embassy blasts, 247 people, including
12 Americans, died in Nairobi, and 11 died in Dar es Salaam.
	   Shortly after the Nairobi bombing, President Daniel arap Moi
estimated damage at 30 billion shillings (dlrs 500 million). But
business and financial experts called the figure too high.
	   The Nairobi embassy building is located in a busy area in the
city center, while the building in Dar es Salaam was in a
residential neighborhood.
	   Daley said when he visited the Nairobi bombing site, local
business people robbed of their property and livelihoods asked him
``why Kenya should be penalized for an atrocity carried out against
America.''
	   He indicated that part of the bomb aid package would go to help
Nairobi hospitals which he said were placed under several strain
dealing with the several thousand people injured in the blast.
	   The Kenyan government has set up its own bomb disaster fund and
has been accepting contributions from local businesses and
individuals.
	   On Tuesday, fund chairman Charles Njonjo said the families of
each of the 235 Kenyan victims would receive an interim payment of
100,000 shillings (dlrs 1,666). The government has already paid out
several hundred thousand dollars to cover burial costs.
	   Kenya's average per capita income is around dlrs 300 a year.
	   But the majority of the victims _ both dead and severely injured
_ were civil servants or professional people whose salaries
supported extended families that often number at least 20 members.

Iraqi minister ridicules American military threat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALEXANDRIA, Egypt (AP) _ Characterizing America as ``sometimes a
stupid superpower,'' Iraq's foreign minister on Thursday said U.S.
military action against Iraq would not be productive.
	   The minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, made the comments to
reporters after a meeting near this Mediterranean city with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
	   He was responding to comments earlier this week by Martin Indyk,
assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, who said
``force remains an option'' in dealing with Iraq's decision last
month to suspend cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   ``The United States has, in the past, directed a series of
military stupidities (against Iraq) which have not led to any
results,'' al-Sahhaf told reporters.
	   ``The United States is a superpower _ but it is sometimes a
stupid superpower _ and striking Iraq with missiles will not change
the truth,'' he added.
	   He accused Indyk of ``political maneuvers'' and urged Washington
to ``stop their provocative statements because we will not respond
to them.''
	   Al-Sahhaf said he briefed Mubarak on Baghdad's latest conflict
with the United Nations and its demand that the Security Council
lift crippling trade sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.
	   Iraq on Wednesday urged the Security Council to reconsider its
decision to suspend regular reviews of the sanctions. The council's
decision was in response to Iraq's announcement Aug. 5 that it no
longer would cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its
biological, chemical and nuclear weapons as well as long-range
missiles before the sanctions can be lifted.
	   Iraq maintains it has fulfilled U.N. disarmament resolutions and
accuses Washington of blocking efforts to get the sanctions lifted.
	   Washington last February built up its forces in the Gulf and
threatened force until Iraq agreed to open presidential compounds
to U.N. inspection. Indyk said the United States has a
``considerably stronger strike capability'' in the Gulf now.

Carbajal in search of comeback title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHOENIX (AP) _ In boxing, where Larry Holmes and George Foreman
are looking toward yet another fight at ages 49 and 50
respectively, ``retiring'' doesn't necessarily mean quitting.
	   And, looking to join such comeback ranks, retired former
junior-flyweight champion Michael Carbajal is in training for a
yet-to-be-determined opponent next month in search of a flyweight
title.
	   ``I just wanted to get back in,'' he said Wednesday. ``I watched
all the competition at 112, and I didn't see too much,'' referring
to the 112-pound (51-kilo) weight class.
	   Carbajal (45-4, 30 knockouts) was 30 when he retired in mid-1997
after losing the 108-pound (49-kilo) International Boxing
Association crown that July by a ninth-round TKO in an injurious
bout with South Africa's Jake Matlala. He left the ring with a
two-inch gash above his right eye.
	   Now 31, he called off a May flyweight match with Mexico's Rafael
Orozco after injuring his right hand, but says it's in good shape
now.
	   Danny Carbajal, the fighter's manager-brother, said they are
putting together a bout for Oct. 23 or Oct. 30 at a casino near
Biloxi, Mississippi.
	   Ultimately a title is the motivation, Michael Carbajal said:
``You want something that you lost, and you want it real bad.''
	   Colleagues say money isn't the issue since Carbajal earns about
dlrs 80,000 a year from a retirement fund. The first in the
lightest divisions of boxing to get a dlrs 1 million purse, he
earned about dlrs 7 million overall.
	   ``I know I can win another title,'' he said.
	   Carbajal, a silver medalist in the 1988 Olympics who
subsequently held and lost the WBC crown as well as a number of
other professional titles, was the IBF junior flyweight champion
from 1990-93 and regained it later. He also is a former super
flyweight champ.
	   He suffered a cut over the left eye _ he blamed a head butt
then, too _ in losing the IBF light flyweight title to Mauricio
Pastrana of Colombia in January 1997.
	   Foreman and Holmes are to fight Jan. 23 in Houston.

EU clears dlrs 12.4 million in aid for Palestinians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union on Thursday approved
10.9 million European currency units (dlrs 12.4 million) in
humanitarian aid for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
and those living as refugees in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria.
	   The EU's executive body, the European Commission, said the funds
will be used to provide medical supplies as well as ``emergency
food aid for the most vulnerable.'' It will also involve training
of specialized personnel.
	   The package is the first of its type that the EU's humanitarian
aid program has approved for Palestinian refugees in Lebanon,
Jordan and Syria, the Commission said in a statement.

Korea's opposition lawmakers threaten to resign en masse
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Legislators of South Korea's largest
opposition party threatened Thursday to resign as a group to
protest what they said was political suppression by President Kim
Dae-jung.
	   Prosecutors, who are seeking to arrest or question eight
opposition lawmakers on charges of taking bribes from businessmen,
denied their investigation was politically motivated.
	   At least one ruling party legislator also was being
investigated, the prosecutors said.
	   The Grand National Party accused Kim of using his
anti-corruption drive to break up the No. 1 opposition party.
	   ``We can no longer sit idle. We will step up our fight,'' said
Rep. Ahn Sang-soo, spokesman for the opposition.
	   Ahn said all his party's 138 lawmakers were prepared to resign
en masse to protest the investigation. It was not clear when they
would resign.
	   Ahn also said his party will organize anti-government rallies in
its political home turfs of southeastern provinces over the
weekend.
	   Despite the threat, Kim vowed Thursday to push his anti-graft
campaign further.
	   ``We can not compromise our anti-corruption campaign.
Prosecutors will conduct a fair and thorough investigation,'' Kim
was quoted as saying by his spokesman, Park Jie-won.
	   Kim's aides said prosecutors have enough evidence that the
then-ruling Grand National Party used government tax collectors to
raise illegal funds from businessmen to finance its presidential
campaign last December.
	   The opposition party denied the allegation and accused the
president of engaging in political revenge.
	   Kim, a lifelong opposition leader often tortured by past
authoritarian regimes, won the December election to become South
Korea's first dissident leader to take power.
	   Also Thursday, news reports said prosecutors have been
investigating 200 politicians, government officials and others
suspected of corruption. Prosecutors refused to confirm the
reports.
	   Kim's National Congress for New Politics and its coalition
partner, United Liberal Democrats, control a combined 155 seats, or
a majority of five seats in the country's single-chamber, 299-seat
National Assembly.
	   The ruling coalition cobbled together the majority only after
luring away several opposition legislators.

Poland hopes to hold missile tests for Huzar helicopter in fall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland will hold talks with Israel about
missile tests for Huzar helicopter which it hopes will begin this
fall, the Rzeczpospolita newspaper said Thursday.
	   Defense Minister Janusz Onyszkiewicz said he received a letter
from his Israeli counterpart confirming Israel wants to go ahead
with tests for NTD missile on a Polish training ground, the daily
said.
	   In October, Poland signed an agreement with Israel that awarded
a dlrs 800 million contract the Rafael and Elbit companies to equip
the Huzar helicopter in line with NATO requirements, rejecting U.S.
defense contracting giant Boeing.
	   Under the deal, Rafael would equip the Huzar with Israeli NTD
missiles and Elbit would supply electronic integrating systems.
Both components of the deal still required approval from the two
governments.
	   The Solidarity government criticized the handling of the tenders
by its ex-communist predecessor and decided to seek a new tender
for the electronic integrating systems. No date for offering the
new tender has been set.
	   Poland can reject the agreement if the missile tests prove
unsatisfactory.
	   Poland is scheduled to join NATO next year as one of three
former Warsaw Pact countries shifting to the Western military
alliance, but must modernize some of its hardware and training.

Polish police gets on-line access to FBI database
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Polish policemen will be able to identify
cars and boats stolen in the United States with the launching
Thursday of an on-line access to FBI files.
	   An FBI gift, the first international link to the U.S. National
Crime Information Center, will allow Poles to fight international
gangs that steal luxury cars, boats and yachts in the U.S. and
smuggle them to Europe.
	   Police estimate that up to 2,000 cars stolen in America are
brought to Poland every year, according to Pawel Biedziak,
spokesman for the national police headquarters.
	   Biedziak said gangs often reinvest their profits from car sales
in other criminal activities, like drug production and trafficking.
	   Poland's Interior Minister Janusz Tomaszewski and U.S.
Ambassador Daniel Fried, along with top Polish policemen witnessed
the presentation of the system by FBI experts.
	   The system links Poland's national police headquarters will NCIC
through an Interpol network. New connections to all Poland's
provincial police headquarters are planned.

O'Neill breaks gold medal record
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ To become the greatest swimmer in
Commonwealth Games history, Susie O'Neill had to forget all about
it.
	   Ever since she decided to tackle eight events in Kuala Lumpur,
O'Neill has been quizzed relentlessly about Mike Wenden's record of
nine gold medals at the Commonwealth Games, which is believed to be
the best by any athlete at the games.
	   But as O'Neill collected five golds and two silvers from the
first seven events, the talk of Wenden was obviously grating on
her. One more from her best event would lift her to double figures,
including one gold in 1990 and three in 1994.
	   After the heats of her favorite 200-meter butterfly event,
O'Neill told reporters she tried to go slower than she managed, to
get an outside lane.
	   Perhaps after all those events, she just wanted to be closer to
the edge of the pool when it finished.
	   ``I'm glad it's over. It was probably the best feeling in my
life when I finished it,'' O'Neill said after the race.
	   If O'Neill was trying to psyche out her main rival, Australian
compatriot Petria Thomas, then the ploy worked.
	   Wenden, who operates a swim center in Brisbane, Australia, told
reporters he was delighted to see O'Neill break his record after 24
years.
	   ``If you are going to break a record, what a way to do it,''
Wenden said.
	   ``Susie's swim was technically beautiful. It was a glorious swim
and she had a marvellous sense of pace.''
	   O'Neill seldom shows much emotion after her events, but Thursday
she paddled for a half lap of honor to see some friends in the
stands.
	   ``I've got about 14 friends here to watch me tonight so I
thought I'd better head up the pool and see them,'' she said.
	   Australian coach Don Talbot described O'Neill as ``one of the
greatest Australian sportspeople of all time.''
	   ``Susie's got to be right up there. She's an Olympic champion,
she's defended Commonwealth titles and she's got the longevity that
you need if you want to be thought of in that sort of light,''
Talbot said.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan's new prime minister urged Israel
Thursday to withdraw from Syrian and Lebanese territories to pave
the way for a regional settlement.
	   Fayez Tarawneh's remarks to the 80-member Chamber of Deputies
came in a one-hour speech outlining his policy prior to a
parliamentary vote of confidence.
	   The 23-member Cabinet, appointed by King Hussein last month, is
expected to receive a majority vote in the Chamber of Deputies,
which is dominated by pro-government politicians.
	   The vote will follow a three-day debate beginning Tuesday.
	   Jordan supports the Palestinians until ``they establish their
independent state on their national soil,'' Tarawneh told
Parliament, which interrupted its summer recess to hear his policy
speech.

Love of basketball drew young player from Africa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KAREN RUSSO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ A little more than a year ago, Modibo Diarra said
goodbye to his family and home in Africa to play basketball in the
United States.
	   Diarra, one of 14 children, had to walk from his native Mali to
neighboring Guinea to catch a flight to the United States. He lost
one friend to malaria along the way.
	   The 6-foot-10 (208-centimeter), 228-pound (103-kilo) forward is
now a top college recruit as he enters his junior year at a
Fitchburg boarding school in the northeastern state of
Massachusetts.
	   Diarra, who turned 18 on Wednesday, had only played basketball
for 2 1/2 half years _ including a stint with the Junior National
team in the French-speaking West African nation _ before arriving
at Notre Dame Prep school last October. He was 30 pounds (13.5
kilos) lighter and owned little more than a small bag of clothing.
	   Diarra said in an interview Wednesday he finds the competition
more intense here, in part because many of his classmates in Africa
dream of playing the World Cup game, notably less rigorous then
that of the National Basketball Association.
	   Notre Dame Coach John Kelly, who is also Diarra's legal
guardian, said the young man was an aggressive basketall player
when he arrived at the school, but lacked many skills.
	   ``Over the past summer he's improved a great deal,'' he said.
``The sky's the limit for him it looks like, if he continues to
work the way he is both on and off the court.''
	   Diarra has not returned to Africa to visit home for fear he
would not be allowed to leave again.
	   He said that he misses his family, including his six brothers
and seven sisters, and he speaks with them every few weeks on the
phone. However, his family still has a chance to see him play
because his coach sends them videotapes of his games.
	   ``I miss everybody, my friends, my parents, my family,
everybody,'' he said.
	   Scott Spinelli, an assistant basketball coach at American
University in Washington, discovered Diarra while on a recruiting
trip in western Africa last year.
	   Spinelli told Kelly about the young player and Kelly asked how
he could get him to come to Notre Dame.
	   ``For the little schools every assistant coach is trying to
discover a hidden jewel, and sometimes it takes you to remote
places,'' Spinelli said. ``It ends up being persistence and luck.''
	   But getting Diarra out of Mali proved difficult, Kelly said,
because his embassy would not issue him an exit visa. Kelly said
officials there are afraid citizens will leave permanently.
	   He said Modibo and two friends walked 60 miles (100 kilometers)
to Guinea, where they stayed with an acquaintance for two months
while waiting for a visa. It was in Guinea, where the boys went for
up to five days at a time without food, that one of Modibo's
friends became sick and eventually died.
	   Diarra, who lives in the school dormitories, takes tutoring in
English. Kelly said Diarra's language skills have improved
dramatically.
	   In the off-season, Diarra plays in basketball tournaments, runs
and lifts weights. He said he still plays soccer with his friends
and has dabbled in boxing.
	   But he will be modeling his career after NBA star Hakeem
Olajuwon, a Nigerian native who plays center for the Houston
Rockets, not Mohammed Ali.
	   ``I want to be good,'' Diarra said.
	   Kelly said Diarra is being courted by the University of Kentucky
and American University, among others.
	   ``He could go to most schools if he'd like to,'' he said.
``People are just starting to see him and realize who he is. He's
definitely one of the top juniors in the country.''

Real Madrid takes on FC Barcelona in early showdown

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A buoyant Real Madrid takes on struggling
league champion FC Barcelona Saturday in the biggest showdown yet
this season in the Spanish premier division.
	   Real Madrid shares first place with upstart Zaragoza, both
having won their first two games, and comes off a solid 2-0 victory
Wednesday night in Seville against Inter de Milan in a Champions
League Group C opener.
	   Barcelona has failed to shine so far in league play, tying
Racing de Santander 0-0 and eking out a disappointing 1-0 win over
lowly Extremadura.
	   The Catalan titans did, however, salvage a 3-3 tie Wednesday
night at Old Trafford against Manchester United after falling
behind 2-0 in their Champions League Group D game.
	   And Barcelona goalkeeper Ruud Hesp takes heart from that
performance, even though he allowed three goals.
	   ``This tie is very good when you think about the game with
Madrid, because we showed we can play well. If we play as well as
we did in the second half, we can win in Bernabeu.''
	   He was referring to Madrid's cavernous Santiago Bernabeu
Stadium. Normally, crowds seeking tickets to games between the two
arch-rivals sleep outside the arena to get a good place in line for
the best show in town.
	   Not this time, though, in part because many Real Madrid fans
traveled to Seville for the Inter Milan game.
	   Still, officials are doing all they can to keep the peace
between rival fans in Saturday's lone match. The government has
told Real Madrid that the number of Madrid supporters who watch the
game from the standing-room area must be cut from 15,000 to 8,250.
	   Spanish newspapers said a record 1,200 police will be on hand to
provide security.
	   Elsewhere on Sunday, Atletico de Madrid takes on Espanyol
without its star Yugoslav Vladimir Jugovic, who was injured Tuesday
when the Madrid club beat Obilic of Yugoslavia 2-0 in a UEFA Cup
match. Brazilian ace Juninho is doubtful for the game because of a
leg injury.
	   Zaragoza travels to Vitoria to meet newly promoted Alaves, who
lost against Oviedo in the second week of the season.
	   Zaragoza has emerged as a serious contender after convincing
wins against Betis and Athletic de Bilbao. It has a chance to take
sole possession of first place if Real Madrid loses to Barcelona or
draws.
	   Mallorca, which easily beat Espanyol 2-1 Sunday night, also has
rejoined the fight this year. It finished in a respectable 5th
place last season, and will travel north Sunday to face
middle-ranking Real Sociedad.
	   In other games Sunday, Oviedo faces Tenerife, Celta takes on
Valladolid, Racing plays Betis, Extremadura takes on Athletic de
Bilbao, Valencia plays Villreal and Salamanca takes on Deportivo.

Defense chief says scandal-related documents moved before raid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The head of Japan's Defense Agency acknowledged
Thursday that defense officials hid documents that may be key
evidence in an investigation of alleged overpayment for military
equipment.
	   Fukushiro Nukaga told a parliamentary panel that some officials
took the documents home or moved them to another storage area
shortly before investigators raided the agency headquarters earlier
this month, an agency spokesman said.
	   It was the first time a defense official acknowledged a possible
cover-up in the scandal.
	   The scandal has resulted in the arrest of two top former Defense
Agency officials as well as nine executives and senior officials at
major electric machinery maker NEC Corp. and its affiliate, Toyo
Communication Equipment Co.
	   They are suspected of arranging a reduced reimbursement to the
Defense Agency for the purchase of military equipment, for which
Toyo had overcharged the government.
	   Prosecutors say the payoff was in exchange for jobs for the
agency officials.
	   Also Thursday, the Defense Agency acknowledged that some
documents were moved to the navy headquarters before the raid.
	   Nukaga's deputy, administrative-vice minister Masahiro Akiyama
told a news conference that the documents were moved but found in a
second raid this week, the spokesman said.
	   Akiyama did not deny the possibility the documents may have been
burned in an incinerator.
	   The central figure in the case, Kenichi Ueno, the former deputy
director of procurement at the agency, was arrested Sept. 3 on
suspicion of conspiring with others to reduce Toyo's reimbursement
to the government by nearly 1.7 billion yen (dlrs 12.8 million).
	   Nukaga, the defense chief, is scheduled to answer questions from
opposition lawmakers on the scandal during Friday's parliamentary
session.

O'Neill wins record 10th gold, Hackett wins 1,500m
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with finals &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australia's Susie O'Neill became
the greatest gold medal winner in Commonwealth Games swimming
history Thursday, doing it in style with the second fastest women's
200-meter butterfly race of all time.
	   O'Neill, the Olympic and world champion in the event, blew away
compatriot Petria Thomas to claim her 10th gold medal in her third
Commonwealth Games.
	   World 1,500-meter champion Grant Hackett inflicted the first
international defeat on dual Olympic champion Kieren Perkins in
eight years. Hackett recorded his best time of 14 minutes, 50.92
seconds, and was forced to go alone for most of the race.
	   South African Ryk Neethling held off a late surge by Perkins to
claim the silver while Perkins finished with bronze. Hackett was
the only swimmer to break 15 minutes.
	   England's Sue Rolph finished with a freestyle sprint double,
countrywoman Katy Sexton won a surprise 200-meter backstroke gold,
Australian Matthew Dunn won the 200-meter medley and Australia
claimed the men's 4x100-meter medley relay on the last night of
pool competition.
	   Australia finished with 23 golds, two off its record from 1994,
while England had four and Canada three.
	   O'Neill's gold tally surpassed fellow Australian Mike Wenden's
total of nine and equaled Canadian Graham Smith's record total for
a single games of six in 1978.
	   O'Neill's 2:06.60 crushed her own Commonwealth record of
2:07.29, which she set in 1995, and was second only to United
States swimmer Mary T. Meagher's 1981 mark of 2:05.96 _ the oldest
swimming record.
	   She finished the competition with six golds and two silver
medals.
	   ``During the day I was thinking about the 10 gold medals and my
coach had a big talk to me and made me get it out of my mind and
focus on the job at hand, and that really helped tonight,'' O'Neill
said. ``He made me realize it's the 200 fly I'm here to swim, not
the 10 gold medals. I'm glad it's over. It was probably the best
feeling in my life when I finished it.''
	   O'Neill's 10 golds are believed to be the greatest haul by any
athlete in any games sport, but the Commonwealth Games Federation
is unable to confirm this because of poor record keeping.
	   Thomas has not beaten O'Neill in the 200 since 1993, and won
silver medals behind her at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and January's
world championships.
	   Perkins was swimming here as part of his campaign to win a third
consecutive 1,500-meter gold medal at the Sydney Olympics in 2000.
It was his first major race since winning the event from lane eight
at the 1996 Olympics.
	   ``I'll put it this way _ it's not over,'' said Perkins. ``Every
time I'm racing I'm improving.''
	   Hackett was pleased to topple his famous compatriot.
	   ``To be the first to do that in eight years is fantastic,''
Hackett said. ``But his world record (14:41.66) is still out there.
To be honest, I want to get down to 14:40 in the next six to 12
months.''
	   Australia's Matthew Dunn gave Australia the first gold Thursday
when he swam a Commonwealth record-breaking time to take the
200-meter individual medley.
	   Dunn clocked 2:00.26, breaking the record of 2:01.13 set by
Canada's Atlanta Olympic medalist Curtis Myden. Myden missed the
meet because of study commitments.
	   England's 200-meter butterfly gold medalist James Hickman led
Dunn through the fly and backstroke legs but the Australian hit the
front halfway through the breaststroke. He turned with a winning
margin and powered home on the freestyle.
	   Hickman finished second in 2:01.87, with Robert Van Der Zant
taking bronze in 2:02.73.
	   ``Everything went perfect: my warm-up went perfect, my swimming
went perfect, even my lunch went perfect,'' said Dunn.
	   England's Sue Rolph dug deep to win her second gold of the meet
in the 50-meter freestyle, but wasn't satisfied.
	   ``I'm not that happy with that. It was pretty slow really,''
said Rolph, who touched in 25.82 seconds, ahead of Scottish rival
Alison Sheppard (25.92) and New Zealand's Toni Jeffs (26.07).
	   ``It's been a long six days and I think my batteries have gone a
bit low.''
	   Sexton, 16, came from nowhere to pip Australian Meredith Smith
and English favorite Helen Don Duncan.
	   While the Smith and Don Duncan exchanged the lead with every
turn, Sexton stayed in contention and beat Smith by 0.01 seconds on
the final stroke, leaving Don Duncan with bronze.

Unemployment rate marches upward to 5 percent

 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS spelling of government economist from 'Kwon-yiu' to
'Kwong-yiu' in 8th graf bgng: 'Although there ...' &QL; 
 &UR; By MARCOS CALO MEDINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong announced Thursday that its
unemployment rate climbed to a 15-year high of about 5 percent in
the three-month period ending Aug. 31.
	   A slowdown in retail and the restaurant and construction trades
accounted for most of the job losses, officials said. The entry of
new graduates in the labor market also aggravated the problem.
	   The 5 percent jobless rate, up from 4.8 percent for the three
months through July, was the worst since it hit 5.2 percent in
1983.
	   Analysts said the problem is unlikely to be solved as the
14-month financial turmoil in Asia shows no signs of abating. But
the figure was lower than the expected 5.2 percent.
	   ``The overall trend is that things will deteriorate even
further,'' said Anthony Chan of HSBC Securities Asia in Hong Kong.
Chan said the unemployment rate may reach 7 percent by May next
year.
	   ``As Hong Kong is still in the midst of difficult economic
adjustment ... high unemployment will inevitably remain with us for
some time,'' Joseph Wong, secretary for education and manpower,
said in a statement.
	   Although Wong later told a news conference the increase in
unemployment has been slowing down, he refused to say whether that
meant better times ahead.
	   ``Although there is stabilization in the unemployment rate, it
is too early to draw any conclusions,'' government economist Tang
Kwong-yiu said.
	   Hong Kong's once-robust economy shrank 5 percent in the second
quarter, and is expected to shrink 4 percent in 1998.
	   High interest rates _ the government's main tactic in defending
the territory's currency link to the U.S. dollar _ is stifling the
property sector, responsible for one in 10 jobs here.
	   About 175,000 of the 3.3 million work force are unemployed,
according to government figures.
	   The latest figure came as more companies announce massive
layoffs.
	   On Wednesday, two investment banks, Nikko Securities and Warburg
Dillon Read, said they were cutting almost 100 jobs.
	   Late Thursday, Hong Kong Telecommunications said it will impose
10 percent pay-cuts on all its employees beginning Nov. 1, Dow
Jones Newswires reported.
	   ``I think we haven't seen the worse yet,'' said T.S. Chow, an
executive at the quasi-government Employment Retraining Program.
	   On Thursday, dozens of people were flipping through job notices
on boards at a government employment service office.
	   Men and women, from their 20s to 60s, wrote down contact numbers
for jobs offering as low as 5,000 Hong Kong dollars a month (U.S.
dlrs 645) _ much lower than the median income of 9,000 Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 1,154) before the Asian financial crisis hit.
	   ``The unemployment problem in Hong Kong is too serious,'' said
Chiu Hok-men, a 25-year-old former shipping clerk who has been out
of work for a year.
	   ``The government should do more,'' he said while checking out
job postings.
	   Union leaders criticized the government as not doing enough.
	   ``The tax dollar has been spent. But where are the new jobs?''
asked activist Leung Kwok-hung.
	   Officials have pledged to create 110,000 new jobs by
accelerating infrastructure projects, but the government appears to
have run out of ideas.
	   On Tuesday, the government approved the U.S. dlr 8.2 billion
West Rail project, expected to create 13,000 jobs in the next few
years.
	   The government has also approved a program to train the
unemployed as maids and a volunteer program for recent graduates
who cannot find jobs.

Angolan gov't threatens military action against former rebel group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Angola's army is ready to act soon to
dislodge the former rebel group UNITA from central highland
strongholds it has refused to surrender under a 1994 peace pact, a
government official said.
	   UNITA will be ousted from the last four towns it holds ``as soon
as possible, one way or another,'' Higino Carneiro, the Deputy
Minister for Territorial Administration, told reporters late
Wednesday.
	   ``We can do it peacefully or with violence,'' Carneiro said
after a meeting with United Nations envoy Issa Diallo.
	   UNITA has relinquished control of most of the 50 percent of the
southwest African country it controlled during the two-decade civil
war with the government which was halted by the U.N.-mediated peace
accord.
	   However, UNITA has accused the government of human rights abuses
against its supporters in areas already relinquished and wants to
negotiate special conditions for handing over the four so-called
``sensitive areas'' located several hundred kilometers (miles)
southeast of the capital.
	   The U.N. has imposed sanctions on UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym
for the National Union of the Total Independence of Angola _ for
its failure to comply with the peace accord.
	   The governing MPLA has expelled UNITA officials from the
government of national unity and reconciliation and has said it
will no longer negotiate with UNITA chief Jonas Savimbi.
	   Diallo said the peace process, which has been on hold since May
because of the continuing hostility between the former foes, would
not make progress unless the two sides displayed the ``political
will to make peace work.''
	   The Security Council on Tuesday extended the U.N. mandate until
Oct. 15.
	   ``If there is political will, the 30 days will be plenty. If
there isn't, not even 30 years will suffice,'' Diallo said.

Sudan calls on Ugandan troops to withdraw from southern Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ President Omar el-Bashir called on
Ugandan forces, which Khartoum claims are helping Sudanese rebels,
to withdraw from southern Sudan, the official Sudan News Agency
Thursday.
	   It also quoted a top government official in southern Sudan as
saying that Tuesday's Ugandan-led attack in the south was a
violation of non-aggression agreements between Sudan and Uganda.
	   ``This rebel-backed Ugandan aggression... a step back by Uganda
from its previous... commitments,'' said Riak Machar, head of the
government's Southern States Coordination Council.
	   The Sudanese army said Tuesday that its troops had repulsed a
Ugandan-led assault in the towns of Liria, Torit and Jabalain in
the Eastern Equatoria province, which borders Uganda. It said that
its troops killed more than 50 Ugandan government troops and
Sudanese rebels.
	   However, a government-run Ugandan newspaper quoted a spokesman
for the rebel group, Sudan Peoples Liberation Army rebel, as saying
its forces killed 40 Ugandan rebels in Tuesday's clashes.
	   Kampala and Khartoum accuse each other of supporting the other's
rebels.
	   Southern Sudanese rebels are believed to receive support from
Ethiopia and Eritrea, as well as Uganda.
	   Machar, who also serves as the government's envoy for talks with
Uganda, said that Ugandan President Yuweri Museveni had agreed to
the basics of a non-aggression agreement, which has yet to be
signed.
	   Machar said that the Ugandan assault was prompted by the United
States as ``a warning to its allies who neighbor Sudan'' not to
normalize relations with Khartoum, the independent daily, Akhbar
Al-Youm said Thursday.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Low-lying areas across Belgium
struggled through a fourth day of rain, floods and evacuations
Thursday.
	   The Belgian meteorological service declared days of record
rainfall a ``disaster,'' clearing the way for the government to
provide special relief for those with water knee-high in their
homes and no insurance to pay for the damage.
	   A decision is expected at Friday's meeting of Prime Minister
Jean-Luc Dehaene's cabinet.
	   On Thursday, soldiers again helped reinforce dikes or breach
others to divert water away from residential areas as rain fell
again in many parts of the country.
	   The floods have led to the evacuation of hundreds of people,
especially the old and sick, and killed at least one woman who
drowned in her car on Tuesday. On Thursday, several rivers
continued to crest at critical levels.
	   The flooding began on Sunday after a record weekend downpour.

O'Neill wins record 10th gold, Hackett wins 1,500m
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS England, Canada totals, 6th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australia's Susie O'Neill became
the greatest gold medal winner in Commonwealth Games swimming
history Thursday, doing it in style with the second fastest women's
200-meter butterfly race of all time.
	   O'Neill, the Olympic and world champion in the event, blew away
compatriot Petria Thomas to claim her 10th gold medal in her third
Commonwealth Games.
	   World 1,500-meter champion Grant Hackett inflicted the first
international defeat on dual Olympic champion Kieren Perkins in
eight years. Hackett recorded his best time of 14 minutes, 50.92
seconds, and was forced to go alone for most of the race.
	   South African Ryk Neethling held off a late surge by Perkins to
claim the silver while Perkins finished with bronze. Hackett was
the only swimmer to break 15 minutes.
	   England's Sue Rolph finished with a freestyle sprint double,
countrywoman Katy Sexton won a surprise 200-meter backstroke gold,
Australian Matthew Dunn won the 200-meter medley and Australia
claimed the men's 4x100-meter medley relay on the last night of
pool competition.
	   Australia finished with 23 golds, two off its record from 1994,
while England had five and Canada four.
	   O'Neill's gold tally surpassed fellow Australian Mike Wenden's
total of nine and equaled Canadian Graham Smith's record total for
a single games of six in 1978.
	   O'Neill's 2:06.60 crushed her own Commonwealth record of
2:07.29, which she set in 1995, and was second only to United
States swimmer Mary T. Meagher's 1981 mark of 2:05.96 _ the oldest
swimming record.
	   She finished the competition with six golds and two silver
medals.
	   ``During the day I was thinking about the 10 gold medals and my
coach had a big talk to me and made me get it out of my mind and
focus on the job at hand, and that really helped tonight,'' O'Neill
said. ``He made me realize it's the 200 fly I'm here to swim, not
the 10 gold medals. I'm glad it's over. It was probably the best
feeling in my life when I finished it.''
	   O'Neill's 10 golds are believed to be the greatest haul by any
athlete in any games sport, but the Commonwealth Games Federation
is unable to confirm this because of poor record keeping.
	   Thomas has not beaten O'Neill in the 200 since 1993, and won
silver medals behind her at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and January's
world championships.
	   Perkins was swimming here as part of his campaign to win a third
consecutive 1,500-meter gold medal at the Sydney Olympics in 2000.
It was his first major race since winning the event from lane eight
at the 1996 Olympics.
	   ``I'll put it this way _ it's not over,'' said Perkins. ``Every
time I'm racing I'm improving.''
	   Hackett was pleased to topple his famous compatriot.
	   ``To be the first to do that in eight years is fantastic,''
Hackett said. ``But his world record (14:41.66) is still out there.
To be honest, I want to get down to 14:40 in the next six to 12
months.''
	   Australia's Matthew Dunn gave Australia the first gold Thursday
when he swam a Commonwealth record-breaking time to take the
200-meter individual medley.
	   Dunn clocked 2:00.26, breaking the record of 2:01.13 set by
Canada's Atlanta Olympic medalist Curtis Myden. Myden missed the
meet because of study commitments.
	   England's 200-meter butterfly gold medalist James Hickman led
Dunn through the fly and backstroke legs but the Australian hit the
front halfway through the breaststroke. He turned with a winning
margin and powered home on the freestyle.
	   Hickman finished second in 2:01.87, with Robert Van Der Zant
taking bronze in 2:02.73.
	   ``Everything went perfect: my warm-up went perfect, my swimming
went perfect, even my lunch went perfect,'' said Dunn.
	   England's Sue Rolph dug deep to win her second gold of the meet
in the 50-meter freestyle, but wasn't satisfied.
	   ``I'm not that happy with that. It was pretty slow really,''
said Rolph, who touched in 25.82 seconds, ahead of Scottish rival
Alison Sheppard (25.92) and New Zealand's Toni Jeffs (26.07).
	   ``It's been a long six days and I think my batteries have gone a
bit low.''
	   Sexton, 16, came from nowhere to pip Australian Meredith Smith
and English favorite Helen Don Duncan.
	   While the Smith and Don Duncan exchanged the lead with every
turn, Sexton stayed in contention and beat Smith by 0.01 seconds on
the final stroke, leaving Don Duncan with bronze.

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Former President Sali Berisha called
Thursday for a nationwide protest against the Albanian government
and lawmakers opened deliberations on whether to clear the way for
his arrest.
	   Staying defiant even as a political noose appeared to be
tightening around him, Berisha assailed Prime Minister Fatos Nano
as ``the champion of corruption in Europe'' and led another
opposition protest rally in the capital.
	   At least 2,000 of Berisha's Democratic Party supporters gathered
downtown to denounce the government. Others were prevented from
joining it by police roadblocks at key intersections, purportedly
intended to check weapons.
	   Berisha has demanded that Nano resign in favor of a ``technical
government'' to arrange new elections. The crisis has raised fears
of unrest reminiscent of the months of anarchy that struck Albania
last year after the collapse of shady pyramid schemes that cost
many people their entire savings.
	   Western powers fear that the violent confrontation between
Berisha and Nano that has erupted in the past week could worsen if
Berisha is arrested on charges of seeking to overthrow the
government. They are desperate to prevent the Albanian unrest from
influencing other crises in the region, especially in the
neighboring Kosovo province of Yugoslavia, where Serb forces are
fighting ethnic Albanian separatists.
	   As a parliamentary committee convened Thursday afternoon to
consider whether to lift Berisha's immunity from arrest. A source
close to the proceedings, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
there was pressure from international officials to come up with a
lesser charge against Berisha to avoid further instability.
	   Five other Democratic Party members of Parliament also were
faced with having their immunity lifted along with Berisha. If the
committee lifts immunity, Parliament could order them jailed.
	   Prosecutor Arben Rakipi was presenting his case to lawmakers. It
was unclear when a decision would be made or what it would be.
	   Meanwhile, new unrest was reported in northern Albania, where
Berisha has strong support.
	   Police said a gang of about 80 people armed with grenades and
automatic rifles attacked a bank and police station late Wednesday
night in Lezha, 55 kilometers (35 miles) north of Tirana, the
capital. Three of the attackers died in gunbattles with police and
several were wounded, according to Artan Bizhga, the Interior
Ministry spokesman.
	   The identities of the attackers was unknown, but Bizhga said
some were believed to have come from other towns in the area. An
explosion in Lezha two weeks ago damaged the office of Nano's
Socialist Party.
	   In rioting Sunday and Monday, Berisha's supporters damaged the
parliament and prime minister's office, briefly took over the state
television station, burned cars and looted some shops.
	   On Thursday, he called for nationwide protests on Friday, saying
they would be peaceful. Speaking at a news conference before the
rally, he called Nano ``the most dangerous leader, staying in power
only by arresting, by murdering, by executing ... the opposition.''
	   He accused Nano's secret police of cutting off access in Albania
to independent media, forcing people to rely on state media which
he claims is sending out false, biased information. He said
Albanians must listen to foreign or independent media in order to
understand what's going on.
	   ``Fatos Nano is keeping the Albanians in darkness,'' he said,
accusing him of being ``a high prosecutor in the old years of
Albania.''
	   The second major crisis in Albania in 18 months began after the
slaying Saturday of popular politician Azem Hajdari, a close aide
to Berisha, who immediately blamed Nano.
	   Demonstrations degenerated into rioting that lasted two days and
left three people dead and scores injured.
	   Berisha has been seeking to return to power, tapping not only
outrage over Hajdari's killing but also widespread disappointment
with the government's inability to revive the economy and restore
confidence in Albania's future.

	   ONNELEY, England (AP) _ Animal-rights activists hacked open
cages and freed almost 8,000 minks at a breeding farm early
Thursday, marking the second such attack in Britain in as many
months.
	   Police issued an alert after the animals, bred for their pelts,
were freed just before 6 a.m. (0500 GMT) from the farm in Onneley,
Staffordshire, 250 miles (400 kms) northwest of London.
	   Sky TV reported that the Animal Liberation Front, a shadowy,
extremist group linked to past acts of violence, had claimed
responsibility.
	   At the Onneley farm, 3,500 cages were hacked open, possibly with
bolt-cutters, said owner Len Kelsall.
	   Nearly all the animals on the property were freed, but most
stayed contained on the farm compound. Police said 2,000 had
escaped into the neighboring countryside.
	   ``This is not animal rights, this is animal cruelty,'' said
Kelsall, 60, standing beside a shopping cart full of mink carcasses
recovered from roads and fields.
	   ``... Dead mink run over, fighting, being shot _ it is
absolutely horrendous,'' added Kelsall, who supplies the Russian
fur market.
	   Police warned local residents to keep doors and windows closed
because the minks will attack pets, and told motorists to avoid the
area.
	   Press Association, the British news agency, reported sounds of
shots _ apparently neighboring farmers shooting at the minks which
destroy crops and attack other animals.
	   In August, supporters of the Animal Liberation Front smashed
cages and cut wire at a fur farm near Ringwood, 100 miles (160 kms)
southwest of London, freeing 2,000 minks.
	   Similarly, thousands of minks were set free from a farm near
Helsinki, Finland, Sept. 9. Many of them were hit by cars or killed
each other, authorities said.

denying they are holding back results because of who is winning. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ International officials in
charge of Bosnia's elections denied Thursday that they are holding
back vote results because extremists won, saying the count remains
inconclusive.
	   Nicole Szulc, spokeswoman for the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, which supervised last weekend's nationwide
elections, declined to comment on who is leading in races deemed
crucial to rebuilding Bosnia after its 3 1/2-year war.
	   ``We are not going to make judgments based on 60 percent, or 40
percent of counted ballots. The only results that will matter are
the final results,'' she said.
	   Robert Barry, head of the OSCE in Bosnia, said results probably
will be announced next week on Wednesday or Thursday.
	   A strong showing by extremists would be an embarrassing setback
to international efforts to build a stable, multi-ethnic state in
Bosnia-Herzegovina.
	   It could also raise doubts about the effectiveness of the
international effort that has sought to rebuild Bosnia since the
1995 Dayton peace accords.
	   The most closely watched contest, the re-election bid of Bosnian
Serb President Biljana Plavsic _ a moderate backed by the West _
has generated conflicting claims about whether she won or lost.
	   Hundreds of Radical Party supporters gathered in Pale and other
towns in the Serb half of Bosnia on Wednesday night to celebrate
what they said was Plavsic's defeat by extremist Nikola Poplasen.
	   Szulc dismissed the victory reports, saying the ballot counting
is complicated and 200,000 ballots have not been opened yet.
	   Two extremist parties accused the OSCE of delaying the planned
release of preliminary results because of the strong showing of the
hard-liners.
	   ``The results are known but OSCE is silent,'' the Bosnian Serb
Radical Party and Serb Democratic Party said in a statement carried
by the Bosnian Serb SRNA news agency on Wednesday.
	   In Sarajevo, state radio said Wednesday night it will not
broadcast any purported results given by the competing parties and
said the conflicting claims, if added together, would reflect 118
percent of voters casting ballots.
	   Meanwhile, there is a possibility the OSCE may disqualify top
vote-winning nationalists who violated election rules.
	   The group is to meet Friday to decide whether to punish the
Radicals for broadcasting an interview with their leader, Vojislav
Seselj, during a pre-election blackout.
	   The strongest punishment would be disqualifying Poplasen. The
party has suggested that such a decision might trigger civil
unrest.
	   Plavsic's party indicated that it might request the elections be
declared void because of serious violations by the Radicals, the
Sarajevo daily Oslobodjenje reported. It claimed the Seselj
broadcast caused many people to vote for extremists.
	   Poplasen and Momcilo Krajisnik, a candidate for the joint
Bosnian presidency, are supporters of war crimes suspect Radovan
Karadzic. They are against the Dayton peace accord that envisaged a
unified Bosnia.
	   Analysts believe nationalist sentiment among Bosnian Serbs has
been rekindled because of clashes in the Serbian province of Kosovo
against largely Muslim ethnic Albanians. Western pressure on
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic over that situation has also
worked against Plavsic, they said.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The Industrial Development
Corp. and McDonald's South Africa on Thursday signed an agreement
for the IDC to loan 30 million rand (dlrs 4.9 million) to
prospective franchisers.
	   The fund will be used over the next 10 months to open 25 more
restaurants, including 20 to be operated by black entrepreneurs.
	   IDC chief executive officer Khaya Ngqula said the investment was
part of his organization's strategy to help bring more black people
into the formal economy.
	   McDonald's SA operates 46 outlets and employs 3,500 people.
	   --
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Police suspect their colleagues were
involved in the largest cash and gem robbery in Kenya, a newspaper
said Thursday.
	   ``It can be assumed that policemen were involved in the raid,''
Noah arap Too, director of the criminal investigations department,
was quoted as saying in the Daily Nation.
	   Witnesses said gunmen in police uniform and using a police car
raided a cargo service strongroom at Jomo Kenyatta International
Airport on Monday and seized 111 million Kenyan shillings (dlrs 1.9
million), and two boxes of gemstones weighing 44 kilograms (20
pounds).
	   The stolen money belonged to Barclays Bank and was on the way to
the Republic National Bank of New York, in Singapore. The gems
belonged to a Nairobi company and were en route to India.
	   Too said police have arrested nine suspects.
	   --
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ Women _ not even government ministers _
will be allowed to bare their knees by wearing short skirts in the
Lusaka parliament, Deputy House Speaker Simon Mwila ruled.
	   He threw Finance Minister Edith Nawakwi out of the legislature
for attending debate in a dress with the hem just above the knee.
	   ``May the honourable minister of finance go home and come back
when she is dressed properly,'' Mwila said a few minutes after the
start of Wednesday's session.
	   Nawakwi, known as a feminist, angrily left and didn't return to
the debate.
	   In April, Health Minister Nkandu Luo was also sent out of the
Lusaka parliament for wearing a short skirt. She argued afterward
the dress code discriminated against women.
	   Women legislators accuse their male colleagues of resisting
change in Africa's traditionally male-dominated society.

	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) _ Liberian refugees living in Ghana will lose
their protected status after December 31 and most will have to
leave the country, the government announced Thursday
	   Refugees without specific permission to stay could be forcibly
repatriated, State Refugee Board Chairman Ebenezer Blavo said at a
news conference. About 14,000 are believed to remain in Ghana.
	   The decision to revoke the refugee status was done because of
the poor response to a voluntary repatriation program _ including
free food, passage and token financial assistance _ that began late
last year, the chairman said. With the civil war over in Liberia,
he said the refugees were free to return home.
	   Refugees with ``genuine fears,'' about their safety could apply
to stay in Ghana, Blavo said.
	   Nigerian-led West African peacekeepers helped end Liberia's
bloody seven-year civil war, in which more than 150,000 people died
before fighting stopped in 1996.
	   Nearly a half-million Liberians fled their country during the
war to surrounding countries.
	   --
	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) _ Ghana's crippling energy crisis appears to
have eased, with most of the country getting power whenever they
need it, a spokesman for the country's electricity company
announced.
	   Much of Ghana has been left in the dark for long periods over
the past year because the country was unable to produce enough
power.
	   But there are only a few areas left where power was still being
cut during peak hours, Kwamina Longdon of the Electricity Company
of Ghana announced Wednesday.
	   Longdon warned, however, that the situation could change if more
industrial users increased their consumption.
	   Ghana's electricity crisis was triggered by unusually poor
rainfall, leading to a shortfall in production at the country's
major hydro-electricity producing dam.
	   Ghana is now getting additional power, though, particularly from
neighboring Ivory Coast. Western countries have also been helping
Ghana to get new electrical plants operating.

Pilots, controllers blamed for near miss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Investigators blamed errors by pilots and air
traffic controllers for what was nearly a mid-air collision between
a Japan Airlines Boeing 747 and a business jet west of London last
year.
	   The jumbo jet, bound for Heathrow Airport with 288 people
aboard, flew less than a mile from the Gulf Stream IV in a thick
cloud above Lambourne, 50 miles (80 km) west of London, the Civil
Aviation Authority said Thursday.
	   The incident, which took place on July 3, 1997, was attributed
to failure of the Japan Airlines pilot to descend to the level
instructed by air traffic controllers, and controllers not handling
flight paths properly, according to the CAA's report.
	   The Gulf Stream jet, with five aboard and bound for Luton
Airport 40 miles (64 km) north of London, had been cleared to cross
the 747's path. The pilots of both planes took action to avoid a
collision only after onboard warning systems were triggered, the
report said.
	   The planes passed as close as two-thirds of a mile (1 km)
horizontally and 200 feet (61 meters) vertically at about 12,000
feet (3,640 meters), it said.
	   The 747's pilot failed to properly report its speed to
controllers, and controllers did not notice the 747 had stopped
descending when giving flight path instructions to the smaller jet,
the CAA said.
	   The report suggested that controllers should get occasional
training to better understand capabilities and procedures of
various aircraft.

Vickers to close tank factory, slashing 650 jobs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The engineering group Vickers PLC said Thursday it
will close a tank factory in the northern city of Leeds,
eliminating 650 jobs as it moves the production to another plant in
Newcastle.
	   Vickers said the cutbacks are necessary as it moves closer to
completing a British Army order of 386 of the Challenger 2 battle
tanks valued at dlrs 1.5 billion pounds (dlrs 2.5 billion).
	   All of those tanks will be delivered by 2001 _ and Vickers said
the work is already winding down although it hopes to obtain some
export orders, with Greece, South Africa and Qatar leading the list
of potential customers.
	   Vickers now makes tanks in both Leeds and Newcastle, but said
its decision to consolidate the business in Newcastle will
eliminate some 450 jobs in Leeds and another 200 in Newcastle.
	   Along with other previously announced job cuts, Vickers will be
reducing its workforce by 1,326 positions, or 22 percent of the
total, by the end of next year.

Official: Charter flights boost Greek tourism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Despite waves of strikes and
anti-foreigner attacks, it's been a good year for Greek tourism.
	   That was the message Thursday from the nation's development
minister, Vasso Papandreou, who announced a 10 percent increase in
charter flights to Greece from January to August compared with the
same period last year.
	   She said another 2 percent raise is expected by the end of the
year.
	   Papandreou did not provide overall figures on tourism, but the
charter flight data appears to support earlier predications of an
increase in tourist arrivals this year.
	   Greek officials had feared the nation's important tourism
industry could suffer a serious blow because of a series of strikes
at state-run Olympic Airways. Also, leftist firebombers have
attacks hundred of foreign-registered cars and others targets. The
arsonists have spared tourist-related sites, but Greek authorities
worried about the negative image abroad.
	   According to Papandreou, a program aimed at improving tourism
quality has led to a higher rate of bookings in luxury and
first-class hotels.
	   The development ministry is planning to start a 3.7 billion
drachmas (dlrs 12.8 million) campaign giving special education to
tourist sector employees such as museum guards, information office
workers and Greek tourism organization staff.

Man executed for murder of Egyptian actress
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A man convicted in the 1994 murder of
actress Wadad Hamdy was hanged in a Cairo prison Thursday, police
officials said.
	   Matta Basilious Matta, 55, kicked and screamed as he was dragged
to the hanging chamber, said the officials, speaking under
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Matta was convicted and sentenced to hang in Nov. 1997 for the
stabbing death of Hamdy, but the verdict was overturned by an
appeals court on grounds of a legal technicality. He was retried in
May and again sentenced to death.
	   Police say that Matta, who worked as a courier delivering film
scripts, entered Hamdy's apartment on the pretense of handing her a
script. He stabbed her to death and stole about 250 pounds (dlrs
73) cash and a portable tape recorder from her apartment.
	   Hamdy, who was 57, was famous for playing the roles of maid in
Egyptian films.

Bishops group rejects bill giving homosexual couples legal
</HEADLINE>
standing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Conference of Bishops of France on Thursday
rejected a bill that would give unmarried and homosexual couples
the same legal standing as man and wife, saying such a law would
make marriage a ``useless'' institution.
	   Only a relationship between a man and a woman ``can be qualified
as a couple,''the Conference's Permanent Council said.
	   A law that would provide social recognition to a homosexual
relationship would weaken the ``social image'' of marriage and
render it ``finally useless,''
	   ``Our conviction is simple,'' the bishops group said in a
statement. The law as it stands provides sufficient means to
resolve social and economic problems encountered ``by certain
people who cannot or do not want to marry.''
	   ``It is not necessary to inscribe in law a new statute on
relationships that risks to further undo the meaning of the couple
and the family,'' the statement said.
	   The bill, to be debated in the National Assembly starting Oct.
9, would among other things provide homosexual and other unmarried
couples with the same fiscal advantages as traditional married
couples.

Australia's Rogers wins 20-kilometer scratch race
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Two-time junior world champion
Michael Rogers of Canberra found an opening in the final sprint
Thursday and won the men's 20-kilometer scratch cycling race at the
Commonwealth Games.
	   Rogers was in a foursome that broke away from the rest of the
field before the halfway mark.
	   England's Shaun Wallace took the silver medal, New Zealand's
Timothy Carswell won the bronze and Canada's Brian Walton finished
fourth.
	   All four were timed in 25 minutes, 18.34 seconds in the track
race.
	   ``Certainly in the senior ranks, it's right up there with the
big ones of my career,'' the 18-year-old Rogers said of his gold
medal.
	   ``With a lap to go, I was kicking myself because I didn't have
the best positioning, but there was a tailwind down the back
straight and I used that to my advantage,'' he added.
	   ``I saw a gap underneath with three-quarters of a lap left and I
took that.''
	   The defending champion, Australian Stuart O'Grady, was unable to
ride after seriously tearing his skin when he fell in the
42-kilometer time trial Tuesday, when he won a silver medal anyway.

<TEXT>
	   SLANISTE, Macedonia (AP) - Staff Sgt. Billy Tingle's 10-man
squad of American soldiers mans a tiny outpost here on the
Macedonia-Yugoslavia border, proud their presence is maintaining
stability in a volatile region.
	   With violence ripping the southern Serbian province of Kosovo,
Albania in a state of constant turmoil and Bosnia still unsettled,
this brand new Balkan country, independent from Yugoslavia for only
six years, has real reason to fear the effects of somebody else's
problems.
	   If Macedonia has avoided getting sucked into the struggles of
the region's various ethnic peoples, it is largely thanks to the
U.N. Preventive Deployment Force of 750 troops, including 350
Americans from the 1st Infantry Division and 400 from Norway,
Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Indonesia.
	   ``Sometimes you see guys in the trees trying to sneak around the
checkpoint,'' said Lt. Col. Bryan Norman, commander of the American
battalion here, gesturing toward the border a stone's throw away.
``Occasionally we hear gunfire. There's a fair amount of
activity.''
	   Macedonia, heavily trodden by the boots of history and bitterly
contested by various empires, is sometimes referred to as the
crossroads between east and west and has only limited experience
with independence. It is squeezed by Albania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria
and Greece.
	   Petar Atanasov, spokesman for the Macedonian Ministry of
Defense, acknowledges his country has remained an island of peace
in a sea of Balkan suffering but says Macedonia fears a ``big wave
of refugees that can show up on our border and the Kosovo situation
that can spillover into our country.''
	   So far, neither has happened. Refugees fleeing the fighting in
Kosovo, where Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is trying to
put down ethnic Albanians who want independence, have not been seen
in great numbers here.
	   To the east, the Nordic battalion of 350 men, soon to be 650,
covers the territory directly on the Kosovo and Albanian borders.
While smuggling activity is higher there, refugees have not been a
large problem.
	   The U.N. force has no authority to interdict smuggling, so its
exact nature and volume is unclear. Mines were discovered along the
border, which brought a temporary halt to foot patrols.
	   Atanasov claimed smuggling from Albania through Macedonia into
Kosovo is down, but he noted ``the border is only protected from
our side. The Albanians have no organized structure on their
side.''
	   The situation in Macedonia is complex. About a quarter of the
country's population of two million are ethnic Albanians. Fears
that Albanians from Kosovo or Albania could stir up passions here
have not materialized. For the moment, ethnic Albanians appear to
have opted to press their demands through the political process and
the two main Albanian parties have joined forces for the Oct. 18
parliamentary elections.
	   To maintain stability, the U.N. is conducting about 400 patrols
along the border each week. The American battalion operates four
permanent observation posts and a fifth that they man periodically
for short periods.
	   Tingle, 26, from Newton, Mississippi, says his men meet
Macedonian army patrols on this side of the border and closely
observe the Serbs patrolling their side. His main job is looking
for unusual activity, large buildups of Yugoslav soldiers, gunfire
``even if it's just hunting.
	   ``Their sheer presence brings stability to this whole region,''
Norman said of the men from the 1st Battalion, 18th Infantry. ``The
soldiers feel that too.''
	   Sgt. Edward Swiger, 26, of Doylestown, Ohio, brought his
four-man patrol back through the wire gate of the observation post
compound, finishing a run through the nearby community of Lojane.
	   ``We're welcome there,'' he said. ``They are curious just as we
are.
	   ``Everything we do out here has a purpose - to observe, monitor
and report. It gives the town a sense of stability, knowing that we
are here.''
	   This U.N. mission, begun in 1992 at the request of President
Kiro Gligorov, was an adjunct to the original U.N. mission in
Bosnia, later becoming an independent mission.
	   Is it working?
	   ``Oh absolutely,'' said Norman, 41, from Fort Bragg, North
Carolina. ``This is a stable region. Look at the capital Skopje and
the infrastructure of the country, and compare it to others in the
region. Look at their gross national product and outside
investment. Look at just how the city looks.''

Major expansion for Jewish settlement in West Bank
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Israeli official saying privately owned
Palestinian land not being exprorpriated &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Israeli government has approved the 10-fold
expansion of a Jewish West Bank settlement where two settlers were
killed by Palestinian militants last month, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's adviser said Thursday.
	   Under the plan, 600 new apartments are to be built in the
Yitzhar settlement near the Palestinian town of Nablus, the largest
in the West Bank, said the adviser, David Bar-Illan.
	   According to Israeli peace activists monitoring settlement
construction, half of the 136 apartments in Yitzhar stand empty and
the settlement is home to only 60 families.
	   The Yediot Ahronot newspaper said the new houses are to be built
on land seized from four nearby Palestinian villages. However,
Peter Lerner, a spokesman for Israel's military government in the
West Bank, said there were no plans to expropriate private land.
	   Bar-Illan said there was a big demand for housing from new
settlers who want to move into Yitzhar.
	   However, Mossi Raz, leader of the Israeli group Peace Now,
denounced the expansion plans. ``This plan involves cruel land
confiscations and is nothing but revenge for the killings,'' he
said.
	   In August, two Yitzhar residents were killed in a drive-by
shooting by Palestinian militants. In response to the killing,
Netanyahu pledged to build new homes in the settlement.
	   ``There is no restriction to building in Yitzhar,'' Netanyahu
told the Yediot daily Thursday. ``I urge the settlers in Yitzhar to
start building because this is another response of mine to
terrorist perpetrators.''

Malaysia restricts Singapore rescue, military flights

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia said Thursday that
Singaporean military and rescue planes were banned from its air
space starting Friday, escalating the tit-for-tat diplomatic
wrangle that has engaged the neighboring Southeast Asian countries
for weeks.
	   The Defense Ministry said that case-by-case permission is needed
for Singapore's military flights that previously had blanket
approval.
	   The flights include military jets from Paya Lebar Air Base
heading across southern Malaysia for training flights over the
South China Sea, aircraft passing into Malaysian air space as they
take off from Tengah Air Base, and search-and-rescue aircraft
flying above Malaysian territory.
	   The previous arrangement, with one country's military aircraft
flying at low altitude over another without warning, was highly
unusual.
	   The change was ``just a case of a nation's asserting its
sovereignty,'' said Prasun Sengupta of the Malaysia-based Asian
Defense Journal.
	   He said Singapore military aircraft can file a flight plan and
receive permission from Malaysia within a few hours, as is standard
with other countries.
	   Defense Minister Syed Hamid told reporters, ``It is not an easy
decision. It was taken in the best interest of Malaysia.''
	   Hamid denied that the move was retaliation for the memoirs
published this week by Singapore's most powerful man, Senior
Minister Lee Kuan Yew.
	   In that book, Lee accused Malaysian leaders of the 1960s,
including Hamid's late father, of corruption and of inciting race
riots.
	   The defense minister and other Cabinet members have been
outraged by the book. They accused Lee of poisoning relations
between the two countries that were merged during 1963-65.
	   Relations between the two countries have had their ups and
downs. But in the past weeks, acrimony has been so sharp that
Singaporean athletes were booed by the Malaysian crowd during the
Commonwealth Games.
	   Malaysia withdrew from recent military exercises with Singapore,
the United States, Britain and Australia.
	   Singapore's Defense Ministry said its air force ``has
alternative arrangements to ensure that its operational
effectiveness is not compromised and that its training will not be
affected.''
	   It also said, without elaborating, that Malaysia had terminated
Thursday some bilateral defense arrangements dating to the early
1960s.
	   Singapore is a defense-conscious state that has to train its
pilots in Australia and the United States because it is so small.
	   ``I think this will be seen rather more seriously in Singapore
than in Malaysia,'' Bruce Gale of the Political and Economic Risk
Consultancy, a regional newsletter, said of the flight ban.
	   ``In Malaysia, they must just shrug their shoulders over this
one. Down in Singapore, they're more aware of how small the place
is, so maybe it suggests a real problem,'' Gale said in Singapore.

EU clears dlrs 1.6 million in aid for Honduras
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Commission approved aid
worth 1.4 million European currency units (dlrs 1.6 million)
Thursday to improve public health in Honduras.
	   The money would be used to combat malaria, cholera, dysentery
and other diseases which contribute to Honduras' high death and
infant mortality rates, the European Union's executive body said in
a statement.
	   The aid will enable Spanish and Italian humanitarian agencies to
improve water and sanitation, provide medical supplies and train
local health-care workers over a period of six to nine months.
	   The programs should benefit to more than 600,000 people, the
Commission said in a statement.

Russian journalists accuse new government of censorship
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fresh Zubakov quotes in grafs 7-8. ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Economy
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on
Thursday parried accusations of censorship that followed his order
to government officials to avoid speaking to the media until his
new Cabinet is in place.
	   ``I have been and remain a staunch proponent of the freedom of
speech and media independence,'' Primakov said, according to
Russian news agencies.
	   However, ``openness doesn't have anything in common with
attempts at biased coverage and misinterpretation of statements
made by government members,'' he added.
	   President Boris Yeltsin said on Thursday it would take an extra
week to complete formation of the new Cabinet. Meanwhile, the
Russian media have been abuzz with speculation about possible
appointments and policies, adding to the confusion surrounding the
new government's intentions.
	   Moving to squelch a wave of rumors, Primakov on Wednesday banned
officials from speaking to journalists without permission from his
chief of staff, Adm. Yuri Zubakov, a veteran of Soviet foreign
intelligence.
	   Government spokesman Andrei Korotkov said the order was only
valid for the reorganization period and said media could get all
the necessary information from press officers at the government
headquarters and various ministries.
	   Zubakov himself reiterated that the new Cabinet did not intend
to keep information from the press.
	   ``But we will try to act so that only objective and trustworthy
information reaches the press,'' Zubakov was quoted as saying by
the Interfax news agency.
	   Some journalists, however, have assailed the move as an attempt
to return to Soviet-era control of the media. They accused Primakov
of trying to introduce the same secretiveness that surrounded
Russia's spy agency, which he headed in 1991-1995.
	   ``The introduction of such practices would turn the government
into a secret service and only feed rumors instead of trustworthy
information,'' Alexei Venediktov, the head of the popular Echo
Moscow radio station, said, according to the business daily
Kommersant.
	   ``It's a very dangerous signal. We may go to court to appeal
that,'' he said.
	   Some said Primakov's order signaled the government's weakness.
	   ``By saying that, he openly admits that his candidates aren't
smart enough and relish speculation about their possible
appointments,'' said Vladislav Borodulin, the editor of the
Kommersant Vlast (Power) weekly.
	   Others believe it's too early to panic. ``Unconfirmed
information and rumors generously spread by officials have only
added to public nervousness,'' said Oleg Dobrodeyev, head of the
NTV television network. ``Primakov's intention to set up a single
structure is understandable.''

 &UR; Yeltsin orders security steps before October protest &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details on interior troops in new grafs 6-8. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday ordered
stepped-up security in anticipation of nationwide mass protests
next month and approved plans to set up fast-reaction police units.
	   Yeltsin met with Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin and signed
an order on security preparations for a nationwide protest that
trade unions have organized for Oct. 7 together with Communists and
other hardliners. Labor groups have held an annual protest day in
October in recent years.
	   Stepashin told reporters the steps were intended to prevent mass
disturbances in view of the current economic crisis. He said the
orders specifically ban blockades of railways and roads and any
protests in military units.
	   There was a wave of scattered protests earlier this year by
workers protesting unpaid wages, including blockades of the
Trans-Siberian railway and other routes.
	   Yeltsin also ordered Stepashin to create additional mobile
police squads. At the same time he issued a directive to cut the
number of Interior Ministry troops by 54,000 by next year in an
apparent money-saving measure.
	   Interior troops, which now have about 250,000 men, are supposed
to help police enforce public order and intervene in case of mass
riots and other disturbances.
	   Their number will be cut to 120,000 by the year 2001 and they
will be turned into all-volunteer force instead of current
conscription, Stepashin said, according to the Interfax.
	   As a first step, the Dzerzhinsky division of interior troops,
the largest and best-equipped force in the Russian capital, will be
reformed to consist of officers only, he said.
	   Also on Thursday, Yeltsin met with Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev and promised to pay off wage arrears to the military by
the end of the month, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said,
according to Russian news agencies.
	   The government has issued similar pledges for years, but failed
to solve wage debts to the military and other state workers because
of a chronic shortfall in revenues.
	   Russian media reported that the current fund shortage had
already forced the military to sharply cut food rations.

Customs officials seize 33 kilograms of heroin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Police at Bulgaria's border with Turkey
arrested a Turkish national Thursday, after seizing 33 kilograms
(73 pounds) of heroin stashed in his car, an official said.
	   The seizure was made at the Kapitan Andreevo border crossing 314
kilometers (196 miles) southeast of Sofia.
	   The report didn't identify the detainee, who could face up to 15
years in prison if found guilty of drug trafficking.
	   Drug smuggling from Asia to Europe has increased across the
Balkans, since border regulations were eased at the end of the Cold
War in 1989.

Bankers predict regional crisis to spread, call for international
</HEADLINE>
action
 &UR; By TARA SUILEN DUFFY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Senior bankers warned Thursday that the Asian
financial crisis could spread and called for industrialized
countries to take swift action to ward off a global economic
meltdown.
	   Painting a gloomy picture of the world economy for the next
couple years, bankers from Lehman Brothers, Warburg Dillon Read,
Goldman Sachs, and Tokai Asia said Asia's problems could spread
unless governments in Asia, Europe, and the Americas work together.
	   And the first to do that should be Japan, they said.
	   ``Japan is the problem, globally speaking,'' said Russel Jones,
chief economist for Asia and senior vice-president at Lehman
Brothers Japan.
	   They were speaking at a panel discussion on the region's
economy, organized by Asia Society, a non-profit organization.
	   If Japan continues to spiral downward, Asia's recovery will be
nearly impossible, Jones said.
	   Japan's dire situation calls for unorthodox solutions, he said.
	   New money needs to be injected into the banking sector, and the
government needs to aggressively ease government restrictions in
the economic sector, said Tokai Asia managing director Brian C.
Lippey.
	   About 40 percent of Japan's economy is subject to strict
regulations, compared with 10 percent in the United States, Lippey
said.
	   Jones also called for the nationalization of Japan's banking
sector, which would cost huge sums of tax dollars.
	   Simon Ogus, managing director for Asian economics at Warburg
Dillon Read, urged the U.S. Federal Reserve to take the lead,
including cutting interest rates.
	   What is needed is ``a wake-up call to the Europeans and the
Americans that actually Asia's problems are their problems,'' he
said.

Angola threatens military action against former rebel group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Angola's army is ready to act soon to
dislodge the former rebel group UNITA from mountain strongholds it
has refused to surrender under a 1994 peace pact, a government
official said.
	   UNITA, which once controlled half of the southwest African
country, has relinquished most of the territory it held during the
two-decade civil war, halted by a U.N.-mediated peace accord.
	   However, UNITA has accused the government of human rights abuses
against its supporters in areas it relinquished and wants to
negotiate special conditions for handing over the four so-called
``sensitive areas,'' which are located several hundred kilometers
(miles) from the capital.
	   UNITA will be ousted from the four highland towns it holds ``as
soon as possible, one way or another,'' Higino Carneiro, the Deputy
Minister for Territorial Administration, told reporters late
Wednesday.
	   ``We can do it peacefully or with violence,'' Carneiro said
after meeting with U.N. envoy Issa Diallo.
	   The United Nations has imposed sanctions on UNITA _ a Portuguese
acronym for the National Union of the Total Independence of Angola
_ for its failure to comply with the peace accord.
	   The governing MPLA has expelled UNITA officials from the
government of national unity and reconciliation and has said it
will no longer negotiate with UNITA chief Jonas Savimbi.
	   Diallo said the peace process, which has been on hold since May
because of the continuing hostility between the former foes, would
not make progress unless the two sides displayed the ``political
will to make peace work.''
	   The U.N. Security Council decided Tuesday to keep international
military observers in Angola for another month and urged Angolan
authorities to reconsider suspending UNITA's participation in the
government.
	   ``If there is political will, the 30 days will be plenty. If
there isn't, not even 30 years will suffice,'' Diallo said.

Campaign turns nasty with Labor attack on heroin proliferation
</HEADLINE>
under conservatives &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The election campaign turned nasty
Thursday as the Labor Party accused Prime Minister John Howard of
putting young lives at risk by allowing cheap heroin into
Australia.
	   OppositionLabor Party justice spokesman Nick Bolkus was later
forced to apologize for his attack, although he denied he had meant
Howard was personally responsible for heroin overdose deaths.
	   Howard was outraged. ``I think that's a pretty cheap, tawdry,
guttersnipe attack,'' he said in Perth.
	   Howard called on opposition leader Kim Beazley to pull his key
spokespeople into line.
	   ``It seems that the pattern of the Labor Party is that the boss
sails on serenely in a civil manner, but at the margins he allows
his minions to say anything they like,'' he said.
	   Howard's governing conservatives and Beazley's Labor party are
battling toward an Oct. 3 national election.
	   Thursday's row erupted after Bolkus issued a statement
attempting to undercut Howard's announcement of increased funding
to fight illicit drugs.
	   Bolkus accused Howard of risking young lives by neglecting law
enforcement and said 60 young people had died from heroin overdoses
in Perth last year.
	   ``And why? Because under John Howard the price of a cap of
heroin has dropped from 40 dollars to as little as 5 dollars --
cheaper than a packet of cigarettes,'' he said.
	   (That is equivalent to a price drop of U.S. dlrs 24 to U.S. dlrs
3).
	   Bolkus later issued another statement regretting his attack had
been interpreted as blaming Howard for heroin deaths.
	   Meanwhile, Howard's predecessor as conservative leader, John
Hewson, undercut Treasurer Peter Costello's rosy economic outlook,
saying economic growth will fall off dramatically this year and the
Asian crisis could go on for decades.
	   Hewson, chairman of the Australian arm of investment bank ABN
Amro, said he believed domestic demand was slowing and that further
impact from Asia was about to flow through to the Australian
economy.
	   His comments came a day after Costello said the economy could
pick up speed as early as next year after a temporary slowdown in
1998/99, and that the Asian financial crisis could pass
``quickly.''
	   Hewson also suggested treasury's projection of 3.5 percent
economic growth for 1999/00 was ``odd'' in the current global
circumstances.

	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ Controversial opposition politician
Sam Rainsy signaled his agreement Thursday with a plan to end
political tensions, setting the stage for a summit meeting next
week of the country's top government and opposition leaders.
	   The talks, bringing him and opposition ally Prince Norodom
Ranariddh face-to-face with their bitter foe, Second Premier Hun
Sen, will be held Tuesday under the auspices of King Norodom
Sihanouk in the northwestern province of Siem Reap.
	   It will be Hun Sen's first meeting with Ranariddh since he
ousted the prince in a violent coup d'etat in July last year.
	   After a four-hour meeting here with King Sihanouk, Sam Rainsy
confirmed that he would attend the summit meeting and that his
party would be present for the convening of parliament on Sept. 24.
	   Ranariddh and his FUNCINPEC party made the same agreement on
Wednesday after the prince consulted with King Sihanouk, his
father.
	   Opposition leaders, protesting alleged fraud by Hun Sen's party
in July's parliamentary elections, had previously threatened to
boycott the parliamentary session, which would have made it
impossible to form a new government.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won a slight majority in the
polls, but not the two-thirds needed to form a government by
itself.
	   Opposition supporters staged demonstrations for several weeks
protesting the July 26 poll results, but last week police cracked
down, violently breaking up the street protests.
	   ``I think we have to move forward, it is time for dialogue,''
Sam Rainsy told reporters after meeting the king. ``As long as I
abide by this spirit, I hope that every political party and
authority will also abide by this spirit.''
	   To ease the crisis, the ruling party and its two opposition
rivals on Monday reached a tentative three-point agreement calling
for halting all demonstrations, holding a summit meeting and
convening the parliament as scheduled.
	   ``We would not do all these efforts if we did not have in mind
the objective of ending bloodshed and following the constitution of
Cambodia,'' Sam Rainsy said Thursday.
	   Sam Rainsy's trip to Siem Reap marked the first time in more
than a week that he has left his sanctuary at the United Nations
office in a Phnom Penh luxury hotel.
	   Sam Rainsy accepted protection from the office of the U.N.
Secretary General's Personal Representative in Cambodia after he
was accused by Hun Sen of being behind a Sept. 7 grenade attack on
the Cambodian leader's home.
	   As Hun Sen's strongest critic, Sam Rainsy has long been a thorn
in the side of the Cambodian strongman.
	   Hun Sen was not home and no one was hurt. Opposition leaders
denied they were behind the attack and accused Hun Sen of staging
it as a pretext to crack down on his opponents.
	   Police violence against the largely peaceful protesters began
the night after the grenade attack.
	   Ranariddh said Thursday he would demand a guarantee for the
safety of opposition politicians before officially agreeing to the
summit meeting.
	   He also called on the government to lift a travel ban Hun Sen
placed on 64 opposition members.
	   ``They must lift the travel ban before anything else because
this is unconstitutional,'' said Ranariddh. ``It is something that
makes us feel we cannot trust each other.''
	   Just before leaving Phnom Penh for Siem Reap, Sam Rainsy lit
incense sticks before a wreath marking where a demonstrator had
been killed by police in front of his hotel.
	   ``I have always to be optimistic,'' he said wearily, when asked
for his assessment of the political situation. While directly under
U.N. protection, he has agreed to avoid public political
statements.

Boldon runs 9.88 to take gold

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with men's and women's 100 finals, other medals &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC;

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Ato Boldon missed the world record
but still celebrated in style as he ran 9.88 seconds Thursday to
win the Commonwealth Games 100 meters gold medal.
	   The Trinidanian sprinter, who had said he felt capable of
beating Donovan Bailey's 9.84, threw his arms wide and took the
acclaim of the fans as he broke Linford Christie's Games mark of
9.91, set four years ago at Victoria, British Columbia.
	   Boldon, who has twice run 9.86 this season, ran to collect the
flag of Trinidad from one of his army of fans and did a lap of
honor with 37,000 spectators in the 100,000-capacity National
Stadium cheering him wildly.
	   The medals went as expected, with Boldon's big rival, Frankie
Fredericks of Namibia, second in 9.96 and Obadele Thompson of
Barbados, who ran 9.87 at altitude in Johannesburg on Friday, third
in 10.00.
	   While Boldon ran consistently throughout the race, Fredericks
started slowly and needed a powerful surge at midrace to get back
into contention. But Boldon always looked the winner and there was
daylight between the two sprint superstars at the line.
	   Chandra Sturrup of the Bahamas powered away from Canada's
Philomena Mensah to win the women's 100 meters in 11.06. Mensah
clocked 11.19 and Australia's Tania Van-Heer took the bronze in
11.29.
	   Kenya gained an expected 1-2-3 in the 3,000-meter steeplechase
with John Kosgei outsprinting world record holder Bernard Barmasei
to take the gold, with Kikpurui Misoi third.
	   Kosgei edged Barmesei by .03 with a time of 8 minutes, 15.34
seconds, with Misoi on 8:18.34. Such was the Kenyan domination of
the race that fourth place Joel Bourgeois of Canada was more than
16 seconds slower than the third-place finisher.
	   Australia's Kate Anderson won the women's 5,000 meters in
15:52.75 although she briefly surrendered the lead to England's
Sarah Young in the next to last lap.
	   Anderson retook the lead at the bell and pulled away to win the
race, while Young paid the penalty and was caught by three more
runners and finished fifth. England's Andrea Whitcomb took the
silver and Zimbabwe's Samukeliso Moyo the bronze.
	   Kenya's world champion Sally Barsosio was named in the field but
didn't make the start lineup after being involved in a car accident
back home in Kenya.
	   England's Denise Lewis, the defending champion, Olympic bronze
medalist and world silver medalist, looked almost certain for a
repeat win in the heptathlon.
	   She won the long jump with a leap of 6.52 meters, her third
victory from five events, and then made it four out of six by
throwing 51.22 meters in the javelin.
	   Only the 800 meters was to come later Thursday and she led
Australia's Julie Jamieson by 222 points.
	   Australia's Nick A'Hern was in a class of his own in the
20-kilometer walk around Lake Titiwangsa.
	   After sharing the lead with Canada's Arturo Huerta and another
Australian, Nathan Deaks, A'Hern made his move 45 minutes into the
race and finished some 250 meters clear of Huerta in 1 hour, 24
minutes, 59 seconds.
	   The Canadian won the silver in 1:25.49, with Deakes third in
1:26.06.
	   Maria Mutola, the Olympic bronze medalist from Mozambique, set a
Games record in the heats in the 800 meters, which marked the
return of Diane Modahl of England.
	   The African star clocked 1:59.06, becoming the first runner to
break 2 minutes in the Games and removing Modahl's mark of 2:00.25
from the record books. Modahl's record was at Auckland in 1990 and
that was her last race in the Games.
	   Days before she was due to defend her title, she was pulled out
of the English team at Victoria, British Columbia, in 1994 after
testing positive for high levels of testosterone. Modahl declared
her innocence, arguing that the tests were flawed, and she was
reinstated despite serving 20 months of a four-year ban that was
later quashed.
	   Declaring before the Games that she was still the defending
champion, Modahl ran 2:06.44 to win her heat. The semifinal is
Thursday and the final on Friday.

Lee: Indonesia's economic collapse could have been avoided
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's powerful politician said
Indonesia's economic disaster could have been avoided had the
country's former president Suharto understood the demands of the
global market.
	   ``President Suharto did not understand that after he had opened
up Indonesia's financial system and linked it to the international
money markets, he had to submit to the judgment of that market,''
Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew said in a statement Thursday.
	   ``He chose to ignore them with disastrous consequences.''
	   Lee was responding to a question asked during a news conference
on Tuesday. He said he will give a written answer later.
	   After ruling Indonesia for 32 years, Suharto resigned last May
amid ethnically charged riots and economic collapse.
	   ``It was an immense personal tragedy,'' Lee said about Suharto,
whom he called his longtime friend and colleague.
	   Prime minister of Singapore for 31 years, Lee stepped down in
1990 but still wields enormous influence.
	   Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong visited Suharto three
times ``to explain that, fair or unfair, his country, having made
use of monies from this market, simply had to comply with the
standards that international bankers and fund managers considered
necessary,'' Lee said.
	   Lee added that Indonesia can still rely on its infrastructure
and educated work force and that it can resume fast growth when
recovery comes.

Queensland government says racism concern caused conference
</HEADLINE>
cancellation &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Australia-Election &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ One of Australia's leading financial
institutions canceled a planned Queensland conference for its Asian
clients because of concern over the right-wing populist One Nation
party's electoral success, the state's treasurer said Thursday.
	   Treasurer David Hamill said his office had been contacted by a
senior executive of one of the financial institution who said the
conference was canceled because several high-profile Asian clients
would be attending.
	   He did not name the financial institution.
	   ``This financial institution actually does extensive business
with Asian investors in fixed interest securities and bonds such as
those issued by the Queensland Treasury Corp.,'' Hamill said.
	   Hamill said he had seen first hand the concern in the financial
community about Pauline Hanson's One Nation party, which wants to
end Asian immigration to Australia.
	   The party won 11 of 89 seats in state Parliament in last June's
election.
	   He said during a recent trip interstate with Queensland Treasury
representatives, he was disturbed to discover that representatives
of the financial markets were ``preoccupied'' with what impact One
Nation's policies would have on the state's fiscal policies.
	   Public Works and Housing Minister Rob Schwarten told Parliament
a Philippines delegation, due to attend the Master Builders
Convention on the Gold Coast next month, had canceled because of
concerns about racism in Australia.
	   He introduced a letter from the William Golangco Construction
Corp. that said that due to bad publicity generated by alleged
racist activities, 16 from the group had canceled.
	   He said every time the Queensland government wanted to do
business in Asia, it had to explain that it did not hold racist
views despite One Nation's local popularity.

FBI chief vows to remain on trail of anti-American terrorists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The FBI and Greek authorities are
determined to crush one of the world's most elusive terrorist
organizations, FBI Director Louis Freeh said Thursday.
	   ``Terrorism, whether it's in East Africa or in Oklahoma City in
the United States or in Greece, does not discriminate against its
victims,'' Freeh said as part of a two-day visit to seek to broaden
crime-fighting partnerships between Greek and American authorities.
	   But despite two decades of cooperation between the FBI and Greek
police, neither appear to be any closer to the November 17
organization, which has killed 22 people, including four Americans,
since its 1975 assassination of the CIA station chief in Athens.
	   ``Terrorism cases, particularly those conducted by professional
killers, are very difficult to solve,'' said Freeh, who is on a
European tour.
	   He noted that for 16 years the FBI was unable to crack the
Unabomber case in which a former mathematics professor, Theodore
Kaczynski, confessed to killing three people and injuring 23 others
between 1978 and 1995 with homemade bombs.
	   No one has ever been arrested in connection with November 17,
and no confirmed suspects have been named in the 23 years of its
operation.
	   ``What is important, however, is the resolve and determination
of our two police services to solve these crimes and bring these
people to justice,'' he said.
	   ``We wish to do so shorter than 23 years or 16 years, but we are
confident that at the end of our investigations, we will bring
people to justice,'' Freeh noted. ``And that is the determination
that ensures our success.''
	   No obvious headway has been made since the last spate of
bombings against American companies by November 17 this spring. The
United States also has renewed its dlrs 2 million reward for
information leading to the arrest of the terrorists.
	   The group said its latest bombing campaign, in which no one was
injured, was ``aimed against American imperialism-nationalism,''
and accused the U.S. of ``undermining Greece's sovereign rights.''
	   November 17, built around a mix of ultra-leftist and nationalist
ideologies, is named for the day in 1973 when the then-ruling
military junta crushed a student uprising in Athens.

Thai army chief asks Myanmar to release Thai prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ During his final trip abroad as
Thailand's army commander in chief, Gen. Chetta Thanajaro has asked
Myanmar's military government to release 86 Thai prisoners, army
officials said Thursday.
	   Most of the Thai prisoners were arrested for fishing in
Myanmar's territorial waters, a senior army official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press.
	   The Thais are being kept in Insein Prison in Yangon, which also
houses many of Myanmar's political prisoners and has a reputation
for extremely harsh conditions.
	   Thai fishermen released from Insein in the past have called it
hell on earth.
	   Chetta made the request Wednesday while meeting with Gen. Khin
Nyunt, one of the top four generals of the ruling junta, who said
he would consider it, the officer said. Chetta is slated to retire
before the end of the year.
	   Those arrested for more serious crimes probably would not be
considered for release, the officer said.
	   The army could not confirm the exact number of Thai convicts in
Myanmar prisons, but the officer said it may be more than a
hundred.
	   He said Myanmar may also free another 10 Thai prisoners detained
for illegal entry at the town of Kengtung opposite of northern
Thailand.
	   Gen. Chetta said that even after his retirement he will make
good use of his close ties with Myanmar's military leaders to
promote better relations between the two countries, the Bangkok
Post reported Wednesday.
	   Chetta has been criticized by democracy activists and human
rights groups in Thailand and other countries for his close
relations with Myanmar's leaders.
	   Myanmar's military government has been the target of
international criticism for its repression against the country's
democracy movement, attacks on ethnic groups and alleged failure to
curb the massive amount of drugs flowing out of the country.

At his trial, Ex-NATO chief Claes denies bribery charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Ex-NATO chief Willy Claes, testifying
at his own corruption trial, distanced himself Thursday from
charges of financial wrongdoing in awarding two defense contracts
in the late 1980s when he was Belgian economics minister.
	   Claes, 59, said he was only indirectly involved in talks to get
Italian helicopter maker Agusta SpA to place orders in Belgium in
exchange for a contract to build 48 helicopters for the Belgian
Army.
	   ``I have always followed the economic compensation talks from a
certain distance,'' Claes told the supreme court where he and 11
others, including ex-defense minister Guy Coeme and ex-deputy
premier Guy Spitaels, are on trial for corruption.
	   ``It was only in the final phase (of the compensation
negotiations) I occupied myself with that issue.''
	   The government gave Agusta the contract arguing it offered
better economic compensation than France's Aerospatiale SA.
Prosecutors dispute that saying Agusta bribed Claes' Socialist
Party which Claes denies.
	   The corruption trial opened Sept. 2 but did not get going until
Thursday after the court heard and rejected procedural questions
Claes and his co-defendants raised to stop the proceedings.
	   Prosecutors allege Agusta paid Claes' Dutch-speaking socialist
party 51 million francs (dlrs 1.37 million) in 1988 to win a
December, 1988, contract for the helicopters.
	   They also charge France's Dassault Aviation SA paid 60 million
francs (dlrs 1.62 million) to win a June, 1989, deal to equip
Belgian F-16 jets with new electronics. The French-speaking
socialist party of Coeme and Spitaels allegedly got a bribe of 30
million francs from Dassault.
	   The Agusta and Dassault contracts were worth hundreds of
millions of dollars each.
	   Serge Dassault of Dassault Aviation is also a defendant. Charges
have been dropped against ex-Agusta executive Raffaelo Teti who
died Aug. 22 of a heart attack.
	   The Agusta and Dassault ``gifts'' were allegedly funneled to
Belgium's Dutch and French-speaking socialist parties from Swiss
and Luxembourg bank accounts into socialist front companies and
foundations in Belgium.
	   The trial is held in the supreme court after the parliamentary
immunity of Claes and other onetime cabinet members had been been
lifted.
	   Until 1989, corporate donations to Belgian parties were legal.
Thus, prosecutors must not prove money was paid but must prove
corruption by showing the Agusta and Dassault ``gifts'' were timed
so closely to the awarding of contracts they had to be bribes.
	   The allegations against Claes, 59, cost him his prized NATO job.
He became secretary general Sept. 29, 1994 but quit Oct. 19, 1995,
amid charges of financial wrongdoing from his days as Belgian
economics minister.

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ The tenacious Australian media pack
sprang into action Thursday to chase a rumor that Monica Lewinsky
was vacationing at the Port Douglas resort in far north Queensland.
	   Mike Berwick, the mayor of Douglas Shire, sparked the media
feeding frenzy by telling Radio 4CA he had heard a rumor that the
24-year-old former White House intern was visiting.
	   ``I've heard that it is correct that she is in town and I heard
that last night,'' he said.
	   In Los Angeles, Ms. Lewinsky's spokeswoman, Judy Smith, refused
to comment on where the former intern was.

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Jordan, Kuwait. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Share prices fell but turnover shored up on
the Amman stock exchange this week because of active dealing on
shares of lucrative commercial banks, brokers said Thursday.
	   A stock market report, reflecting activity for five business
days ending Wednesday, showed that the 60-company share price index
closed at 175.65 _ 1.17 percent less than the previous week.
	   The report said activity on shares of commercial banks
constituted 49.1 percent of the total turnover, which nudged up by
34.5 percent to 4.99 million Jordanian dinars (dlrs 7 million).
	   It said despite the active dealing, shares of commercial banks
slipped by 1 percent, industrial firms by 1.5 percent, the services
sector by 2.8 percent and insurance companies by 0.5 percent.
	   Shares of 99 companies were traded during the week, the report
added.
 &UR; ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The price index of the Kuwait Stock Exchange
closed at 2.168 points at the end of the trading week, 6.1 or 0.28
percent lower than the previous week, the National Investments Co.
said Thursday.
	   Trading was affected by selling for profit-taking, and strong
speculation on the stocks of Gulf firms, the company said in a
weekly report.
	   Some 628.34 million shares changed hands this week, 14.04
percent lower than last week. The value of these stocks also fell
by 9.38 percent to 120.62 million dinars (dlrs 394.18 million).
	   The company said the stocks of 66 companies were traded, with 30
closing higher, 11 closing lower and 25 unchanged. Ten of the
exchange's 76 listed companies were not traded.
 &UR; ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan and the Palestinians will open talks
this weekend on boosting trade exchange, officials said Thursday.
	   Mohammed Halayqah, undersecretary of the Trade Ministry, said a
larger meeting of senior officials on Saturday will discuss adding
more than 120 commodities to a tax-exempt list of goods exchanged
with the West Bank. He declined to say how many items were
currently on the list.
	   Halayqah and his Palestinian counterpart, Khalid Islam, said the
Saturday meeting will also discuss obstacles hindering trade
between the two sides, including Israeli bureaucracy and delays at
crossing points linking Jordan with the West Bank.
	   ``It would be an advantage for us to increase the number of
commodities from the Jordanian markets and minimize that of the
Israelis, especially since the Israelis impose a sales tax of
around 55 percent on all commodities,'' Islam said.
	   In 1995, Jordan and the Palestinian agreed on a broad framework
for cooperation, which included a trade exchange ceiling of dlrs
300 million. But since, actual trade did not exceed one fifth of
the envisaged volume.

	   PARIS (AP) _ The Conference of Bishops of France on Thursday
condemned legislation that would give homosexual couples the same
legal standing as man and wife, saying such a law would make
marriage a ``useless'' institution.
	   Only a relationship between a man and a woman ``can be qualified
as a couple,'' the Conference's Permanent Council said.
	   A law that would provide social recognition to a homosexual
relationship would weaken the ``social image'' of marriage and
render it ``finally useless,'' the council said in a statement.

Harada grabs early lead in Oronamin C Japan Cup bowling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Akio Harada of Japan took a 67-pin lead in the
opening round of the 14th annual Oronamin C Japan Cup at Tokyo Port
Bowl Thursday.
	   The four-day event features the top 16 players from the U.S.
Professional Bowlers Association and its Japanese counterpart JPBA.
	   Harada, a 12-time titlist on the Japanese association, shot a
300-game during round one and won six of eight matches on his way
to a total pinfall of 2,241.
	   Trailing Harada is reigning PBA Player of the Year Walter Ray
Williams Jr., who went 5-3 with 2,174 pins. The PBA Hall of Famer
from Orlando, Florida, won this event in 1991 and is looking for
his third win of the year.
	   In third place with 2,158 total pins is former PBA Player of the
year Norm Duke. The resident of Clermont, Florida, is looking for
his first Japan Cup victory.
	   Fourth place belongs to first-time Japan Cup qualifier Tommy
Delutz Jr., who had 2,138 total pins. The resident of Flushing, New
York, also had a 300-game in round one and had a field-best 7-1
match play record in his quest for his first PBA title.
	   Just 24 pins behind Delutz is Tim Criss, of Bel Air, Maryland.
Criss, who won the final event of the PBA's Summer Tour in June,
went 4-4 in match play and handed Deluts his only loss of round
one.
	   Rounding out the top six is veteran JPBA champion Tsuguo
Tsukahara. Tsukahara, along with Williams and Harada, are the only
players to have qualified for all 14 Japan Cups. Tsukahara had
2,109 and a 5-3 match play record.
	   Defending champion Doug Kent, of Canandaigua, New York, is in
ninth place with 2,092 and a match play record of 6-2.
	   The entire 32-man field returns Friday for rounds two and three.
The final round of match play is set for Saturday before the field
is trimmed to the top six for Sunday's championship round.

Perkins says it's not over
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Dual Olympic 1,500-meter swimming
champion Kieren Perkins declared he was on still on target to win a
third gold at the Sydney games despite his first international
defeat in eight years Thursday.
	   Perkins, 25, holds the world records for 1,500, 800 and 400
meters, and won the gold medals at the 1992 and 1996 Olympics.
	   He has hardly raced since winning the final in Atlanta, after
sneaking into the final by .23 seconds and getting lane eight.
	   World champion Grant Hackett had his first chance to race
Perkins in a major final after Perkins missed this year's world
championships.
	   But he refuses to concede defeat.
	   ``I'll put it this way _ it's not over,'' said Perkins. ``Every
time I'm racing I'm improving.
	   ``But the most disturbing thing is that's the first time I've
been beaten internationally over 1,500 meters for eight years and I
don't like it.''
	   Perkins last lost at the 1991 world championships in Perth when
he was edged by Germany's Jorg Hoffmann. That remains the only
1,500-meter race in history where three swimmers have broken 15
minutes.
	   Hackett was pleased to topple his famous compatriot.
	   ``To be the first to do that in eight years is fantastic,''
Hackett said. ``But his world record (14:41.66) is still out there.
To be honest I want to get down to 14:40 in the next six to 12
months.''
	   Hackett was hoping to go into the 14:40s Thursday to join
Perkins as the only swimmer to go under 14:50.
	   ``But realistically I should be happy with 14:50. I did feel I
was out there alone and that made it a little harder,'' Hackett
said.
	   Hackett, like Perkins, had problems with illness in the two
months leading up to these games.
	   While Hackett believes he can crack the record before Sydney
2000, Perkins disagrees.
	   ``Personally, I don't think Grant is near my world record,''
Perkins said. ``He's young and inexperienced and doesn't know how
to swim the 1,500 properly yet.''

Sudan calls on Ugandan troops to withdraw from southern Sudan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS in 8th graf spelling of Ugandan president's name. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ President Omar el-Bashir called on
Ugandan forces, which Khartoum claims are helping Sudanese rebels,
to withdraw from southern Sudan, the official Sudan News Agency
Thursday.
	   It also quoted a top government official in southern Sudan as
saying that Tuesday's Ugandan-led attack in the south was a
violation of non-aggression agreements between Sudan and Uganda.
	   ``This rebel-backed Ugandan aggression... a step back by Uganda
from its previous... commitments,'' said Riak Machar, head of the
government's Southern States Coordination Council.
	   The Sudanese army said Tuesday that its troops had repulsed a
Ugandan-led assault in the towns of Liria, Torit and Jabalain in
the Eastern Equatoria province, which borders Uganda. It said that
its troops killed more than 50 Ugandan government troops and
Sudanese rebels.
	   However, a government-run Ugandan newspaper quoted a spokesman
for the rebel group, Sudan Peoples Liberation Army rebel, as saying
its forces killed 40 Ugandan rebels in Tuesday's clashes.
	   Kampala and Khartoum accuse each other of supporting the other's
rebels.
	   Southern Sudanese rebels are believed to receive support from
Ethiopia and Eritrea, as well as Uganda.
	   Machar, who also serves as the government's envoy for talks with
Uganda, said that Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni had agreed to
the basics of a non-aggression agreement, which has yet to be
signed.
	   Machar said that the Ugandan assault was prompted by the United
States as ``a warning to its allies who neighbor Sudan'' not to
normalize relations with Khartoum, the independent daily, Akhbar
Al-Youm said Thursday.

Bosnia election supervisors deny withholding pro-extremist results

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from Bosnian Serb prime minister critical
of OSCE handling of the election &QL; 
 &UR; By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Despite allegations they
were trying to manipulate the outcome of last weekend's voting,
international officials refused Thursday to release any figures
from Bosnia's national election.
	   ``We are not going to make judgments based on 60 percent, or 40
percent of counted ballots,'' said Nicole Szulc, spokeswoman for
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which ran
the election. ``The only results that will matter are the final
results,'' and those are expected in a few days, she said.
	   Robert Barry, head of the OSCE in Bosnia, said results probably
will be announced next Wednesday or Thursday _ at least 10 days
after the voting.
	   Extremist parties have claimed victory, based on reports from
party monitors who watched the counting at precinct level following
two days of voting which ended Sunday.
	   If the claims are true, the outcome would be a severe blow to
international efforts to build a stable, multi-ethnic state in
Bosnia-Herzegovina.
	   It could also raise doubts about the effectiveness of the
international effort which has sought to rebuild Bosnia after the
1995 Dayton peace accords.
	   The most closely watched contest, involving the re-election bid
of Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic _ a moderate backed by
the West _ has generated conflicting claims about whether she won
or lost.
	   Hundreds of flag-waving Radical Party supporters took to the
streets of Pale and other towns in the Serb half of Bosnia on
Wednesday night to celebrate what they said was Plavsic's defeat by
extreme radical Nikola Poplasen.
	   A Western diplomat in Sarajevo who declined to be named said
both sides are creating circumstances to declare the elections void
in case of their defeat.
	   Szulc dismissed reports spread by various parties in Bosnia of
their victory. She said the ballot counting is complicated and
there are some 200,000 ballots in envelopes that have not been
opened yet.
	   ``Releasing preliminary figures would only add to the dispute
about who really won,'' Barry told a news conference in Banja Luka.
	   In a statement carried by the Bosnian Serb SRNA news agency on
Wednesday, two extremist parties accused the OSCE of deliberately
delaying the planned release of preliminary results because of the
hardliners' strong showing.
	   ``The results are known but OSCE is silent,'' said the joint
statement by the Bosnian Serb Radical Party and Serb Democratic
Party.
	   In Banja Luka, the prime minister of the Bosnian Serb republic,
Milorad Dodik, said Thursday the delays showed that OSCE had no
business trying to run elections.
	   ``Having in mind all mistakes that are evident in the election
procedure, we will demand that the next municipal elections be
carried out according to the laws of Republika Srpska and that a
permanent election commission is formed while OSCE would only be a
monitor,'' Dodik told reporters.
	   He said it was ``evident there were many problems, technical
mostly, so we stand firm in our belief that OSCE unnecessarily
experimented with ballots.''

Suu Kyi and nine others acting as Myanmar parliament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Aung San Suu Kyi and nine politicians
from Myanmar confirmed their intentions Thursday to act as the
country's parliament in the democratic leadership's most serious
challenge ever to the authority of the military government.
	   The democrats also declared that all laws and proclamations
issued by the military government since it seized power illegally
in a coup d'etat 10 years ago are illegal.
	   The democratic leadership is risking arrest by the military
government with their actions. The military has warned that any
attempt to convene the parliament elected in 1990 would be illegal.
	   ``The Committee Representing Elected Lawmakers formed by the
National League for Democracy on Sept. 16 decided it will perform
the functions of the Parliament until a formal Parliament session
is called under the 1990 multi-party democratic election law,'' a
statement from the committee said on Thursday.
	   Since May, the military has arrested 843 members of Suu Kyi's
party, the National League for Democracy, including 195 lawmakers
to prevent them from convening the assembly, a separate party
statement said Thursday.
	   Most of the arrests have come during the last two weeks. The
mass detentions taking place all over the country constitute the
most severe attempt by the military government to crush the
democratic opposition since the early 1990s.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been ruled by the military
since 1962. The current leadership seized power on Sept. 18, 1988
by crushing a nationwide pro-democracy uprising in which thousands
of people were gunned down by troops.
	   In 1990, Suu Kyi's party won 82 percent of the seats in
parliament in an election the military has refused to honor. The
1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner was under house arrest by the
military at the time.
	   The 10-member Committee to Represent Elected Lawmakers chose Dr.
Saw Mra Aung as the Parliament speaker. Saw Mra Aung is an elected
representative of the Arakan League for Democracy, which won 11
seats in the 1990 poll but has since been outlawed by the
government.
	   The committee's first parliamentary resolution was to call for
the release of all political prisoners.
	   The government is also under pressure from university and high
school students who have been staging small ``lightning protests''
for more academic freedom and against military rule, an exiled
students group said Thursday.
	   ``Four high school students arrested in relation to a
demonstration on Sept. 9 were yesterday sentenced to five years
imprisonment,'' the All Burma Students Democratic Front said.
	   The group also said that 1,200 students at the Hlaing campus of
the Yangon Institute of Technology were refusing orders by the
military to return to their homes in the provinces following exams
held on Monday.
	   ``The students are merely demanding the right to a decent
education,'' said ABSDF Chairman Aung Naing Oo. ``By suppressing
the rights and legitimate aspirations of students the Burmese
military is destroying the future of our country.''

UN agency to provide food aid to China flood victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The World Food Program said Thursday it was
launching its first-ever emergency relief operation in China,
providing food for more than 5 million people forced from their
homes by this summer's devastating floods.
	   The floods killed more than 3,000 people, destroyed large tracts
of crop land and left millions homeless.
	   ``It's tested the ability of the government to respond on its
own,'' said Francis Mwanza, spokesman for the Rome-based U.N.
agency. ``They have come out asking for international help - that's
why we're going in.''
	   WFP said it would provide 247,214 metric tons (271,935 short
tons) of rice to 5.8 million people in the hardest-hit areas of
Hunan, Hubei, Anhui and Jiangxi.
	   Flood victims will receive free food rations until the
floodwaters dry, which is expected to happen around mid-October.
WFP will then pay the victims in food to perform tasks such as
constructing shelters, restoring drinking water facilities and
rebuilding damaged roads.

Basque separatist group announces cease-fire

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Basque separatist group ETA has
announced a cease-fire in its 30-year fight for an independent
homeland in northern Spain.
	   ETA's four-page statement announcing its first indefinite truce
was made public late Wednesday by Euskadi Informacion, a newspaper
in the Basque region that supports the militant separatist cause.
	   The group set no conditions on the cease-fire, set to begin
Friday, but warned it would end the truce in the event of a
``confrontation'' with the government.
	   ETA, the Basque language initials for Basque Homeland and
Freedom, and Basque political parties seek an independent nation
carved out of northern Spain and southern France.
	   Pressure on ETA to declare a unilateral cease-fire has escalated
ahead of the Oct. 25 Basque regional elections, Most Basque
politicians support the ETA's goal, but not the use of violence.
ETA has killed nearly 800 people since 1968.
	   On Saturday, the ETA's allies in the election, the Herri
Batasuna party, joined other Basque nationalists in urging peace
talks and a permanent end to the bloodshed.
	   The government's first reaction to the ETA announcement was
skepticism.
	   ``Time will be the judge of the sincerity, authenticity, the
depth of this decision,'' Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja, who
controls national security forces, said in a nationally televised
statement.
	   Mayor Oreja has warned the ETA might call a ``trick truce'' to
gain support for the Herri Batasuna party.
	   There was no immediate comment from Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar, who was on an official visit to Peru.
	   Spain's major opposition party, the Socialists, also urged
caution.
	   ``One has to analyze this communique with prudence,'' party
spokesman Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba told the state-run news agency
EFE late Wednesday.
	   The Socialists and Aznar's more conservative Popular Party have
long maintained they would not negotiate with ETA unless it
renounced violence and put down its arms.
	   There was a more euphoric reaction in the Basque region itself,
where government spokeswoman Mari Carmen Garmendia urged the
Socialists and Popular Party to join others in peace negotiations.
	   ``Peace demands the participation and collaboration of everyone
without exception,'' Garmendia told the Spanish news agency Europa
Press late Wednesday.
	   ETA earlier has called limited cease-fires. In 1996, for
example, it observed a one-week truce. This is the first time it
has announced an open-ended cease-fire.
	   The last ETA attack came June 25 when it killed a town councilor
of the Popular Party in the Basque town of Renteria. He was the
sixth person killed by ETA this year.

U.S. Embassy will be 'open,' despite security worries, ambassador
</HEADLINE>
says &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The new U.S. Embassy building to be built in
Berlin will be a ``normal, open'' embassy despite heightened
security concerns in the wake of last month's bombings in East
Africa, U.S. Ambassador John Kornblum said on Thursday.
	   Plans for a new embassy were unveiled in mid-1996, and Kornblum
said construction will probably begin this fall on the site where
the prewar embassy stood, next to the Brandenburg Gate.
	   An embassy spokeswoman said the bombings last month near U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania have delayed the groundbreaking
while they wait to see whether the State Department will want to
change the plans to make the building more secure.
	   ``There's a worldwide security review going on and it has not
yet been completed,'' spokeswoman Andrea Meyer said.
	   Kornblum refused to comment on how the security concerns will
affect the construction, except to say: ``It will be a normal, open
U.S. Embassy.''
	   Kornblum said the U.S. Embassy in Germany would still complete
its planned move from Bonn to Berlin by next year, using the old
U.S. Embassy in former East Germany until the new building is
finished.
	   Kornblum officially upgraded the U.S. office in Berlin to
official embassy status Thursday.
	   The reconstruction and move is timed to coincide with the German
federal government's return next year to its historic capital from
Bonn.
	   Kornblum said about 30 percent of U.S. Embassy staff are already
working in Berlin, he said. Kornblum will be among those remaining
in Bonn until the final move in September 1999.

Boldon runs 9.88 to take gold

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Ato Boldon missed the world record
but still celebrated in style as he ran 9.88 seconds Thursday to
win the Commonwealth Games 100 meters gold medal.
	   The Trinidanian sprinter, who had said he felt capable of
beating Donovan Bailey's 9.84, threw his arms wide and took the
acclaim of the fans as he broke Linford Christie's Games mark of
9.91, set four years ago at Victoria, British Columbia.
	   Boldon, who has twice run 9.86 this season, ran to collect the
flag of Trinidad from one of his army of fans and did a lap of
honor with 37,000 spectators in the 100,000-capacity National
Stadium cheering him wildly.
	   The medals went as expected, with Boldon's big rival, Frankie
Fredericks of Namibia, second in 9.96 and Obadele Thompson of
Barbados, who ran 9.87 at altitude in Johannesburg on Friday, third
in 10.00.
	   While Boldon ran consistently throughout the race, Fredericks
started slowly and needed a powerful surge at midrace to get back
into contention. But Boldon always looked the winner and there was
daylight between the two sprint superstars at the line.
	   ``I tell you what. I talked the talk as usual _ now I've walked
the walk as well.
	   ``At 50 meters I thought, oh yeah, this is looking fast,''
Boldon said. ``Me and the starter had been in sync for the last two
days.
	   He also sent a message to former champion Christie, now retired.
	   ``Remember at Victoria four years ago I said I was going to be
the one to watch?
	   ``Well, promise delivered.''
	   Fredericks, silver medalist at the last two Olympics at both the
100 and 200 meters, acknowledged he had finished second again.
	   ``It's frustrating. All I know is that every time I step on the
track I try my best,'' said the Namibian, who was angry that his
prime minister now considered him the nation's second best
sportsman behind a boxer because he had failed to win an Olympic
gold.
	   ``I'm just going to keep trying and train harder and hopefully
one day I'll win.
	   ``You always expect to win but there's eight people, and one
person can win,'' Fredericks said. ``But I'm happy that I came here
despite all the circumstances.''
	   Chandra Sturrup of the Bahamas powered away from Canada's
Philomena Mensah to win the women's 100 meters in 11.06. Mensah
clocked 11.19 and Australia's Tania Van-Heer took the bronze in
11.29.
	   Kenya gained an expected 1-2-3 in the 3,000-meter steeplechase,
with John Kosgei outsprinting world record holder Bernard Barmasei
to take the gold and Kikpurui Misoi third.
	   Kosgei edged Barmesei by .03 with a time of 8 minutes, 15.34
seconds, with Misoi on 8:18.34. Such was the Kenyan domination of
the race that fourth place Joel Bourgeois of Canada was more than
16 seconds slower than the third-place finisher.
	   Australia's Kate Anderson won the women's 5,000 meters in
15:52.75 although she briefly surrendered the lead to England's
Sarah Young in the next to last lap.
	   Anderson retook the lead at the bell and pulled away to win the
race while Young paid the penalty. She was caught by three more
runners and finished fifth. England's Andrea Whitcomb took the
silver and Zimbabwe's Samukeliso Moyo the bronze.
	   Kenya's world champion Sally Barsosio was named in the field but
didn't make the start lineup after being involved in a car accident
back home in Kenya.
	   In the heptathlon, England's Denise Lewis, the defending
champion, Olympic bronze medalist and world silver medalist,
cruised to another Games title with four victories in the seven
events.
	   She won the long jump with a leap of 6.52 meters and then made
it four out of six by throwing 51.22 meters in the javelin. After
the final event, the 800 meters, she finished with 6,513 points, a
massive 159 points clear of Australia's Jane Jamieson, with New
Zealand's Joanne Henry collecting bronze.
	   England's Bob Weir heaved a Games record 64.42 meters at age 37
to win the men's discus ahead of Frantz Kruger of South Africa and
Jason Tunks of Canada.
	   Australia's Nick A'Hern was in a class of his own in the
20-kilometer walk around Lake Titiwangsa.
	   After sharing the lead with Canada's Arturo Huerta and another
Australian, Nathan Deaks, A'Hern made his move 45 minutes into the
race and finished some 250 meters clear of Huerta in 1 hour, 24
minutes, 59 seconds.
	   The Canadian won the silver in 1:25.49, with Deakes third in
1:26.06.
	   Maria Mutola, the Olympic bronze medalist from Mozambique, set a
Games record in the heats in the 800 meters, which marked the
return of Diane Modahl of England.
	   The African star clocked 1:59.06, becoming the first runner to
break 2 minutes in the Games and removing Modahl's mark of 2:00.25
from the record books. Modahl's record was at Auckland in 1990 and
that was her last race in the Games.
	   She was pulled out of the English team in 1994 after testing
positive for high levels of testosterone. Modahl declared her
innocence, arguing that the tests were flawed, and she was
reinstated despite serving 20 months of a four-year ban that was
later quashed.
	   Declaring before the Games that she was still the defending
champion, Modahl ran 2:06.44 to win her heat. The semifinal is
Thursday and the final on Friday.

Asian markets tumble on U.S., Russian worries
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RESTORES dropped day in lede &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed sharply lower
Thursday on concerns over U.S. interest rates, renewed economic
turmoil in Russia, and a host of negative local market news.
Japan's main stock index plunged to a new 12-year low.
	   But shares in the Philippines bucked the region's trend. The key
PSE index rocketing 7.9 percent _ the sharpest gain in three months
_ lifted by a 25-percent rally in shares of the Philippines Long
Distance Telephone amid rumors of a possible merger or takeover.
	   Japan's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 338.56
points, or 2.38 percent, closing at 13,859.14, on escalating
worries over the economies in Russia and Japan.
	   It was the Nikkei's lowest finish since March 5, 1986, when it
closed at 13,807.46. It had fallen 0.21 percent Wednesday.
	   In late afternoon trading, the dollar bought 134.30 yen, down
0.62 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New
York rate of 134.90 yen overnight.
	   Shares of major Japanese companies doing business with Russia
tumbled, following the announcement of TDK Corp., a major maker of
electronic parts, that it may face delays in the redemption of
16.31 billion yen (dlrs 121 million) that it had invested in
Russian euroyen bonds, because of the recent economic turmoil
there.
	   The monthlong confusion over Russia's economy escalated
Thursday, as President Boris Yeltsin said it would take an extra
week to complete formation of the new Cabinet, and Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov ordered officials to avoid speaking to the media
until then.
	   The Russian media have been abuzz with speculation about
possible appointments and policies.
	   Apart from Russia, investors also were confused over whether the
United States would cut interest rates. Analysts say that would
give Asian economies reassurance that the economic giant is ready
to act to prevent a global economic fallout.
	   On Wednesday, Greenspan said in closely-watched testimony in
Congress that ``at the moment there is no endeavor to coordinate
interest rate cuts'' among the Group of Seven industrialized
countries.
	   Greenspan's comments, coupled with profit-taking and
expectations that the unemployment figure, announced later in the
day, will show a rise sent Hong Kong shares sharply lower.
	   The Hang Seng Index plunged 3.6 percent to close at 7,576.57
after three straight session of gains.
	   The government announced after trading closed that unemployment
in the three months ending Aug. 31 reached a 15-year high of 5
percent.
	   In Singapore, the Straits Times Index fell 0.6 percent at
941.42, also on Greenspan's comments and profit-taking from
Wednesday's 4.9 percent gain.
	   In Indonesia, the key JSX index plunged 1.9 percent to 286.475
points on fears of growing demonstrations in the capital city, and
uncertainties over the future ownership of some listed companies
whose owners are facing huge financial liability.
	   In Malaysia, the key Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange closed down 1.9
percent at 394.04, as more retail investors pulled out amid
continued talks of a capital gains tax.
	   Elsewhere:
	   BANGKOK: The SET index closed up 0.6 percent at 220.05 on Wall
Street's fourth consecutive session of gains Wednesday.
	   SEOUL: The Kospi index fell 0.7 percent, with no particular
market news to boost shares.
	   SYDNEY: The All Ordinaries Index was 0.4 percent lower at
2,542.9, as investors stayed sidelined ahead of the local federal
election.
	   TAIPEI: The technology-heavy Weighted Price Index was up 0.4
percent at 7,000.52 on rotational buying of technology stocks.
	   WELLINGTON: The NZSE-40 capital index was 0.8 percent higher at
1,762, boosted by a strong gain by Telecom Corp. of New Zealand
Ltd.

British royals visit 2 former colonies in Southeast Asia

<TEXT>
	   BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei (AP) _ Two of the world's oldest
ruling dynasties gathered Thursday as Queen Elizabeth II arrived in
this oil-rich kingdom for a formal visit with the Sultan of Brunei.
	   The queen and her husband, Prince Philip, were met at the
airport by Crown Prince Al-Muhtadee Billah, and then escorted to
the royal palace, where they were greeted with an honor guard and
Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, wearing a gray, Western suit and a
traditional Malay cap, called a songkok.
	   The queen wore a lavender, floral dress with white hat and
heels.
	   The British royals chose Brunei and Malaysia for their only
state visits this year. They have vowed to stand by the two former
British colonies in Southeast Asia during tough economic times.
	   ``We want to show how much we value links at a time of economic
difficulties and how Britain is no fair-weather friend,'' said a
Buckingham Palace spokesman.
	   The British royals are making their first state visit since 1972
to this remote rain forest on the northern tip of Borneo island.
That's 12 years before the tiny kingdom gained full independence
from the United Kingdom, which had kept it a British protectorate
for nearly a century.
	   Though Brunei today is one of the wealthiest countries in the
world _ its 312,000 people pay no taxes and medical care and
education are free _ it has not been immune to the economic turmoil
that has gripped the region.
	   Brunei's absolute monarchy is embroiled in a family feud that is
believed to have cost it some dlrs 16 billion with the collapse of
its international flagship company, Amadeo.
	   The company was run by the jet-setting younger brother of the
sultan, Prince Jefri Bolkiah, who has since been sacked and remains
in self-imposed exile abroad.
	   With the global plunge in the price of oil, which generates 80
percent of Brunei's wealth, compounded by the Asian financial
crisis, the sultanate last month took the unprecedented step of
forming a Ministerial Economic Council to study ways in which to
revamp its economy.
	   The British royals during their four-day visit intend to mingle
with ordinary people, no doubt to emulate the winning style of the
late Princess Diana. The queen will tour an open market, a
centuries-old water village along the Brunei River and a health
clinic that caters to women and children.
	   She will also walk through the Jame' Asr Hassanil Bolkiah
Mosque, covering her head and removing her shoes in respect for
Islam, practiced by most indigenous Malays here.
	   The royal couple will also be feted in the grand style befitting
the Bolkiah dynasty, which dates back to the 14th century, and the
1,000-year-old British monarchy.
	   On Friday, they will attend a state banquet hosted by the sultan
and his two wives at the Istana Nurul Iman, said to be the world's
largest palace, with 1,788 suites.
	   The sultan _ estimated by Fortune magazine to have a personal
fortune of dlrs 37 billion _ has his own squadron of private jets.
The British royals arrived aboard a chartered British Airways
Boeing 777 jet.
	   The royals were accompanied by Foreign Secretary Robin Cook.
Unlike their rocky visit to India _ where they faced demands for an
apology over a 1919 British massacre _ the Brunei visit will be
tightly orchestrated and little controversy should emerge.
	   Brunei Darussalam, or ``abode of peace,'' is as docile as its
formal name and the sultan demand. Alcohol is forbidden. The
British commodore of the yacht club was arrested last month for
having smuggled whiskey aboard his boat. Criticizing royalty
borders on treason.
	   The kingdom has been under a state of emergency since 1962, when
parliament was scrapped by royal fiat after Brunei's first free
elections swept an anti-monarchist party to power.
	   The British royal visit to neighboring Malaysia, beginning
Sunday, could get more feisty as the just-sacked deputy prime
minister there has provoked a groundswell of hostility against the
17-year leadership of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.

Report lambasts S.African sports as ``lily-white''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Once hailed as a way to heal
racial wounds, sports in South Africa became the subject of a
racially charged debate Thursday after a government report labeled
many top governing bodies as bastions of white rule.
	   ``Development and Affirmative Action in Sport,'' drawn up by
parliament's sports committee, lashed out at those it concluded
were doing little to train and encourage black players.
	   It listed mainstream games such as rugby, cricket and tennis as
being worthy of particular criticism, as well as netball, rowing,
motor sports, canoeing and hockey.
	   ``Management structures still reflect the old order, with blacks
sidelined from decision-making positions,'' the reports said.
	   Going on to say many local and national teams were still
``lily-white,'' it added there was also ``a total disrespect for
the sports culture that used to exist in the black communities.''
	   National Party lawmaker Abe Williams said the report's findings
were unhelpful.
	   ``There is a lot of political interference in sport. I can't see
there is ever going to be peace in sport with this sort of thing,''
said Williams, whose party ruled under apartheid.
	   Mohamed Sheik, development head of the South African Tennis
Association, said the report was unfair. ``We are making sure that
black people are being encouraged,'' he said.
	   In the months after 1994's all-race elections ended apartheid,
sports was seen as a way of uniting the country's races.
	   Though most blacks hate rugby as a symbol of white domination,
President Nelson Mandela has tried to use the sport to promote
reconciliation. To show his support during the 1995 World Cup,
Mandela attended the final game wearing a national Springbok team
jersey and attracted the cheers of thousands of whites in the
stands.
	   However, since then sport has often been a source of division.
	   Mandela became involved in a bitter dispute with South African
Rugby Football Union president Louis Luyt over the slow pace of
transformation. Luyt eventually resigned but only after Mandela was
forced to appear in court to defend a government commission probing
racism in the game.
	   The report, released Wednesday by the African National
Congress-dominated committee, continues to criticize SARFU, which
now has a black president, saying that it is still controlled by
whites and ignores talented black players.
	   No one from SARFU was immediately available for comment.
	   Sports listed as having made progress included athletics,
soccer, baseball, table tennis, basketball, karate and squash.

Dow off 204 as world markets retreat dashed hopes for global rate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
cut &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ U.S. stocks plunged Thursday after investors in
Asia and Europe pushed markets lower on Alan Greenspan's denial
that world finance leaders had agreed to cut interest rates.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 204.68 to 7,884.84 in
early trading. The drop of 2.5 percent followed a 2.4 percent fall
in Japan's main index to a 12-year low and drop or more than 5
percent in Paris. London's main index was down 3.4 percent.
	   Up until Thursday morning, the Dow had managed to eke out a
181.53 point gain for the year. Its four straight days of gains, a
6.2 percent climb through Wednesday, was the longest winning streak
since a five-day rise in June. Even with that gain, however, as
today's session began the Dow still was down 13.4 percent from the
record 9,337.97 reached July 17.
	   Broader indicators also fell.
	   Greenspan's comments Wednesday had little effect on U.S. markets
and the Dow finished the day 65.39 points higher on a late rally.
But overseas, investors were more disappointed about the dimmer
outlook for an international move to stimulate sinking economies by
cutting interest rates.
	   Speculation of a coordinated round of rate cuts started Monday
when finance ministers and central bank presidents of the world's
seven richest countries released a joint statement saying they
needed to work together to deal with the world financial crisis.
	   The anticipation of a round of rate cuts was heightened when
President Clinton said Monday that the world's major industrial
powers should abandon fears of inflation and unite to spur economic
growth.
	   But testifying Wednesday before the House Banking Committee,
Greenspan responded to a question by saying: ``I can safely say
that at the moment there is no endeavor to coordinate interest rate
cuts.''

Hospital mix-up ends in death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A patient undergoing a heart operation has died
after a saline bag that went empty pumped air into the bloodstream,
hospital officials said Thursday.
	   Despite resuscitation, the patient developed chest pains and
died Monday about two hours after the operation began, public
Grantham Hospital said in a statement. The empty bag was replaced
but air bubbles had already seeped into the tubing, it said.
	   The hospital notified the family of the death and, after an
initial investigation, apologized Thursday.
	   The death is the latest in a string of hospital blunders, some
of which were fatal.
	   The blunders have rattled confidence in Hong Kong's public and
private hospitals, which previously boasted health care standards
that were among the highest in the world.
	   Last month, three kidney patients died when contaminated water
was pumped into dialysis machines. The investigation team has yet
to disclose its report on the cause of the mix-up.
	   In April, a painkiller that could harm both mother and fetus was
injected into 526 pregnant women after a hospital pharmacist failed
to verify the drug's contents.
	   Last year, an 84-year-old woman died after staff mixed up tubes
and pumped oxygen into her blood instead of into the air cushion
under her neck.
	   Soon afterward, a student nurse in an intensive care unit
mistakenly connected a nutrition pack to an intravenous line,
sending milk into a patient's circulation.
	   The Hospital Authority, which runs public hospitals in the
territory, has appointed a two-member independent investigation
into the latest death, government-run Radio Hong Kong reported.
	   The authority's spokesman Ko Wing-man told the radio that the
operation, coronary angioplasty, performed on heart patients, is
fairly standard.

Report: Three arrested in embezzlement scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Three people have been arrested in a high-profile
case involving accusations that banks embezzled dlrs 237 million in
government funds that had been intended for supplying fighter
aircraft to India, a news report said Thursday.
	   Russian prosecutors have been investigating accusations that
Unikombank, one of the country's largest banks, and Andrei Vavilov,
former deputy finance minister and now adviser to the gas monopoly
Gazprom, diverted dlrs 512 million in government funds in two
separate deals in 1996 and early 1997. The aircraft deal alone was
worth dlrs 237 million, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Both Unikombank and Vavilov denied the allegations. Vavilov has
been among those mentioned as a possible finance minister in the
new government, and he held meetings with top government officials
on Thursday.
	   Two arrests were announced earlier this month in connection with
the deal involving the sale of MiG fighter aircraft to India.
	   ITAR-Tass, which cited an unidentified source in the Prosecutor
General's office in its report of a third arrest Thursday, gave no
additional details.

Fighting resumes in north as Western efforts intensify
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As the United States and its
European allies intensified efforts to end the crisis in Kosovo,
Serb forces and ethnic Albanian rebels fought Thursday in the
heretofore peaceful north of the province.
	   Clashes between the defiant guerrillas and Serb security forces
resumed Thursday, a day after the government attacked one of the
last rebel strongholds. The sides reported a total of 17 people
were injured in battles about 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of
Pristina, the provincial capital.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, is fighting the Serbs to gain
independence of the Kosovo province, where hundreds of people have
been killed and more than 300,000 displaced since late February. On
Wednesday, the KLA said it would reject any peace deal that does
not free the predominantly ethnic Albanian region from rule by
Serbia, the dominant partner in the Yugoslav federation.
	   In an apparent test of ethnic Albanian opinion, a newspaper
close to the moderate leadership on Thursday published a U.S.
proposal for Kosovo that would grant the region a level of
self-rule.
	   A Western diplomat, speaking Thursday on condition of anonymity,
confirmed the authenticity of the proposal made by U.S. envoy
Christopher Hill, but downplayed it as ``only a starting point.''
	   The three-year accord, published in the daily Koha Ditore,
refers to Kosovo as a ``territory'' that would have its own
parliament and executive powers, local police and judicial system.
Kosovo would be represented in the Serbian government and the
Yugoslav parliament, but federal authorities could not influence
the work of local officials, the daily reported.
	   Publication of the document could represent an attempt by the
pacifist Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova, to test public sentiments
about cutting a deal that falls short of independence from Serbia.
	   Like most ethnic Albanians, Rugova also wants independence. But
the idea has been ruled out by the West and by Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, who stripped the province of autonomy in 1989.
	   Northern Kosovo, where fighting started Wednesday, has in past
months been largely peaceful. It is believed to be one of the two
remaining rebel strongholds. The other one is in the central
Drenica area.
	   The pro-government Media Center reported that four policemen
were wounded in Wednesday fighting, two seriously.
	   The ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Information Center said 13 ethnic
Albanians were injured. It claimed four villages were burned to the
ground, and two others were under fire while advancing Serb forces
looted ethnic Albanian houses. Some 10,000 people have been
reported on the run.
	   Fearing a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo as winter approaches,
the United States and its European allies again raised the
possibility of NATO action to end the fighting.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said in Washington that NATO
planning and consulting have advanced, while State Department
spokesman James Foley said resolve among member countries is
increasing.
	   ``There is a growing sense of urgency,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, diplomatic sources reported that Britain and France
have begun preliminary discussions with Security Council members to
seek a peaceful resolution to the Kosovo conflict. Details of the
resolution were sketchy, particularly about the use of force.
	   So far, little action has been taken on Kosovo because of
divisions among the U.N. Security Council over the use of force.
Russia, a permanent member with veto rights, opposes it.

Floods wash over southern Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Heavy rainfall flooded the White Nile,
threatening the welfare of thousands of southern Sudanese already
suffering from war and hunger, an aid group said Thursday.
	   Many people in Eastern Equatoria, where the river burst its
banks, have lost nearly all of their possessions, said David
Verboom, project director for Swiss-based MEDAIR.
	   They are camping in the bush with just a few pots, some goats
and chickens, and a little salvaged food. Crops are rotting in the
fields, and livestock were killed, he said.
	   Exposed to the elements, people are catching colds, respiratory
infection and fevers. Contaminated water is spreading diarrhea,
Verboom said. Swarms of mosquitoes, which breed in swamps, attack
at night, spreading malaria.
	   Many southerners already were living precariously even before
the flood because of the ravages of a 15-year war waged by mostly
Christians and animists in the south for greater autonomy from the
Arab, Muslim-dominated government in the north.
	   Hunger is a persistent problem, worsened this year by drought
followed by flooding. A famine that swept through Bahr el Ghazal
province is subsiding, but too many people are still dying of
hunger, the United Nations said last week.
	   About 1.5 million people have died in fighting and famines in
Sudan since 1983.
	   MEDAIR said it was providing blankets, tarps and mosquito nets
to about 8,000 families in the worst affected areas. About 19,000
households are in need.
	   Local residents said the flood was as bad as one in 1960, when
it took six years for waters to recede.
	   Airstrips and roads are submerged, complicating the delivery of
supplies, Verboom said.
	   Flooding and torrential rains in northern and central Sudan have
driven 30,000 people from their homes and left 25 people dead, a
government official said Wednesday

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli motorists opened fire on
Palestinian high school students Thursday, killing one and wounding
another, witnesses and doctors said.
	   The witnesses said the motorists shot without provocation. In
the past, Israelis driving in the West Bank have opened fire to
repulse Palestinian stone throwers.
	   The shooting occurred around noon in the West Bank village of
Beitunia. Witnesses said a group of about 10 high school students
was walking along the main road on their way home from school when
a Ford with Israeli license plates pulled up next to them.
	   Passengers in the Ford rolled down their windows and began
firing from a pistol and a submachine gun, said Raed Abdel Rahman,
17, one of the students who escaped injury.
	   ``Everybody started to jump and take cover,'' said Abdel Rahman.
	   The wounded were taken to nearby Ramallah Hospital.
	   Iyad Hashem, 17, who was hospitalized in critical condition with
a stomach wound, died at the hospital about an hour later, said
hospital director Shauke Harb.
	   Fifteen-year-old Issa Jabarin was in stable condition with a
stomach wound, hospital officials said.
	   Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath said he believed the
shooting was carried out by Jewish settlers who he said had a long
record of violence aginst Palestinians.
	   He said the Israeli government was not meeting its
responsibility to rein in the settlers and was ``allowing settlers
to continue this violence without punishment.''

EU poll shows support for euro at all-time high
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Support among Europeans for their
soon-to-be-launched common currency is at an all-time high, with 60
percent of European Union citizens backing the euro, according to
an EU poll published Thursday.
	   Support is even stronger in the 11 countries where the euro will
be launched on Jan. 1. Sixty-six percent there said they supported
the EU single currency and just 23 percent opposed it, the
Eurobarometer survey said.
	   In the nations staying out of the first wave of the currency
union _ Britain, Sweden, Greece and Denmark _ only 39 percent of
citizens supported the euro.
	   Across all 15 EU member nations, the survey taken in April and
May found fast-growing support for the euro, with 60 percent of
citizens in favor of it and 28 percent against. Support was up
almost 10 points from the last time the semi-annual poll was taken
in October-November 1997.
	   ``This increase ... represents the first truly significant
improvement since 1993 (when the poll began), with opposition to
the single currency falling below 30 percent for the first time,''
proclaimed the European Commission which ordered the poll.
	   Italians are the biggest supporters of the euro, with 83 percent
backing it as a replacement for the lira. Danes are the least
enthusiastic, with 34 percent in favor.
	   The Commission, the EU executive body, noted that in Austria,
Finland and Germany support for the euro was above 50 percent for
the first time, with Germany coming in at 51 percent.
	   Finns had the biggest change of heart, with 53 percent in favor
of the euro, compared to 33 percent in the last survey.
	   The poll also showed an increased in support for the EU as a
whole, with backing for membership of the Union rising above 50
percent _ to 51 percent _ for the first time since 1996.
	   The Irish and Dutch are the EU's biggest supporters with over
three-quarters of them stating their countries' membership of the
Union is a ``good thing.''
	   The three most recent members of the EU club are the least
contented. Four years after they joined support for EU membership,
support is now down to 32 percent in Sweden, and 36 percent in
Finland and Austria.
	   EU citizens don't appear keen to welcome in their eastern
neighbors. Just 44 percent said they approve of the Union's plans
to take on new members from among the former communist bloc.
	   Hungary was the most popular candidate, with 53 percent,
followed by Poland and the Czech Republic. Just 39 percent of
citizens from the current EU nations thought Romania or Slovenia
should be allowed in.
	   The survey was based on interviews with about 1,000 citizens in
each of the EU nations. Margins of error were estimated at between
1.9 and 3.1 percent.

UNCTAD criticizes IMF, urges adoption of U.S. bankruptcy laws
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ If it is to be effective, the International
Monetary Fund must reform the way it tries to help countries in
financial trouble, the U.N. trade and development agency said
Thursday.
	   Financial turmoil in East Asia has laid bare some of the
problems in the conventional IMF approach to managing crises
triggered by the sudden withdrawal of foreign capital and mass
sales of local currencies, the U.N. Conference on Trade and
Development said.
	   The IMF has coordinated emergency funding for troubled economies
in Indonesia and elsewhere in Asia, but its efforts have usually
come too late to stop the recipient country's currency from
plunging in value, according to the 229-page report.
	   The IMF's slowness in providing funds can enable speculative
attacks on a currency to evolve into full-blown capital flight and
insolvency, the report said.
	   A failure to quickly provide enough cash and credit in an
economy will eventually lead to widespread defaults and
bankruptcies, UNCTAD warned.
	   The report says governments can forestall bankruptcies if
international institutions like the IMF adopt elements of U.S.
bankruptcy law.
	   The U.S. law gives a financially troubled company breathing
space to restructure its finances. It aims to keep creditors at bay
long enough for a company to get back on a sound financial footing
and continue operating before creditors ``grab'' assets and force
it into liquidation.
	   ``Procedures of this kind would meet the need once again evident
in the East Asian crisis to safeguard debtor countries from the
overreaction of financial markets,'' the study said.
	   The IMF's strategies include lending governments money to bail
out troubled banks and other companies as a way to protect
creditors and prevent defaults. But this approach enables lenders
to avoid facing the full consequences of their decisions, the
report said.
	   ``More importantly, the sums required have been increasing and
are reaching the limits of political acceptability in countries
providing them,'' it said.
	   IMF Deputy Director Stanley Fischer said Sunday that record
lending to handle financial crises in Asia and Russia has depleted
IMF reserves to historic lows.
	   No more than dlrs 9 billion is available for loans from the
IMF's regular reserve fund, compared to 26 billion in 1996.

EU clears dlrs 5.7 million in aid for Mali
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union on Thursday approved
5 million European currency units (dlrs 5.7 million) in
humanitarian aid to help resettle refugees and displaced people in
Mali.
	   The EU's executive body, the European Commission, said the
emergency aid will go to people affected by fighting in the
northern part of the country.
	   ``After five years of conflict between rebel Tuareg factions and
the army, people are gradually returning to Northern Mali, but
their prospect are very poor, given poverty, the level of
destruction and the effects of drought'' the Commission said in a
statement.
	   EU's aid will be used to ``provide improved water supplies and
food for both people and livestock, with the aim of making people
self-sufficient.''
	   The funds will be channeled through the Red Cross and other
humanitarian organizations for a project covering the next six to
nine months. The EU said it is the biggest donor of aid to Mali.

UEFA restricts number of spectators at Cup Winners match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Only 2,520 spectators will be allowed at
Bulgaria's national stadium Thursday to watch the European Cup
Winners Cup match between Levski Sofia and Copenhagen, because most
seats don't have back supports.
	   An inspection by the European soccer association UEFA on
Wednesday found that in only 2,520 of the state-run Vasil Levski
stadium's 50,000 seats were chairs with backs as required.
	   ``The reason is lack of funds,'' said Plamen Krastev, official
the government Committee on Youth Physical Training and Sports.
``One seat costs about 70 German marks (40 dollars).''
	   The state news agency BTA said riot police would be dispatched
around the stadium to prevent angry soccer fans from trying to
enter.
	   Krastev said the government was expected to earmark money for
more seats with backs in the next eight months.
	   The only stadium that matches international standards is
Neftochimik in the Black Sea city of Burgas, 400 kilometers (250
miles) east of Sofia.
	   The restriction was likely to anger Levski's numerous fans, the
daily Sega reported Thursday.
	   It said Levski officials promised to install a video wall at a
near smaller stadium, so that the most ardent fans be able to watch
the game there.

BayStars beat Giants 6-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Robert Rose singled home two runs and Hiroki Nomura
gave up only three hits as the Central League's front-running
Yokohama BayStars beat the Yomiuri Giants 6-1 at Tokyo Dome
Thursday.
	   Rose, formerly with the California Angels, also hit a single and
scored in the seventh on Hitoshi Nakane's single. Nomura is 12-8
this season.
	   The BayStars are 3 1/2 games ahead of the second-place Chunichi
Dragons.
	   The Yakult Swallows edged the Dragons 4-3 in 10 innings at
Tokyo's Jingu Stadium. The Dragons ended their winning streak at
four.
	   The Dragons tied 3-3 on Takeshi Yamasaki's two-run home run in
the ninth, but the Swallows scored the winning run in the bottom of
the 10th when Toshifumi Baba drew a bases-loaded walk from Yasuyuki
Sato (2-2). Yamasaki has 26 homers.
	   At Koshien Stadium, Taiwanese Yasuaki Taiho, Cheng Tai-feng,
drove in all three runs with a two-run home run in the first inning
and a one-double in the sixth as the Hanshin Tigers beat the
Hiroshima Toyo Carp 3-1.
	   Taiho's 17th homer of the season came after former Chicago Cubs
player Dave Hansen hit a single.
	   In the Pacific League, Fumiya Nishiguchi scattered six hits and
Ken Suzuki ignited a two-run second inning with a double, leading
the Seibu Lions to a 4-2 win over the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks at Seibu
Dome.
	   The second-place Hawks, who ended their winning streak at five,
are a half game behind the front-running Nippon Ham Fighters who
were idle Thursday along with the Orix BlueWave.
	   At Osaka Dome, the Kintetsu Buffaloes and the Chiba Lotte
Marines tied 2-2 in 12 innings. Under Pacific League rules, games
are limited to 12 innings.

Dow plunges in world market retreat on dashed hopes for global rate

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ U.S. stocks plunged Thursday after investors in
Asia and Europe pushed markets lower on Alan Greenspan's denial
that world finance leaders had agreed to cut interest rates.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average quickly fell 205.71 points
before recovering some of its lost ground. It was down 184.08 at
7,905.70 in morning trading.
	   Broader indicators also were sharply lower.
	   The Dow's drop of 2.3 percent followed a 2.4 percent fall in
Tokyo's main index to a 12-year low. Near the end of the European
trading day, major indicators were down 4.7 percent in Paris, 3.4
percent in London and 4.2 percent in Frankfurt, Germany.
	   In Brazil, the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange tripped the
circuit-breaker in the first hour of trading when the Bovespa Index
fell 10 percent. The market opened sharply lower, but losses
deepened after U.S. shares also dropped at the opening.
	   Up until Thursday morning, the Dow had managed to eke out a
181.53 point gain for the year. Its four straight days of gains, a
6.2 percent climb through Wednesday, was the longest winning streak
since a five-day rise in June. Even with that gain, however, as
today's session began the Dow still was down 13.4 percent from the
record 9,337.97 reached July 17.
	   Greenspan's comments Wednesday had little effect on U.S. markets
and the Dow finished the day 65.39 points higher on a late rally.
But overseas, investors were more disappointed about the dimmer
outlook for an international move to stimulate sinking economies by
cutting interest rates.
	   Speculation of a coordinated round of rate cuts started Monday
when finance ministers and central bank presidents of the world's
seven richest countries released a joint statement saying they
needed to work together to deal with the world financial crisis.
	   Just before that statement was released, President Clinton was
saying that the world's major industrial powers should abandon
fears of inflation and unite to spur economic growth.
	   But testifying Wednesday before the House Banking Committee,
Greenspan responded to a question by saying: ``I can safely say
that at the moment there is no endeavor to coordinate interest rate
cuts.''

Rebels announce capture of garrison town in south

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with SPLA claiming capture of Liria,
CHANGES overline. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudanese rebels announced on Thursday
that they captured the garrison town of Liria, which is near the
southern provincial capital of Juba.
	   The Sudan People's Liberation Army said Liria and two smaller
army outposts fell to rebel troops on Wednesday. At Liria, it said,
``government forces abandoned the town and fled in total disarray''
	   The rebel statement said the fleeing soldiers left behind two
tanks, an armored personnel carrier and several trucks mounted with
machine guns.
	   Liria is 72 kilometers (45 miles) southeast of Juba, which is
controlled by the government. The other military posts were nearby.
	   The rebel statement said the move isolated the army camp at
Torit, southeast of Juba, and that the rebels had begun operations
to take it.
	   The SPLA has been fighting since 1982 to try to win autonomy for
the south's Christian and animist population from the Islamic
north.
	   On Tuesday, the government of Lt. Gen. Omar el-Bashir said it
had repulsed a rebel attack against Liria that had involved Ugandan
troops. It said the army killed 50 Ugandan troops and southern
rebels.
	   On Thursday, el-Bashir demanded that Ugandan forces be
withdrawn, the official Sudan News Agency reported.
	   SUNA also quoted Riak Machar, a former SPLA commander who has
joined el-Bashir's government, as saying the involvement of Ugandan
troops was a violation of non-aggression pacts between Sudan and
Uganda.
	   Machar termed it ``a step back by Uganda'' from its commitments.
	   Uganda severed relations with Khartoum in 1995 after accusing
Sudan of harboring Ugandan rebels seeking to overthrow the
government. In turn, Sudan has accused Uganda _ along with Eritrea
and Ethiopia _ of aiding the Sudanese rebels.

Indian boy killed in Kashmir; Pakistani shells hit Indian barracks

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ Police in the troubled Kashmir province
said Indian troops killed 10-year-old boy who was caught in
crossfire during a clash with Muslim militants, but witnesses said
the firing near a school was unprovoked.
	   ``We do not know why they opened fire,'' said Salima, one of 10
people injured in the violence in Nowpora Pattan, a village 35
kilometers (20 miles) north of Srinagar, the summer capital of
Indian-held Kashmir.
	   Also Thursday, the army reported that three of its barracks in
Kashmir were damaged by shells from neighboring Paksitan overnight
near Kargil, 225 kilometers (140 miles) northwest of Srinagar.
	   Major. P. Purshotam, speaking at army headquarters in Srinagar,
said the barracks were empty at the time and there were no
casualties in the firing. He said Indian troops fired back.
	   Further south in Kashmir, Indian border forces reported
heavier-than-normal firing from Pakistan in the last few days, but
no casualties. A spokesman for the Border Security Forces, speaking
on customary condition of anonymity, accused Pakistan of firing to
cover the infiltration of guerrillas into India.
	   India accuses Pakistan of arming and training Muslim militants
who have waged a nine-year separatist campaign in Indian-held
Kashmir, predominately Hindu India's only Muslim-majority state.
Pakistan says it provides only morale support.
	   Firing across divided Kashmir is routine and rarely causes
casualties. But in July and August, hundreds of people in Pakistan
and India, most of them civilians, were killed in one of the
heaviest and most prolonged peacetime border duels between the two
countries.
	   Pakistan and India have fought two wars over Kashmir in the 51
years since the two independent countries were formed out of a
British empire. The region is divided between them, and both
countries claim it all.

Former finance minister goes on trial for fraud
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A former finance minister accused of
embezzlement, fraud and acting in bad faith in a savings fund
similar to a pyramid scheme, went on trial Thursday.
	   Prosecutors have accused George Danielescu of using money from
an investment fund called SAFI for his own ends or to favor a
company in which he had a personal interest.
	   Danielescu was present at the trial, but is not expected to
testify until spring, his lawyer Viorel Stanu said. Thousands of
people who lost money are expected to testify first.
	   Danielescu was finance minister from 1991-92. Although he is not
a member of parliament, he belongs to the Liberal party which is
part of the ruling coalition.
	   Between 1993 and 1996, Danielescu, who was manager of a savings
institute, diverted 167 billion lei, at the time worth up to dlrs
100 million according to rapidly changing exchange rates,
prosecutors have alleged.
	   Acting as an investment agent, his SAFI enterprise received
money from private investors on the understanding it would invest
the sums in other companies at interest rates of up to 40 percent a
month.
	   While in pyramid schemes that collapsed in recent years from
Russia to Albania investors could withdraw their investment plus
fabulous interest money after several months, the contracts signed
by Danielescu did not allow early withdrawals.

Two miners die in accidents in Ukraine; 278 killed this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Two miners died this week in work accidents
in Ukraine, raising the total number of workers killed on the job
this year to 278, officials and union leaders said Thursday.
	   One miner was killed during repair work at a mine in the western
town of Novovolynsk on Wednesday, and another died Wednesday night
in a rockslide at a mine in Makiyivka in eastern Ukraine, the
Emergency Situations Ministry said.
	   The Independent Miners' Union put the number of miners killed in
accidents at Ukraine's deteriorating coal mines this year at 278.
Some 290 workers were killed in accidents last year.
	   The number of job fatalities has been steadily increasing in
recent years because mines lack the funds needed to modernize
equipment and improve safety conditions.
	   The worst single accident this year was in April, when a methane
gas blast killed 63 workers at a mine in the eastern Donetsk
region.

American World War II bomb defused
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RENNES, France (AP) _ A 250-kg (114-pound) World War II bomb
dropped by Allied American forces on this Brittany city was defused
Thursday by experts in a delicate operation at the construction
site where it was found.
	   The bomb, dropped in 1943 and uncovered during building
construction, was in functioning order, local officials said.
	   Inhabitants of some 60 buildings and shops in the area were
evacuated before explosives experts moved onto the site. They then
set about their delicate task of defusing the bomb -- first
dismantling the outer casing, the charge then the fuse and the
detonator.
	   Bomb from World War II, and even World War I, are still found
around France, often during a construction project.

Socialist group pulls out of coalition government billed as India's
</HEADLINE>
most corrupt &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PATNA, India (AP) _ Irked over plans to stall creation of a
state for tribespersons in northern India, a tiny socialist group
withdrew support Thursday from a coalition government in Bihar,
considered India's most corrupt administration.
	   The withdrawl of support by a splinter group of the Jharkhand
Mukti Morcha Party will not affect the government of Chief Minister
Rabri Devi, an illiterate housewife who succeded her husband to the
highest elected seat in government 14 months ago in a complex
political drama.
	   Devi immediately announced she would expand her cabinet,
inducting 10 lawmakers who had earlier broken away from another
party to support her coalition.
	   Bihar is widely considered the most lawless state in India. Most
of the lawmakers in the state legislature have criminal records and
are frequently known to switch political loyalty in return for
hefty bribes.
	   Devi's husband, Laloo Prasad Yadav, a colorful politician
resigned as chief minister last year after a court charged him with
siphoning off millions of dollars in government funds. The case is
still under trial. Yadav immediately appointed his wife as chief
minister but he continues to weild enormous power.
	   On Thursday, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha said it will no longer
support the government because Yadav flip flopped on creating
another state for tribespersons. The creation of the new state in
southern Bihar had been supported by almost all political groups.
	   Last week Yadav suddenly announced he will oppose the plan
because a new state will promote regional imbalance and only
support his rivals, the right-wing party that is in power in New
Delhi.
	   The Bharatiya Janata Party, which is in power in New delhi,
wants to create Vananchal out of 18 districts in Bihar, where a
tribal campaign for a separate state has raged for years.
	   Yadav feels that opposing the plan will boost his popularity in
the state and help him consolidate his hold over the electorate,
most of which is illiterate.
	   The government in New Delhi has been trying for months to
dismiss Devi's government, saying law and order has deterirated in
Bihar after she came to power. She says the situation is no worse
than in the rest of the country and in states governed by the
Bharatiya Janata.
	   Southern Bihar is home to 28 million triberspersons from
different groups. They want a separate state where they say they
will not be discriminated against by governments run by upper caste
people from the northern districts.

Rice trucks to Bangladesh looted
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CALCUTTA, India (AP) _ Police in an eastern Indian state have
arrested 16 people on charges of looting trucks carrying rice to
Bangladesh, where floods have left hundreds of people dead and some
35 million others homeless, an official said Thursday.
	   The rice was bought by Bangladesh traders from the wholesale
market in Calcutta in neighboring India.
	   Every day, hundreds of trucks carrying food regularly cross into
Bangladesh, usually without any problem.
	   But on Tuesday, unidentified men in villages near the Indian
border with Bangladesh stopped seven trucks and looted more than
300, 000 kilograms (660,000 pounds) of rice under cover of
darkness.
	   Police quickly raided the villages, about 100 kilometers (65
miles) east of Calcutta and recovered most of the rice, said
Ramakrishna Roy, a top police officer.
	   Police also arrested 16 people on charges of looting, he said.
	   The rice was not part of the relief 200,000 tons of food that
India is sending to Bangladesh to help the government provide
relief to the flood-affected people, Roy said in a telephone
interview.

Sudan calls on Ugandan troops to withdraw from southern Sudan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS in 8th graf spelling of Ugandan president's name.

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ President Omar el-Bashir called on
Ugandan forces, which Khartoum claims are helping Sudanese rebels,
to withdraw from southern Sudan, the official Sudan News Agency
Thursday.
	   It also quoted a top government official in southern Sudan as
saying that Tuesday's Ugandan-led attack in the south was a
violation of non-aggression agreements between Sudan and Uganda.
	   ``This rebel-backed Ugandan aggression... a step back by Uganda
from its previous... commitments,'' said Riak Machar, head of the
government's Southern States Coordination Council.
	   The Sudanese army said Tuesday that its troops had repulsed a
Ugandan-led assault in the towns of Liria, Torit and Jabalain in
the Eastern Equatoria province, which borders Uganda. It said that
its troops killed more than 50 Ugandan government troops and
Sudanese rebels.
	   However, a government-run Ugandan newspaper quoted a spokesman
for the rebel group, Sudan Peoples Liberation Army rebel, as saying
its forces killed 40 Ugandan rebels in Tuesday's clashes.
	   Kampala and Khartoum accuse each other of supporting the other's
rebels.
	   Southern Sudanese rebels are believed to receive support from
Ethiopia and Eritrea, as well as Uganda.
	   Machar, who also serves as the government's envoy for talks with
Uganda, said that Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni had agreed to
the basics of a non-aggression agreement, which has yet to be
signed.
	   Machar said that the Ugandan assault was prompted by the United
States as ``a warning to its allies who neighbor Sudan'' not to
normalize relations with Khartoum, the independent daily, Akhbar
Al-Youm said Thursday.

Habibie, ministers under Suharto to be investigated over
</HEADLINE>
corruption &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ An investigation into possible
corruption during former President Suharto's rule will be expanded
to include all officials who served under him, including the new
president, the official Antara news agency said Thursday.
	   Suharto, 77, who quit in May after a wave of riots and protests,
has been accused of illegally enriching himself during his
three-decade rule and of hiding millions of dollars in foreign bank
accounts. He has denied wrongdoing.
	   Although the investigation will cover all officials including
Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, looking into Suharto's
assets and bank accounts will come first, Minister of Justice
Muladi was quoted as saying Thursday by Antara.
	   Early this week, Habibie ordered Suharto's family and associates
be questioned.
	   One of Suharto's six children, Bambang Trihatmodjo, has been
banned from leaving the country as police prepare to question him
over the collapse of a bank partly owned by him.
	   The investigative team headed by Attorney General Muhammad Andi
Ghalib includes National Police Chief Lt. Gen. Rusmanhadi and a
senior government finance official.
	   The team has invited anyone with information to come forward.
Ghalib has said he hopes to start the investigation this month.

Critical stockholders say fusion would cost 100,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ A day before Daimler-Benz shareholders
vote on the company's planned merger with U.S.-based Chrysler
Corp., a critical shareholders group predicted 100,000 jobs would
be lost in the fusion.
	   Gerd Rathgeb, the works council chief at Daimler's Unterturkheim
operation, charged Thursday that the fused company's push for more
profits ``would be at the expense of the workforce,'' despite
Daimler chairman Juergen Schrempp's repeated promise that no jobs
would be lost.
	   Daimler employs some 300,000 people worldwide and Chrysler
122,000. Both companies have said the merger would not bring
layoffs or plant closures.
	   Rathgeb's group of 250 shareholders also charged that the only
winners of a merger with Chrysler will be top Daimler-Benz
managers, whose salaries are expected to be boosted to match those
of Chrysler's top team.
	   ``While the board preaches to us to tighten our belts, they rake
off more for themselves,'' a group statement said.
	   German executives traditionally earn far less than their U.S.
counterparts, and that issue could make for heated debate at
Friday's shareholders meeting, which is expected to run late into
the night.
	   Still, analysts say the shareholders probably won't let that
argument stop the merger.
	   ``They will only hurt themselves if they vote against it,'' said
Tom Aney of the Bayerische Hypo- and Vereinsbank in Munich.
	   Last year, Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton took home dlrs 16
million in salary, bonus and stock options. His counterpart,
Juergen Schrempp, earned about an eighth of that.
	   Despite protests, Daimler will likely raise manager compensation
to Chrysler's levels in the medium term, analysts said. If
Daimler's pay isn't competitive, the executives will defect to
competitors, Aney said.
	   If the deal goes through, Daimler-Benz shareholders would
control 57 percent of DaimlerChrysler, and Chrysler shareholders 43
percent.
	   Seventy-five percent of Daimler shares on an undiluted basis
must be exchanged for shares in the new company for the deal to go
through. But the two automakers want an exchange of at least 90
percent, which will allow them to use the more favorable ``pooling
of interests'' accounting method.

Kidnappers demand ransom for Italian priest kidnapped in
</HEADLINE>
Philippines &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ An unidentified group is demanding
20 million pesos (dlrs 459,700) in ransom for Italian priest
Luciano Benedetti and is threatening to kill him if it is not paid,
military and police officials said Thursday.
	   Police Chief Superintendent Panfilo Lacson, chief of the
presidential anti-crime task force, said authorities are still
trying to determine the authenticity of the ransom letter.
	   The letter was said to have been addressed to Benedetti's
superior, the Rev. Giulio Mariani of his missionary order, the
Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions.
	   Mariani said he did not receive a ransom note.
	   Benedetti, 54, of Ravenna, Italy, was abducted Sept. 8 from a
church in the remote town of Sibuco in Zamboanga del Norte
province, together with 12 Filipinos. The Filipinos were later
freed unharmed.
	   Benedetti was assigned to the Philippines in 1977 and is one of
about 70 Italian priests in the southern Philippines.
	   Mariani said his order will follow the Philippine Roman Catholic
church policy of not paying ransom.
	   ``If we did pay for one, we would all be in danger ... we will
never be able to operate,'' Mariani said.
	   Benedetti has written a letter asking the military not to try to
rescue him because it could endanger his life.
	   No one has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping, but police
suspect the Muslim extremist group Abu Sayyaf.
	   Military and police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said they also suspect disgruntled members of another Muslim group,
the Moro National Liberation Front, which signed a peace pact with
the government in 1996.
	   Last year, former MNLF guerrillas kidnapped two foreign
missionaries in the southern Philippines demanding the government
release livelihood assistance promised for former rebels.

Pakistani police arrest hundreds in religious violence crackdown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistani police arrested at least 200
people Thursday in a crackdown on rival Islamic groups engaged in
an ongoing feud that has left scores of people dead throughout the
country.
	   The militant Sunni Muslim group Sipah-e-Sahaba, or Guardians of
the Friends of the Prophet, has threatened to storm jails to free
its members unless they are released by next week, the group's
spokesman Saifullah khallid told The Associated Press.
	   A key leader, Shoaib Nadeem, and three others members of the
Sunni group were murdered by four gunmen on a highway near
Islamabad on Sunday. The killing set off widespread demonstrations,
including militants setting fire to a Shiite mosque and three
houses in Wah Town, some 40 kilometers (24 miles) west of Islamabad
on Monday night.
	   About 200 Sunnis were arrested in those demonstrations on
Monday. Police said another 200 militants, including Sunni and
Shiites, were arrested on Thursday in the Lahore region.
	   Nadeem's group is suspected in the Sept. 8 murder of Murid
Hussein, a leader of a rival Shiite Muslim group called
Tehrik-e-Jafria Pakistan.
	   Tanvir Naqvi, a spokesman Tehrik-e-Jafria, said a leading member
of his group, former federal government minister Monir Gillani, was
among the Shiite's arrested in Lahore, about 240 kilometers (150
miles) south of Islamabad.
	   Nadeem's group is suspected in the Sept. 8 murder of Murid
Hussein, a leader of a rival Tehrik-e-Jafria Pakistan.
	   Militant Sunnis, the majority in Pakistan, and extremist Shiite
Muslims routinely kill each other a nationwide feud that has
intensified in recent years. Most Sunnis and minority Shiites are
moderate, however, and live together peacefully.

Mother blames daughter's friend in Gucci trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The mother of the ex-wife of Maurizio Gucci
testified Thursday that her daughter never seriously intended to
have the fashion tycoon killed. She blamed a friend for the
slaying.
	   The mother, Silvana Barbieri, admitted that her daughter openly
hated her ex-husband after their turbulent divorce and often asked
anyone who would listen if they could help her find a killer to
finish him off.
	   ``She said it as though she should say `let's go out for tea' --
I never gave any weight to her words,'' Barbieri said.
	   Maurizio Gucci was gunned down on the steps to his Milan office
March 27, 1995.
	   On trial are his ex-wife, Patrizia Reggiani Martinelli, her
friend, Pina Auriemma, and three others: the alleged triggerman,
the driver of the getaway car and an intermediary.
	   Auriemma has confessed to arranging the murder of Maurizio Gucci
at Reggiani Martinelli's insistence.
	   Reggiani Martinelli, who has pleaded innocent, testified in July
that Auriemma took it upon herself to have Gucci killed and then
blackmailed her for 500 million lire (dlrs 300,000) to keep quiet
about it.
	   The mother accused Auriemma of invading her daughter's life.
	   ``My daughter was like putty in her hands. Anything Auriemma
said, my daughter did,'' said Barbieri. ``She took care of
everything, from deciding where they would go on vacation to what
they would eat for dinner.''
	   The outcome of the trial may center on a court-ordered
psychiatric evaluation scheduled for Oct. 13. Reggiani Martinelli's
lawyers argue that she was incapable of issuing a mandate for
Maurizio Gucci's death following a brain tumor operation in 1992.
They claim the tumor had compromised her capacity for rational
judgment

Nepal's lawmaker come to blows in Parliament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Government ministers and opposition
lawmakers beat up each other and broke chairs and desks in
Parliament on Thursday over a bill to provide autonomy to local
government institutions.
	   The 49 lawmakers of the main opposition Communist Party of Nepal
(United Marxist-Leninist) has for the past one week disrupted
proceedings, demanding changes in the bill. But they do not have
the necessary strength in the 205-member parliament.
	   No one was seriously injured in the clashes, which lasted 25
minutes. The speaker then adjourned the house and the lawmakers
then intensified the violence.
	   The ruling Nepali Congress and its new partner, the Communist
Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist), together have 127 members. They
want the bill to be adopted in its original form.
	   As soon as the legislature met, the protesters moved out of
their seats and surrounded the House speaker. Guards tried to stop
them, in vain.
	   The communist lawmakers shoved government ministers aside and
pushed desks, crushing the deputy prime minister and the
communications minister.
	   Soon lawmakers were shouting abuses at each other and then began
to beat up each other, ripping shirts, breaking chairs and using
them as clubs.
	   Amidst the melee, Local Development Minister Keshav Lal Shrestha
presented the Bill and the ruling lawmakers approved it in a voice
vote. The legality of the move is being debated by both sides.
	   The bill was drafted last year in a bid to empower village and
district committees and municipalities, giving them more powers.
	   The opposition wants to retain a clause that will expel elected
councilors of local government bodies who switch allegiance to
another party. The government wants that provision scrapped.
	   The clause would also have cost the jobs of many lawmakers who
broke away from the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist)
earlier this year.
	   The government did not immediately comment on the incident. The
opposition said it was a conspiracy to end the multiparty democracy
in Nepal.
	   Speaker Ram Chandra Poudel called for a meeting later in the
night in his chamber of representatives of all the parties to
discuss the incident.

French sports minister wants Paris to host 2008 Olympic Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's sports minister on Thursday urged
officials not to ``waste any time'' in launching a Paris bid for
the 2008 Olympic Games.
	   Marie-George Buffet, speaking at a news conference to outline
the sports budget for 1999, said she met last week with Henri
Serandour, the head of France's Olympic Committee.
	   ``I asked him to make the necessary contacts to quickly confirm
this candidacy,'' Buffet said. ``We mustn't waste any time.''
	   France's credentials will not have been harmed by its successful
staging of the 1998 World Cup which won widespread praise and which
France went on to win.
	   Cities have until February 2000 to submit bids to the
International Olympic Committee, which is to select the host city
in 2001.
	   The declared candidates so far for 2008 are Toronto and Osaka,
Japan. Bids are also expected from previous candidates China;
Istanbul, Turkey; Seville, Spain, and Buenos Aires, Argentina.
	   France held the Olympics in Paris in 1900 and 1924. It has also
staged three Winter Olympics -- Chamonix, 1924; Grenoble, 1968, and
Albertville, 1992.
	   Lille, in northern France, failed in a bid to land the 2004
games, being staged in Athens, Greece.

UNCTAD criticizes IMF, urges adoption of U.S. bankruptcy laws
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES in 7th graf to say `... before any creditors can
``grab'' ...' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ If it is to be effective, the International
Monetary Fund must reform the way it tries to help countries in
financial trouble, the U.N. trade and development agency said
Thursday.
	   Financial turmoil in East Asia has laid bare some of the
problems in the conventional IMF approach to managing crises
triggered by the sudden withdrawal of foreign capital and mass
sales of local currencies, the U.N. Conference on Trade and
Development said.
	   The IMF has coordinated emergency funding for troubled economies
in Indonesia and elsewhere in Asia, but its efforts have usually
come too late to stop the recipient country's currency from
plunging in value, according to the 229-page report.
	   The IMF's slowness in providing funds can enable speculative
attacks on a currency to evolve into full-blown capital flight and
insolvency, the report said.
	   A failure to quickly provide enough cash and credit in an
economy will eventually lead to widespread defaults and
bankruptcies, UNCTAD warned.
	   The report says governments can forestall bankruptcies if
international institutions like the IMF adopt elements of U.S.
bankruptcy law.
	   The U.S. law gives a financially troubled company breathing
space to restructure its finances. It aims to keep creditors at bay
long enough for a company to get back on a sound financial footing
and continue operating before any creditors can ``grab'' assets and
force it into liquidation.

Malaysia restricts Singapore rescue, military flights

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia said Thursday that
Singaporean military and rescue planes were banned from its air
space starting Friday, escalating the tit-for-tat diplomatic
wrangle that has engaged the neighboring Southeast Asian countries
for weeks.
	   The Defense Ministry said that case-by-case permission is needed
for Singapore's military flights that previously had blanket
approval.
	   The flights include military jets from Paya Lebar Air Base
heading across southern Malaysia for training flights over the
South China Sea, aircraft passing into Malaysian air space as they
take off from Tengah Air Base, and search-and-rescue aircraft
flying above Malaysian territory.
	   The previous arrangement, with one country's military aircraft
flying at low altitude over another without warning, was highly
unusual.
	   The change was ``just a case of a nation's asserting its
sovereignty,'' said Prasun Sengupta of the Malaysia-based Asian
Defense Journal.
	   He said Singapore military aircraft can file a flight plan and
receive permission from Malaysia within a few hours, as is standard
with other countries.
	   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was quoted by the
Bernama news agency as saying the decision was ``permanent, not
temporary.''
	   He added that it was a way for Malaysia to ``take back our
territory bit by bit.'' The two countries were merged for 23 months
from 1963-65.
	   Defense Minister Syed Hamid told reporters, ``It is not an easy
decision. It was taken in the best interest of Malaysia.''
	   Hamid denied that the move was retaliation for the memoirs
published this week by Singapore's most powerful man, Senior
Minister Lee Kuan Yew, which has outraged Malaysian politicians.
	   In that book, Lee accused Malaysian leaders of the 1960s,
including Hamid's late father, of corruption and of inciting race
riots.
	   Mahathir acknowledged that Lee's book had hurt
Malaysian-Singaporean relations but denied that it prompted the
decision on the flights.
	   ``We decided on this much earlier,'' he said.
	   Relations between the two countries have had their ups and
downs. But in the past weeks, acrimony has been so sharp that
Singaporean athletes were booed by the Malaysian crowd during the
Commonwealth Games.
	   Malaysia withdrew from recent military exercises with Singapore,
the United States, Britain and Australia.
	   Singapore's Defense Ministry said its air force ``has
alternative arrangements to ensure that its operational
effectiveness is not compromised and that its training will not be
affected.''
	   It also said, without elaborating, that Malaysia had terminated
Thursday some bilateral defense arrangements dating to the early
1960s.
	   Singapore is a defense-conscious state that has to train its
pilots in Australia and the United States because it is so small.
	   ``I think this will be seen rather more seriously in Singapore
than in Malaysia,'' Bruce Gale of the Political and Economic Risk
Consultancy, a regional newsletter, said of the flight ban.
	   ``In Malaysia, they must just shrug their shoulders over this
one. Down in Singapore, they're more aware of how small the place
is, so maybe it suggests a real problem,'' Gale said in Singapore.

Concert `blackened' by rogue tickets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The Rolling Stones concert was the hottest
ticket in town. And now Greece's tax watchdog is putting the heat
on organizers.
	   A special tax squad says it discovered thousands of illegal
tickets for the sold-out Wednesday show attended by more than
75,000 fans at the Olympic Stadium.
	   ``I express my deepest regret because this businessman blackened
a top musical event with his tax behavior,'' Finance Ministry
Undersecretary Giorgos Dris was quoted as saying Thursday.
``Justice now has its say.''
	   According to the Finance Ministry, organizers Neo Revma
allegedly sold 8,000 tickets that weren't registered with
authorities. Officials claim the income from the tickets _ worth a
total of 96 million drachmas (dlrs 328,000) _ could be hidden from
tax collectors.
	   But the ticket holders were allowed into the stadium to watch
the Stones' first performance in Greece since 1967.
	   The ministry said Neo Revma could be forced to pay a minimum
fine of 250 million drachmas (dlrs 856,000) and face prosecution.
	   Neo Revma and its president, Dimitris Helmis, did not
immediately comment on the charges.

EBRD to finance run-up to privatizing Ukraine's telecoms monopoly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development is ready to lend Ukraine dlrs 200 million to help
prepare the country's telecommunications monopoly for
privatization, a bank official said Thursday.
	   Jaroslav Kinach, who heads the EBRD's office in Kiev, said the
bank can share its experience in privatizing telecommunications
companies after financing similar projects in Hungary and Romania,
the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Kinach gave no details on what these preparations could involve.
	   Last year, Ukraine's government announced plans to privatize the
telecommunications monopoly Ukrtelecom. It is currently preparing a
legislative bill that would remove the company from the list of
enterprises barred from privatization.
	   Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko has said the government
could raise up to dlrs 2 billion by selling a 25 percent stake in
the telecommunications company.
	   Ukrtelecom includes 35 subsidiaries and 738 branches throughout
Ukraine, and owns large stakes in five joint ventures. The company
employs 130,000 people.

Critical stockholders say fusion would cost 100,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ A day before Daimler-Benz shareholders
vote on the company's planned merger with U.S.-based Chrysler
Corp., a critical shareholders group predicted 100,000 jobs would
be lost in the fusion.
	   Gerd Rathgeb, the works council chief at Daimler's Unterturkheim
operation, charged Thursday that the fused company's push for more
profits ``would be at the expense of the workforce,'' despite
Daimler chairman Juergen Schrempp's repeated promise that no jobs
would be lost.
	   Daimler employs some 300,000 people worldwide and Chrysler
122,000. Both companies have said the merger would not bring
layoffs or plant closures.
	   Rathgeb's group of 250 shareholders also charged that the only
winners of a merger with Chrysler will be top Daimler-Benz
managers, whose salaries are expected to be boosted to match those
of Chrysler's top team.
	   ``While the board preaches to us to tighten our belts, they rake
off more for themselves,'' a group statement said.
	   German executives traditionally earn far less than their U.S.
counterparts, and that issue could make for heated debate at
Friday's shareholders meeting, which is expected to run late into
the night.
	   Still, analysts say the shareholders probably won't let that
argument stop the merger.
	   ``They will only hurt themselves if they vote against it,'' said
Tom Aney of the Bayerische Hypo- and Vereinsbank in Munich.
	   Last year, Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton took home dlrs 16
million in salary, bonus and stock options. His counterpart,
Juergen Schrempp, earned about an eighth of that.
	   Despite protests, Daimler will likely raise manager compensation
to Chrysler's levels in the medium term, analysts said. If
Daimler's pay isn't competitive, the executives will defect to
competitors, Aney said.
	   If the deal goes through, Daimler-Benz shareholders would
control 57 percent of DaimlerChrysler, and Chrysler shareholders 43
percent.
	   Seventy-five percent of Daimler shares on an undiluted basis
must be exchanged for shares in the new company for the deal to go
through. But the two automakers want an exchange of at least 90
percent, which will allow them to use the more favorable ``pooling
of interests'' accounting method.

EU clears dlrs 12.4 million in aid for Palestinians

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union on Thursday approved
10.9 million European currency units (dlrs 12.4 million) in
humanitarian aid for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
and those living as refugees in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria.
	   The EU's executive body, the European Commission, said the funds
will be used to provide medical supplies as well as ``emergency
food aid for the most vulnerable.'' It will also involve training
of specialized personnel.
	   The package is the first of its type that the EU's humanitarian
aid program has approved for Palestinian refugees in Lebanon,
Jordan and Syria, the Commission said in a statement.

Arabs support Libya's call for guarantees for Lockerbie suspects
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with final resolution, news conference &QL; 
 &UR; By BASSEM MROUE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Arab foreign ministers urged the United
States and Britain on Thursday to hold talks with Libya and backed
Tripoli's calls for guarantees for the two suspects in the
Lockerbie case.
	   But the Arab League ended its two-day meeting in Cairo by
turning down a Libyan demand for member states to disregard a
six-year U.N. air embargo on Libya.
	   The meeting's final statement, however, said Arab states would
suspend the air sanctions as soon as the United States, Britain and
Libya agree on measures to put the two Libyan suspects on trial in
the Netherlands for the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 that exploded
over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, for the loss of 270 lives.
	   Such a suspension would be in advance of the plan that the U.N.
Security Council approved last month, which calls for the sanctions
to be suspended only when the suspects actually arrive in the
Netherlands.
	   Tripoli has accepted the U.N. plan in principle, but called for
negotiations with Washington and Britain, the main backers of the
plan, over the details of the suspects' trial and treatment in
custody.
	   Washington and Britain have said they will provide
clarification, but that the plan is non-negotiable. U.S.
legislators have threatened to press for sanctions against Libyan
oil sales if Tripoli does not surrender the suspects for trial.
	   The League described this threat as being in ``total disregard
of Libya's positive cooperation with Security Council
resolutions,'' according to a copy of the final statement published
by Egypt's official Middle East News Agency. The statement was not
issued to reporters at the meeting.
	   The statement called on the United States, Britain and the
Netherlands to hold talks with Libya either directly or through the
offices of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the trial
arrangements.
	   Speaking to the press after the meeting, Arab League
Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid said member states were
``discussing the arrangements of handing over these two suspects,
guaranteeing them their right to defense, the right to security and
their legal rights before Scottish jurisdiction.''
	   Under the U.N. plan, the suspects would be tried by Scottish
judges and under Scottish law. They could not be extradited after
they arrive in the Netherlands and, if convicted, they would serve
their sentences in a British prison.
	   The sanctions, which ban air travel to and from Libya, were
imposed in 1992 to force Tripoli to surrender the suspects.
	   Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, who chaired the
meeting, said the ministers also discussed Turkey's military
cooperation with Israel.
	   ``We don't accept that Turkey becomes a partner for a side that
occupies holy Jerusalem,'' al-Sharaa said, reiterating Arab
opposition to the cooperation.
	   The final statement condemned last month's U.S. missile attack
on a pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum, calling it ``an act of
aggression against Sudan, a dangerous violation of its sovereignty
and territory, and a violation of international law.''
	   The United States alleged the plant was making the ingredients
of chemical weapons.
	   The statement also called on the international community to
impose sanctions on Israel to force it to implement its agreements
with the Palestinians. Israel's policies were ``threatening
international peace and stability,'' the statement said.

Agassi at a price: Presidential apartment, villa, sat dish
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) - It's not the purse, it's the
presidential apartment.
	   Organizers of the IPB Czech Indoor tennis tournament have signed
U.S. star Andre Agassi for the Oct. 19-25 tourney _ but only after
offering him megaperks, according to tournament director Petr
Kovarcik.
	   ``He has asked for a presidential apartment and two other luxury
apartments in the best hotel in town, private pool and gym,'' the
daily Pravo quoted Kovarcik as saying. ``We'll probably rent a
villa with a pool and a gym for him.''
	   Because Agassi also wanted to watch American TV channels,
``we'll buy him a satellite receiver,'' Kovarcik reportedly said.
	   Agassi will fly to the tourney in Ostrava on a private plane.
That and the costs of his stay will probably cost more than the
dlrs 200,000 the player will get in appearance money, organizers
said.
	   Besides Agassi, the dlrs 1 million IPB Czech Indoor will host
two other top 10 players on the ATP tour _ Petr Korda and Yevgeni
Kafelnikov, as well as U.S. Open finalist Mark Philippoussis.

Boldon misses world mark but O'Neill gets record 10th title

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Track star Ato Boldon didn't get
his world record but Susie O'Neill collected her unmatched 10th
swimming gold medal at the Commonwealth Games Thursday.
	   Boldon ran 9.88 seconds to win the 100-meter sprint, .04 outside
the world mark set by Canada's Donovan Bailey at the Atlanta
Olympics.
	   But the flamboyant sprinter, who said before the event that
conditions here were hot and humid enough for him to break the
record, still celebrated in style, hoisting the flag of Trinidad,
waving to the 37,000 fans in the National Stadium and saying there
was more to come.
	   For big rival Frankie Fredericks, there was the familiar feeling
of finishing second. The Namibian, who has collected silver medals
for both the 100 and 200 meters at the last two Olympics, clocked
9.96 for yet another for his collection. Obadele Thompson of
Barbados took the bronze in 10.00.
	   At least Boldon took Linford Christie's Games record, which
stood at 9.91, and he sent out a message to the retired former
Olympic champion.
	   ``Remember at Victoria four years ago I said I was going to be
the one to watch?
	   ``Well, promise delivered.''
	   While Boldon collected his first Commonwealth Gold, O'Neill was
weighed down with them at the pool.
	   She achieved her 10th, amassed from three Games, to eclipse Mike
Wenden's record of nine with the second fastest ever swim for the
200-meter butterfly.
	   Her 2 minutes, 6.60 seconds shattered her own Commonwealth
record of 2:07.29, which she set in 1995, and was second only to
United States swimmer Mary T. Meagher's 1981 mark of 2:05.96 _
swimming's oldest record.
	   ``During the day I was thinking about the 10 gold medals and my
coach had a big talk to me and made me get it out of my mind and
focus on the job at hand, and that really helped tonight,'' O'Neill
said.
	   ``He made me realize it's the 200 fly I'm here to swim, not the
10 gold medals. I'm glad it's over. It was probably the best
feeling in my life when I finished it.''
	   Her sixth gold medal triumph here helped Australia finish with
23, two off its record from 1994, while England had five and Canada
four in the pool.
	   In all, Australia had 50 golds from these games, far ahead of
England's 16 and Canada's 14.
	   Australia's world 1,500-meter champion Grant Hackett inflicted
the first international defeat in eight years on dual Olympic
champion Kieren Perkins, who missed the Worlds in January. Another
countryman, Matthew Dunn, won the 200-meter medley and Australia
claimed the men's 4x100-meter medley relay.
	   England's Sue Rolph finished with a freestyle sprint double and
countrywoman Katy Sexton won a surprise 200-meter backstroke gold.
	   While Boldon's victory over Fredericks and Thompson was the
track highlight, Chandra Sturrup of the Bahamas powered away from
Canada's Philomena Mensah to win the women's 100 meters in 11.06
and England's Denise Lewis, the Olympic bronze medalist and world
championship runner-up, retained her heptathlon title with ease.
	   Kenyans John Kosgei, world record holder Bernard Barmasei and
Kikpurui Misoi gained an expected medal sweep in the 3,000-meter
steeplechase, Australia's Kate Anderson won the women's 5,000
meters, countryman Nick A'Hern captured gold in the 20-kilometer
walk and England's Bob Weir heaved a Games record 64.42 meters at
age 37 to win the men's discus.
	   Australia crushed New Zealand by nine wickets to advance to the
first Commonwealth Games cricket final after bowling its neighbor
out for only 58 including a hat trick from leg spinner Brad Young.
The Australians meet South Africa in Saturday's final.
	   There was more success for Australia in cycling and
weightlifting.
	   Michael Rogers of Australia found an opening in the final sprint
Thursday and won the men's 20-kilometer scratch cycling race ahead
of England's Shaun Wallace and New Zealand's Timothy Carswell.
	   Australia's Damian Brown and Canada's Sebastien Groulx each won
two gold medals Thursday in weightlifting while India's Satheesa
Rai and Malaysia's Muhad Hidayat each won one.
	   On the shooting range, English shooters Michael Gault and Chris
Hector and Australian Christine Trefry all defended their
Commonwealth Games championships. Gault repeated as the men's free
pistol gold medalist, Hector as the air rifle winner, and Trefry as
the women's sports pistol champion.
	   Roopa Unnikrishnan of India won the women's sport rifle prone
event.

Government tries to dampen public enthusiasm for Basque cease-fire

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish government tried to dampen
public enthusiasm Thursday over a cease-fire announced by the armed
Basque separatist group ETA after a 30-year fight for an
independent homeland.
	   Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja said he recognized most
people had greeted the news with ``happiness and relief,'' because
``while there is a truce, there will be no tragedy, no deaths.''
	   But the minister, who controls the country's security forces,
recalled that previous ETA cease-fires ended with a resumption of
violence. ``ETA's very record proves that skepticism is
necessary,'' he said.
	   ETA gunmen and bombs have killed nearly 800 people since the
group began fighting in the late 1960s for an independent homeland
in the Basque country, a region which straddles the border between
Spain and France.
	   Mayor gave the first official government reaction to the ETA's
announcement late Wednesday of its first open-ended ceasefire,
which it said would begin at midnight Thursday.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar was traveling in Peru.
	   ETA's announcement drew praise from as far away as Northern
Ireland, where a peace accord was reached in April in a bid to end
decades of sectarian violence between Catholics and Protestants.
	   ``I would urge all of those involved, and particularly the
Spanish government, to learn the lessons of our experience. Don't
prevaricate, don't create obstacles, don't delay. The emphasis now
should be on building confidence and trust and getting negotiations
under way speedily,'' said Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the Irish Republican Army.
	   Basque leaders have followed developments in Northern Ireland
closely, especially how Sinn Fein turned an apparent admission of
weakness _ stopping shooting without achieving its goal of uniting
Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland _ to its advantage.
	   In the Basque country, Xabier Arzallus, president of the
governing Basque Nationalist Party, warmly welcomed ETA's move.
	   In apparent reference to the IRA, he said ETA had taken ``the
first step on a long road filled with obstacles, especially in
light of similar processes that began with an identical decision.''
	   The truce, he said, ``is major news that, although a long time
coming, still makes us feel great happiness.''
	   Pressure on ETA to declare a cease-fire had escalated since
Saturday, when Basque nationalists and other political groups,
including the ETA-allied Herri Batasuna coalition, held an ``Irish
Forum'' in the Basque town of Lizarra and called for peace talks
and a permanent end to the violence.
	   The Lizarra Declaration, which stated that only a political
solution was possible, as in the case of Northern Ireland, was
signed by 23 political parties, labor unions and grassroots groups.
It was boycotted by the ruling Popular Party and the Socialists.
	   The interior minister said the government would intensify
meetings with all democratic forces in the country to analyze the
Basque question.
	   The minister referred to a cautionary statement he made earlier
in the week that any ETA cease-fire declared before the Oct. 25
Basque region elections, would be a ``trick truce'' intended to
boost support for Herri Batasuna.
	   The government's stated position is that talks with ETA are
impossible until the group renounces violence forever.
	   ETA's four-page truce announcement was released by the radical
Basque newspaper Euskadi Informacion, a small-circulation
publication that grew out of the daily Egin, shut down by the
government in July over its alleged links to ETA.
	   The armed group set no conditions on the cease-fire but said it
would not surrender its arms and warned it would end the truce in
the event of a ``confrontation'' with the government.
	   ETA has called cease-fires before, but of limited duration. This
is the first time it has announced an open-ended cease-fire.
	   ETA are the Basque-language initials for Basque Homeland and
Freedom. Mainstream Basque political parties share its desire for
an independent nation but say they oppose violence as the way to
achieve the goal.
	   The last ETA attack came on June 25 when it killed a town
councilor of the ruling Popular Party in the Basque town of
Renteria. He was the sixth person killed by ETA this year.

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Gunmen in northern Mexico lined up about 20
people against a wall and opened fire Thursday, the Red Cross and
news media said. At least 15 people were reported killed.
	   The shooting occurred early Thursday in El Sauzal, a suburb of
the resort of Ensenada and only 60 miles (100 kilometers) south of
the U.S. border.
	   Antonio Ulloa, a worker at the Ensenada Red Cross, said they had
taken two seriously wounded people to the hospital. He said Red
Cross workers believed there were between 15 and 18 dead.
	   The Mexican television network Televisa said in a report from
the scene that 19 people had been killed and that there were two
survivors.
	   According to Televisa, the victims were men, women and children,
and all were lined up against a wall and shot as if by a firing
squad. Televisa said the victims were the residents of three
neighboring houses in this middle-class town.
	   Ensenada Judicial Police officer Jose Ramon Espinoza said he had
no information on the reported massacre.
	   Apparently, no one was arrested. None of the reports gave a
possible motive for the attack.

Kohl hounded by questions about minister's tax hike remark
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl was on the defensive
again Thursday regarding charges he planned to raise Germany's
value-added tax after the election, with the opposition Social
Democrats calling his denials ``a new tax lie.''
	   Kohl insisted again that his family minister, Claudia Nolte,
made a mistake when she suggested early this week that an increase
was planned. ``You've known for 24 hours that that's incorrect,''
he said when asked about her remark during an appearance at a
banking convention in Dresden.
	   But the Social Democratic general manager Franz Muentefering in
Bonn released similar denials made by Kohl before the elections in
1990 and 1994 _ and the tax increases that followed.
	   ``The latest contention from (Kohl's) coalition, that they don't
want any increase in value-added tax, is the attempt at a new tax
lie,'' he said.
	   Nolte had hinted the government planned to raise value-added
taxes to make up for tax cuts elsewhere, calling such a raise
socially just because the better paid buy more.
	   On Thursday she pleaded for an end to the discussion. ``It was
really a mistake,'' she insisted in Bonn.
	   With the Sept. 27 election nearing, the underdog Kohl was
hitting the campaign trail with renewed vigor following a good
showing by his Bavarian allies in state elections last weekend.
After the Dresden stop, he was to address a rally in Berlin
Thursday night.
	   ``You wouldn't believe how that motivates you when you've
already been buried,'' Kohl said, referring to opinion polls that
have shown him trailing Social Democratic challenger Gerhard
Schroeder for months.

Bosnia election supervisors deny withholding pro-extremist results
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Bosnian Serb prime minister's
criticism of OSCE. &QL; 
 &UR; By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ International officials in
charge of Bosnia's elections denied Thursday that they are holding
back vote results because extremists won, saying the count remains
inconclusive.
	   Nicole Szulc, spokeswoman for the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, which supervised last weekend's nationwide
elections, declined to comment on who is leading in races deemed
crucial to rebuilding Bosnia after its 3 1/2-year war.
	   ``We are not going to make judgments based on 60 percent, or 40
percent of counted ballots. The only results that will matter are
the final results,'' she said.
	   Robert Barry, head of the OSCE in Bosnia, said results probably
would be announced next Wednesday or Thursday.
	   A strong showing by extremists would be an embarrassing setback
to international efforts to build a stable, multi-ethnic state in
Bosnia-Herzegovina.
	   It could also raise doubts about the effectiveness of the
international effort that has sought to rebuild Bosnia since the
1995 Dayton peace accords.
	   The most closely watched contest, the re-election bid of Bosnian
Serb President Biljana Plavsic _ a moderate backed by the West _
has generated conflicting claims about whether she won or lost.
	   Hundreds of Radical Party supporters gathered in Pale and other
towns in the Serb half of Bosnia on Wednesday night to celebrate
what they said was Plavsic's defeat by extremist Nikola Poplasen.
	   Szulc dismissed the victory reports, saying vote counting is
complicated and 200,000 ballots have not been opened yet.
	   Two extremist parties accused the OSCE of delaying the planned
release of preliminary results because of the strong showing of
hard-liners.
	   ``The results are known but OSCE is silent,'' the Bosnian Serb
Radical Party and Serb Democratic Party said in a statement carried
Wednesday by the Bosnian Serb SRNA news agency.
	   In Banja Luka, the prime minister of the Bosnian Serb republic,
Milorad Dodik, said the delays showed the OSCE had no business
trying to run elections.
	   ``We will demand that in the next municipal elections ... a
permanent election commission is formed, while OSCE would only be a
monitor,'' Dodik told reporters.
	   In Sarajevo, state radio said Wednesday night it will not
broadcast any purported results given by the competing parties and
said the conflicting claims, if added together, would reflect 118
percent of voters casting ballots.
	   Meanwhile, there is a possibility the OSCE may disqualify top
vote-winning nationalists because of election rule violations.
	   The group is to meet Friday to decide whether to punish the
Radicals for broadcasting an interview with their leader, Vojislav
Seselj, during a pre-election blackout.
	   The strongest punishment would be disqualifying Poplasen. The
party has suggested that such a decision might trigger civil
unrest.
	   Plavsic's party indicated it might request the elections be
declared void because of serious violations by the Radicals, the
Sarajevo daily Oslobodjenje reported. It claimed the Seselj
broadcast caused many people to vote for extremists.
	   Poplasen and Momcilo Krajisnik, a candidate for the joint
Bosnian presidency, are supporters of war crimes suspect Radovan
Karadzic. They are against the Dayton peace accord that envisaged a
unified Bosnia.
	   Analysts believe nationalist sentiment among Bosnian Serbs has
been rekindled because of clashes in the Serbian province of Kosovo
against largely Muslim ethnic Albanians. Western pressure on
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic over that situation has also
worked against Plavsic, they said.

Boldon runs 9.88 to take gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS more comment from Boldon, trims &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Ato Boldon missed the world record
but still celebrated in style as he ran 9.88 seconds Thursday to
win the Commonwealth Games 100 meters gold medal.
	   The Trinidanian sprinter, who had said he felt capable of
beating Donovan Bailey's 9.84, threw his arms wide and took the
acclaim of the fans as he broke Linford Christie's Games mark of
9.91, set four years ago at Victoria, British Columbia.
	   Boldon, who has twice run 9.86 this season, ran to collect the
flag of Trinidad from one of his army of fans and did a lap of
honor with 37,000 spectators in the 100,000-capacity National
Stadium cheering him wildly.
	   The medals went as expected, with Boldon's big rival, Frankie
Fredericks of Namibia, second in 9.96 and Obadele Thompson of
Barbados, who ran 9.87 at altitude in Johannesburg on Friday, third
in 10.00.
	   While Boldon ran consistently throughout the race, Fredericks
started slowly and needed a powerful surge at midrace to get back
into contention. But Boldon always looked the winner and there was
daylight between the two sprint superstars at the line.
	   ``At 50 meters I thought, oh yeah, this is looking fast,''
Boldon said. ``Me and the starter had been in sync for the last two
days.''
	   Boldon said he had been disappointed with his performance during
the recent European season, but that he had been confident of
success in Kuala Lumpur because of solid training.
	   ``How I run in training is how I'm going to compete,'' he said.
``The main thing I knew I had going for me this year was, I held on
to my fitness.''
	   He also sent a message to former champion Christie, now retired.
	   ``Remember at Victoria four years ago I said I was going to be
the one to watch?
	   ``Well, promise delivered.''
	   Fredericks, silver medalist at the last two Olympics at both the
100 and 200 meters, acknowledged he had finished second again.
	   ``It's frustrating. All I know is that every time I step on the
track I try my best,'' said the Namibian, who was angry that his
prime minister now considered him the nation's second best
sportsman behind a boxer because he had failed to win an Olympic
gold.
	   ``I'm just going to keep trying and train harder and hopefully
one day I'll win.
	   ``You always expect to win but there's eight people, and one
person can win,'' Fredericks said. ``But I'm happy that I came here
despite all the circumstances.''
	   Chandra Sturrup of the Bahamas powered away from Canada's
Philomena Mensah to win the women's 100 meters in 11.06. Mensah
clocked 11.19 and Australia's Tania Van-Heer took the bronze in
11.29.
	   Kenya gained an expected 1-2-3 in the 3,000-meter steeplechase,
with John Kosgei outsprinting world record holder Bernard Barmasei
to take the gold and Kikpurui Misoi third.
	   Australia's Kate Anderson won the women's 5,000 meters in
15:52.75 although she briefly surrendered the lead to England's
Sarah Young in the next to last lap.
	   Anderson retook the lead at the bell and pulled away to win the
race while Young paid the penalty. She was caught by three more
runners and finished fifth. England's Andrea Whitcomb took the
silver and Zimbabwe's Samukeliso Moyo the bronze.
	   In the heptathlon, England's Denise Lewis, the defending
champion, Olympic bronze medalist and world silver medalist,
cruised to another Games title with four victories in the seven
events.
	   She won the long jump with a leap of 6.52 meters and then made
it four out of six by throwing 51.22 meters in the javelin. After
the final event, the 800 meters, she finished with 6,513 points, a
massive 159 points clear of Australia's Jane Jamieson, with New
Zealand's Joanne Henry collecting bronze.
	   England's Bob Weir heaved a Games record 64.42 meters at age 37
to win the men's discus ahead of Frantz Kruger of South Africa and
Jason Tunks of Canada.
	   Australia's Nick A'Hern won the 20-kilometer walk around Lake
Titiwangsa with Canada's Arturo Huerta second and another
Australian, Nathan Deaks, third.
	   Maria Mutola, the Olympic bronze medalist from Mozambique, set a
Games record in the heats in the 800 meters, which marked the
return of Diane Modahl of England.
	   The African star clocked 1:59.06, becoming the first runner to
break 2 minutes in the Games and removing Modahl's mark of 2:00.25
from the record books. Modahl's record was at Auckland in 1990 and
that was her last race in the Games.
	   She was pulled out of the English team in 1994 after testing
positive for high levels of testosterone. Modahl declared her
innocence, arguing that the tests were flawed, and she was
reinstated despite serving 20 months of a four-year ban that was
later quashed.
	   Declaring before the Games that she was still the defending
champion, Modahl ran 2:06.44 to win her heat. The semifinal is
Thursday and the final on Friday.

Italian and German Open switch places on tennis calendar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ The German Open has switched slots with
the Italian Open on the tennis calendar and will now take place in
the third week of May, the German tennis federation said Thursday.
	   The move was made in an attempt to avoid northern Germany's
notoriously wet weather. The later date is expected to provide for
better weather.
	   The German Open will now be the last major tournament before the
French Open, which will come two weeks later.
	   Guenter Sanders, secretary general of the German tennis
federation (DTB), said he had been officially notified of the
change in the calendar by Mark Miles, chief executive officer of
the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP).
	   The Germans have been lobbying hard for several years to have
their tournament moved to a later date.
	   Sanders said that the Super-9 tournament in Hamburg will try to
get women playing there as well from 2001.

Hong Kong defends intervention
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Tsang saying he may intervene again; comments
from monetary authority chief, lawmakers; RESTORES dropped word
'to' in final graf; minor edit. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The territory's financial secretary on Thursday
defended his government's recent foray into stock markets in
response to criticism from U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan.
	   Donald Tsang told reporters the government had ``absolutely no
other option'' but to step into the markets.
	   ``We had to defend the linked exchange rate of Hong Kong,
otherwise it would have triggered off another round of devaluation
in the whole of Asian region and probably greater disasters outside
the region.''
	   Greenspan, in testimony Wednesday, said Asian economies, in
general, shouldn't turn their backs on open markets and shouldn't
think their actions can be easily reversed.
	   He singled out the Hong Kong government's stock and futures
market intervention in August for criticism.
	   ``I don't think it can succeed,'' Greenspan said. ``The
consequences of doing that erodes some of the extraordinary
credibility that the Hong Kong monetary authorities have achieved
over the years.''
	   Speaking in an evening legislative committee meeting, Joseph
Yam, chief executive of Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the
territory's de facto central bank, also rejected Greenspan's
criticism.
	   ``Our intention is to deter speculation, not to jack up the
market,'' he said.
	   Yam also said he had explained the move to other Federal Reserve
board members, but was not sure whether his comments were heard by
Greenspan. Both he and Tsang said they would write him to explain
the move.
	   Speaking later on CNBC Asia financial TV network, Tsang also
added he couldn't promise the government wouldn't intervene again,
although it has stayed off the market this month.
	   Last month, the Hong Kong government took on currency and stock
speculators, ultimately intervening and changing market rules to
close the door on what it called market manipulation.
	   The government is believed to have spent 15 percent of its U.S.
dlrs 96 billion foreign reserves on a two-week buying spree to prop
up share prices and defend the Hong Kong currency, which is set at
7.80 to the U.S. dollar.
	   Lawmaker Andrew Cheng of the Democrats, Hong Kong's largest
political party, agreed with Greenspan, saying the government's
move has damaged investors' confidence in the government and Hong
Kong's financial system.
	   But lawmaker Sophie Leung, of the pro-business Liberal Party,
said on government radio Hong Kong defended the intervention,
saying without it Hong Kong could have been hurt.
	   Tsang has called for international cooperation to battle
speculative activities harming smaller economies like Hong Kong.
	   He is scheduled to meet with financial ministers and central
banks on a three-week visit this month to Germany, Holland, Britain
and the United States. A government spokesman said he's not sure
whether Tsang will meet Greenspan.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ U.S. stocks plunged Thursday after investors in
Asia and Europe pushed markets lower on Alan Greenspan's denial
that world finance leaders had agreed to cut interest rates.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 209.57 to 7,880.21 at
midmorning. Broader indicators also were sharply lower in active
trading that was running above Wednesday's early pace.
	   The Dow's drop of 2.6 percent followed a 2.4 percent fall in
Tokyo's main index to a 12-year low. Near the end of the European
trading day, major indicators were down 4.7 percent in Paris, 3.4
percent in London and 4.2 percent in Frankfurt, Germany.
	   Brazilian share prices cut their losses when trading resumed
Thursday morning after a circuit breaker halted business for 30
minutes.
	   At 1420 GMT, 15 minutes after trading reopened, the Sao Paulo
Stock Exchange's Bovespa Index was down 500 points or 7.4 percent
at 6260.
	   The circuit breaker was activated after the Bovespa fell 10
percent in the 35th minute of Thursday's session.

Berisha calls nationwide protest; lawmakers consider his arrest

 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 8 grafs with parliamentary commission agrees to
lift Berisha's immunity. Pick up 9th graf pvs. &QL; 
 &UR; By MERITA DHIMGJOKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A parliament commission recommended
Thursday that Sali Berisha be stripped of parliamentary immunity,
the legal step toward arresting the former president for fomenting
this week's riots after the slaying of his ally.
	   The decision, which requires approval by the full parliament,
was taken as the former president continued urging his followers to
more protests demanding the resignation of his rival, Prime
Minister Fatos Nano.
	   Some 2,000 or more Democratic Party supporters gathered again
Thursday to denounce the government as Berisha assailed Nano as
``the champion of corruption in Europe.''
	   Others were prevented from joining it by police roadblocks at
key intersections, purportedly intended to check weapons.
	   Western powers fear that the violent confrontation between
Berisha and Nano that has erupted in the past week could worsen if
Berisha is arrested on charges of seeking to overthrow the
government.
	   Berisha has demanded that Nano resign in favor of a ``technical
government'' to arrange new elections. The crisis has raised fears
of unrest reminiscent of the months of anarchy that struck Albania
last year after the collapse of shady pyramid schemes that cost
many people their entire savings.
	   During an Thursday afternoon meeting attended by international
officials, a parliamentary commission recommended stripping Berisha
of the immunity from arrest, which he enjoys as a member of the
legislature. The commission decided against removing the immunity
of five of his allies, pending further evidence.
	   It was unclear when the full parliament would take up the issue.
But Nano's Socialists dominate both the commission and the
assembly, and it was expected that the full chamber would go along
with the recommendation.
	   A government source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
there was pressure from international officials to come up with a
lesser charge against Berisha in order to avoid further
instability.
	   Western powers fear that the violent political confrontation
could worsen if Berisha is arrested on charges of seeking to
overthrow the government. They are desperate to prevent the
Albanian unrest from influencing other crises in the region,
especially in the neighboring Kosovo province of Yugoslavia, where
Serb forces are fighting ethnic Albanian separatists.

Prince Albert arrives in Alexandria for sightseeing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Monaco's Prince Albert arrived Thursday in
the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria on a two-day visit to
tour the city's historic sights, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
	   Albert arrived from Beirut, where he met with a number of
Lebanese officials, including President Elias Hrawi, Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri.
	   He also visited reforestation projects in Lebanon that were
financed by Monaco.
	   Albert is to meet with the head of Egypt's antiquities
authority, Gaballah Ali Gaballah, and then see some of the
archaeological discoveries made by a French team off the coast of
Alexandria, MENA said.
	   French archaeologists, exploring the Alexandria coastline, have
discovered the court of Cleopatra and, more recently, the sunken
wrecks of Napoleon's navy.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Gunmen in northern Mexico lined up 21 members
of three families against a wall and opened fire Thursday. Eighteen
people were killed and three were seriously wounded, police said.
	   The shooting occurred before dawn Thursday in El Sauzal, a
suburb of the Ensenada resort and only 60 miles (100 kilometers)
south of the U.S. border.
	   Ensenada Judicial Police officer Jose Ramon Espinoza said the
victims _ men, women and children _ were members of three families:
the Flores family and two families that had the last name Castro.
	   ``It appears they rounded them all up, lined them up and gunned
them down,'' Espinoza said. He said 18 people were killed and three
seriously wounded.
	   He said he had no information on suspects or a possible motive.
	   The Mexican television network Televisa gave the death toll at
19 and said there were two survivors.

Perkins says it's not over

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Dual Olympic 1,500-meter swimming
champion Kieren Perkins declared he was still on target to win a
third gold at the Sydney games despite his first international
defeat in eight years Thursday.
	   Perkins, 25, holds the world records for 1,500, 800 and 400
meters and won the gold medals at the 1992 and 1996 Olympics.
	   He has hardly raced since winning in Atlanta, after sneaking
into the final by .23 seconds and getting lane eight.
	   World champion Grant Hackett had his first chance to race
Perkins in a major final after Perkins missed this year's World
Championships.
	   Hackett clocked 14 minutes, 50.92 seconds, while Perkins was
well back in third in 15:03.
	   But Perkins is not thinking defeat.
	   ``I'll put it this way _ it's not over,'' said Perkins. ``Every
time I'm racing I'm improving.
	   ``But the most disturbing thing is that's the first time I've
been beaten internationally over 1,500 meters for eight years and I
don't like it.''
	   Perkins last lost at the 1991 world championships in Perth when
he was edged by Germany's Jorg Hoffmann. That remains the only
1,500-meter race in history where three swimmers have broken 15
minutes.
	   Hackett was pleased to topple his famous compatriot.
	   ``To be the first to do that in eight years is fantastic,''
Hackett said. ``But his world record (14:41.66) is still out there.
To be honest I want to get down to 14:40 in the next six to 12
months.''
	   Hackett was hoping to go into the 14:40s Thursday to join
Perkins as the only swimmer to go under 14:50.
	   ``But realistically I should be happy with 14:50. I did feel I
was out there alone and that made it a little harder,'' Hackett
said.
	   Hackett, like Perkins, had problems with illness in the two
months leading into these games.
	   ``There's a few things I did miss with this preparation and
tonight I saw a few things I can improve on a lot,'' Hackett said.
	   While Hackett believes he can crack the record before Sydney
2000, Perkins disagrees.
	   ``Personally, I don't think Grant is near my world record,''
Perkins said. ``He's young and inexperienced and doesn't know how
to swim the 1,500 properly yet.''
	   Both believe Hackett's best chance will come if and when Perkins
returns to sub-15 minute form.
	   ``During the race tonight I was thinking I wish Kieren was at
his best and I wish I was right next to him now,'' said Hackett.
``As soon as he gets back down it's going to do wonderful things
for me.''
	   Hackett is already thinking beyond the 14:40s to, gulp, the
14:30s.
	   ``I don't think it's scary,'' said Hackett. ``I don't know what
I'm capable of _ Kieren did the 14:41 when he was 21. He was a man
and I'm just a boy.''
	   Perkins is not thinking about anything he hasn't done before.
	   ``I'm not trying to break into uncharted territory with this,''
he said. ``I've done it before and I can do it again.''

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Although Bangladesh is reporting
increasing cases of diarrhea from the country's deadliest floods in
decades, foreign visitors have little to fear, a World Health
Organization official said Thursday.
	   ``I don't think tourists should stop coming to Bangladesh
because of the waterborne diseases,'' W. Hardjotanojo, head of WHO
office in Dhaka told reporters.
	   He advised visitors to take precautions and not expose
themselves to waters polluted by floods receding after battering
the delta nation for more than two months.
	   Diarrhea that causes fatal dehydration is spreading fast with
government officials reporting more than 240,000 cases in past two
months. Nearly 208 of them have so far died.
	   ``Bangladesh is facing a health emergency,'' the WHO official
said.
	   He said more than 4,000 health teams working across the country
have so far prevented an epidemic of diarrhea, which kills at least
110,000 people every year in Bangladesh because of poor hygiene.
	   ``The case management of diarrhea has so far been reasonably
good,'' he said.
	   The WHO has appealed for dlrs 8.7 million to buy medicines and
water purification tablets for 35 million people displaced by the
floods that claimed more than 900 lives.

Strike-ravaged Philippine Airlines announces closure

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada met late
Thursday with union leaders from strike-ravaged Philippine Airlines
in a last-ditch effort to reverse a decision by Asia's oldest
airline to close.
	   An Estrada aide said there was still a ``small window of
opportunity'' to avoid PAL's shutdown, announced earlier Thursday.
	   Union officials said they will consider a request from Estrada
that PAL workers be allowed to vote directly on a
management-proposed rescue plan.
	   Union leaders have already turned the plan down once. Company
officials held out little hope.
	   ``We're going to close. It's final,'' PAL vice president Rolando
Estabillo said.
	   PAL's board decided in a special meeting Thursday that the
company, founded 57 years ago, will halt operations next Wednesday.
	   Company officials said efforts to rebuild the airline were no
longer feasible because of the unions' rejection of the management
proposal.
	   The shutdown of the Philippines' biggest airline, which calls
itself ``Asia's Sunniest,'' would leave the country with only a
handful of small carriers, most with severe economic or operating
problems of their own.
	   ``It is not easy to preside over the demise of a great Filipino
institution that has been a partner in nation building for over
half a century,'' PAL said in a statement.
	   ``Sadly, our sincere efforts to keep PAL flying and serve the
riding public have not been matched by a similar commitment from
our employees' unions,'' it said.
	   A meeting between Estrada and Lucio Tan, PAL's biggest
shareholder and chairman, initially set for Thursday was postponed.
	   Estrada said he would contact Tan Friday and will also meet
again with union members Monday.
	   ``I will try my best to settle this problem,'' Estrada said. ``I
am keeping my fingers crossed.''
	   Tan is estimated to have a 70 percent stake in PAL, while the
government owns about 18 percent.
	   Tan's proposal would have given workers three board seats and 20
percent ownership of the company in exchange for a 10-year
suspension of their collective bargaining agreement.
	   Each worker would have received 60,000 shares of stock worth
300,000 pesos (about dlrs 6,900).
	   Gerardo Rivera, vice president of the PAL Employees Association,
said its board decided on Wednesday to reject the airline's offer
because ``we cannot just wholesale surrender our right to
collective bargaining.''
	   Asia's financial crisis struck last year just as PAL was gearing
up an ambitious refleeting and modernization program. The airline
was then badly crippled by a 22-day pilots' strike in June.
	   It fired the pilots, cut most of its routes, laid off 5,000 of
its nearly 14,000 workers, and said it would dispose of most of its
54 planes as part of a recovery plan.
	   The airline now is mired in debts of dlrs 2.1 billion to local
and foreign creditors, but secured a moratorium while the survival
plan was being considered by regulators and creditors.
	   PAL officials said creditors refused to agree to the
restructuring plan unless new capital was infused into the airline.
But prospective investors were driven away by its recurring labor
disputes, they said.
	   The airline lost 2.2 billion pesos (dlrs 51 million) between
April and June, mainly because of the work stoppages and the
effects of Asia's currency crisis.
	   PAL says its liabilities now almost equal its assets, and the
company is losing between 40 million and 60 million pesos (dlrs
930,000 and dlrs 1.4 million) a day.
	   PAL carried five passengers from Manila to Baguio in the
northern Philippines on its maiden flight on March 15, 1941. It
became the first Asian airline to cross the Pacific on July 31,
1946.

Palestinian killed in West Bank shooting; new settlement plans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout to INCORPORATE BC-Israel-Shooting and
UPDATE with Israeli officials saying summit not likely &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli motorists on Thursday killed a
Palestinian high school student in a West Bank shooting and Israel
announced it would expand a Jewish settlement 10-fold in response
to the recent killing of two settlers by Palestinian militants.
	   The shooting and the settlement plans came as U.S. Mideast envoy
Dennis Ross wound down his weeklong shuttle mission without having
made progress toward agreement on an Israeli troop withdrawal in
the West Bank.
	   Diplomatic sources said in Washington on Wednesday that U.S.
President Bill Clinton was trying to arrange a three-way summit in
New York next week with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to wrap up such a deal.
	   However, on Thursday it appeared increasingly unlikely that such
a meeting would take place unless Ross made significant progress
before returning to Washington at the end of the week.
	   The three leaders will be in New York for the U.N. General
Assembly. An Israeli Foreign Ministry official said it was more
likely that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would hold
separate talks with Arafat and Netanyahu.
	   The fatal shooting took place in the West Bank village of
Beitunia around noon Thursday when a group of a dozen Palestinian
high school students was walking along the main road.
	   One of the students, Raed Abdel Rahman, 17, said an Israeli car
pulled up, the passengers rolled down the windows and started
shooting from a pistol and an assault rifle.
	   ``Everybody started to jump and take cover,'' said Abdel Rahman.
	   Two of the teen-agers were hit in the stomach and taken to
nearby Ramallah Hospital where 17-year-old Iyad Hashem later died
of his injury. The second boy was in stable condition.
	   Abdel Rahman insisted that the teen-agers had not first stoned
the Israeli car and that the motorists opened fire without
provocation. However, in the past, Israeli drivers have repeatedly
fired shots to repulse stone throwers in the West Bank.
	   The Israeli army said police was handling the matter. Police
spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said she was checking the incident.
	   Meanwhile, tensions rose over Israeli construction plans on
disputed land.
	   Israel approved plans to build 600 new homes in the Jewish West
Bank settlement of Yitzhar where two residents were killed last
month in a drive-by shooting by Palestinian militants. Yitzhar is
home to 60 families.
	   Netanyahu told the Yediot Ahronot daily that he approved the
construction ``as another response of mine to terrorist
perpetrators.''
	   The United States has urged Israel to halt settlement expansion.
Israel says it is trying to accommodate natural growth while the
Palestinians say the construction is part of an illegal land grab.
	   ``This expansion policy is the bomb that will explode all the
efforts to put the peace process back on track,'' said Ahmed Abdel
Rahman, the secretary-general of the Palestinian Cabinet.
	   The Yediot Ahronot daily said Israel would confiscate land from
four Palestinian villages for the new construction.
	   However, Peter Lerner, a spokesman for Israel's military
government in the West Bank, said no private Palestinian land would
be expropriated for the construction.
	   In disputed east Jerusalem, some 35 members of Betar, the youth
movement of Netanyahu's Likud Party, set up two tents and a mobile
home at the site of the planned Jewish neighborhood of Har Homa.
	   The demonstrators said they wanted to push Netanyahu to begin
construction of the 6,500 homes planned at the site, known in
Arabic as Jabal Abu Ghneim.
	   After five hours, police dismantled the tents and ordered the
demonstrators to leave. Several were detained for questioning.
	   The Palestinians hope to establish a future capital in east
Jerusalem, the sector captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967
Mideast war. They broke off peace talks with Israel in March 1997,
when Netanyahu broke ground for Har Homa.

	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Riot police and paramilitary
commandos Thursday lobbed teargas and assaulted protesters and
commuters in a display of force amid growing unrest following the
police killing of taxi driver.
	   Squadrons of officers at roadblocks throughout the western
suburbs of Abidjan, Ivory Coast's commercial capital, randomly
dragged civilians _ mainly taxi and minibus drivers _ out of their
vehicles to kick and beat them with whips, gun butts and
truncheons.
	   In the Abobo suburb, an impoverished neighborhood of crowded
shanties and grimy street stalls, crowds of more than a thousand
curious onlookers were scattered in all directions when police
launched tear gas into the area.
	   Smaller throngs of mainly women and teenage youths were
dispersed by police wielding tear gas and clubs in the Yopougon
neighborhood, where taxi drivers had clashed with police a day
earlier. A group of drivers attacked a police station with rocks
and bottles Wednesday and set several cars on fire.
	   The police had eventually barricaded themselves inside the
station and fired tear gas canisters into the crowds.
	   On Thursday, throughout Abidjan's west side, police took up
positions along a number of main roads.
	   Police over the weekend shot and killed a taxi driver who failed
to stop at a routine checkpoint, sparking a city-wide strike Monday
by taxi and minibus drivers that has slowly grown violent.
	   Checkpoints are often used by Ivorian police to extort money
from drivers.
	   The head of Abidjan's taxi union said police on Saturday shot at
Assane Sanogo's cab when he failed to stop and continued shooting
until the driver was dead.
	   The strike has tapped growing anger among cab drivers, who claim
at least five of their colleagues have been shot dead by police in
the last year.
	   There were unconfirmed reports of two serious injuries during
Wednesday clashes, but it was not immediately clear if anyone had
been seriously hurt in Thursday's beatings.
	   A government statement read on state radio apologized for
Sanogo's death and said the officers responsible had been arrested.
President Henri Konan Bedie has appealed to taxi drivers to return
to work. Taxi union leaders met with government officials Thursday
in an attempt to resolve the dispute.
	   Some drivers vowed to continue the strike until police brutality
ended.
	   ``We have had enough of police violence and greed,'' said Yoda
Hamiodu, a driver from Yopougon.
	   Normally packed with orange and yellow taxis, Abidjan's streets
have been quiet since the drivers began their strike. Buses are
jammed and many commuters are forced to walk miles (kilometers)
along major thoroughfares to work and back.
	   Ivory Coast is among West Africa's most peaceful countries and
unlike its neighbors, has never experienced a coup or armed
rebellion.

Bangladeshi fundamentalists demand trial of author

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with family confirming her return, quotes,
CORRECTS that she returned Monday. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Novelist Taslima Nasrin, living under
death threats from Islamic zealots on blasphemy charges, has gone
into hiding in Bangladesh for fear of life, a family member said
Thursday.
	   Islamic fundamentalists have announced a reward of 200,000 takas
(dlrs 5,000) for anyone who kills her.
	   ``Yes, she has returned home, but she is too fearful to disclose
her whereabouts,'' a man said in a telephone interview, confirming
for the first time Nasrin's return Monday from New York. He would
not give his name.
	   In a joint statement published Thursday, several Muslim
religious leaders demanded the immediate arrest and trial of the
36-year-old author. They warned the government of serious
consequences if she is not put on trial for suggesting that Koran,
the Islamic holy book, should be rewritten. She has denied making
the comments.
	   The controversial author's return from four years of exile in
Europe was reported by local newspapers, touching off fresh
protests.
	   On Tuesday, several hundred Muslims protesters marched through
central Dhaka chanting death to the author.
	   Nasrin's ailing mother has asked for forgiveness for her
daughter.
	   ``Please forgive my daughter if she has hurt anyone's religious
sentiments,'' the 60-year-old mother, Eid-ul-Ara Begum told The
Associated Press on Wednesday.
	   Nasrin accompanied her mother from New York, where she underwent
treatment for colon cancer.
	   The author fled the country in 1994 after former Prime Minister
Khaleda Zia's government ordered her arrest on blasphemy charges.
Before leaving the country she spent one month in hiding.
	   Legally, she can still be tried in a blasphemy case filed in
1994. But Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who replaced Mrs. Zia, did
not press for it.
	   On bail, Nasrin is free to live in Bangladesh.
	   She also angered fundamentalists with her novel, Lajja (
``Shame''), which criticized Muslims for attacking minority Hindus
in Bangladesh following the 1992 destruction of a mosque by Hindu
zealots in neighboring India.

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilian share prices plummeted in
early trading Thursday, following poor performances on foreign
markets.
	   Soon after the trading began at the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange,
Latin America's largest, share prices were down 8.9 percent.
	   After the benchmark Bovespa Index plunged 10 percent in the
first hour of trading, the automatic circuit-breaker was activated,
suspending trading for 30 minutes.
	   Fifteen minutes after trading resumed, share prices cut their
losses, with the Bovespa Index down 500 points or 7.4 percent.
	   Bellwether stock Telebras came off its low of 76 reals (dlrs 64)
and was trading at 79.50 reals (dlrs 67.37) per thousand shares for
a loss of 5.9 percent.
	   A second circuit-breaker will be activated if the Bovespa Index
falls more than 15 percent.
	   The Bovespa has seen wild swings in prices during the last week.
It closed 13.9 percent lower last Thursday, but gained 18 percent
on Tuesday.

Jardine Matheson reports 63 percent decline in profits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ One of Hong Kong's oldest conglomerates
reported on Thursday a sharp 63 percent decline in profits for the
first half of this year.
	   Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd. _ one of the oldest British
trading houses here _ reported a sharp decline in earnings to U.S.
dlrs 103.4 million during the first half of 1998.
	   With most of Jardine Matheson's markets mired in recession,
``the second half of 1998 is not expected to show any
improvement,'' company chairman Henry Keswick said.
	   Kewswick said property values across Asia have been badly hit,
and that this would be reflected in a ``significant decline'' in
properties held by Hongkong Land Holdings Ltd., a Jardine
subsidiary.
	   Hongkong Land reported Wednesday its net profits fell 18.3
percent to U.S. dlrs 168.8 million for the six months ending June
30, while Jardine Fleming Holdings Ltd., the group's brokerage
unit, managed to break even in the first half.
	   Jardine Matheson, which began its business peddling opium in
China in the 19th century, is a group of eight core businesses
focused primarily on Asia.
	   Jardine's interests cover financial services, supermarkets,
consumer marketing, engineering and construction and hotels.
	   The group's parent, incorporated in Bermuda, has a primary
listing in London, with the bulk of its shares trading in
Singapore.

It's taken just a week for coaches to come under fire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A week into the season, and already Serie A coaches
are having a tough time.
	   Criticism from club owners or players is nothing new, but rarely
are top teams looking for answers so early. The finger-pointing is
going on across the Italian League, including at two-time defending
champion Juventus of Turin and title contenders Internazionale of
Milan, Lazio of Rome and AC Parma.
	   None has had an easy start _ only Juventus won its league
opener, barely _ but all can take solace from the schedule.
Sunday's second round provides mediocre opposition: Juventus hosts
Cagliari, Lazio hosts Bari, Parma travels to Venezia and Inter
hosts Piacenza in the night game.
	   Other matchups are Bologna vs. Udinese, Empoli vs. AS Roma,
Salernitana vs. AC Milan, Sampdoria of Genoa vs. Perugia, and
Vicenza vs. Fiorentina.
	   Inter (Champions League) and Parma (UEFA Cup) both lost their
European cup debuts this week, while Juventus managed only a draw.
The Juventus general manager, Luciano Moggi, and one of the team's
owners questioned coach Marcello Lippi's strategy after the team's
2-2 home game against Turkey's Galatasaray. Striker Filippo
Inzaghi, who was pulled after scoring for Juve on an acrobatic
bicycle kick, also wondered aloud whether Lippi had erred.
	   On paper, his powerful club should not have trouble with
Cagliari, which was in the second-division last season. Then again,
so was Perugia, which gave Juventus fits on Sunday in a game that
ended 4-3.
	   Juve's defense is in shambles, with starters Paolo Montero, Mark
Iuliano and Ciro Ferrara all sidelined by injury. Cagliari may have
to play without its top player, veteran forward Roberto Muzzi (one
goal, one assist last week in 2-2 draw with Inter), who skipped
practice Wednesday with a leg injury.
	   Lippi's counterparts at Parma _ first-year man Alberto Malesani
_ and Inter are under even more pressure.
	   Inter's Luigi Simoni received a public vote of confidence from
owner Massimo Moratti, though that doesn't necessarily mean the
coach's job is very safe. Moratti, who's invested millions of
dollars to provide Simoni with a talented roster, was quite
critical of the team's performance and its tactics in a 2-0 loss
Wednesday to Spain's Real Madrid.
	   ``Unfortunately, we didn't play well, we put on an ugly show and
we didn't win,'' Moratti said. ``We could have played this game
differently. We were too conservative.''
	   Brazilian star Ronaldo will make his league season debut against
Piacenza _ the lone all-Italian Serie A club _ which is without its
captain, striker Giampietro Piovani, for a month because of a right
hamstring tear.
	   Parma has been shut out twice in a week, and Malesani needs to
find a solution in attack quickly. It doesn't help that Argentine
playmaker Juan Veron and top striker Enrico Chiesa might both skip
the Venezia game with nagging injuries. If they do, the scoring
burden falls to Colombian Faustino Asprilla and Argentine Hernan
Crespo, who have struggled for some time.
	   Lazio coach Sven Goran Eriksson, reportedly out at season's end,
said this week he will stick with his starting 11 for two more
games. If the lineup doesn't produce, expect sweeping changes. One
move might be to put veteran Roberto Mancini _ an Eriksson favorite
dating to their days together at Sampdoria _ on the field in favor
of either Chile's Marcelo Salas or Christian Vieri, two high-priced
offseason signings.

Arsenal and Manchester United clash in battle of giants

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Arsenal and Manchester United will cast
disappointing European results aside Sunday as English soccer focus
returns to a battle of the Premier League giants.
	   Arsene Wenger's F.A. Cup and League-double titlists had a 1-1
tie with Lens, while Manchester United surrendered a 2-0 advantage
to slump to a 3-3 draw at home with Barcelona in Champions League
openers Wednesday.
	   But Arsenal and Manchester United, which finished No. 1 and No.
2 in the league last season, will put all their resources into the
clash at Highbury.
	   The teams have played once already this season, the Gunners
winning the annual Charity Shield match 3-0 in August.
	   The Gunners, minus former captain Ian Wright _ who transferred
to West Ham in the off-season _ have only one win and four ties in
five league games.
	   The major concern for Wenger in has been the indifferent form of
Dutch striker Dennis Bergkamp, who has not scored a goal in the
domestic competition since returning from the World Cup.
	   Bergkamp, a key player in Arsenal's campaign last season with 16
league goals and three cup goals, has admitted to suffering from
post-World Cup burnout.
	   Manchester United is in fifth place in the standings with two
wins and two ties from four games and has started to fire since
star striker Dwight Yorke arrived from Aston Villa.
	   Yorke, a 12.6-million-pound (dlrs 20 million) signing, has
scored three goals in United's last two league games.
	   The sixth round kicks off with eight matches Saturday, with
league-leading Aston Villa at third-place play Leeds United.
	   Villa, undefeated at the top of the Premier League standings
with four wins and tie, fought back from two goals down to escape
with a 3-2 win at home over Norway's Stromgodset in a UEFA Cup
match Tuesday.
	   Villa trailed 2-1 after a goal in the 83rd minute and then got
two goals in injury time from 18-year-old Darius Vassell to clinch
the victory.
	   Despite his winning double, Vassell is almost certain to remain
on the reserves bench against Leeds at Elland Road.
	   Leeds was forced to fight for a 1-0 win over Portugal's Maritimo
in the UEFA Cup Tuesday but secured the first-leg result when Jimmy
Floyd Hasselbaink scored in the 84th minute.
	   Former England international Robbie Fowler and 18-year-old
sensation Michael Owen should be reunited as Liverpool's striker
pairing against Charlton at Anfield.
	   Liverpool scored a 3-0 win over Kosice in the UEFA Cup Tuesday
after an unexpected 2-1 loss to West Ham last weekend cost the
Merseysiders the No. 1 spot in the Premier League standings.
	   Owen and Fowler, who has returned from a lengthy absence with a
knee injury, combined for a goal in the UEFA Cup win and Owen, the
leading scorer in the league with five goals, expects more to come.
	   ``Robbie and I have 24 goals between us in 25 games and I see
him as my ideal partner up front,'' Owen said.
	   Former England midfielder Paul Gascoigne is slowly returning to
form with Middlesbrough. Boro coach Bryan Robson said he expected
Gascoigne to star in Saturday's match against Everton.
	   In other Premier League matches Saturday, Nottingham Forest is
at home to West Ham, Coventry plays Newcastle, Wimbledon takes on
Sheffield Wednesday, Derby meets Leicester and Southampton plays
Tottenham.
	   In Division One matches Saturday, league-leading Huddersfield is
home to Wolverhampton and No. 2 Birmingham is home to Grimsby. In
other games: Barnsley vs. Crystal Palace; Bury vs. Tranmere; Crewe
vs. Bolton; Ipswich vs. Bristol City; Port Vale vs. Portsmouth;
Queens Park Rangers vs. Stockport; Sheffield United vs. Norwich;
Sunderland vs. Oxford; Swindon vs. Watford.
	   On Sunday, Bradford plays at West Brom.
	   The only Premier League match Monday is at Stamford Bridge,
where Chelsea hosts Blackburn Rovers.
	   In Scotland, Rangers will be at home to Celtic in the Premier
Division in the biggest game of the young Scottish season. Celtic
edged out Rangers for the Scottish league title last season, ending
Rangers nine-season run on the trophy.

Auction of James Bond memorabilia brings thousands

 &UR; Eds: will be topped at conclusion of auction &QL;

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A Lotus Esprit S1 automobile fetched 29,000 pounds
(dlrs 49,000) at a Christie's auction Thursday. Never mind that it
didn't have a motor: It just happened to be the prop car featured
in the 1977 James Bond movie ``The Spy Who Loved Me.''
	   The sleek automobile, which Roger Moore's version of Agent 007
piloted on land and sea in the film, was among the most
recognizable of the 250-plus lots peddled at the auction of Bond
memorabilia.
	   Generating the most interest _ and the most money _ was the
lethal metal-rimmed bowler used by assassin Oddjob, the most famous
of the Bond villains, in the 1964 film ``Goldfinger.'' An anonymous
bidder, participating by phone, paid 62,000 pounds (dlrs 104,700).
	   Among the more curious items up for grabs was one that had never
been in a Bond movie and carried an extra zero to boot _ a ``0007''
British car license plate.
	   Houmayoun Sharifi of London, who came across with the 32,000
pounds (dlrs 54,000) for it, said it would go on his Bentley.
	   Also among the toys, posters, clothing and various other props
on the block was the Rolex Oyster Perpetual watch worn by Moore in
his first Bond film, 1973's ``Live and Let Die.'' It brought about
22,000 pounds (dlrs 37,200), more than five times the estimate.
	   In the film, the watch is adapted by Secret Service gadgets
expert Q to feature a powerful magnet, for which 007 found an
ingenious use _ hands-free unzipping of a Bond girl's dress.
	   The number of bidders crammed into two separate sale rooms and
others bidding by telephone pushed prices for many items far higher
than estimates.
	   Seven brass bullets engraved with 007, used to promote the 1974
film ``The Man with the Golden Gun,'' each fetched around 1,500
pounds (dlrs 2,500), well over the estimate of 200 (dlrs 335) to
400 pounds (dlrs 670) apiece.
	   Actor Desmond Llewellyn, who played Q in the films and attended
the auction, was astounded at what some of the items were
commanding.
	   ``I think it's fantastic, but these people are crazy,'' he said.
	   Ajose Carpio, a serious Bond fan from San Francisco, paid 20,700
pounds (dlrs 35,000), for the Triumph Stag driven by Sean Connery
in the 1971 film ``Diamonds Are Forever.''
	   The wet-dry Lotus from ``The Spy Who Loved Me'' ended up in the
hands of Domenico Morassatti, an Italian businessman from Padua.
	   ``I bought a dream, not a car,'' Morassatti said afterward.

Rebels announce capture of garrison town in south

rebellion's outbreak to 1983 graf 6 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudanese rebels said Thursday they had
captured the garrison town of Liria, which is near the southern
provincial capital of Juba.
	   The Sudan People's Liberation Army said Liria and two smaller
army outposts fell to rebel troops on Wednesday. At Liria, it said,
``government forces abandoned the town and fled in total disarray''
	   The rebel statement said the fleeing soldiers left behind two
tanks, an armored personnel carrier and several trucks mounted with
machine guns.
	   Liria is 72 kilometers (45 miles) southeast of Juba, which is
controlled by the government. The other military posts were nearby.
	   The rebel statement said the move isolated the army camp at
Torit, southeast of Juba, and that the rebels had begun operations
to take it.
	   The SPLA has been fighting since 1983 to try to win autonomy for
the south's Christian and animist population from the Islamic
north.
	   On Tuesday, the government of Lt. Gen. Omar el-Bashir said it
had repulsed a rebel attack against Liria that had involved Ugandan
troops. It said the army killed 50 Ugandan troops and southern
rebels.
	   On Thursday, el-Bashir demanded that Ugandan forces be
withdrawn, the official Sudan News Agency reported.
	   SUNA also quoted Riak Machar, a former SPLA commander who has
joined el-Bashir's government, as saying the involvement of Ugandan
troops was a violation of non-aggression pacts between Sudan and
Uganda.
	   Machar termed it ``a step back by Uganda'' from its commitments.
	   In Kampala, a Ugandan military spokesman denied that Ugandan
troops had crossed into Sudan and attributed the attack to the
SPLA.
	   Ugandan troops do not even chase Ugandan rebels of the Lord's
Resistance Army across the border, Lt. Ethau Mugira said.
	   ``If we have to stop the LRA, we would remain on the border and
kill them as they cross. We do not go to Sudan,'' Mugira said.
	   Uganda severed relations with Khartoum in 1995 after accusing
Sudan of harboring Ugandan rebels seeking to overthrow the
government. In turn, Sudan has accused Uganda _ along with Eritrea
and Ethiopia _ of aiding the Sudanese rebels.

Palestinian killed in West Bank shooting; new settlement plans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Israel radio saying Palestinian students threw
stones before the motorists opened fire &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli motorists on Thursday killed a
Palestinian high school student in a West Bank shooting and Israel
announced it would expand a Jewish settlement 10-fold in response
to the recent killing of two settlers by Palestinian militants.
	   The shooting and the settlement plans came as U.S. Mideast envoy
Dennis Ross wound down his weeklong shuttle mission without having
made progress toward agreement on an Israeli troop withdrawal in
the West Bank.
	   Diplomatic sources said in Washington on Wednesday that U.S.
President Bill Clinton was trying to arrange a three-way summit in
New York next week with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to wrap up such a deal.
	   However, on Thursday it appeared increasingly unlikely that such
a meeting would take place unless Ross made significant progress
before returning to Washington at the end of the week.
	   The three leaders will be in New York for the U.N. General
Assembly. An Israeli Foreign Ministry official, Yitzhak Lior, said
it was more likely that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
would hold separate talks with Arafat and Netanyahu.
	   The fatal shooting took place in the West Bank village of
Beitunia around noon Thursday when a group of a dozen Palestinian
high school students was walking along the main road. Israel radio
said the students threw stones at passing Israeli cars, though the
students denied this.
	   One of the students, Raed Abdel Rahman, 17, said an Israeli car
pulled up, the passengers rolled down the windows and started
shooting from a pistol and an assault rifle.
	   ``Everybody started to jump and take cover,'' said Abdel Rahman.
	   Two of the teen-agers were hit in the stomach and taken to
nearby Ramallah Hospital where 17-year-old Iyad Hashem later died
of his injury. The second boy was in stable condition.

continues &QL;

tri-nation report on elections; ADDS details, background; ADDS

 &UR; By ANDREW SELSKY &QC;

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Demonstrators in the kingdom
of Lesotho closed down government offices and businesses Thursday
to protest election results while a week-old mutiny by junior army
officers continued to seethe.
	   Armed soldiers looked on but didn't intervene as demonstrators
surrounded government offices and many businesses, including the
southern African nation's only brewery and its largest flour mill,
and prevented workers from entering, according to diplomats.
	   Demonstrators have hijacked about 70 government-owned cars over
the past two days and have driven them to the grounds of King
Letsie III's palace, where protesters have been camped for weeks.
	   The soldiers didn't attempt to break up the demonstrations, but
have stepped in to prevent the unrest from escalating into
hijackings of privately owned cars and robberies of passersby, a
Western diplomat said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   It was unclear who the soldiers on the streets were getting
their orders from. The military has been in turmoil since junior
army officers arrested the army commander, Lt. Gen. Makhula
Mosakeng, and other senior officers on Sept. 11. Although Mosakeng
has been released, he apparently has no authority over his troops.
	   Diplomats have been unable to confirm reports the junior
officers mutinied because they were ordered to oust the protesters
from the palace with deadly force if necessary.
	   Nearby countries are concerned about the increasing unrest in
Lesotho, a Belgium-sized country of 2 million people located within
South Africa's borders.
	   In a report released Thursday, a commission composed of
representatives of South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana criticized
the May 1998 elections, which gave a sweeping victory to Lesotho's
ruling party.
	   The report, obtained by The Associated Press, cites ``serious
concerns'' about apparent election irregularities, contradicting
international election observers who had deemed the vote free and
fair.
	   The tri-nation report said seals on ballot boxes had been
prematurely broken and material from different polling stations had
been mixed together. But the report merely calls for restoration of
confidence in Lesotho's electoral commission and does not declare
the election invalid.
	   Opposition figures had been hoping the report would conclude the
election was fraudulent. The relatively lukewarm findings could
inflame tensions among protesters.
	   Representatives of the three countries were delivering the
report Thursday to the Lesotho government and to opposition
parties.
	   Meanwhile, several of the deposed senior army officers have fled
to South Africa, news reports said. The officers, who left the
previous evening, had been released from captivity last week.
	   Lesotho, an impoverished country whose main revenue comes from
its citizens working in South Africa's gold mines, has a history of
political upheaval.
	   In 1970, the first elections after Lesotho gained independence
from Britain were cancelled because the ruling party was afraid it
would lose.
	   The military, after staging a coup in 1986, allowed elections in
1993, but the vote was widely criticized as fraudulent with one
party winning every seat in parliament.
	   In early 1994 dissident troops kidnapped several Cabinet
ministers and assassinated Deputy Prime Minister Selometsi Baholo.
Loyal troops crushed the rebellion.

Sudanese promise big rally to mark one month after US attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The Sudanese government is planning a
massive rally on Sunday to mark the one-month anniversary of the
U.S. missile attack on a pharmaceutical plant in the capital.
	   ``All workers and civil servants in Khartoum will gather in
front of Friendship Hall on September 20 to renew their
denunciation of the American act of aggression,'' State Minister
for Labor Abdel Rahman Nour-Eddin told state-run Radio Omdurman.
	   U.S. cruise missiles destroyed the el-Shifa factory in north
Khartoum on Aug. 20 in an attack that retaliated for the bombing of
American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania earlier that month.
	   Washington said the factory produced the ingredients of chemical
weapons and belonged to an organization in which Osama bin Laden,
the alleged mastermind of the embassy bombings, was a shareholder.
	   Khartoum said the factory produced only drugs for humans and
animals and was owned by a businessman.
	   ``The present American administration has proved to be unjust
and arrogant,'' Nour-Eddin said.
	   The Friendship Hall overlooks the confluence of the Blue and
White Niles.

Dutch stocks sharply down in nervous market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Prices on the Amsterdam Stock
Exchange hit a six-month low Thursday, with technology and
financial stocks taking a beating in a continuously nervous market.
	   The 27-share AEX index plunged to close at 987.55 points, the
lowest level since February, down 39.79 points, or 3.9 percent.
	   The index had bottomed out at 977.83 points earlier but rallied
slightly as investors started buying again in the late afternoon.
Traders described the bourse floor as jittery, with negative
reactions to any bad news.
	   Financial stocks sank on the back of ongoing worries about
economic turmoil in Asia, Russia and Latin America.

Twelve Nobel laureates meet to honor Marie Curie
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ One hundred years after Polish-born
physicist Marie Sklodowska Curie discovered radioactive elements,
12 fellow Nobel Prize winners gathered Thursday for a conference to
discuss scientific responsibility.
	   At the opening session, participants noted Curie's 1898
discoveries opened the doors for cancer-fighting radiotherapy, but
also for the construction of nuclear weapons.
	   Joseph Rotblat, the 1995 Peace Prize winner, said that when
Curie was doing her research, ``it seemed that science had no link
to politics.''
	   ``Later, it turned out that it has great influence on politics
and that scientists are responsible for the fate of the world,''
said Rotblat, a British nuclear scientist who became an
anti-nuclear activist.
	   Curie, born in Warsaw in 1867 as Maria Sklodowska, did her
research in Paris together with her French husband Pierre Curie.
	   She won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1903 for the discovery of
radioactive radium and polonium, and a Nobel Prize in chemistry in
1911 for research on the two elements.
	   Rotblat recalled that he met Curie in Warsaw in 1932, two years
before her death, during the opening of the Radium Institute, a
medical institution devoted to treating cancer.
	   The conference is attended by Nobel laureates in medicine:
Baruch Blumberg (1976), Christian de Duve (1974) and Edward Lewis
(1995), in chemistry: Paul Crutzen and Sherwood Rowland (1995),
Jerome Karle (1985) and in physics: Carlo Rubbia (1984), Burton
Richter (1976), Rudolf Moessbauer (1961), Jerome Friedman (1990)
and Leo Esaki (1973).
	   They were among some 100 scientists from around the world at the
conference, which also will address the future of physics and
biology.
	   Curie's granddaughter Helene Langevin-Joliot is also present.

	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Riot police and paramilitary
commandos Thursday lobbed teargas and assaulted protesters and
commuters in a display of force amid growing unrest following the
police killing of taxi driver.
	   Squadrons of officers at roadblocks throughout the western
suburbs of Abidjan, Ivory Coast's commercial capital, randomly
dragged civilians _ mainly taxi and minibus drivers _ out of their
vehicles to kick and beat them with whips, gun butts and
truncheons.
	   In the Abobo suburb, an impoverished neighborhood of crowded
shanties and grimy street stalls, crowds of more than a thousand
curious onlookers were scattered in all directions when police
launched tear gas into the area.
	   Smaller throngs of mainly women and teenage youths were
dispersed by police wielding tear gas and clubs in the Yopougon
neighborhood, where taxi drivers had clashed with police a day
earlier. A group of drivers attacked a police station with rocks
and bottles Wednesday and set several cars on fire.
	   The police had eventually barricaded themselves inside the
station and fired tear gas canisters into the crowds.
	   On Thursday, throughout Abidjan's west side, police took up
positions along a number of main roads.
	   Police over the weekend shot and killed a taxi driver who failed
to stop at a routine checkpoint, sparking a city-wide strike Monday
by taxi and minibus drivers that has slowly grown violent.
	   Checkpoints are often used by Ivorian police to extort money
from drivers.
	   The head of Abidjan's taxi union said police on Saturday shot at
Assane Sanogo's cab when he failed to stop and continued shooting
until the driver was dead.
	   The strike has tapped growing anger among cab drivers, who claim
at least five of their colleagues have been shot dead by police in
the last year.
	   There were unconfirmed reports of two serious injuries during
Wednesday clashes, but it was not immediately clear if anyone had
been seriously hurt in Thursday's beatings.
	   A government statement read on state radio apologized for
Sanogo's death and said the officers responsible had been arrested.
President Henri Konan Bedie has appealed to taxi drivers to return
to work. Taxi union leaders met with government officials Thursday
in an attempt to resolve the dispute.
	   Some drivers vowed to continue the strike until police brutality
ended.
	   ``We have had enough of police violence and greed,'' said Yoda
Hamiodu, a driver from Yopougon.
	   Normally packed with orange and yellow taxis, Abidjan's streets
have been quiet since the drivers began their strike. Buses are
jammed and many commuters are forced to walk miles (kilometers)
along major thoroughfares to work and back.
	   Ivory Coast is among West Africa's most peaceful countries and
unlike its neighbors, has never experienced a coup or armed
rebellion.

Top Serbian officials blast Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Two top Serbian officials blasted
Germany Thursday for its alleged support of Kosovo Albanian
``terrorists,'' and one called for Germany's defeat if NATO strikes
in the troubled Serbian province.
	   ``Our people have to get ready for defense,'' said Vojislav
Seselj, Serbia's ultranationalist vice Premier. ``Germany and all
its allies must be defeated if they strike against our territory.''
	   ``There will be no mercy for the aggressor,'' Seselj told
reporters. ``Germans and their allies from NATO must know this.''
	   In recent weeks, American and European officials have signaled
growing exasperation with Serbia's crackdown against Kosovo
Albanian separatists, and more willingness to use force to end the
bloodshed.
	   German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said on German television
Tuesday that military action could come in a matter of weeks.
	   At a separate press conference, spokesman for Serbia's ruling
Socialist Party Ivica Dacic accused Germany of ``openly supporting
(ethnic Albanian) terrorists in Kosovo.''
	   ``Probably, two (German) genocides against the Serbian people
were not enough, so they want to finish off the job,'' Dacic said,
referring to World Wars I and II when the Serbs fought alongside
the allies against the German Axis.

Opposition protests parliament approval of state media tax
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Opposition lawmakers in Bulgaria walked
out of parliament Thursday, protesting adoption of a new tax law
intended to raise money for state radio and TV.
	   The new tax would be imposed on all households, comapanies and
instutions owning watt-hour meters and will be paid together with
electricity bills, and is expected to take effect later this year.
	   Household will be charged 0.6 percent of the government-set
minimum monthly wage, while companies and institutions will be
charged 2.5 percent of the minimum monthly wage, currently leva
55,000 (some dlrs 33).
	   Money collected from the tax will go into a fund aimed at
suppoprting state radio and TV, allowing the government to
partially cut state media subsidies. An independent National
Council on Radio and TV will be set up to control the fund,
effectively decreasing government control of state media.
	   Opposition lawmakers led by the Socialist _ formerly Communist _
Party, walked out of parliament in protest of the bill, saying they
would appeal it in court. They argue the tax is unfair, as some 10
percent of Bulgaria's 8.2 million people don't have TV sets, while
some 30 percent own two TV sets.
	   State-run TV is the only station in Bulgaria with nation-wide
coverage, reaching some 5 million viewers. Since 1990, scores of
local private TV stations have mushroomed across the country.

Mali premier meets governments to discuss poverty reduction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Mali's prime minister appealed to the United
States, Japan, European countries and others Thursday for dlrs 372
million to reduce poverty in the north west African nation.
	   Ibrahim Boubacar Keita is seeking the support of other
governments at a two day meeting in Geneva for a five year strategy
to satisfy the basic needs of Mali's 9.8 million people.
	   Half the population don't have access to fresh drinking water
and 46 percent of Mali's children cannot attend school, Keita told
a news conference.
	   In 1996, an estimated 71.6 percent of the population was living
below the poverty line, a U.N. Development Program news release
said. The country's strategy aims to reduce poverty by at least 12
percent during the next five years.
	   Around 65 percent of Mali is desert or semi-desert and 80
percent of the working population is employed in farming and
severely affected by bad weather, the news release said.

EU opera company debuts with Tchaikovsky performance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European opera gets a new voice this
weekend with the debut of the European Union Opera company set up
to promote the careers of talented young singers.
	   ``We need to ensure that Europe's most gifted young artistes are
as prepared and equipped as they should be to compete in the
world,'' Brian Dickie, General Director of the EUO said Thursday.
	   The EUO will make its debut Saturday with a performance of
Tchikovsky's 'Eugene Onegin' in the Germany city of Baden-Baden
with Ireland's Orla Boylan, 27, and Russian-born Vladimir
Glushchak, 30, from Duesseldorf, Germany in the lead roles.
	   About 50 young singers make up the new company, selected from
more than 400 singers under 30 who auditioned for a place. While
working for the EUO they receive coaching from top Opera stars.
	   The EU is sponsoring the opera company hoping to extend the work
of the European Union Youth Orchestra, which has become an
established feature of the European concert circuit since its
creation in 1976.
	   After four performances at the Festspielhaus in Baden-Baden, the
EUO production of Eugene Onegin will move to the Theatre des Champs
Elysees in Paris on Oct. 5 and 6.
	   The EUO will also give concern performances of Berlioz's comic
opera Beatrice et Benedict in Baden-Baden and Paris.

American biologist to receive annual prize
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Argentine-born American biologist Otto Thomas
Solbrig was chosen Thursday as the winner of an annual award by the
Japanese Education Ministry for his work on links between biology
and the global environment.
	   The Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, which is
affiliated with the ministry, said Solbrig, a 67-year-old professor
at Harvard University, will receive the International Prize for
Biology and 10 million yen (dlrs 74,000). The awards ceremony will
be in Tokyo Dec. 7, it said.
	   The prize was established in 1985 to honor the 60th year of the
reign of the late Emperor Hirohito and his long years of devotion
to biological research. Hirohito died of cancer in January 1989 at
the age of 87.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Japanese college student was robbed
of his money and belongings after three Thai prostitutes slipped
sleeping pills in his drink, a police officer said Thursday.
	   Kenichi Misawa, 21, woke up in a hotel room in one of Bangkok
red-light districts and discovered that his passport, 50,000 yen
(dlrs 370) and 3,00 baht (dlrs 73) in cash, and checks worth 80,000
yen (dlrs 597) were missing, according to the officer who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   The student filed a complaint against the three women on
Wednesday, the officer said.
	   The women have acknowledged putting sleeping pills in the drink
but say they already spent some of the money, he said.

Palestinian killed in West Bank shooting; new settlement plans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout to UPDATE with Israeli officials saying
summit not likely; INCORPORATES Israel-Shooting. &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli motorists on Thursday killed a
Palestinian high school student in a West Bank shooting and Israel
announced it would expand a Jewish settlement in response to the
recent killing of two settlers by Palestinian militants.
	   The shooting and the settlement plans came as U.S. Mideast envoy
Dennis Ross wound down a weeklong mission without having made
progress toward agreement on an Israeli troop withdrawal from the
West Bank.
	   Diplomatic sources said Wednesday in Washington that U.S.
President Bill Clinton was trying to arrange a three-way summit in
New York next week with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to wrap up such a deal.
	   However, on Thursday it appeared increasingly unlikely that such
a meeting would take place unless Ross made significant progress
before returning to Washington at the end of the week.
	   The three leaders will be in New York for the U.N. General
Assembly. An Israeli Foreign Ministry official said it was more
likely that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would hold
separate talks with Arafat and Netanyahu.
	   The fatal shooting took place in the West Bank village of
Beitunia around noon Thursday when a group of a dozen Palestinian
high school students was walking along the main road.
	   One of the students, Raed Abdel Rahman, 17, said an Israeli car
pulled up, the passengers rolled down the windows and started
shooting from a pistol and an assault rifle.
	   ``Everybody started to jump and take cover,'' said Abdel Rahman.
	   Two of the teen-agers were hit in the stomach and taken to
nearby Ramallah Hospital where 17-year-old Iyad Hashem later died
of his injury. The second boy was in stable condition.
	   Abdel Rahman insisted that the motorists opened fire without
provocation and that the teen-agers had not first stoned the
Israeli car. However, in the past, Israeli drivers have repeatedly
fired shots to repulse stone throwers in the West Bank.
	   The Israeli army said police was handling the matter. Police
spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said she was checking the incident.
	   Meanwhile, tensions rose over Israeli construction plans on
disputed land.
	   Israel approved plans to build 600 new homes in the Jewish West
Bank settlement of Yitzhar where two residents were killed last
month in a drive-by shooting by Palestinian militants. Yitzhar is
currently home to 60 families.
	   Netanyahu told the Yediot Ahronot daily that he approved the
construction ``as another response of mine to terrorist
perpetrators.''
	   The United States has urged Israel to halt settlement expansion.
Israel says it is trying to accommodate natural growth while the
Palestinians say the construction is part of an illegal land grab.
	   ``This expansion policy is the bomb that will explode all the
efforts to put the peace process back on track,'' said Ahmed Abdel
Rahman, the secretary-general of the Palestinian Cabinet.
	   The Yediot Ahronot daily said Israel would confiscate land from
four Palestinian villages for the new construction.
	   However, Peter Lerner, a spokesman for Israel's military
government in the West Bank, said no private Palestinian land would
be expropriated for the construction.
	   In disputed east Jerusalem, some 35 members of Betar, the youth
movement of Netanyahu's Likud Party, set up two tents and a mobile
home at the site of the planned Jewish neighborhood of Har Homa.
	   The demonstrators said they wanted to push Netanyahu to begin
construction of the 6,500 homes planned at the site, known in
Arabic as Jabal Abu Ghneim.
	   After five hours, police dismantled the tents and ordered the
demonstrators to leave. Several were detained for questioning.
	   The Palestinians hope to establish a future capital in east
Jerusalem, the sector captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967
Mideast war. They broke off peace talks with Israel in March 1997,
when Netanyahu broke ground for Har Homa.
	   On Thursday, Jordan's new prime minister, Fayez Tarawneh, urged
Israel to withdraw from Syrian and Lebanese territories to pave the
way for a regional settlement.

WHO boss says smoking could account for one-fifth of all deaths
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Smoking is increasingly becoming a
global health burden and could account for one of every five deaths
within a decade, the head of the World Health Organization said
Thursday.
	   ``Unless we take decisive action, tobacco will be responsible
for 2 million deaths, 20 percent of all deaths, in 2010,'' said Gro
Harlem Bundtland, who took over in July as head of the U.N. health
agency.
	   Brundtland, a former prime minister of Norway, welcomed last
month's decision by the European Union to ban almost all tobacco
advertising by 2006.
	   ``It should not be subsidized, advertised or glamorized,'' she
said at a news conference. She called the EU move ``a landmark
public health event with implications far beyond the EU border.''
	   Brundtland spoke to reporters after addressing the annual
meeting of health officials from WHO's European region.

Gunmen in northern Mexico set up firing squad for three families;

18 dead &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with details of scene, weapons used. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Gunmen in a northern Mexican town pulled
three families from their beds, lined them up against a wall and
opened fire before dawn Thursday. Eighteen people were killed and
three were seriously wounded, police said.
	   Television images from the scene showed the bloody bodies lined
up on the ground, most in their pajamas or naked as if they were
pulled from their sleep. Police said the attack took place before
dawn.
	   The concrete houses of the victims were surrounded with
children's toys, and at least one of the bodies seen on television
was that of a baby.
	   Ensenada Judicial Police officer Jose Ramon Espinoza said the
victims were members of three families: the Flores family and two
families that both had the last name Castro. It was unclear whether
the families were related.
	   ``It appears they rounded them all up, lined them up and gunned
them down,'' Espinoza said. He said 18 people were killed and three
seriously wounded.
	   The shooting occurred in El Sauzal, a suburb of the resort of
Ensenada and only 60 miles (100 kilometers) south of the U.S.
border. Turkeys cackled in the yard.
	   The yard was filled with broken glass, and chairs were
overturned on the porch, indicating a struggle. Beds were unmade,
the sheets and blankets pulled to the side.
	   Dozens of bullet casings surrounded the bodies, and the Televisa
television network said most were from a Kalashnikov assault
weapon, although some were from smaller-caliber weapons and
shotguns.
	   Espinoza said he had no information on suspects or a possible
motive.
	   Televisa gave the death toll at 19 and said there were two
survivors.

Agassi at a price: presidential apartment, villa, satellite dish
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ It's not the purse, it's the
presidential apartment.
	   Organizers of the IPB Czech Indoor tennis tournament have signed
U.S. star Andre Agassi for the Oct. 19-25 event _ but only after
offering him megaperks, according to tournament director Petr
Kovarcik.
	   ``He has asked for a presidential apartment and two other luxury
apartments in the best hotel in town, private pool and gym,'' the
daily Pravo quoted Kovarcik as saying. ``We'll probably rent a
villa with a pool and a gym for him.''
	   Because Agassi also wanted to watch American TV channels,
``we'll buy him a satellite receiver,'' Kovarcik reportedly said.
	   Agassi will fly to the tournament in Ostrava on a private plane.
That and the costs of his stay will probably cost more than the
dlrs 200,000 the player will get in appearance money, organizers
said.
	   Besides Agassi, the dlrs 1 million IPB Czech Indoor will host
two other top 10 players on the ATP tour _ Petr Korda and Yevgeni
Kafelnikov, as well as U.S. Open finalist Mark Philippoussis.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Support among Europeans for their
soon-to-be-launched common currency is at an all-time high, with 60
percent of European Union citizens backing the euro, according to
an EU poll published Thursday.
	   Support is even stronger in the 11 countries where the euro will
be launched on Jan. 1. Sixty-six percent there said they supported
the EU single currency and just 23 percent opposed it, the
Eurobarometer survey said.
	   In the nations staying out of the first wave of the currency
union _ Britain, Sweden, Greece and Denmark _ only 39 percent of
citizens supported the euro.
	   Across all 15 EU member nations, the survey taken in April and
May found fast-growing support for the euro, with 60 percent of
citizens in favor of it and 28 percent against. Support was up
almost 10 points from the last time the semi-annual poll was taken
in October-November 1997.
	   ``This increase ... represents the first truly significant
improvement since 1993 (when the poll began), with opposition to
the single currency falling below 30 percent for the first time,''
proclaimed the European Commission which ordered the poll.
	   Italians are the biggest supporters of the euro, with 83 percent
backing it as a replacement for the lira. Danes are the least
enthusiastic, with 34 percent in favor.
	   The Commission, the EU executive body, noted that in Austria,
Finland and Germany support for the euro was above 50 percent for
the first time, with Germany coming in at 51 percent.
	   Finns had the biggest change of heart, with 53 percent in favor
of the euro, compared to 33 percent in the last survey.
	   The poll also showed an increased in support for the EU as a
whole, with backing for membership of the Union rising above 50
percent _ to 51 percent _ for the first time since 1996.
	   The Irish and Dutch are the EU's biggest supporters with over
three-quarters of them stating their countries' membership of the
Union is a ``good thing.''
	   The three most recent members of the EU club are the least
contented. Four years after they joined support for EU membership,
support is now down to 32 percent in Sweden, and 36 percent in
Finland and Austria.
	   EU citizens don't appear keen to welcome in their eastern
neighbors. Just 44 percent said they approve of the Union's plans
to take on new members from among the former communist bloc.
	   The survey was based on interviews with about 1,000 citizens in
each of the EU nations. Margins of error were estimated at between
1.9 and 3.1 percentage points.

Planning chief says reforms not yet finished
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HEMA SHUKLA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The deputy chairman of India's economic
planning commission called Thursday for more reforms in this once
socialist-style state.
	   Reforms launched in 1991 ``have not completely released the
energy of Indian entrepreneurs,'' Jaswant Singh told reporters.
``There is still the oppressiveness of excessive governance.''
	   Though Singh did not elaborate Thursday, his government has in
the past pledged to speed up the sale of state-owned industry and
cut bureaucratic red tape that investors complain is stifling
growth.
	   Singh also said he was counting on foreign business to create
more jobs in India. For example, he said, the Swiss national
carrier has a reservations office in Bombay that employs 1,000
Indians.
	   The planning commission Jaswant Singh oversees _ Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee is its figurehead chairman _ is itself a
holdover from the days India's economy was centrally planned,
closed to most foreign entrepreneurs and characterized by
state-owned industry.
	   Reforms pushed India's growth rate to a strong 7 percent to 8
percent in the early 1990s. But progress has since bogged down in
political squabbles over the direction and pace of reform.
	   Growth was 5 percent in the fiscal year 1997-98, the lowest in
the last five years. The future looks troubled in part because of a
sharp plunge in the rupee following anti-nuclear sanctions.
	   In addition to his planning commission portfolio, Singh was
appointed by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to negotiate with
a United States angered by India's May nuclear weapons tests. The
United States and other countries imposed economic sanctions
because of the tests.
	   Singh refused to discuss his ongoing talks with U.S. envoy
Strobe Talbott, saying only that the next meeting, on an
unspecified date, would be in Washington.

Italy's Bugno wins 12th stage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANFRANC, Spain (AP) _ Italy's Gianni Bugno of the Mapei team
won the 12th leg of the Tour of Spain cycling marathon Thursday.
	   Bugno needed 4 hours, 26 minutes and 4 seconds to peddle the
187-kilometer (116-mile) run in northern Spain that ended in a
steep climb up the Canfranc mountain pass.
	   Together with 11 other cyclists, veteran racer Bugno broke away
from the main pack just over 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the
start. The group reduced to four riders later, until Bugno took off
on his own for the last few kilometers (miles).
	   Santiago Blanco of the Vitalicio Seguros team came in 1 minute
48 seconds later at No. 2.
	   But the stage did little to alter the overall standings with
Spaniard Abraham Olano still leading the 22-stage race on the
strength of his time-trial win in the 9th leg.
	   Friday's 13th-leg covers 208 kilometers and includes four
mountain climbs.

Auction of James Bond memorabilia brings thousands

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A Lotus Esprit S1 automobile fetched 29,000 pounds
(dlrs 49,000) at a Christie's auction Thursday. Never mind that it
didn't have a motor: It just happened to be the prop car featured
in the 1977 James Bond movie ``The Spy Who Loved Me.''
	   The sleek automobile, which Roger Moore's version of Agent 007
piloted on land and sea in the film, was among the most
recognizable of the 250-plus lots peddled at the auction of Bond
memorabilia.
	   Generating the most interest _ and the most money _ was the
lethal metal-rimmed bowler used by assassin Oddjob, the most famous
of the Bond villains, in the 1964 film ``Goldfinger.'' An anonymous
bidder, participating by phone, paid 62,000 pounds (dlrs 104,700).
	   Among the more curious items up for grabs was one that had never
been in a Bond movie and carried an extra zero to boot _ a ``0007''
British car license plate.
	   Houmayoun Sharifi of London, who came across with the 32,000
pounds (dlrs 54,000) for it, said it would go on his Bentley.
	   Also among the toys, posters, clothing and various other props
on the block was the Rolex Oyster Perpetual watch worn by Moore in
his first Bond film, 1973's ``Live and Let Die.'' It brought about
22,000 pounds (dlrs 37,200), more than five times the estimate.
	   In the film, the watch is adapted by Secret Service gadgets
expert Q to feature a powerful magnet, for which 007 found an
ingenious use _ hands-free unzipping of a Bond girl's dress.
	   The number of bidders crammed into two separate sale rooms and
others bidding by telephone pushed prices for many items far higher
than estimates. When bidding ended, the auction had raised 480,000
pounds (dlrs 811,000), more than double the amount expected,
Christie's spokeswoman Emma Sully said.

Suharto may face jail if guilty of abusing power in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Former President Suharto would go to
prison if he is found guilty of abusing power during the 32 years
he ruled Indonesia, a senior official said Thursday.
	   Justice Minister Muladi said he was confident that a new
investigation team will seriously probe the wealth of Suharto, who
resigned in May amid massive protests against his autocratic rule.
	   ``If he is found guilty, then the criminal code will be
imposed,'' Muladi told reporters after attending a hearing at the
parliament.
	   President B.J. Habibie, who replaced Suharto, authorized the
investigation of his longtime friend and ally over alleged
corruption during his 32-year rule.
	   The investigation is being led by Attorney General Muhammad Andi
Ghalib, who was to question Suharto over a recent denial that he
and his family had no overseas accounts. The attorney general's
office announced this month that it found strong indications of
mismanagement in foundations that Suharto set up and ran.
	   The team, which includes the national police chief and top
finance officials, will also investigate Suharto's six children,
who are all billionaires.
	   One son, Bambang Trihatmodjo, has been banned from leaving the
country as police prepare to question him over the collapse of a
bank he partly owned.
	   Also Thursday, President B.J. Habibie also called for an end to
derision of Suharto, who he said was dedicated to the nation.
	   ``Humiliation against the former president should be stopped
now,'' State Secretary Akbar Tanjung quoted Habibie as saying.
	   Citing a proverb, he urged people ``not relinquish their
cultural values that urge people not to `spit the waste after
sucking the sweet.'''

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Top-seeded Francisco Clavet advanced
to the quarterfinals of the Romanian Open but defending champion
and second-seeded Richard Fromberg was ousted Thursday by Emilio
Alvarez.
	   Alvarez, a Spaniard, beat the Australian 7-6 (7-4), 3-6, 7-5 in
a match that lasted 150 minutes.
	   Clavet struggled and needed three sets to defeat the unseeded
Romanian Dinu Pescariu 3-6, 7-5, 6-2. Clavet, one of the five
Spaniards in the quarterfinals, turned the match after prevailing
in a hard-fought second set.
	   Another unseeded Romanian, Andrei Pavel, produced the second
upset of the day in the dlrs 350,000 clay-court tournament.
	   Pavel rallied to beat fourth-seeded Carlos Costa of Spain 6-7
(6-8), 6-3, 6-1, taking control of the match in the second set with
a good service and strong net play.
	   In other matches, Adrian Voinea of Romania upset his countryman
Ion Moldovan 6-3, 6-4, while eighth-seeded Julian Alonso beat
fellow Spaniard Alex Calatrava 6-2, 6-7 (4-7), 6-4.

Cult guru's lawyers lash at prosecutors, court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Attorneys for a cult guru accused of murder in the
nerve gas attack on Tokyo subways denounced his trial Thursday as
``unfair'' because some of the prosecutors' charges are
contradicted by testimony from their own witnesses.
	   Shoko Asahara, the leader of the Aum Shinri Kyo cult, is on
trial on 17 charges in the March 20, 1995 sarin attack that killed
12 people and sickened thousands.
	   Other cult leaders have also been charged in the gassing as well
as in other slayings.
	   Osamu Watanabe, Asahara's chief defense lawyer, said the trial
should not be allowed to go on.
	   ``We must wonder why such abnormal and unfair proceedings are
tolerated. The court has been negligent,'' Watanabe told the Tokyo
District Court.
	   The prosecutors say Asahara, accused of masterminding the subway
gassing, decided on the attack on March 18, 1995 while riding in a
car with his followers.
	   But Watanabe pointed out that top cultist Yoshihiro Inoue, a key
witness for the prosecution, told the court that Asahara was still
undecided on the timing of the attack at that time. Inoue quoted
Asahara as saying that he needed to meditate about it.
	   Last April, the defense raised similar objections, but the
prosecutors refused to change their statement.

Palestinian killed in West Bank shooting; new settlement plans

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli motorists on Thursday killed a
Palestinian high school student in a West Bank shooting, witnesses
said. Israel announced it would expand a Jewish settlement 10-fold
in response to the recent killing of two settlers by Palestinian
militants.
	   The shooting and the settlement plans came as U.S. Mideast envoy
Dennis Ross wound down his weeklong shuttle mission without having
made progress toward agreement on an Israeli troop withdrawal in
the West Bank.
	   Diplomatic sources said in Washington on Wednesday that U.S.
President Bill Clinton was trying to arrange a three-way summit in
New York next week with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to wrap up such a deal.
	   However, on Thursday it appeared increasingly unlikely that such
a meeting would take place unless Ross made significant progress
before returning to Washington at the end of the week.
	   The three leaders will be in New York for the U.N. General
Assembly. An Israeli Foreign Ministry official, Yitzhak Lior, said
it was more likely that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
would hold separate talks with Arafat and Netanyahu.
	   The fatal shooting took place in the West Bank village of
Beitunia around noon Thursday when a group of a dozen Palestinian
high school students was walking along the main road. One of the
youths described the vehicle driven by the shooters as having
Israeli license plates.
	   Israel radio said the students threw stones at passing Israeli
cars, though the students denied this.
	   One of the students, Raed Abdel Rahman, 17, said an Israeli car
pulled up, the passengers rolled down the windows and started
shooting from a pistol and an assault rifle.
	   ``Everybody started to jump and take cover,'' said Abdel Rahman.
	   Two of the teen-agers were hit in the stomach and taken to
nearby Ramallah Hospital where 17-year-old Iyad Hashem later died
of his injury. The second boy was in stable condition.
	   Israeli police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said Israeli police
were investigating the incident.

Trial hopes to crack enigma of Florence Rey
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Rey sobbing, other info &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Florence Rey, tousle-haired, dressed in a blue jean
jacket, wiped away tears as she stepped into the courtroom to be
judged for a 1994 cops-and-robbers chase that turned into one of
the bloodiest common crimes in France in a decade.
	   Four years after the deadly escapade that left five people dead,
including three police officers and her accomplice, the 23-year-old
stood before a court that will try to unlock the enigma behind Ms.
Rey, whose motives remain a mystery.
	   A second person, Abdelhakim Dekhar, 33, accused of being the
``third man'' described by eyewitnesses in the Oct. 4, 1994,
episode also was being tried. Dekhar denies any involvement.
	   Rey's companion in crime, Audry Maupin, then 22, died a day
later.
	   Rey, then a haggard-looking literature student, daughter of a
plumber and a school teacher, is accused of murder and attempted
murder.
	   On the first day of court, devoted to calling in the jury --
seven women and two men -- and setting the agenda, Rey sobbed
several times, bursting into tears when her parents were called
forward for their hearing date.
	   The trial, likely to last two weeks, is expected to shed light
on extreme-left movements to which Rey and Maupin had allegedly
gravitated. It was not clear whether that connection could help
explain the origin of the drama. Only the events that unfolded that
night four years ago are clear:
	   Rey and Maupin, armed with rifles, try to hold up a car lot in
northeast Paris, allegedly tear gassing two police officers and
taking their pistols.
	   The two then commandeer a taxi, taking the driver and passenger
hostage. The driver, frightened, purposely rams a police car,
prompting an initial shootout. Two police officers and the taxi
driver are killed and two passersby wounded.
	   Rey and Maupin then commandeer a second car. Police give chase
and the driver is ordered to accelerate. But the car is suddenly
blocked by a motorcyclist who lays his cycle across the road to
stop the pair.
	   A second shootout erupts: one police officer is killed and
Maupin seriously injured. Rey throws down her rifle and surrenders.
	   Psychiatrists, according to the prosecution, describe Rey as
having a ``good intellectual level'' but living with an
``idealization of the future cut off from social reality.''
	   Ballistics experts determined that the fatal shots came from
Maupin's weapons. But Rey confessed to firing, too, numerous times.
	   The prosecution claims she ``participated by her presence and
her action, her support and her encouragement of her friend, in all
of the acts perpetrated during this murderous escapade.''
	   Still, no one seems to know why.

Consortium buys Brazilian power company
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ In a mixed success for Brazil's
privatization drive, Sao Paulo state sold its Bandeirante electric
company on Thursday for 1 billion reals, or about dlrs 856 million.
	   There was only one bidder at the auction. A consortium formed by
Electricidade de Portugal and Brazilian power company CPFL paid the
minimum price for 75 percent of Bandeirante's voting capital.
	   But at least it was sold. An earlier attempt to sell the company
failed to attract any bidders. And some analysts feared the current
market turmoil would again scare off prospective buyers.
	   Electricidade de Portugal, known as EDP, already owns a minority
stake in the Rio de Janeiro utility Cerj. It has invested around
dlrs 1 billion in its Brazilian operations and is looking for more.
	   ``We consider Latin America in general and Brazil in particular
as a top priority,'' said EDP president Mario Cristina de Sousa.
	   He said the company is studying other investments in power
distribution and is interested in the Sao Paulo gas distribution
company Comgas, which should be sold next year.
	   Bandeirante was Brazil's last major electricity distribution
company still under state control. The privatization of government
assets this year has generated about dlrs 36 billion, up from dlrs
27.5 billion in 1997.

Police seize sizable quantity of marijuana
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   IGOUMENITSA, Greece (AP) _ Port police have seized 161 kilograms
(360 pounds) of marijuana on the outskirts of this northern port
city near the border with Albania.
	   Authorities said Thursday the drugs were found late Wednesday
hidden in a remote mountainous region 32 kilometers (20 miles) from
the frontier. It was located following a tip-off to police, but
there were no arrests.
	   Albania is a major producer of marijuana and drug trafficking
across the mountainous Greek-Albanian border has been on the rise
since March 1997, when Albania descended into chaos following the
collapse of fraudulent pyramid investment schemes.

WHO boss says smoking could account for one-fifth of all deaths
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS typo in 'Brundtland' in 2nd graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Smoking is increasingly becoming a
global health burden and could account for one of every five deaths
within a decade, the head of the World Health Organization said
Thursday.
	   ``Unless we take decisive action, tobacco will be responsible
for 2 million deaths, 20 percent of all deaths, in 2010,'' said Gro
Harlem Brundtland, who took over in July as head of the U.N. health
agency.
	   Brundtland, a former prime minister of Norway, welcomed last
month's decision by the European Union to ban almost all tobacco
advertising by 2006.
	   ``It should not be subsidized, advertised or glamorized,'' she
said at a news conference. She called the EU move ``a landmark
public health event with implications far beyond the EU border.''
	   Brundtland spoke to reporters after addressing the annual
meeting of health officials from WHO's European region.

Campaign turns nasty with Labor attack on heroin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The election campaign turned nasty
Thursday as the Labor Party accused Prime Minister John Howard of
putting young lives at risk by allowing cheap heroin into
Australia.
	   Opposition Labor Party justice spokesman Nick Bolkus was later
forced to apologize for his attack, although he denied he had meant
Howard was personally responsible for heroin overdose deaths.
	   Howard was outraged. ``I think that's a pretty cheap, tawdry,
guttersnipe attack,'' he said.
	   Howard called on opposition leader Kim Beazley to pull his key
aides into line.
	   ``It seems that the pattern of the Labor Party is that the boss
sails on serenely in a civil manner, but at the margins he allows
his minions to say anything they like,'' he said.
	   Howard's governing conservatives and Beazley's Labor party are
battling toward an Oct. 3 national election.
	   Thursday's row erupted after Bolkus issued a statement
attempting to undercut Howard's announcement of increased funding
to fight illicit drugs.
	   Bolkus accused Howard of risking young lives by neglecting law
enforcement and said 60 young people had died from heroin overdoses
in the city of Perth last year.
	   ``And why? Because under John Howard the price of a cap of
heroin has dropped from 40 dollars (U.S. dlrs 24) to as little as 5
dollars (U.S. dlrs 3) _ cheaper than a packet of cigarettes,'' he
said.
	   Meanwhile, Howard's predecessor as conservative leader, John
Hewson, undercut Treasurer Peter Costello's rosy economic outlook,
saying economic growth will fall off dramatically this year and the
Asian crisis could go on for decades.
	   Hewson, chairman of the Australian arm of investment bank ABN
Amro, said he believed that domestic demand was slowing and that
further impact from Asia was about to flow through to the
Australian economy.
	   His comments came a day after Costello said the economy could
pick up as early as next year, with the Asian financial crisis
possibly passing ``quickly.''

Canada continues dominance of boxing as defending champ bows out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Pearce John cq in 8th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Brian Magee of Northern Ireland
scored a sensational upset over defending champion Rowan Donaldson
of Jamaica Thursday, advancing to the semifinals of middleweight
boxing at the Commonwealth Games.
	   Using quick counter punches, Magee took the lead in the third
round and posted a convincing 25-14 victory over Donaldson, who had
won the 75-kilogram division gold at the 1994 Victoria Games as a
Canadian citizen. He later moved to Jamaica, the country he
represented at the Atlanta Olympics.
	   Magee likened his victory to winning the gold medal.
	   ``It's a bonus to beat the Commonwealth champion,'' said Magee.
``It's like winning the final.''
	   Donaldson conceded Magee's superiority.
	   ``Every time I scored, he counter-punched. He is very good,''
said Donaldson.
	   Donaldson's defeat kept Canada's middleweight gold hopes alive,
as Trevor Stewardson defeated Alan Foster of Scotland 20-19.
Stewardson will meet India's Jitender Kumar in Friday's semifinals.
	   Three other Canadians also advanced to the semifinals: Michael
Strange in light welterweight, Scott MacIntosh in light
middleweight and Jeremy Molitor in welterweight.
	   Also Thursday, two Australians moved into the semis while a
third, Danny Green, conceded a walkover to Pearce John of England
in middleweight after he was declared unfit at the medical
inspection because of a broken left wrist.
	   John will now meet Magee.
	   Donaldson's defeat meant that Jamaican athletes will leave Kuala
Lumpur without a boxing medal. Gallant efforts by his countrymen,
Trevor Brown and Patrick Daley, in the light welterweight and light
middleweight categories, also were fruitless.
	   Thursday's results ensured that a Canadian will compete in every
boxing category semifinal.
	   Canadians Andrew Kooner (bantamweight), Marty O'Donnel
(featherweight), Troy Amos Ross (light heavyweight) and Mark
Simmons (heavyweight) are seen as possible gold medalists.
	   The Canadians look set to better their 1994 performance in
Victoria, where they won four golds, one silver and two bronzes.
	   ``We came here as the best team in boxing and we aim to retain
that. But my target has always been for my boxers to perform better
than their best. The end results will come naturally,'' said team
manager Taylor Gordon.
	   But a major challenge to Canada is England, which has the second
highest number of six semifinalists.

Demonstrators close down gov't offices in Lesotho, army mutiny
</HEADLINE>

elections; SUBS 5th graf to ADD name of capital; MINOR trimming

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Demonstrators in the kingdom
of Lesotho closed down government offices and businesses Thursday
to protest election results while a week-old mutiny by junior army
officers continued to seethe.
	   Armed soldiers looked on but didn't intervene as demonstrators
surrounded government offices and many businesses, including the
southern African nation's only brewery and its largest flour mill,
and prevented workers from entering, according to diplomats.
	   Demonstrators have hijacked about 70 government-owned cars over
the past two days and have driven them to the grounds of King
Letsie III's palace, where protesters have been camped for weeks.
	   The soldiers didn't attempt to break up the demonstrations, but
have stepped in to prevent the unrest from escalating into
hijackings of privately owned cars and robberies of passersby, a
Western diplomat said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   It was unclear who the soldiers on the streets of the capital
Maseru were getting their orders from. The military has been in
turmoil since junior army officers arrested the army commander, Lt.
Gen. Makhula Mosakeng, and other senior officers on Sept. 11.
Although Mosakeng has been released, he apparently has no authority
over his troops.
	   Diplomats have been unable to confirm reports the junior
officers mutinied because they were ordered to oust the protesters
from the palace with deadly force if necessary.
	   Nearby countries are concerned about the increasing unrest in
the Belgium-sized country of 2 million people located within South
Africa's borders.
	   In a report released Thursday, a commission composed of
representatives of South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana criticized
the May elections, which gave a sweeping victory to Lesotho's
ruling party.
	   The report cites ``serious concerns'' about apparent election
irregularities, contradicting international election observers who
had deemed the vote free and fair.
	   The tri-nation report said seals on ballot boxes had been
prematurely broken and material from different polling stations had
been mixed together. But the report merely calls for restoration of
confidence in Lesotho's electoral commission and does not declare
the election invalid.
	   Because the commission had not found widespread election fraud,
the government won't step down or call for new elections, Lesotho
Deputy Prime Minister Kalebone Maope told reporters.
	   Opposition figures had been hoping the commission would conclude
the election was fraudulent. The relatively lukewarm findings could
inflame tensions among protesters.
	   Meanwhile, several of the deposed senior army officers have fled
to South Africa, news reports said. The officers, who left the
previous evening, had been released from captivity last week.
	   Lesotho, an impoverished country whose main revenue comes from
its citizens working in South Africa's gold mines, has a history of
political upheaval.
	   In 1970, the first elections after Lesotho gained independence
from Britain were cancelled because the ruling party was afraid it
would lose.
	   The military, after staging a coup in 1986, allowed elections in
1993, but the vote was widely criticized as fraudulent with one
party winning every seat in parliament.

Palestinian killed in West Bank shooting; new settlement plans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 10 grafs with Israel radio saying students threw
stones before motorists opened fire, witness description of
vehicle, Israeli police comment. &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli motorists on Thursday shot to death a
Palestinian high school student in the West Bank, witnesses said.
And Israel announced it would expand a Jewish settlement there in
response to the recent killing of two settlers by Palestinian
militants.
	   The shooting and the settlement expansion came as U.S. Mideast
envoy Dennis Ross wound down a weeklong mission that made no
progress toward agreement on an Israeli troop withdrawal from the
West Bank.
	   Diplomatic sources said Wednesday in Washington that U.S.
President Bill Clinton was trying to arrange a summit next week
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   However, on Thursday the meeting appeared increasingly unlikely
unless Ross made significant progress before returning to
Washington at the end of the week.
	   The three leaders will be in New York for the U.N. General
Assembly meeting. An Israeli Foreign Ministry official, Yitzhak
Lior, said it was more likely that U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright would hold separate talks with Arafat and
Netanyahu.
	   The fatal shooting took place in the West Bank village of
Beitunia Thursday when a group of a dozen Palestinian high school
students was walking along the main road. One of the youths said
vehicle driven by the shooters had Israeli license plates.
	   Israel radio said the students threw stones at passing Israeli
cars, which the students denied.
	   One of the students, Raed Abdel Rahman, 17, said an Israeli car
pulled up, the passengers rolled down the windows and started
shooting from a pistol and an assault rifle.
	   ``Everybody started to jump and take cover,'' said Abdel Rahman.
	   Two of the teen-agers were hit in the stomach and taken to
nearby Ramallah Hospital, where 17-year-old Iyad Hashem later died.
The second boy was in stable condition.
	   Israeli police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said Israeli police
were investigating.

Last touches for world's biggest beer festival nearly done

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Workmen scurried around Munich's
Theresienwiese Thursday putting the final touches to rides, tents
and food stands in preparation for the annual Oktoberfest, the
world's biggest beer festival.
	   When Munich Mayor Christian Ude taps the first keg of beer at
noon on Saturday to officially open the two-week bash, all the beer
tables will be in place.
	   Gabriele Weishaeupl, the festival's chief organizer, says
between 6 and 7 million visitors are expected.
	   Last year 6.4 million showed up for Oktoberfest. The record was
7.1 million visitors in 1985. But there's also a record this year.
Organizers say a liter of beer will cost 11.30 marks (dlrs 6.70),
up from a high of 10.40 marks (dlrs 6.19) last year.
	   While this year's festival features a free-fall tower and other
breath-taking rides along with the traditional carousels, a flea
circus and bird imitator, the huge beer tents with oomp-pah-pah
music remain the main attraction.
	   The hall-like tents have some 94,000 seats run by 60 different
businesses. The largest beer tent with 10,000 seats is run by
Munich's famous Hofbraeuhaus brewery.
	   About 400 security people will be patrolling the events on the
42 hectare (103 acres) Theresienwiese, a large field kept free in
the heart of Munich for the traditional festival.
	   The festival originated on Oct. 12, 1810, with the wedding of
Crown Prince Ludwig, who later became king, to Princess Therese von
Saxony-Hildburghausen, when he invited the general public to join
the celebration.
	   This year's Oktoberfest ends on Oct. 4.

Russia ready to negotiate changes in restructuring loans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ For the third time in a month, Russia said
Thursday it was trying to work out a new deal over dlrs 40 billion
in bad loans with foreign banks in the hope of attracting more
Western money to rescue the shattered economy.
	   President Boris Yeltsin said it would take another week to form
a full Cabinet to deal with the economic crisis, despite warnings
that the Kremlin must take swift action. Finance officials clashed
again over whether the Central Bank should print more money and
risk hyperinflation.
	   The new government clearly wants to get off on the right foot
with foreign lenders, who have faced huge losses since Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov's predecessor announced on Aug. 17 that
Russia would default on its loans.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Shokhin said a decision on debt
restructuring was being delayed until Sept. 25 to try to work out a
deal that would be acceptable to foreign lenders _ and that would
help Russia win new loans from the West.
	   He told a visiting delegation from the European Union that
Russia was ready to start negotiating with creditor banks.
	   ``We need forms of direct support in the form of credit lines
established with the support of Western consortia, especially
European banks,'' Shokhin was quoted as saying by the Interfax news
agency.
	   The Russian currency continued its dive, trading at around 15 to
the dollar on the Moscow currency exchange on Thursday after
recovering to 7.5 earlier this week. The ruble stood at around 6 to
the dollar before the crisis began in mid-August.
	   Russian stocks plummeted in thin trading Thursday, forcing
trading to be suspended twice. The Russian Trading System Index
fell 10.9 percent by the end of the day, to close at 52.45 points,
from 58.86 points Wednesday.
	   Yeltsin and his new prime minister Primakov have moved
cautiously in building the Cabinet, offering posts to politicians
across the spectrum, attempting to end constant obstruction by the
opposition.
	   Yeltsin concentrated on security matters on Thursday, meeting
with his defense and police ministers. Yeltsin promised Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev that the government would pay off wage
arrears to the military by the end of the month, said presidential
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin. The government has failed to meet
similar pledges for years because of a chronic shortfall in
revenues.
	   Yeltsin also signed an order on security preparations for an
annual nationwide protest that trade unions have organized for Oct.
7.
	   Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin told reporters that the steps
were intended to prevent mass disturbances in view of the economic
crisis. He said the orders specifically ban blockades of railways
and roads and any protests in military units.
	   The economic turmoil has left many Russians angry and frustrated
with the government, but there has not been unrest. There have been
scattered strikes across the country.
	   Shokhin's announcement came a day after 25 Western banks that
are owed large sums by Russia met in London to draft a joint policy
aimed at getting the government to honor the original terms. The
government had said in August that it would force foreign banks to
accept sharp reductions in repayments.
	   Shokhin, a moderate reformer, also warned Thursday against
printing money as a means to plug the gaping holes in Russia's
budget. Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko favors printing
money _ a policy that contributed to galloping inflation during his
previous tenure in office from 1989-1994.
	   ``We must avoid talk about printing money because it may trigger
inflation,'' Shokhin told reporters.
	   However, a plan unveiled by the Central Bank on Thursday would
require the printing of money to jump-start the country's frozen
banking system, Central Bank First Deputy Chairman Andrei Kozlov
said.
	   ``Yes, we will inject money into the system,'' Kozlov said.
	   However, officials said any increase in the money supply would
be limited, as the Central Bank will limit the number of banks
taking part in the plan.

 &UR; Tensions revived between rival Bosnian Serb camps
 &UR; Eds: AMs; RECASTS and UPDATES with quotes from the nationalists,

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Claiming victory in last
weekend's election, Bosnian Serb radicals warned Thursday of a
political crisis if international overseers try to deny them power.
	   The threats were issued one day after the leader of the Serb
Radical Party, Nikola Poplasen, claimed victory over the U.S.
favorite, Biljana Plavsic, in the race for president of the
Serb-run Bosnian enclave, Republika Srpska.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
ran the Saturday-Sunday election, has refused to release any
results, citing a complicated ballot, numerous contested posts and
the need for accuracy.
	   Nevertheless, hundreds of flag-waving, cheering supporters of
Poplasen took to the streets of many Bosnian Serb towns late
Wednesday, shouting insults against Plavsic and her moderate
government.
	   ``The right people are back in power'' or ``Bon Voyage
Grandma,'' cried some of the jubilant Poplasen supporters who
jammed the hardliners stronghold of Pale, east of Sarajevo, in cars
or on foot, honking horns and dancing.
	   Plavsic's defeat would be a severe setback for U.S. and European
efforts to promote politicians supportive of the 1995 Dayton peace
accords, which foresaw a unitary Bosnian state where Bosnian Serbs,
Muslims and Croats could live in peace.
	   International officials have hoped Plavsic would strengthen her
position at the election. Poplasen is an ally of former Bosnian
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, barred from political life because he
has been indicted by the international court in The Hague for war
crimes during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict.
	   OSCE officials have denied any attempt to manipulate the
results.
	   ``The only results that will matter are the final results,''
declared Nicole Szulc, spokeswoman for OSCE in Sarajevo. Robert
Barry, head of the OSCE in Bosnia, said results probably will be
announced next Wednesday or Thursday _ at least 10 days after the
voting.
	   But the OSCE scheduled a meeting Friday in Sarajevo to consider
whether to punish the Radicals for infractions of election rules
during the campaign. Punishment could include disqualifying
Poplasen.
	   Dragan Cavic, a vice president of another extremist party,
warned the OSCE against any move to disqualify candidates, saying
it could have ``bad implications.''
	   Cavic, of the Serb Democratic Party, said his side has also
filed complaints sufficient for a punishment of the moderates.
	   ``We demand that biased approach be dropped and that political
implications of disqualification of our candidate ... be seriously
considered,'' he said.
	   During the election, Bosnians chose candidates for the
three-member joint national presidency, a national parliament and
regional and local posts. Those in the Serb-run area also voted for
their president.
	   The Bosnian Serb presidency is considered a key post because the
president wields considerable power within the Serb mini-republic.
U.S. and European officials believed a Bosnian Serb president
committed to the spirit of Dayton could play a decisive role in
overcoming the ethnic hatreds generated by the Bosnian war.
	   According to sources in Sarajevo, another Western favorite,
Kresimir Zubak, also was faring poorly. Zubak has recently split
from the Bosnian Croat hardliners and formed a new, more moderate
party.
	   Vojislav Seselj, the Radicals' leader in Serbia, said a moderate
candidate for the Serb seat on the three-member national
presidency, Zivko Radisic, had won the post. Seselj indicated the
extremists would not dispute such a result.

Unemployment rate marches upward to 5 percent

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong announced Thursday that its
unemployment rate climbed to a 15-year high of about 5 percent in
the three-month period ending Aug. 31.
	   A slowdown in retail and the restaurant and construction trades
accounted for most of the job losses, officials said. The entry of
new graduates in the labor market also aggravated the problem.
	   The 5 percent jobless rate, up from 4.8 percent for the three
months through July, was the worst since it hit 5.2 percent in
1983.
	   Analysts said the problem is unlikely to be solved as the
14-month financial turmoil in Asia shows no signs of abating. But
the figure was lower than the expected 5.2 percent.
	   ``The overall trend is that things will deteriorate even
further,'' said Anthony Chan of HSBC Securities Asia in Hong Kong.
Chan said the unemployment rate may reach 7 percent by May next
year.
	   ``As Hong Kong is still in the midst of difficult economic
adjustment ... high unemployment will inevitably remain with us for
some time,'' Joseph Wong, secretary for education and manpower,
said in a statement.
	   Although Wong later told a news conference the increase in
unemployment has been slowing down, he refused to say whether that
meant better times ahead.
	   ``Although there is stabilization in the unemployment rate, it
is too early to draw any conclusions,'' government economist Tang
Kwong-yiu said.
	   Hong Kong's once-robust economy shrank 5 percent in the second
quarter, and is expected to shrink 4 percent in 1998.
	   High interest rates _ the government's main tactic in defending
the territory's currency link to the U.S. dollar _ is stifling the
property sector, responsible for one in 10 jobs here.
	   About 175,000 of the 3.3 million work force are unemployed,
according to government figures.
	   The latest figure came as more companies announce sharp losses
and massive layoffs.
	   On Wednesday, two investment banks, Nikko Securities and Warburg
Dillon Read, said they were cutting almost 100 jobs.
	   Hong Kong Telecommunications said it will impose 10 percent
pay-cuts on all its employees beginning Nov. 1, while freight
company Hong Kong International Terminals said it will be slashing
123 workers from its staff, Television Broadcast reported late
Thursday.

UN convoy ambushed, 3 people injured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A convoy of 16 U.N. trucks in northern
Angola was ambushed by armed bandits and U.N. escorts returned
fire, the United Nations said Thursday. Three people were injured,
though not seriously.
	   The convoy, consisting of six trucks from the U.N. military
observer mission and 10 trucks belonging to the World Food Program,
came under fire Wednesday about 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of
Lukana, in the north of the south-western African nation, U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
	   Indian soldiers escorting the convoy returned fire, he said.
	   Three local employees of a contractor were injured though not
seriously, he said. Three trucks from the U.N. observer team also
were damaged.
	   The United Nations has been trying to implement a 1994 peace
accord between the government and the former rebel movement, UNITA,
in the face of renewed fighting between the two sides.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ fought a civil war against the
government for nearly two decades after Angola won independence
from Portugal in 1975.
	   The U.N.-mediated 1994 accord, called the Lusaka Protocol, ended
the fighting, but the United Nations says UNITA has resisted
honoring it, particularly by refusing to hand over four key
territories and demobilize its troops.

Spanish Prime Minister visits Peru after Basque seapratists offer
</HEADLINE>
truce &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ A day after Spain's Basque separatists
declared a unilateral cease-fire, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar maintained his public silence Thursday and instead met as
scheduled with Peru's President Alberto Fujimori.
	   Aznar has not spoken to reporters or commented on Thursday's
truce, which could end decades of separatist violence that killed
more than 800 people. The truce by the ETA separatists will take
effect Friday.
	   Government officials in Spain have greeted the ETA announcement
with skepticism. The ETA has fought for 30 years for an independent
Basque state in northern Spain.
	   Aznar went to the presidential palace in the Peruvian capital,
Lima, on Thursday. Aznar arrived in Peru on Wednesday, accompanied
by his wife, Ana Botella, and top officials and business leaders.
	   The four-day visit to Peru is aimed at strengthening ties
between the impoverished Andean nation and Spain, its biggest
foreign investor. Spain's Telefonica de Espana bought Peru's state
telephone company in 1994 for dlrs 2 billion.
	   Aznar arrived in Lima late Wednesday from the city of Iquitos in
Peru's Amazon jungle, 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) northeast of
Lima, where he visited projects financed by Spanish foreign aid.
	   Among the projects he visited were a fruit processing plant and
a multilingual school that teaches Spanish and Indian languages. He
also visited several telephone booths installed in the jungle by
the Spanish-owned telephone company.
	   The leaders are expected to sign an agreement on Spanish aid for
Peru's efforts to reduce production of the coca leaf used to make
cocaine. Peru is one of the world's top coca producers.
	   Aznar is also expected to offer Peru millions of dollars in aid
to help it recover from the effects of the El Nino weather
phenomenon, Peru's foreign ministry said.
	   On Saturday, Aznar will visit the Andean capital of Cuzco and
visit the stone ruins of Machu Picchu, Peru's top tourist
attraction, before returning to Madrid.

Darcy among five leaders in close first round

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-NOM-LA-BRETECHE, France (AP) - Five players shot 4-under
par 67s Thursday to share the first-round lead in a
closely-contested pounds 800,000 (dlrs 1.32 million) Lancome
Trophy.
	   Outshining the superstars competing for the trophy, Australian
Stephen Allan, Derrick Cooper of England, Eamonn Darcy of Ireland,
Spain's Miguel Angel Jimenez and Greg Turner of New Zealand share
the leader board on the par-71, 6,311 meter (6,903-yard) course in
Saint-Nom-La-Breteche, west of Paris.
	   In warm, sunny conditions, a further five players shot 3-under
par 68s to stay in close contention for the pounds 133,330 first
prize, to be awarded Sunday.
	   Darcy, first to tee off at 8:10 am, began badly, bogeying the
4th but roared back with birdies on the 6th, 13th and 15th.
	   His best moment came with an eagle on the 509-yard par-5 8th,
when he was short on his second shot but eventually putted from 30
yards for an eagle.
	   ``I was driving the ball really well and didn't miss any
fairways,'' the Irishman said.
	   But Darcy said that his day was tinged with sadness after the
death last week of the teenage son of his friend Christy O'Connor.
	   Turner, who missed the cut in his defense of the British Masters
last week saying his ``focus was astray,'' was back in the groove,
firing four birdies in a solid 67, including a smart 35 foot putt
to birdie the 9th.
	   American David Duval, the current world number two looking for
his first European prize, shot 69, while defending champion Mark
O'Meara was 1-under at 70, along with Fred Couples, Lee Westwood
and Nick Faldo.

Taliban claim to control former defense minister's home district
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban religious army
claimed Thursday that its troops overran the home district of
former defense chief Ahmed Shah Massood, which would be a serious
psychological blow to the northern-based opposition.
	   The opposition denied the Taliban claim. Like many of the
reports from both sides in Afghanistan's bitter conflict, it was
impossible to independently confirm the status of Sheikh Ali
district in the northern Parwan province.
	   However, the Taliban has been making massive territorial gains
in the past week.
	   Taliban soldiers have gained control of much of the Shiite
Muslim stronghold in the central Bamiyan province, a major victory
for the religious militia that now rules about 90 percent of the
country.
	   The Taliban has accused neighboring Iran of arming and financing
the Hezb-e-Wahadat party as well as several other opposition
parties, including Jamiat-e-Islami, led by former Afghan president
Burhanuddin Rabbani and his military chief, Massood.
	   Iran has denied the accusation but relations between Tehran and
the Taliban are strained.
	   Tens of thousands of Iranian soldiers have been deployed to
Afghanistan's border after Tehran promised to avenge the deaths of
nine diplomats and a journalist.
	   The Iranians were killed in August when the Taliban took control
of the opposition city of Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban is seeking U.N. mediation in its dispute with Iran.
	   Opposition soldiers contacted in Bamiyan province by satellite
telephone said that there had been only sporadic fighting in recent
days and that the Taliban still controlled Bamiyan city, including
the strategic air strip.
	   ``Many times the Taliban tried to land their jets but our
artillery stopped them,'' said Baharam, an opposition spokesman,
who gave only one name.
	   The opposition arrayed against the Taliban largely represents
the country's minority ethnic and religious groups.
	   In recent weeks most of the fighting has involved the opposition
Hezb-e-Wahadat party, which represents Shiite Muslims. The Taliban,
like the majority of Afghans, belong to the Sunni sect of Islam.
	   ``In Bamiyan city there is only occasional firing,'' said
Baharam, a member of the Hezb-e-Wahadat party.

Italy's government cold toward Murdoch's possible entry into
</HEADLINE>
nation's TV market &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Italy's undersecretary of communications
expressed alarm Thursday at Rupert Murdoch's reported interest in
the Italian TV market, saying Murdoch is the worst thing that could
happen to Italian television.
	   La Repubblica daily reported Thursday that Murdoch would buy a
40 percent stake in the TV company Stream, which is controlled by
Telecom Italia. A Stream spokeswoman denied the report.
	   Murdoch is believed to be interested in buying into Italy's
digital TV market _ specifically, acquiring the rights to transmit
Italian soccer games.
	   Italy's politicians and government officials greeted the idea
about as coldly as many soccer fans treated the Murdoch group's
moves on the Manchester United soccer team.
	   ``Among the various possibilities for the development of the TV
sector, Murdoch's entry is the most painful for Italian industry,''
Telecommunications Undersecretary Vincenzo Vita said in an
interview with the TMC TV station.
	   The government is said to look more favorably on other partners
for Stream, including RAI, the state-run television group. RAI has
been mentioned as a possible partner for 10 percent to 15 percent
of Stream.

Host Malaysia reaches semifinals amid controversy

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Canadian players were the subject
of a police report because of their behavior after a disputed field
hockey loss to Malaysia on Thursday.
	   Malaysia won 2-1 to reach the semifinals.
	   Livid over a decision against them, the Canadian players
surrounded Scottish umpire David Wallis after the game, in front of
a 20,000-strong home crowd. They were outraged by his decision that
allowed the winning goal, 5 minutes from the end.
	   In the stands were Malaysia's King Tuanku Ja'afar and Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Malaysia had taken the lead in the 28th minute when Nor Saiful
converted a penalty corner. Canada struggled until the 53rd minute
for the equalizer, which came from a penalty stroke taken by the
skipper.
	   But then came the trouble.
	   The Canadians had stopped playing after the ball apparently hit
a Malaysian player, anticipating the umpire's whistle. Malaysia's
Calvin Fernandez shot into the goal in the pause, breaking the 1-1
deadlock.
	   ``Everybody on the field except the umpire seemed to know what
was going on,'' said Canadian forward Rick Robert.
	   When Canada's skipper Peter Milkovich tried to argue with the
umpire, he was sent off the field.
	   The Canadian players jostled Wallis, who had to be escorted from
the field, and the crowd reacted by throwing bottles on to the
pitch.
	   ``I don't think the umpiring has been professional,'' said
Robert.
	   Canadian players damaged the door of their dressing room with
hockey sticks and destroyed signs, the Malaysian official news
agency, Bernama, reported.
	   But Canadian coach Shiaz Virjee denied his players had been
violent, saying the crowd pelted unprotected Canadian players with
water bottles and beer cans.
	   Tournament Director Peter Crane said he had instructed the
stadium board to assess the cost of the damage by the players and
send the bill to the Canadian Commonwealth Games Association.
	   ``There is a police report lodged against the team and the
behavior of the crowd after the match. I haven't seen the report
yet. I will write to the CCGA to seek compensation for the damage
done,'' he said.
	   ``The players do get emotional. It is an intense game,'' said
Virjee.
	   In the remaining matches, overshadowed by the fracas, Australia
coasted to a 4-0 victory over low-ranked Wales Thursday in a Group
A match, sealing their spot in the semifinals.
	   Matthew Smith scored twice for Australia, in the 4th and 46th
minutes, while James Elmer and Michael Brennan contributed in the
26th and 69th.
	   Australia meets England, the Pool B second semifinalist, on
Saturday.
	   New Zealand failed in a last-ditch attempt to qualify for the
semifinals, losing its last pool game 3-1 to India, which will now
play Malaysia in the second semifinal.
	   New Zealand scored first through substitute Darren Smith,
deflecting a push forward from the penalty corner into the goal.
	   Three minutes later, India replied as Mohammed Riaz slotted the
ball home after a feinted shot.
	   After the break, India took control. It peppered New Zealand's
goal until Nandamoori Mukesh Kumar capitalized on a quick free hit
to score from close range. Then Indian captain Dahanraj Pillay
scored a field goal in the 61st minute.
	   South Africa went on a rampage against weak Trinidad and Tobago
in their Group A match, winning 12-3.
	   The avalanche of goals did not help South Africa clinch a place
in the semifinals. It finished third behind group champions
Australia and India.
	   In the women's competition, India and Scotland drew 2-2 and
Australia beat Trinidad and Tobago 8-0 in Group A. In Group B, New
Zealand beat South Africa 4-1.
	   Australia and India topped Group A while Canada and England led
Group B.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Senior diplomats from the European Union gave a
cautious vote of confidence to the new Russian government on
Thursday, expressing hope it will continue on the path of reforms
while trying to lead Russia out of the economic crisis.
	   ``I think, give them a chance,'' said Austrian Foreign Minister
Wolfgang Schuessel, after meeting with new Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov and other top officials.
	   While conceding that the Russian government is in a ``very
difficult and acute situation at this moment,'' delegation member
Hans van der Broek said it must ``prevent a slippage back into too
many protectionist measures.''
	   Primakov's government has not yet revealed its economic program,
and members of the EU delegation said they wanted to form an
impression of the general course the Russian government would take.
	   ``The main thing now is to listen first. We have no quick
answers in our pockets,'' Schuessel said.
	   Russian liberals and media have warned that the appointment of a
Communist lawmaker and a former chief Soviet banker to the Primakov
Cabinet signaled the end of free-market reforms and a return to a
command economy. Primakov has dismissed such speculation and
pledged to continue reforms.
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said Russian officials
tried to assure him that the replacement of the Cabinet and the
difficulties of tackling the economic crisis ``do not mean a change
in course.''
	   Kinkel added he had the ``impression that a command economy
remains hidden away in the suitcases of the past.''
	   Primakov has been selected for the prime minister's job as a
compromise candidate acceptable both to the Kremlin and
Communist-led opposition in parliament. His appointment has quelled
bitter political feuding.
	   But members of the EU delegation told a joint news conference
that the Kremlin and the opposition will also need to support
Primakov's economic program if the government is to succeed in
tackling the crisis.
	   The delegation also promised their nations' support for Russian
government's struggle.
	   ``We are not friends in fair weather only,'' Kinkel said.
However, there was no word of additional financial aid for Russia.
	   Leaders of the International Monetary Fund have also said no
extra money will be coming until the government releases its
program for tackling the crisis.
	   ``Russia needs a kill-or-cure remedy, but one that it prescribes
itself,'' Kinkel has said.
	   The diplomats from Germany, Austria and Britain _ the ``troika''
of nations that are the former, current and next leaders of the
European Union _ also met with Russia's Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov, and Deputy Prime Minister in charge of financial and
economic affairs Alexander Shokhin and Yuri Maslyukov.
	   Aside from economic talks, the EU wanted to discuss the
situation in Kosovo and try to bring Russia behind a United Nations
resolution for Western intervention in the southern Serbian
province, Kinkel said.
	   ``We want to make clear that Russia has a part in the common
responsibility for the Kosovo situation,'' he said.
	   Russia has adamantly opposed the use of force to end fighting in
Kosovo, where the majority ethnic Albanian population seeks
independence. Moscow supports broad autonomy for Kosovo, but not
secession from Serbia, a longtime ally.

WHO boss says smoking could account for one-fifth of all deaths
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Smoking is an increasing global
health burden and could account for one of every five deaths within
a decade, the head of the World Health Organization said Thursday.
	   ``Unless we take decisive action, tobacco will be responsible
for 2 million deaths, 20 percent of all deaths, in 2010,'' said Gro
Harlem Brundtland, who took over in July as head of the U.N. health
agency.
	   Brundtland, former prime minister of Norway, welcomed last
month's decision by the European Union to ban almost all tobacco
advertising by 2006.
	   ``It should not be subsidized, advertised or glamorized,'' she
said at a news conference. She called the EU move ``a landmark
public health event with implications far beyond the EU border.''
	   Brundtland spoke to reporters after addressing the annual
meeting of health officials from WHO's European region.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Argentina's Guillermo Vilas beat Bjorn Borg on the
opening day Thursday of the Compaq Senior event, 20 years after
losing to the Swede at the Roland Garros final.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ U.S. stocks plunged Thursday after investors in
Asia and Europe pushed markets lower on Alan Greenspan's denial
that world finance leaders had agreed to cut interest rates.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled as much as 235.06 in
the morning, before recovering some lost ground. It was down 192.84
at 7,896.94 by early afternoon, and back below where it began the
year, at 7,908.25. Broader indicators also were sharply lower in
trading volume that was running slightly behind Wednesday's heavy
pace.
	   The Dow's drop of 2.4 percent followed a 2.4 percent fall in
Tokyo's main index to a 12-year low. In Europe, major indicators
closed down 5.5 percent in Paris, 3 percent in London and 3.9
percent in Frankfurt, Germany. In Sao Paulo, Brazil, Latin
America's largest market, the leading index was off 7.6 percent in
the afternoon, joining the selloff.
	   The global flight from stocks sent money flowing into U.S.
Treasury bonds, a traditional haven in times of uncertainty. Yields
on 30-year Treasury bonds, which move in the opposite direction of
prices, fell closer toward 5 percent, a level that has never been
reached since the government began regular sales of such bonds in
1977.

Court clears way for radical rightists' campaign demonstration
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SCHWERIN, Germany (AP) _ An administrative court on Thursday
lifted a ban on the radical rightist National Party of Germany from
holding an election campaign demonstration in Rostock, in
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania state.
	   Rostock city officials, fearing violence from the expected 5,000
radical rightists expected to show up, banned the planned Saturday
demonstration after leftist groups announced they would hold
counter-demonstrations.
	   The NPD appealed the ban and the court ruled the party's
organizers had shown cooperation by accepting a change in where
they would assemble, allowing the demonstration.
	   The party had originally said it wanted to demonstrate in
Rostock's Lichtenhagen district, the site of more than a week of
skinhead riots and arson against refugees in August 1992.
	   Police in the state said they are now bracing for their largest
ever deployment, with support called in from all other German
states to prevent possible violence.

Nature group: help India save flood-threatened tigers, rhinos
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The World Wide Fund for Nature said Friday it is
trying to help save tigers and rhinoceroses in flood-stricken
Kaziranga National Park in northeastern Assam state.
	   WWF said some 31 Asian one-horned rhinos were among the animals
that died as a result of the flooding. The park is home to 60
percent of India's 1,500 one-horned rhinos and to about 80 tigers.
	   It did not report that any tigers had drowned, but said 20
endangered wild buffalo and six elephants were among the animals
killed.
	   Not all the rhinos drowned, it said. Five were killed by
poachers at the height of the crisis, when flood waters peaked
Sept. 4-7.
	   WWF said aid it is supplying should help park guards combat
poachers of tigers and rhinos.
	   The organization said it had sent communications equipment,
night-vision binoculars and a small truck as well as money to buy
boats to add the the fleet of 30 already in use.
	   Boats, it said, are ``practically the only means of transport in
the park during the rainy season'' and ``are proving invaluable in
rescue and relief efforts.''
	   WWF said it also is providing a tranquilizer gun to sedate
marooned animals so that they can be moved to safety.
	   In addition to saving the animals, ``a major concern now is to
protect villagers form animals that have wandered into their
settlements and to return those animals to the park,'' said
Elizabeth Kemf, a WWF spokeswoman.
	   The organization said flooding is normal in the park and even
contributes to the lush vegetation, but that the high water this
year was the worst this decade.

British McDonald's foes accuse police of collaboration
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Two vegetarian activists who waged a record legal
battle against McDonald's filed a lawsuit Thursday accusing London
police of improperly colluding with the burger giant to invade
their privacy.
	   Dave Morris and Helen Steel issued writs seeking damages of up
to 100,000 pounds (dlrs 168,000) from Metropolitan Police
Commissioner Paul Condon and a detective whose identity was not
immediately made public.
	   Morris and Steel claim police wrongfully turned over information
about them when McDonald's was investigating British activists
handing out leaflets that accused the company of being an
exploitative menace to society.
	   The investigation led to a libel fight that made the record
books and left McDonald's embarrassed after it won the verdict only
to see the judge side with Morris and Steel on several crucial
points.
	   Morris and Steel, dubbed the McLibel 2, say the McDonald's head
of security, Sid Nicholson, was a former police boss who testified
that he would go to his contacts in the force if he wanted to get
information about protesters.
	   ``This collusion between the police and a multinational
corporation against members of the public exposes the political
role of the police in ensuring the wheels of big business keep
turning,'' Morris and Steel said in a statement. ``It's clear that
their claim to be impartial defenders of the public is a hollow
one.''
	   Their lawsuit, brought in the High Court, contends police
officers allegedly provided McDonald's and its private
investigators with the home addresses of Morris and Steel, as well
as other information about Morris that should have been
confidential.
	   ``We do not know the sum total of what they gave out,'' said
Irene Nembhard, an attorney handling the lawsuit for the pair.
Having a lawyer on the case will be a novel experience for Morris
and Steel, who had to defend themselves for years against
McDonald's because Britain does not permit public assistance in
libel suits.
	   Steel said McDonald's private investigators placed the McLibel
2's homes under surveillance after getting help from the police.
	   ``Obviously, it shouldn't happen to anybody,'' Steel said by
telephone.
	   No one answered the phone at the police press bureau when a
reporter called repeatedly.
	   The McLibel 2 are seeking a public declaration that the police
engaged in unlawful conduct and an injunction to stop if from
happening again.

trailing &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Claiming victory in last
weekend's election, Bosnian Serb radicals warned Thursday of a
political crisis if international overseers try to deny them power.
	   The threats were issued one day after the leader of the Serb
Radical Party, Nikola Poplasen, claimed victory over the U.S.
favorite, Biljana Plavsic, in the race for president of the
Serb-run Bosnian enclave, Republika Srpska.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
ran the Saturday-Sunday election, has refused to release any
results, citing a complicated ballot, numerous contested posts and
the need for accuracy.
	   But Hanns Schumacher, a deputy to the chief international
official in Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp, confirmed Thursday that
Plavsic was trailing, although he stressed that many absentee
ballots remain uncounted.
	   Nevertheless, Schumacher said preliminary results had shown
extremists faring better than the Americans and Europeans had
hoped.
	   Hundreds of flag-waving, cheering supporters of Poplasen took to
the streets of many Bosnian Serb towns late Wednesday, shouting
insults against Plavsic and her moderate government.

U.S. plan published, Kosovo Albanians demand changes

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A U.S.-backed plan to end Kosovo's
violence published Thursday foresees local autonomy for the ethnic
Albanian majority of the Serbian province but keeps them part of
Serbia and within Yugoslavia.
	   The draft plan of the accord was published in Koha Ditore, a
Kosovo Albanian daily, as Serbian and Yugoslav forces maintained
pressure on the few remaining pockets of territory still controlled
by Albanian guerrillas fighting for independence.
	   A Western diplomat, who asked for anonymity, confirmed the
authenticity of the draft published Thursday but said it was ``only
a starting point'' for both Serbian and Kosovo Albanian leaders.
And chief Kosovo Albanian negotiator Fehmi Agani told reporters his
side had ``serious complains about the proposal and it will have to
be changed.'' He did not elaborate.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill discussed the plan with ethnic
Albanian leaders in Pristina on Thursday.
	   The three-year accord refers to Kosovo as a ``territory'' with
its own parliament and executive powers, local police and judicial
system.
	   Kosovo would be represented in the Serbian government and the
Yugoslav parliament, but federal authorities could not influence
the work of local officials, the daily reported.
	   The publication of the document could be an attempt by Ibrahim
Rugova, the pacifist ethnic Albanian leader, to test public
sentiment about cutting a deal that falls short of independence.
	   Although outgunned guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army are
being routed by Serb police and the Yugoslav army, most Albanians
in the province still support the idea of independence from Serbia,
the dominant republic in the Yugoslav federation.
	   Kosovo's independence has been ruled out by the West, which
fears it can only be achieved by years of unrest involving other
countries in the region, and by Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, who stripped the province of autonomy in 1989.
	   Most of Thursday's fighting was located about 30 kilometers (20
miles) northwest and north of Pristina, Kosovo's capital. Three
people were killed and 17 wounded in fighting Wednesday and
Thursday, according to tallies by both sides.
	   Northern Kosovo, where fighting started Tuesday, has in past
months been largely peaceful. It is believed to be one of the two
remaining rebel strongholds. The other one is in the central
Drenica area.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources said that Serb police and the allied
Yugoslav army are using heavy tanks in the offensive and that
several villages have been destroyed. International aid officials
said that some 10,000 ethnic Albanians fled their homes because of
the latest strikes.
	   The United Nations estimates more than 600 deaths and upward of
275,000 people displaced since the clashes started late February.
	   Humanitarian organizations fear that tens of thousands of
refugees remain out in the open and at risk of dying unless
sheltered by late fall.
	   Milosevic's spokesman, Ivica Dacic, dismissed such concerns
Thursday, claiming there are no more displaced people without
shelter.
	   But the United States and its European allies are again
considering NATO action unless the fighting and displacement of
civilians ends.
	   President Clinton said in Washington on Wednesday that NATO
planning and consulting have advanced, while State Department
spokesman James Foley said resolve among member countries is
increasing.
	   Serbia remained defiant. Vojislav Seselj, its ultranationalist
vice premier, urged Serbians to ``get ready for defense,'' adding:
``There will be no mercy for the aggressor.''

Ukrainian police detain top member of prominent opposition party

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian police detained a former senior
government official and prominent opposition activist on suspicion
of involvement in embezzlement and tax evasion connected with gas
imports, officials said Thursday.
	   Also Thursday, Ukraine's Security Service said it had exposed a
group of bankers suspected of large-scale embezzlement.
	   Mykola Syvulskiy, the detained former deputy finance minister
and Central Bank deputy chief, faces a number of charges for
actions that ``have caused grave consequences,'' the chief
prosecutor's office said in a statement.
	   In particular, he is suspected of transferring more than dlrs 5
million from the accounts of state gas company Ukrgazprom to a
private gas trader, Unified Energy System.
	   Syvulskiy's detention was the latest chapter in a massive
investigation launched by state prosecutors recently against
centrist opposition leader and former Prime Minister Pavlo
Lazarenko.
	   Syvulskiy holds a senior post in the shadow Cabinet formed last
year by Lazarenko's Hromada party, one of Ukraine's most powerful
opposition groups.
	   Lazarenko's critics have accused him of abusing his authority
for personal gain when he was premier in 1996-97. The prosecutor
general's office is currently investigating the allegations.
	   Opponents accuse Lazarenko of reaping huge profits from gas
imports to Ukraine by giving the UES preferential status in the
country's gas market during his term in office.
	   The UES recently came under attack from tax authorities, which
fined it 1.4 billion hryvna (dlrs 500 million) for evading tax
payments and illegally transferring abroad dlrs 690 million
received from gas sales.
	   Tax officials told Ukrainian media that in 1997 the UES had paid
a meager 11.1 million hryvna (dlrs 5.5 million at the time) in
taxes, while its net profits amounted to 148 million hryvna (dlrs
74 million) and total turnover stood at 4.1 billion hryvna (dlrs 2
billion).
	   UES has appealed, and the case was sent Thursday to the Supreme
Arbitration Court.
	   Meanwhile, the security service said it has exposed a group of
top managers at a Kiev bank who are suspected of illegally
transferring about dlrs 3 million to a foreign bank in 1996-98. It
did not name the bank and did not say whether any arrests had been
made.

	   BEITUNIA, West Bank (AP) _ Tensions between Israel and the
Palestinians soared Thursday with the shooting death of a
Palestinian teen-ager, apparently by Israeli motorists, and an
announcement by Israel to expand a Jewish settlement.
	   Both the boy's death and the expansion across more West Bank
land, came as U.S. President Bill Clinton's peace envoy wrapped up
an unsuccessful effort at completing a deal to end months of
stalemate between the sides and get a long overdue Israeli troop
withdrawal off the ground.
	   Thursday's fatal shooting occurred in the village of Beitunia
and police said they were questioning an Israeli suspect.
	   ``A 35-year-old male from a Jewish settlement in the area turned
himself into the police ... he is being held for questioning,''
Israeli police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said.
	   The shooting took place around noon when some 12 Palestinian
high school students were walking along the village's main road on
their way back from school.
	   A Ford with Israeli license plates pulled up next to them, the
passengers rolled down their windows and started shooting from a
pistol and an assault rifle, said one of the students, Raed Abdel
Rahman. ``Everybody started to jump and take cover,'' he said.
	   Two of the teen-agers were hit in the stomach and taken to
nearby Ramallah Hospital where 17-year-old Iyad Hashem later died
of his wound. The second boy was in stable condition.
	   Abdel Rahman insisted that the teen-agers had not stoned the
Israeli car first and that the motorists opened fire without
provocation. However, in the past, Israeli drivers have repeatedly
fired shots at Palestinian stone throwers targeting their cars from
rocky hilltops along West Bank highways.
	   Palestinian officials had wanted to hold Hashem's funeral late
Thursday, in keeping with swift Muslim burial, but also perhaps to
allow time for people to calm down. However the boys' family
insisted on holding the funeral Friday, after noon prayers.
	   At the Hashem family's modest apartment, his mother sat on the
living room floor in a house robe and sobbed, slapping her legs in
disbelief. ``My beloved, you didn't come home with your school
books today,'' Mrs. Hashem wailed. Dozens of family members and
neighbors had gathered to mourn with the boy's parents.
	   Adding to the situation were fears by Israel of retaliatory
attacks from Islamic militants just as the country prepared for the
Jewish holiday season. Israeli radios said Israel would enforce a
tight closure on its internal borders, barring all Palestinians
from entering its cities.
	   U.S. mediator Dennis Ross was scheduled to leave the region
Friday and it seemed increasingly unlikely that he would be able to
arrange a three-way summit in New York next week with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
to wrap up such a deal.
	   The three leaders will be in New York for the U.N. General
Assembly. An Israeli Foreign Ministry official said it was more
likely that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would hold
separate talks with Arafat and Netanyahu. And Arafat said he would
only meet Netanyahu, if Israel accepts the terms for a U.S. peace
initiative.
	   Meanwhile, Palestinian officials condemned Israeli plans to
expand in tenfold a Jewish settlement on disputed West Bank land.
	   Netanyahu told the Yediot Ahronot daily that plans to build 600
new homes in Yitzhar, where two residents were killed last month in
a drive-by shooting by Palestinian militants, was his response ``to
terrorist perpetrators.''
	   The United States has urged Israel to halt settlement expansion
on land which the Palestinians want for a hoped-for state.
	   ``This expansion policy is the bomb that will explode all the
efforts to put the peace process back on track,'' said Ahmed Abdel
Rahman, the secretary-general of the Palestinian Cabinet.
	   The Yediot Ahronot daily said Israel would confiscate land from
four Palestinian villages for the new construction.
	   But Peter Lerner, a spokesman for Israel's military government
in the West Bank, said no private Palestinian land would be
expropriated for the construction.

Gunman in Mexico target three families in firing squad: 18 dead

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Gunmen in northern Mexico pulled 21 people
from their beds early Thursday, lined them up against a wall and
opened fire. Eighteen people were killed and three were seriously
wounded, police said.
	   Television footage showed the bloody bodies lined up on the
ground, most in their pajamas or naked.
	   Police said the attack took place before dawn in El Sauzal, a
suburb of the resort of Ensenada and only 60 miles (100 kilometers)
south of the U.S. border.
	   Ensenada Judicial Police officer Jose Ramon Espinoza said the
victims were members of three families: the Flores family and two
families that both had the last name Castro. It was unclear whether
the three families were related.
	   ``It appears they rounded them all up, lined them up and gunned
them down,'' Espinoza said.
	   He said he had no information on suspects or a possible motive.
	   Children's toys littered the yard outside one concrete house,
and at least one of the bodies seen on television was that of a
baby.
	   The yard of the neighboring homes was filled with broken glass
and chairs were overturned on the porch, indicating a struggle.
Inside, beds were unmade, the sheets and blankets pulled to the
side.
	   Dozens of bullet casings surrounded the bodies, and the Televisa
television network said most were from a Kalashnikov assault
weapon, although some were from smaller-caliber weapons and
shotguns.
	   Turkeys cackled in the yard.
	   Televisa gave the death toll at 19 and said there were two
survivors.
	   Police said the middle class town of El Sauzal wasn't known for
its ties to the drug trade, but it is less than an hour's drive
south of the border city of Tijuana, headquarters of the brutal
drug gang led by the Arellano Felix brothers.
	   The brothers, once known for the violence with which they
controlled their territory, had recently been settling into a
quieter, more businesslike style after making themselves famous for
daytime shootouts.
	   But Mexican authorities suspect the Arellano Felix brothers were
behind the killing of a rival last week in Ciudad Juarez, just
across the border from El Paso, Texas.
	   Analysts said the killing might signal a shift back to the
violence of the past.

EU humanitarian aid chief defends her office in fraud case

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - European Union Humanitarian Aid
Commissioner Emma Bonino lashed out at the media Thursday for
questioning her department's integrity in a fraud case involving
dlrs 550,000 that have gone astray.
	   ``I bitterly regret that several sources have made so-called
`revelations' and given in to speculation,'' Bonino told reporters.
	   She said such speculative reporting was damaging to the image of
the EU executive Commission and its humanitarian aid office, known
as ECHO.
	   Bonino acknowledged EU officials had investigated the
disappearance of some 500,000 European currency units (dlrs
550,000) from ECHO coffers and said one ECHO official has been
suspended.
	   Bonino insisted this was an isolated case and denied media
reports of a systematic misuse of funds.
	   The missing funds were part of four aid contracts earmarked for
ex-Yugoslavia and Rwanda in 1993-1994, totaling 2.4 million ecus
(dlrs 2.6 million).
	   The Commission turned the case over to Luxembourg authorities as
the aid was managed by a Luxembourg-based consultancy company,
Perry Lux, for, among other things, recruiting extra staff to run
and monitor humanitarian operations.
	   Bonino said between 1991 and 1995, ECHO used part of its
``operational'' funds to recruit 27, short-term staff to help ECHO
staff cope with the monitoring of aid to crisis-hit regions. Echo
was funded in 1991. It employs 108 full-time workers.
	   Media reports have said the Commission's anti-fraud services
found that Perry Lux has been unable to justify the spending of
540,000 ecu (dlrs 594,000) and that aid funds for the former
Yugoslavia and Africa was used to pay for extra staff in Brussels.
	   There have also been reports of other irregularities involving
funds for office equipment that could not be audited for lack of
proper records.

Under criticism, Ross takes off the jacket to explain policies

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ For a few hours, U.S. mediator
Dennis Ross took off his diplomat's jacket and tie to field
questions from Palestinian children in a crammed and stuffy
classroom and tell the youngsters about his own family back home.
	   Ross' tour of a secondary school and refugee camp, hastily
arranged at the end of another inconclusive shuttle mission, was
apparently aimed at improving his image among Palestinians who
believe he favors Israel and knows little about their plight.
	   U.S. officials said the tour was the Palestinians' idea while
Palestinian officials said Ross initiated it.
	   Ross, the American administration's senior envoy in the Mideast
peace talks, has come under increasing criticism from Palestinians
in the last two years for his handling of the peace negotiations. A
newspaper column published Wednesday in the official newspaper of
the Palestinian Authority used an anti-Semitic reference in calling
for his removal from the negotiations.
	   Palestinian leaders have privately questioned Ross'
effectiveness, presumably in part because he is Jewish.
	   Known for his stoic nature, Ross tried to loosen up a bit
Thursday as he visited with families, businessmen and students
inside the densely populated Gaza Strip.
	   Despite their criticisms of him, the Palestinians were receptive
_ and perhaps hopeful as well.
	   At a meeting with the families of political prisoners, children
held up photos of their fathers along with signs as they sat in
their mothers' laps. ``Freedom to my Dad,'' read one sign. ``Mr.
Ambassador, Please I want my father back home,'' entreated another.
	   And at a school, Ross was greeted by large U.S. and Palestinian
flags, marching girls and cheers. Inside, two girls asked him for
his autograph.
	   In the classroom, Ross revealed a little about his family life,
telling the high school students he thought he could understand
them because he has children their age.
	   While Ross encouraged students as they struggled to read
prepared questions in halting English, he did not abandon his
knotty diplomat's jargon.
	   ``Our initiative is an effort not just to make a statement but
to actually reach an agreement between the two sides and allow them
to create a very different basis on which to proceed,'' Ross said
while explaining the purpose of his mission.
	   In broad terms, he emphasized the need for mutual understanding,
a recurrent theme of the day.
	   ``From your perspective, you look and see all the things
Israelis do that in your eyes they shouldn't do. From the Israeli
perspective, they see the same thing,'' Ross said. ``Oftentimes
when I meet with the people from each side they're very well aware
of their own grievances and have a hard time understanding the
other side's views.''
	   Ross is scheduled to depart the region Friday after a week of
inconclusive talks with both sides on reaching agreement over a
long overdue Israeli troop withdrawal and an end to an 18-month
impasse in Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking.

Turkmen president fires defense minister, other military officials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The president of the former Soviet republic of
Turkmenistan fired his defense minister and several other top
military officials on Thursday, Russian news agencies reported.
	   The dismissals resulted from a Sept. 12 incident in which
several soldiers took hostages, the Interfax news agency said. The
incident led to deaths, Interfax said without offering details.
	   President Saparmurat Niyazov dismissed Defense Minister Danatar
Kopekov and chief of the General Staff Akmurad Mulkamanov, and
demoted a deputy defense minister and the ground forces commander,
the Interfax news agency said. He also fired two top national
security officials.
	   Niyazov named Kurbanmukhammed Kasymov, who has been served as
interior minister, as the new defense chief, and promoted Deputy
Interior Minister Poran Berdyiev to Interior Minister, Interfax
said.

	   PERAMU, Malaysia (AP) _ Fired deputy prime minister Anwar
Ibrahim took his campaign for political reform and self-vindication
into an east coast stronghold of the governing party Thursday.
	   He spoke in front of a small house after police banned him from
addressing crowds at a mosque.
	   Police have threatened to press charges against Anwar if he
holds public rallies without a police permit. Perched on a small
platform in front of a one-story bungalow, he shouted through a
microphone to a crowd of about 6,000 people _ most of whom packed
the street out of curiosity.
	   There were a few chants of ``God is great,'' and ``Reform,''
with fists punched into the air.
	   But reaction in this town near Kuantan, 150 miles (250
kilometers) northeast of Kuala Lumpur, was subdued when Anwar
criticized Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. Mahathir, who has ruled
Malaysia for 17 years, fired his deputy and finance minister on
Sept. 2.
	   ``Mahathir schemed to destroy me politically,'' Anwar yelled.
``But now he's in a dilemma. He has accused me, but he can't bring
any charges against me.''
	   Although Anwar has not been formally charged with any crime, he
has been accused in police affidavits of leaking state secrets,
conducting illicit sexual affairs and tampering with police
investigations. Police have arrested five of his associates as part
of their investigation of Anwar, and they predicted more arrests in
the next few days.
	   Anwar has said he doubts he'll be arrested until after the
Commonwealth Games end Sept. 21 and Britain's Queen Elizabeth II
leaves from a visit on Sept. 23.
	   Mahathir said Anwar was morally unfit for office when he fired
his former heir apparent and engineered his ouster. The prime
minister does not usually tolerate the kind of defiance Anwar has
been displaying.
	   Anwar's bold attacks on Mahathir drew a mixed reception in
Peramu.
	   ``My children grew up under Mahathir,'' said one man, Ramli
Ibrahim. ``He's a nation-builder. I'll support him to the end.''
	   Razali Rahman, a civil servant, had a different view. ``With
people power, the government can collapse. We are counting on
Anwar. The people are restless. Mahathir is killing off justice.''
	   In an effort to stifle any mass support for Anwar, leaders of
the dominant United Malays National Organization said this week
they would begin investigating all party members who back him.
University students have been told not to attend his rallies or
face loss of their scholarships.

admitting Plavsic trailing. CHANGES byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By IRENA GAJIC &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Claiming victory in the
weekend election, Bosnian Serb radicals warned Thursday of a
political crisis if international overseers try to deny them power.
	   The threats were issued one day after the leader of the Serb
Radical Party, Nikola Poplasen, claimed victory over the U.S.
favorite, Biljana Plavsic, in the race for president of the
Serb-run Bosnian enclave, Republika Srpska.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
ran the Saturday-Sunday election, has refused to release any
results, citing a complicated ballot, numerous contested posts and
the need for accuracy.
	   But Hanns Schumacher, a deputy to the chief international
official in Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp, confirmed Thursday that
Plavsic was trailing, although he stressed that many absentee
ballots remain uncounted.
	   Nevertheless, Schumacher said preliminary results had shown
extremists faring better than the Americans and Europeans had
hoped.
	   Hundreds of flag-waving, cheering supporters of Poplasen took to
the streets of many Bosnian Serb towns late Wednesday, shouting
insults against Plavsic and her moderate government.
	   ``The right people are back in power!'' and ``Bon Voyage
Grandma,'' cried some of the jubilant Poplasen supporters who
jammed the hard-liners' stronghold of Pale, east of Sarajevo, in
cars or on foot, honking horns and dancing.
	   Plavsic's defeat would be a severe setback for U.S. and European
efforts to promote politicians supportive of the 1995 Dayton peace
accords, which foresaw a single Bosnian state where Bosnian Serbs,
Muslims and Croats could live in peace.
	   International officials have hoped Plavsic would strengthen her
position at the election. Poplasen is an ally of former Bosnian
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, barred from political life because he
has been indicted by the international court in The Hague for war
crimes during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict.
	   OSCE officials have denied any attempt to manipulate the
results.
	   ``The only results that will matter are the final results,''
declared Nicole Szulc, spokeswoman for OSCE in Sarajevo. Robert
Barry, head of the OSCE in Bosnia, said results probably will be
announced next Wednesday or Thursday _ at least 10 days after the
voting.
	   But the OSCE scheduled a meeting Friday in Sarajevo to consider
whether to punish the Radicals for violating campaign rules.
Punishment could include disqualifying Poplasen.
	   Dragan Cavic, a vice president of another extremist party,
warned the OSCE against any move to disqualify candidates, saying
it could have ``bad implications.''
	   Cavic, of the Serb Democratic Party, said his side has also
filed complaints sufficient for a punishment of the moderates.
	   ``We demand that biased approach be dropped and that political
implications of disqualification of our candidate ... be seriously
considered,'' he said.
	   During the election, Bosnians chose candidates for the
three-member joint national presidency, a national parliament and
regional and local posts. Those in the Serb-run area also voted for
their president.
	   The Bosnian Serb presidency is considered a key post because the
president wields considerable power within the Serb mini-republic.
U.S. and European officials believed a Bosnian Serb president
committed to the spirit of Dayton could play a decisive role in
overcoming the ethnic hatred generated by the Bosnian war.
	   According to sources in Sarajevo, another Western favorite,
Kresimir Zubak, also was faring poorly. Zubak has recently split
from the Bosnian Croat hardliners and formed a new, more moderate
party.
	   Vojislav Seselj, the Radicals' leader in Serbia, said a moderate
candidate for the Serb seat on the three-member national
presidency, Zivko Radisic, had won the post. Seselj indicated the
extremists would not dispute such a result.

At his trial, Ex-NATO chief Claes denies bribery charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Ex-NATO chief Willy Claes, testifying
at his own corruption trial, distanced himself Thursday from
charges of financial wrongdoing in awarding two defense contracts
in the late 1980s when he was Belgian economics minister.
	   Claes, 59, said he was only indirectly involved in talks to get
Italian helicopter maker Agusta SpA to place future business orders
with Belgian companies in exchange for winning a contract to build
48 helicopters for the Belgian Army.
	   Claes told the supreme court that he only became involved ``in
the final phase'' of these compensation negotiations.
	   He and 11 others, including ex-defense minister Guy Coeme and
ex-deputy premier Guy Spitaels, are on trial for corruption.
	   The government gave Agusta the contract, arguing it offered
better economic compensation than France's Aerospatiale SA.
Prosecutors dispute that, saying Agusta bribed Claes' Socialist
Party. Claes denies the charge.
	   The corruption trial opened Sept. 2 but did not get going until
Thursday after the court heard and rejected procedural questions
Claes and his co-defendants raised to stop the proceedings.
	   Prosecutors allege Agusta paid Claes' Dutch-speaking socialist
party 51 million francs (dlrs 1.37 million) in 1988 to win a
December 1988 contract for the helicopters.
	   They also charge that France's Dassault Aviation SA paid 60
million francs (dlrs 1.62 million) to win a June 1989 deal to equip
Belgian F-16 jets with new electronics. The French-speaking
socialist party of Coeme and Spitaels allegedly accepted a bribe of
30 million francs from Dassault.
	   The Agusta and Dassault contracts were worth hundreds of
millions of dollars each.
	   Agusta and Dassault allegedly funneled money _ what Belgians
call ``gifts'' _ to Belgium's Dutch and French-speaking socialist
parties from bank accounts in Switzerland and Luxembourg.
	   Until 1989, corporate donations to Belgian parties were legal.
Thus, prosecutors must do more than simply prove that money was
paid; they must prove corruption by showing the Agusta and Dassault
``gifts'' were timed so closely to the awarding of contracts that
they had to be bribes.
	   The allegations against Claes, 59, cost him his prized NATO job.
He became secretary general Sept. 29, 1994 but quit Oct. 19, 1995,
amid charges of financial wrongdoing from his days as Belgian
economics minister.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with statement from Spanish premier &QL; 
 &UR; By KERNAN TURNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
said Thursday there was no reason to believe that ETA's cease-fire
declaration would end the armed group's 30-year violent campaign
for an independent Basque homeland.
	   ``After 30 years of terrorist activity we cannot give ETA the
benefit of the doubt,'' he said in Lima, Peru, on the second day of
a two-day official visit.
	   ``There have been truces before....If ETA truly wants to end its
trajectory of death and win credibility, it must win it with
actions and not with declarations. ETA and only ETA holds the
burden of proof,'' Aznar said in a statement televised live on
national Spanish television.
	   The prime minister said that he would be holding consultations
with all ``democratic forces'' regarding the cease-fire
declaration.
	   Earlier Thursday Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja said he
recognized most people welcomed the news with ``happiness and
relief,'' because ``while there is a truce, there will be no
tragedy, no deaths.''
	   But the minister, who controls the country's security forces,
recalled that previous ETA cease-fires ended in a resumption of
violence. ``ETA's very record proves that skepticism is
necessary,'' he said.
	   ETA gunmen and bombs have killed nearly 800 people since the
group began fighting in the late 1960s for an independent homeland
in the Basque region straddling the border between Spain and
France.
	   Mayor gave the first official government reaction to the ETA's
announcement late Wednesday of its first open-ended ceasefire,
which it said would begin at midnight Thursday.
	   ETA's announcement drew praise from as far away as Northern
Ireland, where a peace accord was reached in April in a bid to end
decades of sectarian violence between Catholics and Protestants.
	   ``I would urge all of those involved, and particularly the
Spanish government, to learn the lessons of our experience. Don't
prevaricate, don't create obstacles, don't delay. The emphasis now
should be on building confidence and trust and getting negotiations
under way speedily,'' said Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the Irish Republican Army.
	   In the Basque region, Xabier Arzallus, president of the
governing Basque Nationalist Party, warmly welcomed ETA's move as
``the first step on a long road filled with obstacles...''
	   The truce, he said, ``is major news that, although a long time
coming, still makes us feel great happiness.''
	   Basque nationalists had been pressuring the ETA to declare a
cease-fire ahead of Oct. 25 Basque region elections. While most
nationalists support the ETA's goal, they reject the use of
violence.
	   On Saturday, nationalists and other groups held an ``Ireland
Forum'' in the Basque town of Lizarra. The gathering culminated in
an appeal for an end to the violence, a statement signed by 23
political parties, labor unions and grassroots groups, including
the ETA-allied Herri Batasuna coalition.
	   The so-called Lizarra Declaration was boycotted, however, by the
ruling Popular Party and its main opposition, the Socialists, which
see it as a campaign tactic to build support for Basque
nationalists. The Popular Party and the Socialists are opposed to
negotiating with what they call ETA ``terrorists'' until they
renounce violence forever.
	   ETA's four-page truce announcement was released by the radical
Basque newspaper Euskadi Informacion, a small-circulation
publication that grew out of the daily Egin, shut down by the
government in July over its alleged links to ETA.
	   The armed group set no conditions on the cease-fire but said it
would not surrender its arms and warned it would end the truce in
the event of a ``confrontation'' with the government.
	   ETA has called cease-fires before, but of limited duration. This
is the first time it has announced an open-ended cease-fire.
	   ETA are the Basque-language initials for Basque Homeland and
Freedom. Mainstream Basque nationalist parties share its desire for
an independent nation but say they oppose violence as the way to
achieve the goal.
	   The last ETA attack came on June 25 when it killed a town
councilor of the ruling Popular Party in the Basque town of
Renteria. He was the sixth person killed by ETA this year.

Swedish party leader criticized over home-cleaning payments
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Just four days before Swedish elections
in which the Left Party appears poised to make big gains, a
newspaper reported Thursday that party leader Gudrun Schyman made
untaxed payments to a girl who cleaned her apartment.
	   The report was potentially embarrassing to Schyman, who strongly
supports Sweden's high-tax welfare state.
	   Schyman acknowledged that she had paid 2,500 kronor, about dlrs
300, to a friend of her daughter for cleaning work and that she had
not reported the payments to tax authorities.
	   But she denied that the payments constituted what Swedes call
``black work.''
	   ``This is not black work, black work is when someone takes a
lower payment in order to avoid declaring it'' for taxes, Schyman
said on Swedish Radio, hours after the report appeared in the
newspaper Dagens Nyheter.
	   At a news conference later, she said she paid the girl just as a
way of helping her get pocket money for going to the movies or
other recreation.
	   ``A lot of parents will recognize this situation as quite
normal,'' she said.
	   Although the payments to the girl were far less than the dlrs
1,100 limit for untaxed work, the law requires that any payments
over dlrs 125 be reported to tax authorities.
	   Sven Carlstedt, an official at the Swedish Tax Administration,
was quoted by the news agency TT as saying ``this is nothing that
the tax authorities are considering poking around in.''
	   The Left Party has been performing strongly in opinion polls
ahead of Sunday's national elections, attracting the support of
12-13 percent of poll respondents, about double its current
representation in the parliament.
	   With support for the governing Social Democrats languishing
under 40 percent, the Left is seen as a potential key to forming a
government.
	   Carl Bildt, leader of the conservative Moderates who favor
slashing taxes, did not criticize Schyman for failing to report the
payments, but used the incident do get in a dig.
	   ``It's the tax legislation that's wrong. Our proposals would
make it possible for Gudrun Schyman to be legal,'' he said.

Global land mine treaty to go into effect
</HEADLINE>

Canada, Austria, Norway and South Africa. Comments from other
officials, organizations &QL;

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ World leaders and international
organizations on Thursday praised the quick ratification of a
treaty aimed at eliminating anti-personnel land mines which now
goes into effect in six months.
	   At a press conference, ambassadors from Canada, Austria, Norway,
South Africa and Burkina Faso _ countries that either drafted the
treaty or hosted negotiations on it _ congratulated one another for
their work.
	   The treaty will take effect March 1, 1999. The United Nations
made the announcement Wednesday after the West African nation of
Burkina Faso became the 40th country to ratify the pact. The treaty
required ratification by 40 nations and their legislatures to go
into effect in those countries.
	   ``It is important ... that the 40th ratification comes from
Africa, which is now in so much suffering as a result of
anti-personnel mine infestation,'' Canadian Ambassador Robert
Fowler said.
	   Nations that ratify the treaty pledge to destroy all stockpiles
of mines within four years and clear all mines from their territory
within 10 years.
	   ``It is common knowledge that Africa is the continent afflicted
most by the scourge of anti-personnel land mines. Practically more
then one-third of all land mines can be found on the continent,''
said Pieter Vermeulen, a deputy ambassador from South Africa.
	   In London, British Foreign Office Minister Tony Lloyd said the
success in ratifying the treaty ``reflects the international
community's determination to rid the world of anti-personnel mines,
and sends a clear signal to those who have not signed.
	   ```Our task now is to persuade those countries to sign without
further delay, and to remove the millions of mines already laid
across the world.''
	   The United States has refused to sign or ratify the treaty,
maintaining such weapons are needed on the Korean peninsula to
deter North Korea from invading South Korea. Russia and China are
also holding out, contending they need land mines for defensive
purposes.
	   Tens of millions of land mines are scattered in more than 60
countries, and they kill or injure an estimated 20,000 people each
year, mostly innocent civilians. The mines have also rendered huge
swaths of productive land unusable.
	   Last December, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, and
its American coordinator, Jody Williams, won the Nobel Peace Prize
for its six years of worldwide campaigning that resulted in 122
countries signing the treaty in Ottawa last year.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton wants the United States to approve
the treaty by 2006, but only if the armed forces are able to come
up with an alternative weapon by then. The Pentagon has requested
dlrs 4.7 million in the fiscal 1999 budget for the program.
	   One possibility is a weapon that would temporarily disable an
approaching enemy, but not kill. Another involves sensors that warn
of a foe's approach and then trigger weapons.
	   In a statement, the ICBL expressed ``grave concern about reports
of the continued laying of mines in a number of countries that have
signed but not ratified the treaty, such as Angola, Cambodia,
Senegal and Sudan.
	   The ICBL also condemned the use of mines in non-signatory states
such as Yugoslavia, where Serb forces have reportedly planted mines
along the border of the Yugoslav province of Kosovo and Albania to
discourage arms smuggling.
	   In Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross issued a
statement saying ``real success will be measured in terms of fewer
victims, the replanting of fertile farmland and the resumption of
normal life in communities plagued by landmines.''

	   ROME (AP) _ A strike that has silenced Italy's TV and film
dubbers for two months appeared to be nearing an end Thursday _
although dubbers spoke up only to say that it wasn't over yet.
	   TV news reports indicated dubbers were waiting merely to ratify
an accord before going back to work. Italy's ANSA news agency had
reported Wednesday that the dubbers had halted their strike and
agreed to return to negotiations; dubbers denied that Thursday.
	   The dubbers are demanding a collective contract, more money and
royalties. Their strike has delayed the Italian release of
much-awaited Hollywood films like ``Saving Private Ryan'' and
forced TV to use subtitles or voice-overs _ something Italians
generally aren't accustomed to and don't like.
	   Elisabetta Bucciarelli, a spokeswoman for dubbing companies,
said they were ``very close'' to an agreement with the dubbers and
expected they would return to work Monday.
	   Union leader Sergio Cofferati said the dubbers finally were
getting the contract - and the recognition _ that they deserve.
	   ``The accord signals a positive change for an area of
entertainment work too often ignored by the mass media,'' Cofferati
said.

Gunman in Mexico target three families in firing squad: 18 dead

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Red Cross giving details of victims,
newspaper report of 20 dead. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Gunmen in northern Mexico pulled 21 people
from their beds early Thursday, lined them up against a wall and
opened fire. Eighteen people were killed and three were seriously
wounded, police said.
	   Television footage showed the bloody bodies lined up on the
ground, most in their pajamas or naked.
	   Police said the attack took place before dawn in El Sauzal, a
suburb of the resort of Ensenada and only 60 miles (100 kilometers)
south of the U.S. border.
	   The director of the Red Cross in Ensenada, Eugenio Carrillo,
said the victims lived in three neighboring houses. He said the
dead included nine adults, two teen-agers, six children and a baby.
	   One of the wounded, Fermin Castro, was in very serious condition
with a bullet wound to the head, Carrillo said.
	   Television images showed children's toys littering the yard
outside one concrete house. The yard was filled with broken glass
and chairs were overturned on the porch, indicating a struggle.
Inside, beds were unmade, the sheets and blankets pulled to the
side.
	   Turkeys cackled in the yard.
	   Dozens of bullet casings surrounded the bodies, and the Televisa
television network said most were from a Kalashnikov assault
weapon, although some were from smaller-caliber weapons and
shotguns.
	   Ensenada Judicial Police officer Jose Ramon Espinoza said the
victims were members of three families: the Flores family and two
families that both had the last name Castro. It was unclear whether
the three families were related.
	   ``It appears they rounded them all up, lined them up and gunned
them down,'' Espinoza said.
	   He said he had no information on suspects or a possible motive.
	   Televisa gave the death toll at 19 and said there were two
survivors. The Mexico City newspaper El Mediodia said there were 20
dead and two injured.
	   Police said El Sauzal wasn't known for its ties to the drug
trade, but it is less than an hour's drive south of the border city
of Tijuana, headquarters of the brutal drug gang led by the
Arellano Felix brothers.
	   The brothers, once known for the violence with which they
controlled their territory, had recently been settling into a
quieter, more businesslike style after making themselves famous for
daytime shootouts.
	   But Mexican authorities suspect the Arellano Felix brothers were
behind the killing of a rival last week in Ciudad Juarez, just
across the border from El Paso, Texas.
	   Analysts said the killing might signal a shift back to the
violence of the past.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Former President Sali Berisha called
Thursday for a nationwide protest against the government, which
moved a step closer to allowing his arrest for fomenting riots that
sought to topple it.
	   A parliament commission recommended Berisha be stripped of
parliamentary immunity. The legal step, if approved by the full
Parliament, would open Berisha to arrest and could further inflame
the already smoldering Albanian conflict.
	   Berisha earlier urged supporters to demonstrate throughout the
country Friday against Prime Minister Fatos Nano's elected
government, which he called a Communist-style dictatorship that
killed its enemies.
	   Such a reference has resonance in Albania, once among the
world's most hard-line Stalinist countries. But Western officials
and many Albanians consider Berisha himself a power-hungry leader
only interested in personal gain.
	   President Rexhep Meidani, a ceremonial figurehead in Albania's
system, met with international officials Thursday and issued a
public appeal for calm. Western powers fear Friday's protest could
spark similar unrest to the two days of rioting this week that
returned Albania to the brink of implosion for the second time in
18 months.
	   ``We feel it will be very good for people to stay at home, so
that they are not being misused for political ends,'' said Daan
Everts, the ambassador of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
	   For the second straight day, about 2,000 Democratic Party
supporters held a brief, peaceful protest in Tirana's central
square to denounce the Nano government. Others were prevented from
joining it by roadblocks at key intersections, where armed special
police members wearing black balaclavas searched vehicles and
people for weapons.
	   Police told the state news agency that 50 people were detained
Wednesday for possessing weapons or other reasons. Meanwhile, new
unrest was reported in northern Albania, where Berisha has strong
support.
	   A gang of about 80 people armed with grenades and automatic
rifles attacked a bank and police station late Wednesday night in
Lezha, 55 kilometers (35 miles) north of Tirana, said Artan Bizhga,
the Interior Ministry spokesman. Three of the attackers died in
gunbattles with police and several were wounded, Bizhga said.
	   The identities of the attackers was unknown, but Bizhga said
some were believed to have come from other towns in the area. An
explosion in Lezha two weeks ago damaged the office of Nano's
Socialist Party.
	   Western diplomatic sources said behind-the-scenes negotiations
involving Evert, special European Union envoy Herbert Grubmayr and
others sought a ``cooling off'' period to reduce the threat of
further violence.
	   They said Berisha's possible arrest would likely come only next
week to avoid an immediate, emotional backlash from his supporters.
As one Western diplomat put it: ``We're trying to buy time.''
	   While the parliament commission lifted the immunity from arrest
Berisha enjoys as a member of the legislature, it decided against
removing the immunity of five of his Democratic Party allies,
pending further evidence.
	   The crisis began with the slaying Saturday of popular politician
Azem Hajdari, a close aide to Berisha, who immediately blamed Nano.
	   Rioting Sunday and Monday by Berisha's supporters damaged the
parliament and prime minister's office. They briefly took over the
state television station, burned cars and looted some shops. Three
people died and scores were injured.
	   Much of Berisha's support comes from former government
functionaries and workers during his five years in power who lost
their jobs when Nano took over last year. In seeking a return to
power, Berisha has exploited outrage over Hajdari's killing and
widespread disappointment with the government's inability to revive
the economy and restore confidence in the nation's future.
	   Urging people to protest Friday throughout Albania, Berisha
called Nano ``the most dangerous leader, staying in power only by
arresting, by murdering, by executing ... the opposition.''
	   Despite Berisha's rhetoric, he faces an elected government
backed by Western powers desperate to prevent the Albanian unrest
from influencing other crises in the region, especially in
neighboring Kosovo province in Yugoslavia. Berisha has publicly
supported Albanian rebels fighting for Kosovo's independence.

Italy's Bugno wins 12th stage

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from Bugno &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANFRANC, Spain (AP) _ Italy's Gianni Bugno of the Mapei team
won the 12th leg of the Tour of Spain cycling marathon Thursday.
	   ``This might be my last great victory'' the 34-year-old two-time
world champion told the Spanish news agency EFE. ``I was thinking
of hanging up my bicycle at the end of this year,'' he added.
	   Bugno needed 4 hours, 26 minutes and 4 seconds to peddle the
187-kilometer (116-mile) run in northern Spain that ended in a
steep climb up the Canfranc mountain pass.
	   Together with 11 other cyclists, veteran racer Bugno broke away
from the main pack just over 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the
start. The group reduced to four riders later, until Bugno took off
on his own for the last few kilometers (miles).
	   ``Everything went well although the last few kilometers seem
never-ending because of the exhaustion and the head-on wind,''
Bugno said.
	   Santiago Blanco of the Vitalicio Seguros team came in 1 minute
48 seconds later at No. 2.
	   But the stage did little to alter the overall standings with
Spaniard Abraham Olano still leading the 22-stage race on the
strength of his time-trial win in the 9th leg.
	   Friday's 13th-leg covers 208 kilometers and includes four
mountain climbs.

	   SLANISTE, Macedonia (AP) - Staff Sgt. Billy Tingle's 10-man
squad of American soldiers mans a tiny outpost here on the
Macedonia-Yugoslavia border, proud their presence is maintaining
stability in a volatile region.
	   With violence ripping the southern Serbian province of Kosovo,
Albania in a state of constant turmoil and Bosnia still unsettled,
this brand new Balkan country, independent from Yugoslavia for only
six years, has real reason to fear the effects of somebody else's
problems.
	   If Macedonia has avoided getting sucked into the struggles of
the region's various ethnic groups, it is largely thanks to the
U.N. Preventive Deployment Force of 750 troops, including 350
Americans and 400 soldiers from Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark
and Indonesia.
	   ``Sometimes you see guys in the trees trying to sneak around the
checkpoint,'' said Lt. Col. Bryan Norman, commander of the American
battalion here.
	   ``Occasionally we hear gunfire. There's a fair amount of
activity,'' said Norman, 41, from Fort Bragg, North Carolina.
	   Macedonia, heavily trodden by the boots of history and bitterly
contested by various empires, is sometimes referred to as the
crossroads between east and west and has only limited experience
with independence. It is squeezed by Albania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria
and Greece.
	   Petar Atanasov, spokesman for the Macedonian Ministry of
Defense, acknowledges his country has remained an island of peace
in a sea of Balkan suffering but says Macedonia fears a ``big wave
of refugees that can show up on our border and the Kosovo situation
that can spillover into our country.''
	   So far, neither has happened. Refugees fleeing the fighting in
Kosovo, where Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is trying to
put down ethnic Albanians who want independence, have not been seen
in great numbers here.
	   Smuggling of weapons and other supplies is hard to measure, and
the U.N. force has no authority to stop it.
	   The situation in Macedonia is complex. About a quarter of the
country's population of two million are ethnic Albanians. Fears
that Albanians from Kosovo or Albania could stir up passions here
have not materialized. For the moment, ethnic Albanians appear to
have opted to press their demands through the political process and
the two main Albanian parties have joined forces for the Oct. 18
parliamentary elections.
	   To maintain stability, the U.N. conducts about 400 patrols along
the border each week.
	   Tingle, 26, from Newton, Mississippi, says his men meet
Macedonian army patrols on this side of the border and closely
observe the Serbs patrolling their side.
	   Sgt. Edward Swiger, 26, of Doylestown, Ohio, brought his
four-man patrol back to the observation post compound from a run
through the nearby community of Lojane.
	   ``Everything we do out here has a purpose _ to observe, monitor
and report,'' Swiger said. ``It gives the town a sense of
stability, knowing that we are here.''

English weekly complains of censorship by Egyptian government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Government censors have struck out two
articles in Egypt's largest-circulation weekly in English, the
newspaper said Thursday.
	   The Middle East Times had to remove from its Sept. 19-25 issue
an article on U.S. Coptic Christians and another on social violence
in Egypt, said its managing editor, Rod Craig.
	   The article on Copts details how American members of Egypt's
church are campaigning against the Cairo government's
discrimination against Christians and their support for the U.S.
Senate bill on freedom from religious persecution.
	   While the article states that not one of Egypt's 28 provincial
governors and 15 university presidents is Christian, it also quotes
an American Copt as dismissing the activists as lacking grass roots
support.
	   ``In my view (the article's) quite anodyne and no threat to
anyone,'' Craig said.
	   When the newspaper asked the censors why they had excised the
article, they replied ``we've been through all this and we don't
talk about it anymore,'' according to a statement issued by the
Middle East Times.
	   The censors said the article on social violence was
``unacceptable,'' the statement said. The article was based on a
report by the Egyptian Organization of Human Rights.
	   Craig said the weekly had been submitting its articles to the
censors for about two years in order to avoid having whole issues
banned.
	   ``It's a very necessary compromise. Before we were losing whole
editions,'' he said.
	   The Middle East Times has a circulation of about 5,000, mostly
in Egypt. It sells some copies in Cyprus, Lebanon, Israel, Europe
and North America.
	   Craig said the newspaper, which was founded in 1983, had got
used to censorship.
	   ``It's rather sad. We weren't trying to influence the state. We
were doing our job: acting as any normal newspaper would -
reporting what is going on.''
	   In the past 12 months, the government has closed one newspaper
and temporarily forced several publications, such as the Middle
East Times and the Cairo Times, to be printed outside of Egypt. In
addition, four journalists have served short prison terms for
libel.

Jewish leader makes Berlin Holocaust memorial election issue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Ignatz Bubis, the head of Germany's Central
Council of Jews, on Thursday said that a planned Holocaust Memorial
in Berlin would only be realized if Chancellor Helmut Kohl is
re-elected on Sept. 27.
	   Bubis, a member of the Free Democrats, the junior coalition
partner in Kohl's conservative-centrist government, told the Berlin
daily Der Tagesspiegel, if there is a change of government the
chances of the memorial being built are slim.
	   ``Either Kohl remains the chancellor, or the memorial won't be
built,'' the newspaper quoted Bubis as saying.
	   Michael Naumann, the designated culture minister if Kohl's main
challenger Gerhard Schroeder wins the election, renewed his
criticism of the planned memorial.
	   Speaking at a meeting of the Cultural Political Society in
Wiesbaden, Naumann said the design of the memorial by U.S.
architect Peter Eisenman, favored by Kohl, which contains a
labyrinth of 2,700 pillars resembling a cemetery, generated
astonishment but not sorrow.
	   Naumann also said that noted Jewish authors in Israel and the
United States Paul Auster, Harold Brodkey and Amos Oz were united
on the controversial issue. ``All are against this memorial.''
	   Kohl, the strongest promoter of the decade-old project, backed
off his pledge last month to push ahead with the memorial before
national elections on Sept. 27, saying he wanted to avoid turning
such a ``sensitive subject'' into a campaign issue.
	   But Bubis latest remarks appear aimed at doing just that.
	   Schroeder, who is leading in the polls against Kohl, has
welcomed the delay saying he is not against a memorial in
principle, but wasn't sure whether the chosen site and the scale of
the project was appropriate.
	   Although the Eisenman design has been significantly scaled down
from an original proposal of 4,000 pillars, Berlin Mayor Eberhard
Diepgen and other critics complain it is still too ``monumental''
and wrong for the site, just south of the historic Brandenburg
Gate.

High-ranking officer could be sacked for novel on police work
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MAE GHALWASH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Police drag an old man from his home, then
kick and slap him until he wets his pants. They strip him naked and
mock his aged, sagging body. When they threaten to bring in his
daughter, the old man faints.
	   Trembling, he insists he doesn't know the hiding place of his
son, a suspected Muslim militant, and an enraged officer orders the
man's home razed by a bulldozer.
	   The incident echoes human rights reports about Egyptian police
abuses. But this one comes from a novel _ ``The Journal of an
Officer in the Countryside'' _ that has landed its author, a
high-ranking police officer, in a lot of trouble.
	   Brig. Hamdy el-Batran is charged in a police administrative
court with publishing the book without permission and defaming
Egypt's security forces.
	   El-Batran, a 25-year police veteran, faces punishment ranging
from demotion to forced retirement. A verdict is expected Sunday.
	   The novel comes at a time when Egyptian authorities have largely
contained the Muslim militants who have tried to overthrow the
country's secular government since 1992.
	   Human rights groups have repeatedly denounced alleged police
abuses, including kidnapping suspected militants' relatives, in
their fight to end the conflict, which has taken more than 1,250
lives.
	   The police ``consider the novel a revelation of secrets,'' said
el-Batran's lawyer, Elewa Allam. ``But this is not how he meant it.
He was exercising his love of writing. He was not trying to hurt
anyone.''
	   Allam says el-Batran, an engineer by training, already has been
demoted from supervisor of police vehicles in the southern province
of Minya to chief of maintenance. His novel, while not officially
banned, was quietly removed from book stores on orders from the
Interior Ministry.
	   Brig. Mahmoud el-Fishawy, a spokesman for the ministry, which is
responsible for national security, said the book, though fiction,
should have been submitted in advance for approval.
	   ``There are rules, and a police officer should follow them,''
el-Fishawy said, adding that its publication in the midst of the
government's campaign against the militants ``hurts morale.''
	   El-Batran said he was surprised at the furor.
	   ``This book is not my history,'' he said. ``It is a work of
imagination, of creativity. Is one supposed to ask permission
before he gets up to recite poetry?''
	   He pointed out that he published three earlier novels and that
one, ``The Death of a Silent City,'' even won an award from the
ministry.
	   He submitted his only work of nonfiction _ a study of Muslim
militants in southern Egypt _ to the ministry for approval and did
not publish it when permission was denied.
	   ``The Journal of an Officer in the Countryside'' is written as
the diary of a local police commissioner in the southern province
of Assiut, once a hotbed of Muslim militant activity.
	   It is filled with tales of bribery, brutality and immorality _
as well as vivid descriptions of police work.
	   El-Batran does not say what inspired his work, noting that as a
police engineer, he does not even deal with civilians, who are at
the heart of his novel.
	   So why the fuss?
	   The stories _ fiction or not _ seem more credible because they
were written by a police officer. Indeed, the popular weekly
magazine Rose el-Youssef called el-Batran's book ``live testimony''
to police methods.
	   Hafez Abu Siida, a researcher into police abuse at the Egyptian
Organization of Human Rights, says charging el-Batran was a way for
police to deny the abuses his fiction depicts _ and to discourage
other literary-minded officers.
	   ``If this were an official human rights report, the Interior
Ministry could deny it,'' he said. ``But when a police officer says
it, it puts them in a difficult position.''

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Here are excerpts from editorials in publications in various
countries:
	    &UR; ___
	   Aftonbladet, Stockholm, Sweden, on U.N. report on human
development:
	   Sweden is the world's most equal-opportunity country and has the
smallest proportion of poor people of any country. The result is
found in a comprehensive UN report. It tells otherwise of a world
characterized by enormous economic class differences and growing
ecological devastation.
	   The report from the UN's development agency UNDP should be read
both from a national and global perspective. Sweden ... stands
closest to being a model country in any point of view. Certainly,
its average income does not lie in the absolutely top class, but
well-being is especially well apportioned.
	   The number of poor people is reckoned at 6.8 percent. As a
contrast, one can name countries that generally are the right-wing
parties' favorites. In the United States, one of every seven
citizens is poor. In the old Thatcher-land Great Britain, the
number is about the same.
	    &UR; ___
	   Clarin, Buenos Aires, Argentina, on world population:
	   Predictions and forewarnings 30 years ago of a catastrophic
growth in the world population and the detonation of a so-called
``demographic bomb'' have been disproven with the passage of time.
Neither the announced crisis in food stocks nor an extraordinary
increase in the birthrate came to pass. On the contrary, the
momentum toward growth of the world population is ebbing. In 1960,
at the peak of the demographic explosion, the world population
stood at 3 billion people. Today that population is around 6
billion and growth is on the order of 1.4 percent as 80 million
persons are added each year.
	   Nonetheless, the latest population data of the United Nations
warns of other disquieting trends ... principally, more young
people than ever are entering the stage of work ... secondly, the
proportion of those over 65 is growing at a rate without precedent.
	   The U.N. report recalls the international conference on
population and development of 1994 .... (whose) commitments should
produce public policies designed to create sources of work. Greater
efforts in education, health and social security are also
indispensable as a foundation for economic and social development.
	    &UR; ___
	   Repubblica, Rome, on Russia:
	   From the standoff between Boris Yeltsin and the Communist Party
a third group has emerged, a group which played a decisive role
during the collapse of the Soviet Union and in the rising of the
new Russia: those politicians and technocrats who, guided by
Mikhail Gorbachev, started the ``Perestroika.''
	   The new government's prime minister, the deputy prime minister
and the new governor of the Central Bank have all been involved
directly with Mikhail Gorbachev in the past. ...
	   What has made their return to power possible is their moderate
socialism, their faith in the ability of the State to regulate and
correct the market, and their dislike of monetary policy.
	   They have a sort of ``duplicity,'' the same duplicity that did
not allow Gorbachev to make a clear decision between the state and
the market and that, in the end, caused his own collapse.
	   In no way, however, does Gorbachev himself have the possibility
to regain power.
	   And Yevgeny Primakov must be very careful. If he fails, the
Communist party will have no mercy. Just like in the past they had
none for Gorbachev.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Mirror, London, on Tony Blair's friendship with Clinton:
	   Loyalty to friends is an admirable quality _ so long as those
friends are worth admiring.
	   There is little about President Clinton's personal life that any
decent person can admire. Yet this did not stop Tony Blair offering
his support to Clinton as soon as the Starr reports into the
president's sordid sex life was published.
	   Was he supporting Clinton's adultery? Or his lies? Or his
alleged attempts at cover-up?
	   As a prime minister, Blair speaks for the whole country. So when
he supports a lying adulterer, the implication is that we all
should.
	   Admittedly, if you look beyond the revolting sex scandal to
Clinton's political record, there is much about him that is
praiseworthy. ...
	   But none of these issues has anything to do with the publication
of the Starr report, which prompted Blair's message of support.
	   There is no getting away from the fact that Clinton is morally
bankrupt.
	   Which is why Blair's message of support was so ill-judged.
	    &UR; ___
	   Le Monde, Paris, on U.N. report on Algeria:
	   If it is true, like the mission asserts, that Algeria now has an
elected Parliament, where ``lively debates'' take place, this
evolution is still a mere facade: The army is still carrying a lot
of influence in the political life and its many factions are making
arrangements or secretly opposing themselves.
	   Meanwhile, the practice of torture was never ``eradicated'',
opponents have mysteriously disappeared and secret detentions
without judgments are numerous.
	   In Algeria as anywhere else, terrorism can only be ended with
the state's strict respect of the law. For repression has never
been the only answer to a conflict: the means used determine the
end. If they (the means) violate basic rights, they in turn
legitimate revolt and jeopardize a democratic solution to the
crisis. This is the message that the United Nations should have
given to the Algerian regime.

<TEXT>
	   Trouw, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, on Starr Report:
	   Investigator Kenneth Starr's report on the sexual relationship
of President Bill Clinton with Monica Lewinsky is distasteful pulp.
This is no erotic fiction of high caliber, it is not a study of
behavior patterns, and what's more, it is not a report about
anonymous people. It is the sexual habits of the president of the
United States in all its bizarre details for all to see. With his
detailed report, Starr has overstepped the boundary of the
necessary, as well as the decent.
	   More seriously, it has clearly shown that the president has
committed perjury twice ... He has lied under oath. Period. And
just as serious is the way he has attempted to mislead and to
manipulate.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Sydney Morning Herald, Sydney, Australia, on Starr Report:
	   The mess of detail about the tawdry affair between President
Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky does not make it easy to keep the
matter in perspective. ...
	   What (Richard) Nixon authorized in the Watergate scandal
threatened the integrity of the U.S. system of government. It was
bound to be investigated. It was properly pressed home to fix him
and others with responsibility.
	   Clinton's behavior with Lewinsky disgusts. But it has never had
a public dimension to it sufficient to justify the money and effort
expended by (independent counsel Kenneth) Starr and his team of
investigators.
	   At some point long ago it should have become obvious that this
was a private affair, of unexpectedly lurid dimensions. It reflects
terribly on the morals of Clinton. But it never has been and still
is not a sufficiently grave matter of public importance to warrant
the pursuit of the president through the impeachment and removal
process. That will not improve the health of the U.S. system of
government, but weaken it even more than it has been already.
	    &UR; ___
	   Yomiuri Shimbun, Tokyo, on Russsia:
	   Russia is under pressure to resuscitate its economy and ensure
the security of society so as to prevent a depression and the
outflow of nuclear materials.
	   One concern of nations that want to help Russia is that
Communists have gained a greater say in the new Cabinet.
	   (Prime minister Yevgeny) Primakov underscored the necessity of
boosting state control over the economy, a policy that the
Communists support. He has already appointed Communist-affiliated
politicians to key economic posts. If the Communists take the
leadership in managing the economy, they will try to change the
nation's reformist course by, among other things, pushing to
renationalize companies in key industries.
	   If this comes to pass, financial support from the international
community may not continue as it is given on the condition that
Russia will make efforts toward transforming itself into a market
economy. This impasse may result in friction between Russia and the
international community.
	   Signs are emerging that Russia is experiencing a backlash
against economic and political reforms.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Seattle Times, Seattle, Washington, on diarrhea:
	   Authors don't write prize-winning books about it. Celebrities
don't hold Planet Hollywood galas to memorialize its victims.
School children don't hold bake sales to help pay for better sewer
systems in underdeveloped nations. There is no World Diarrhea Day.
	   Yet an estimated 1 million children around the world die of the
disease every year. And in the U.S. _ here in this wealthy,
industrialized nation _ some 55,000 kids are hospitalized annually
by the virus.
	   Earlier this month, the Food and Drug Administration approved a
miracle vaccine that cuts cases of viral childhood diarrhea in
half. It's the world's first diarrhea-fighting medicine;
manufacturer Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories promises to distribute the
vaccine to kids in developing countries. This is an astounding
public-health development that warrants more fanfare than it is
getting.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Herald-Sun, Durham, North Carolina, on Iraq:
	   Lost in the news last week concerning the contents of
independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report to Congress was the
collapsing state of this country's policy toward Iraq. Earlier this
year, the United States appeared headed for military action with
Iraq to force Saddam Hussein to give United Nations inspectors free
access to weapons sites. Saddam appeared to back down after U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan intervened in February to defuse the
crisis.
	   The situation has deteriorated since the February agreement. In
August, Iraq ended all cooperation with weapons inspectors. The
United Nations' reluctance to respond to Iraq's actions prompted
American Scott Ritter, a six-year veteran of the inspections team,
to resign from his post. Ritter criticized the U.N. for being
unwilling to enforce the Gulf War mandate. ...
	   The policy of the United Nations _ and, through its complicity,
this country _ has been one of appeasement. It does a disservice to
the men and women who fought in the Persian Gulf War. Once the dust
settles from the Monica Lewinsky matter, whoever is sitting in the
Oval Office must put teeth back into our policy toward Saddam
Hussein.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Advocate, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Russia:
	   Western nations are right to be cautious about immediate aid to
Russia, gripped by a political and financial crisis that has
rattled world markets as well as made lives of the Russian people
more difficult.
	   Lawrence Summers, the U.S. deputy secretary of the Treasury, is
seeking to lower Russian expectations that an emergency meeting of
finance and foreign ministry officials will generate a big new
check. ...
	   Already, the International Monetary Fund is slated to send the
Russians $4.3 billion to rescue the ruble. ...
	   The problem with this aid, and with many calls for a ``Marshall
Plan'' for Russia in the near future, is that there is no financial
or legal infrastructure of a free enterprise economy. ...
	   Not only does Russia not have that framework, it has a
population averse to the very notion of profit. ...
	   Americans might, one day soon, be called upon to write a very
big check to aid Russia. It might not be a bad idea at some future
date, but not now.

Government links deadly mine accident to illegal tunnel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A mine accident that led to the deaths of
10 men was possibly set off by an illegal tunnel that collapsed,
causing a larger cave-in, Economics Minister Hannes Farnleitner was
quoted as saying Thursday.
	   Farnleitner, whose ministry is responsible for the mining
sector, was quoted by Der Standard daily that the management of the
mine had acknowledged existence of the tunnel which did not show up
in drawings showing its layout.
	   But other executives of the mine in Lassing, 190 kilometers (120
miles) southwest of Vienna, said the tunnel was legal.
	   The men were rescue workers trapped in the talc mine July 17
when the cable of their elevator snapped after a mudslide. The
miner they were sent down to rescue was later found alive.
	   Police investigating the cave-in on Thursday said they had
evidence relating to the dispute about the legality of the tunnel
but added the investigation was expected to continue for weeks.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with talks continuing overnight into Friday, ruling
party compromising on key issues. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOJI SAKURAI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's ruling party compromised to opposition
demands early Friday in an attempt to end the deadlock over a
package of key banking reform bills designed to shore up the
country's ailing financial system.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi is anxious to get the bills
passed before his summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton next
Tuesday.
	   The main sticking point has been the governing party plan to use
taxpayer money to bail out the cash-strapped Long-Term Credit Bank.
	   Talks between ruling party and opposition leaders continued
straight through the night from late Thursday into early Friday.
	   The governing party is trying to pass the legislation to begin
cleaning up the massive bad loans strangling the financial sector,
leftover from the excessive lending of the ``bubble'' era in the
1980s.
	   The opposition can stall the passage of bills because the ruling
party lacks a majority in the upper house of Parliament.
	   Washington has prodded Tokyo to act more quickly to fix the bad
loan problem.
	   And the impasse over the bills has set off fears that Japan will
not be able to pull itself out quickly from its worst recession in
50 years, threatening to hurt the entire global economy.
	   In the overnight talks over proposals and counter-proposals, the
negotiators hammered out a compromise on the Long-Term Credit Bank
of Japan.
	   Under that compromise, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party will
accede to the opposition's call for a temporary nationalization of
the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan.
	   The ruling party also agreed to opposition demands that capital
injected into the Long-Term Credit Bank will not come from a 13
trillion-yen (dlrs 98 billion) pool of public funds earmarked for
bolstering ailing financial institutions.
	   Obuchi is also expected to accept another key opposition demand:
creating a new institution by January 1999 that would take over the
planning of financial policies in the Ministry of Finance.
	   For some time, there have been criticism against how the
powerful ministry deals with such a wide range of policies,
including the national budget as well as banks and other financial
institutions.
	   With the ruling party bending on almost every issue of
contention with the opposition, it appeared almost certain the
bills would pass soon, Japanese media reports said.
	   An opposition party official said that Obuchi may later hold
talks with Naoto Kan, the head of the Democratic Party, the main
opposition party.
	   It was also possible the talks would be temporarily ended then
resumed later Friday.
	   Earlier Thursday, both Kan and Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa
said they expected a deal soon.
	   ``I'm getting signals that the government and the Liberal
Democratic Party are about to accept our proposals,'' Kan said.
	   The pillar of the ruling party's banking legislation is the
creation of a ``bridge bank'' that would use public funds to take
over insolvent banks and run them until they are healthy enough to
be sold back to the private sector.
	   The opposition has proposed rival legislation which holds bank
managers more accountable for running their companies aground.

French government rejects Coca-Cola purchase of Orangina
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The French government, citing concerns over
competition, on Thursday blocked Coca-Cola's proposed five billion
franc (dlrs 850 million) buyout of Orangina, France's biggest soft
drink.
	   The announcement came as a surprise since analysts considered
government approval a formality, despite stern opposition from
Pepsi-Cola Co. which feared losing its distribution channels in
France as a result of the deal.
	   The government said in a statement that a study it commissioned
from France's Competition Council showed that Coke stood to gain an
unfair advantage over its competitors in French bars and
restaurants.
	   ``These risks are liable to penalize the consumer,'' the French
Finance Ministry statement said.
	   Earlier this week, Coca-Cola reached a job-security agreement
with the workers of Orangina, removing what was considered to be
the final major stumbling block to its purchase from Pernod-Ricard.
	   The Atlanta-based company promised to maintain Orangina jobs
until Dec. 31, 2000 under terms of the accord.
	   Orangina workers had voiced concern after a study for employee
representatives indicated major reduction in the 650-member work
force was likely if the buyout occurred.
	   Pepsi-Cola Co., Coke's biggest competitor, hoped to capitalize
on those fears by offering 10 years of job security, but without
offering a similar buyout price.
	   Pernod-Ricard is selling Orangina, a carbonated orange soft
drink, to raise money for other expansions.

	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Claiming victory in last
weekend's election, Bosnian Serb radicals warned Thursday of a
political crisis if international overseers try to deny them power.
	   The threats were issued one day after the leader of the Serb
Radical Party, Nikola Poplasen, claimed victory over the U.S.
favorite, Biljana Plavsic, in the race for president of the
Serb-run Bosnian enclave, Republika Srpska.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
ran the Saturday-Sunday election, has refused to release any
results, citing a complicated ballot, numerous contested posts and
the need for accuracy.
	   But Hanns Schumacher, a deputy to the chief international
official in Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp, confirmed Thursday that
Plavsic was trailing, although he stressed that many absentee
ballots remain uncounted.
	   Nevertheless, Schumacher said preliminary results had shown
extremists faring better than the Americans and Europeans had
hoped. U.S. special envoy Robert Gelbard returned to Sarajevo on
Thursday for what diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, termed ``consultations about the elections.''
	   Hundreds of flag-waving, cheering supporters of Poplasen took to
the streets of many Bosnian Serb towns late Wednesday, shouting
insults against Plavsic and her moderate government.

After battling cancer, Cullen fighting for spot on Lightning
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FELDKIRCH, Austria (AP) _ Tampa Bay Lightning's John Cullen will
return to the ice Friday for the first time since winning his
life-threatening battle with cancer.
	   Having won his year-long struggle with the disease, John Cullen
will return to a more familiar fight on Friday - winning a spot on
the Tampa Bay Lightning roster for the upcoming NHL season.
	   When Cullen steps onto the ice for the first time since being
diagnosed with non-Hodgkins lymphoma, the aggressive chemotherapy
and bone-marrow transplant will fade into the background for a
couple of hours, as the 34-year-old forward vys with several
younger, fitter players for his old position on the team.
	   The Lightning, along with the Buffalo Sabres, are using the
International Challenge tournament in Austria as their kickoff to
pre-season training.
	   On Tuesday, when the Lightning posted a convincing 4-1 win over
European champions Feldkirch, Cullen sat on the bench with several
other candidates awaiting their turn.
	   Tampa Bay coach Jacques Demers and General Manager Phil Esposito
promised Cullen, who has not played a game since March 1997, that
he'd get his chance during Friday's showcase final of the Challenge
Cup against the Sabres.
	   For Cullen, stepping onto the ice at the 1976 Olympic arena in
Innsbruck will be a dream come true, the end of a long journey
back.
	   ``It's been a long, tough ride and just to be back on the ice is
incredible,'' said Cullen. ``This is my 12th training camp.
	   ``You wouldn't think a veteran would enjoy camp but I really,
truly am.''
	   Just 18 months ago, playing hockey had become torture for
Cullen, who suddenly started having chest and throat pains, sore
teeth, and was finding it difficult just to skate the length of the
ice.
	   Assuming it was a chest infection, Cullen chose to ignore his
suffering, with his team just three points out of the hunt for a
playoff berth.
	   It was only when his wife, worried about her usually stoic
husband's compaints, called team officials at the arena before a
game against Hartford, that the team doctor discovered a large,
dark shadow on Cullen's chest X-ray.
	   Though a tumor was listed among the possible causes, Cullen
``never for a second gave cancer any consideration.''
	   The next day, March 29, 1997, a cat-scan and biopsy revealed the
presence of a grapefruit-sized tumor in his chest.
	   Despite six gruelling months of intensive chemotherapy and
radiation treatment traces of the cancer still remained.
	   In October Cullen underwent a painful procedure in which bone
marrow was drilled out of his lower back, ``purged'' or cleansed,
then reintroduced into his body.
	   Four days later his heart stopped beating for almost a minute
before doctors were able to ressucitate him.
	   But the aggressive treatment proved effective.
	   Six months ago, Cullen received the news he was ``cancer-free,''
though he'll have to undergo regular testing to make sure the
disease stays in remission.
	   ``My main motivation to get better was my wife, daughter and
family,'' said Cullen, who lost 40 pounds along with all his body
hair during treatment. ``Hockey was another motivation but not the
main one.''
	   The next five years, when the cancer is the most susceptible to
return, will be the toughest for Cullen.
	   ``When I get a cold I think `Oh my God, it's back','' said
Cullen, who has since regained all the weight he lost. ``I
sometimes panic a bit when I'm not feeling well. I call my doctor
and he tells me it's OK, I'm allowed to get colds, it's normal.
	   ``It'll never end. When you get cancer you fight it for the rest
of your life, always worrying and wondering.''
	   For the moment, however, Cullen is worrying and wondering about
his first NHL game in a year and half.
	   ``When I told Phil (Esposito) about the tumor he was very upset,
but I said don't worry I'll be back,'' said Cullen. ``He must have
thought I was crazy, but here I am.
	   ``It's going to be good to get out there and get banged around
again,''

Police and residents rush to capture thousands of freed minks

<TEXT>
	   ONNELEY, England (AP) _ Residents and police rushed to capture
thousands of freed minks Thursday after animal-rights activists
hacked open cages at a breeding farm, releasing almost 8,000 into
the countryside.
	   The morning raid was the second time British activists have
struck the fur industry in as many months.
	   ``This is not animal rights, this is animal cruelty,'' said Len
Kelsall, 60, who owns the targeted mink farm in Onneley,
Staffordshire, 250 miles (400 kms) northwest of London.
	   ``The farmers are shooting them, or they are getting run over or
fighting with each other,'' added Kelsall. He raises the minks for
their pelts and supplies the Russian fur market.
	   Police issued an alert after the animals were freed just before
6 a.m. (0500 GMT). Kelsall said 3,500 cages were hacked open,
possibly with bolt-cutters.
	   SKY TV reported that the Animal Liberation Front, a shadowy
extremist group linked to similar actions, had claimed
responsibility.
	   By Thursday night, fewer than 1,000 minks were still on the
loose. Most stayed within the farm compound, and others were
captured throughout the day by volunteers and police using large
fish nets.
	   Staffordshire Police also estimated that about 200 minks had
died after being shot or run over.
	   Local residents were being warned by police to keep doors and
windows closed because the minks will attack pets, and motorists
were told to avoid the area.
	   In August, supporters of the Animal Liberation Front smashed
cages and cut wire at a fur farm near Ringwood, 100 miles (160 kms)
southwest of London, freeing 2,000 minks _ some of which are still
running wild.
	   On Thursday, officials in Cardiff, Wales found a two-foot (0.6
meters) long male mink hiding out in the ladies' toilet near the
shopping center. They believe it may have hitched a ride on a fruit
truck, and may be one of the thousands freed in earlier raids.
	   Toilet attendants raised the alarm after the mink began gnawing
on cubicle doors and eating decorative plants.
	   ``It's the first time a mink has been sighted here,'' said a
Cardiff official, speaking with customary anonymity. ``We're just
hoping it doesn't have a mate in tow.''

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with marathon talks temporarily adjourned, opposition
rejecting ruling party compromise; EDITS thruout to conform. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOJI SAKURAI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's ruling party compromised to opposition
demands early Friday in an attempt to end the deadlock over a
package of key banking reform bills designed to shore up the
country's ailing financial system.
	   But the opposition rejected the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party's proposal.
	   ``If this is all they have, forget it,'' Kansei Nakano, deputy
head of the opposition Democratic Party, told reporters. ``We're
done for tonight.''
	   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi is anxious to get an
agreement on the bills before his summit with U.S. President Bill
Clinton next Tuesday.
	   The main sticking point has been the governing party plan to use
taxpayer money to bail out the cash-strapped Long-Term Credit Bank.
	   Talks between ruling party and opposition leaders continued
straight through the night from late Thursday into early Friday.
	   The opposition rejection came after marathon meetings over
proposals and counter-proposals lasting about 18 hours.
Negotiations were expected to resume later Friday, after
participants had rested.
	   The governing party is trying to pass the legislation to begin
cleaning up the massive bad loans strangling the financial sector,
leftover from the excessive lending of the ``bubble'' era in the
1980s.
	   The opposition can stall the passage of bills because the ruling
party lacks a majority in the upper house of Parliament.
	   Washington has prodded Tokyo to act more quickly to fix the bad
loan problem.
	   And the impasse over the bills has set off fears that Japan will
not be able to quickly pull itself out of its worst recession in 50
years, threatening to hurt the entire global economy.
	   Under the ruling party proposal that surfaced in the overnight
talks, the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan will be temporarily
nationalized as the opposition had demanded.
	   The ruling party also agreed to opposition demands that capital
injected into the Long-Term Credit Bank will not come from a 13
trillion-yen (dlrs 98 billion) pool of public funds earmarked for
bolstering ailing financial institutions.
	   Obuchi is also expected to accept another key opposition demand:
creating a new institution by January 1999 that would take over the
planning of financial policies in the Ministry of Finance.
	   With the ruling party bending on almost every issue of
contention with the opposition, it appeared almost certain the
bills would pass soon, Japanese media reports said.
	   The pillar of the ruling party's banking legislation is the
creation of a ``bridge bank'' that would use public funds to take
over insolvent banks and run them until they are healthy enough to
be sold back to the private sector.
	   The opposition has said bank managers should be held more
accountable for running their companies aground.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A U.S.-backed plan to end Kosovo's
violence foresees local autonomy for the Serbian province but keeps
it part of Serbia and within Yugoslavia, a newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   The plan was published in Koha Ditore, a Kosovo Albanian daily,
as Serbian and Yugoslav forces maintained pressure on the few
remaining pockets of territory still controlled by Albanian
guerrillas fighting for independence.
	   A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed the authenticity of the published plan but said it was
``only a starting point'' for Serbian and Kosovo Albanian leaders.
	   And chief Kosovo Albanian negotiator Fehmi Agani said his side
had ``serious complaints about the proposal and it will have to be
changed.'' He did not elaborate.
	   The United Nations estimates more than 600 people have died and
275,000 have been displaced since the clashes started late
February.
	   Although outgunned guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army are
being routed by Serb police and the Yugoslav army, most Albanians
in the province still support the idea of independence from Serbia,
the dominant republic in the Yugoslav federation.
	   The draft plan was first made public late last month, but not in
the detail published Thursday. Many issues remain unresolved, and
Western diplomats say it could take months to finalize them.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill was meeting with ethnic Albanian
leaders in Pristina on Thursday.
	   The three-year accord refers to Kosovo as a ``territory'' with
its own parliament and executive powers, local police and judicial
system.
	   Kosovo would be represented in the Serbian government and the
Yugoslav parliament, but federal authorities could not influence
the work of local officials, the daily reported.
	   The publication of the document could be an attempt by Ibrahim
Rugova, the pacifist ethnic Albanian leader, to test public
sentiment about cutting a deal that falls short of independence.
	   Kosovo's independence has been ruled out by the West, which
fears it can only be achieved by years of unrest involving other
countries in the region, and by Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, who stripped the province of autonomy in 1989, when he
was Serbian president.
	   Fighting continued in the province, most of it located about 20
miles (30 kilometers) north of Pristina, Kosovo's capital. Three
people were killed and 17 wounded in fighting Wednesday and
Thursday, according to tallies by both sides.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources said Serb police and the allied Yugoslav
army are using heavy tanks in the offensive and that several
villages have been destroyed. International aid officials said some
10,000 ethnic Albanians fled their homes because of the latest
battles.

Yeltsin visits Moscow food shop
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Economy &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin stopped off Thursday in a
Moscow food store to see for himself how store clerks and shoppers
were coping with the nation's deep economic crisis.
	   But he brought no cameras with him _ perhaps reflecting his
aides' fear that they'd record him getting an earful of invective
from consumers who are struggling to keep up with fast-rising
prices.
	   Prices were increasing less than 1 percent a month before the
crisis hit. They have gone up 43 percent in the first half of
September, the government said this week.
	   After the president's unscheduled visit, one shop assistant
admitted to a reporter from the ORT state television network that
she'd been ``frightened,'' then pleasantly surprised that Yeltsin
was more pleasant than his usual portrayals in the media.
	   Another clerk said she and her colleagues were ``working as
usual,'' and recalled that the shop had attracted important
visitors before _ in particular, Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev.
	   Yeltsin's press service said that Yeltsin had discussed
``prices, pensions and other problems facing Russians,'' the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   A few pensioners trying to earn extra money by selling produce
outside the store said they'd asked the president to stop Moscow
police from chasing them away, along with other unlicensed vendors.
	   ``He promised us life would be better, but he didn't say when,''
said an unidentified woman who was selling gladioli and was later
interviewed by Russia's RTR TV.

Iranian minister tells Pakistan what steps Taliban should take

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's foreign minister warned his Pakistani
counterpart Thursday that Iran was under pressure to launch a
military strike in Afghanistan, Iranian television reported.
	   Kamal Kharrazi urged the Pakistani foreign minister to make sure
the Taliban militia in Aghanistan took steps to ease the pressure,
the broadcast said.
	   Iranians have been clamoring for their government to act since
the Taliban admitted last week to killing eight Iranian diplomats
and an Iranian journalist when their forces captured the northern
Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   Iran has massed tens of thousands of troops on its border with
Afghanistan, and Taliban leaders say they have rushed troops to the
border region to repulse any Iranian attack.
	   Pakistan is widely seen as the principal backer of the Taliban,
which controls 90 percent of Afghanistan, while Iran is suspected
of backing the opposition.
	   Pakistan's Sartaj Aziz flew to Tehran on Thursday for talks
aimed at defusing the tension.
	   ``There is significant pressure on the Iranian authorities to
resort to military means to avenge the crime,'' Kharrazi told Aziz,
the television reported.
	   ``There is a limit to which the pressure can be borne. However,
it is clear that practical steps need to be taken by both Pakistan
and the Taleban that would help ease the pressure,'' the Iranian
minister continued.
	   The television reported Kharrazi as saying the Taliban should
promptly return the two remaining bodies of the slain Iranians.
Seven bodies were returned Monday.
	   Kharrazi also asked Aziz to make sure the Taliban brings the
killers to justice and releases the other Iranians in its custody.
	   According to previous figures issued by the Tehran authorities,
the Taliban are still holding about 30 Iranian truck drivers.
	   The television reported Aziz as expressing his condolences for
the killing of the Iranians.
	   ``Pakistan is trying hard to secure the release of the Iranian
nationals in Taleban captivity and hopes that its efforts will bear
fruit in the next few days,'' the official Islamic Republic News
Agency quoted Aziz as saying.

	   BEITUNIA, West Bank (AP) _ Tensions between Israel and the
Palestinians soared Thursday with a Palestinian teen-ager's
shooting death, apparently by Israelis who opened fire from a car
on high school students heading home from class.
	   The attack, coupled with an announcement by Israel that it would
expand a Jewish settlement, came while Israel was on high alert,
bracing for possible attacks by militants before the Jewish holiday
season.
	   The incident also occurred as U.S. President Bill Clinton's
peace envoy wrapped up an unsuccessful effort at completing a deal
to end months of stalemate between the two sides over a long
overdue Israeli troop withdrawal.
	   The fatal shooting happened in the West Bank village of
Beitunia, and police said they were questioning an Israeli suspect.
	   ``A 35-year-old male from a Jewish settlement in the area turned
himself into the police. ... He is being held for questioning,''
Israeli police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said.
	   The shooting took place around noon when about 12 Palestinian
high school students were walking along the village's main road on
their way back from school.
	   A car with Israeli license plates pulled up next to them, the
passengers rolled down their windows and started shooting from a
pistol and an assault rifle, said one of the students, Raed Abdel
Rahman. ``Everybody started to jump and take cover,'' he said.
	   Two of the teen-agers were wounded in the stomach and taken to
nearby Ramallah Hospital, where 17-year-old Iyad Hashem later died.
The second boy was in stable condition.
	   In the past, Israelis driving in the West Bank have opened fire
to repulse Palestinian stone-throwers on rocky hilltops.
	   But Abdel Rahman insisted that the teen-agers had not stoned the
Israeli car before the shooting and that the gunfire occurred
without provocation.
	   At the Hashem family's modest apartment, his mother sat on the
living room floor in a house robe and sobbed, slapping her legs in
disbelief. ``My beloved, you didn't come home with your schoolbooks
today!'' Mrs. Hashem wailed. Dozens of family members and neighbors
had gathered to mourn with the boy's parents.
	   Palestinian officials had wanted to hold Hashem's funeral late
Thursday, in keeping with swift Muslim burial, and perhaps in an
effort to avoid violent protests, which rarely happen at night.
However, the boy's family insisted on holding the funeral Friday
afternoon, increasing the risk of rioting during the day.
	   Adding to the situation were fears by Israel of retaliatory
attacks from Islamic militants just as the country prepared for the
Jewish holiday season. Israeli radio said Israel would enforce a
tight closure on its internal borders, barring all Palestinians
from entering its cities.
	   U.S. mediator Dennis Ross was scheduled to leave the region
Friday and it seemed increasingly unlikely that he would be able to
arrange a three-way summit in New York next week with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
to wrap up such a deal.
	   The three leaders will be in New York for the U.N. General
Assembly. An Israeli Foreign Ministry official said it was more
likely that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would hold
separate talks with Arafat and Netanyahu. Arafat also said he would
only meet Netanyahu, if Israel accepts the terms for a U.S. peace
initiative.
	   Meanwhile, Palestinian officials condemned Israeli plans for a
tenfold expansion of a Jewish settlement on disputed West Bank
land.
	   Netanyahu told the Yediot Ahronot daily that plans to build 600
new homes in Yitzhar, where two residents were killed last month in
a drive-by shooting by Palestinian militants, was his response ``to
terrorist perpetrators.''
	   The United States has urged Israel to halt settlement expansion
on land which the Palestinians want for a hoped-for state.
	   ``This expansion policy is the bomb that will explode all the
efforts to put the peace process back on track,'' said Ahmed Abdel
Rahman, the secretary-general of the Palestinian Cabinet.
	   The Yediot Ahronot said Israel would confiscate land from four
Palestinian villages for the new construction.
	   But Peter Lerner, a spokesman for Israel's military government
in the West Bank, said no private Palestinian land would be
expropriated for the construction.

EU humanitarian aid chief defends her office in fraud case

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - European Union Humanitarian Aid
Commissioner Emma Bonino lashed out at the media Thursday for
questioning her department's integrity in a fraud case involving
dlrs 550,000 that have gone astray.
	   ``I bitterly regret that several sources have made so-called
`revelations' and given in to speculation,'' Bonino told reporters.
	   She said such speculative reporting was damaging to the image of
the EU executive Commission and its humanitarian aid office, known
as ECHO.
	   Bonino acknowledged EU officials had investigated the
disappearance of some 500,000 European currency units (dlrs
550,000) from ECHO coffers and said one ECHO official has been
suspended.
	   Bonino insisted this was an isolated case and denied media
reports of a systematic misuse of funds.
	   The missing funds were part of four aid contracts earmarked for
ex-Yugoslavia and Rwanda in 1993-1994, totaling 2.4 million ecus
(dlrs 2.6 million).
	   The Commission turned the case over to Luxembourg authorities as
the aid was managed by a Luxembourg-based consultancy company,
Perry Lux, for, among other things, recruiting extra staff to run
and monitor humanitarian operations.
	   Bonino said between 1991 and 1995, ECHO used part of its
``operational'' funds to recruit 27, short-term staff to help ECHO
staff cope with the monitoring of aid to crisis-hit regions. Echo
was funded in 1991. It employs 108 full-time workers.
	   Media reports have said the Commission's anti-fraud services
found that Perry Lux has been unable to justify the spending of
540,000 ecu (dlrs 594,000) and that aid funds for the former
Yugoslavia and Africa was used to pay for extra staff in Brussels.
	   There have also been reports of other irregularities involving
funds for office equipment that could not be audited for lack of
proper records.

Trial hopes to crack enigma of Florence Rey
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes, restores byline.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Florence Rey, tousle-haired and dressed in a blue
jean jacket, wiped away tears as she stepped into the courtroom
Thursday to be judged for a 1994 cops-and-robbers chase that turned
into one of the bloodiest common crimes in France in a decade.
	   Four years after the deadly escapade that left five people dead,
including three police officers and her accomplice, the 23-year-old
stood before a court that will try to unlock the enigma behind Ms.
Rey, whose motives remain a mystery.
	   ``I wanted to say to the victims' families that I understand
their pain because I know what it's like to lose someone dear,''
she told the court, her trembling voice often inaudible as she
described what she called ``the horrifying sequence of events.''
	   Rey, then a haggard-looking literature student, is accused of
murder and attempted murder.
	   Her companion in crime and lover, Audry Maupin, then 22, died a
day later from gunshot wounds.
	   A second person, Abdelhakim Dekhar, 33, accused of being the
``third man'' described by eyewitnesses in the Oct. 4, 1994,
episode also was being tried. He denies any involvement.
	   Rey sobbed several times before a jury of seven women and two
men, bursting into tears when her parents were called forward for
their hearing date.
	   Although the motives for the attack were still unclear, Rey
described her life with Maupin around the time of the attack.
	   ``Life in that house was getting more and more difficult, it
began to get cold,'' she said. ``I was depressed. Audry was a
rebel. He liked the gangster image. It conveyed freedom to him.''
	   She said she fired several rounds and was ``very panicked.'' But
she said she didn't kill anyone.
	   The trial, likely to last two weeks, is expected to shed light
on extreme-left movements to which Rey and Maupin had allegedly
gravitated. It was not clear whether that connection could help
explain the origin of the drama. Only the events that unfolded that
night four years ago are clear:
	   Rey and Maupin, armed with rifles, try to hold up a car lot in
northeast Paris, allegedly tear gassing two police officers and
taking their pistols.
	   The two then commandeer a taxi, taking the driver and passenger
hostage. The driver, frightened, purposely rams a police car,
prompting a shootout. Two police officers and the taxi driver are
killed and two passersby wounded.
	   Rey and Maupin then commandeer a second car. Police give chase
and the driver is ordered to accelerate. The car is blocked by a
motorcyclist who lays his cycle across the road to stop the pair.
	   A second shootout erupts: one police officer is killed and
Maupin seriously injured. Rey surrenders.
	   Psychiatrists, according to the prosecution, describe Rey as
having a ``good intellectual level'' but living with an
``idealization of the future cut off from social reality.''
	   Ballistics experts determined that the fatal shots came from
Maupin's weapons.
	   The prosecution claims Rey ``participated by her presence and
her action, her support and her encouragement of her friend.''

	   Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz is to deliver a message to Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami from Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif during his ``short and unexpected'' visit to Iran, Iranian
television said. The TV report, which was monitored by the British
Broadcasting Corporation, gave no further details.
	   Iran accuses Pakistani intelligence forces of helping
Afghanistan's Taliban militia to storm the Iranian consulate in
northern Afghanistan last month and capturing 10 Iranian diplomats
and a reporter.
	   The Taliban admitted last week to killing nine of the 11
captured Iranians.
	   Pakistan has denied involvement in the attack on the Iranian
mission.
	   Tensions between Iran and Afghanistan's Taliban militia have
been running high over the Taliban's killing of the Iranians.
	   Iran has massed tens of thousands of troops on its border with
Afghanistan, and Taliban leaders have said they've rushed troops to
the border region to repulse any Iranian attack.
	   Pakistan is widely believed to provide military and other
support to the Taliban, which controls 90 percent of Afghanistan,
while Iran is suspected of backing the opposition which represents
Afghanistan's minority Shiite Muslims.

Mali premier meets governments to discuss poverty reduction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Mali's prime minister appealed to the United
States, Japan, European countries and others Thursday for dlrs 372
million to reduce poverty in the north west African nation.
	   Ibrahim Boubacar Keita is seeking the support of other
governments at a two day meeting in Geneva for a five year strategy
to satisfy the basic needs of Mali's 9.8 million people.
	   Half the population don't have access to fresh drinking water
and 46 percent of Mali's children cannot attend school, Keita told
a news conference.
	   In 1996, an estimated 71.6 percent of the population was living
below the poverty line, a U.N. Development Program news release
said. The country's strategy aims to reduce poverty by at least 12
percent during the next five years.
	   Around 65 percent of Mali is desert or semi-desert and 80
percent of the working population is employed in farming and
severely affected by bad weather, the news release said.

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Former President Sali Berisha called
Thursday for nationwide protests against the government, which
moved closer to arresting him on suspicion he fomented riots aimed
at topple it.
	   A parliamentary commission recommended Berisha, a member of
parliament, be stripped of his immunity against arrest. The legal
step, if approved by the full Parliament, could further fan the
conflict already smoldering in Albania.
	   Berisha urged supporters earlier to demonstrate Friday against
Prime Minister Fatos Nano's government, which he called a
Communist-style dictatorship that killed its opponents.
	   Such a reference resonates in Albania, once among the world's
most hard-line Stalinist countries. But Western officials and many
Albanians view Berisha himself as hungry for power and interested
only in personal gain.
	   President Rexhep Meidani, a ceremonial figurehead, appealed
publicly for calm. Western powers fear Friday's protest could spark
unrest similar to the two days of rioting this week that returned
Albania to the brink of full-scale civil strife for the second time
in 18 months.
	   ``We feel it will be very good for people to stay at home, so
that they are not being misused for political ends,'' said Daan
Everts, the ambassador of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
	   For the second straight day, about 2,000 Democratic Party
supporters held a brief, peaceful protest in Tirana's central
square to denounce the Nano government. Roadblocks at key
intersections kept others from joining it, and armed police wearing
black balaclavas searched vehicles and people for weapons.
	   Police told the state news agency they had detained 50 people on
Wednesday for possessing weapons and other offenses. Meanwhile,
fresh unrest was reported in northern Albania, where Berisha has
strong support.
	   About 80 people armed with grenades and automatic rifles
attacked a bank and police station late Wednesday night in Lezha,
55 kilometers (35 miles) north of Tirana, said Artan Bizhga, the
Interior Ministry spokesman. Three of the attackers died in
gunbattles with police, and several were wounded, Bizhga said.
	   The identities of the attackers was unknown.
	   Western diplomatic sources said Evert, special European Union
envoy Herbert Grubmayr and others were negotiating to arrange a
``cooling off'' period to ease the threat of further violence.
	   They said Berisha would probably not be arrested before next
week, in hopes of avoiding an immediate backlash from his
supporters.
	   The current crisis began with the slaying Saturday of popular
politician Azem Hajdari, a close aide to Berisha, who immediately
blamed Nano.
	   Rioting by Berisha's supporters on Sunday and Monday damaged the
parliament and prime minister's office. They briefly took over the
state television station, burned cars and looted shops. Three
people died, and scores were injured.
	   Much of Berisha's support comes from former government workers
during his five years in power who lost their jobs when Nano took
over last year. In seeking a return to power, Berisha has exploited
outrage over Hajdari's killing and disappointment with the
government's inability to revive the depressed economy and restore
confidence in the nation's future.
	   Urging people to protest Friday throughout Albania, Berisha
called Nano ``the most dangerous leader, staying in power only by
arresting, by murdering, by executing ... the opposition.''
	   Despite Berisha's rhetoric, he faces an elected government
backed by Western powers desperate to prevent the Albanian unrest
from influencing other crises in the region, especially in
neighboring Kosovo province in Yugoslavia. Berisha has publicly
supported Albanian rebels fighting for Kosovo's independence.

Belarus offers to join forces with Russia against Western
</HEADLINE>
``propaganda'' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ In an angry message reminiscent of the
Cold War, the Belarusian government offered Thursday to defend
Russia against a wave of hostile ideology allegedly unleashed by
the West.
	   ``The West in now unfolding powerful, destructive propaganda
against Russia,'' Belarusian Foreign Minister Ivan Antonovich
declared Thursday.
	   But ``we will fight together, we will design joint programs of
survival,'' Antonovich pledged.
	   Antonovich also said that Russia's new prime minister, Yevgeny
Primakov, may visit Belarus to discuss ``joint positions of the new
arena'' of the ideological war.
	   He did not say when the visit might take place.
	   Belarus' autocratic President Alexander Lukashenko and his
government have repeatedly accused western nations of plotting
unspecified hostile actions against his country.
	   Belarusian allegations of plots against Russia appear to have
flared up after Russia was hit by the economic crisis this year.
	   ``I am afraid that very bad things may happen there again,''
Lukashenko said Thursday. ``I am afraid this might become a regular
occurrence.''
	   Lukashenko, a great admirer of the Soviet Union, is eager for
closer ties with Russia, and he seems to be trying to take
advantage of Russia's turmoil to push the goal.
	   At the same time, Lukashenko also criticized Russia for failing
to warn him of the economic crisis.
	   ``This is why the collapse in Russia cost us dearly,''
Lukashenko said.
	   Antonovich, meanwhile, suggested that Russia follow Belarus'
Soviet-style economic methods to resolve the crisis.
	   Belarus has one of the most unreformed economies in the former
Soviet Union, with most factories and businesses remaining under
state control.
	   Its currency, the Belarusian ruble, has suffered slump after
slump in recent months, leading to a surge in prices for what
meager goods are available in stores. Inflation is high and
unemployment is rising as Soviet-era industrial behemoths struggle
to find customers for obsolete products.
	   Lukashenko hopes closer ties with Russia will mean cheap energy
and a market for Belarusian products.

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Italy's undersecretary of communications
expressed alarm Thursday at Rupert Murdoch's reported interest in
the Italian TV market, saying Murdoch is the worst thing that could
happen to Italian television.
	   La Repubblica daily reported Thursday that Murdoch would buy a
40 percent stake in the TV company Stream, which is controlled by
Telecom Italia. A Stream spokeswoman denied the report.
	   Murdoch is believed to be interested in buying into Italy's
digital TV market _ specifically, acquiring the rights to transmit
Italian soccer games.
	   Italy's politicians and government officials greeted the idea
about as coldly as many soccer fans treated his group's moves on
the Manchester United soccer team.
	   ``Among the various possibilities for the development of the TV
sector, Murdoch's entry is the most painful for Italian industry,''
Telecommunications Undersecretary Vincenzo Vita said in an
interview with the TMC TV station.
	   The government is said to look more favorably on other partners
for Stream, including RAI, the state-run television group. RAI has
been mentioned as a possible partner for 10 percent to 15 percent
of Stream.
	   Fear of a purchase by the Australian-born media magnate prompted
a meeting Thursday between the top chiefs of Telecom and RAI.
Telecom officials pressed their RAI counterparts to quickly close
the books on their deal, Italy's ANSA news agency reported.

Under criticism, Ross takes off the jacket to explain policies

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ For a few hours, U.S. mediator
Dennis Ross took off his diplomat's jacket and tie to field
questions from Palestinian children in a crammed and stuffy
classroom and to tell the youngsters about his own family back
home.
	   Ross' tour of a secondary school and refugee camp, hastily
arranged at the end of another inconclusive Middle East peace
mission, was apparently aimed at improving his image among
Palestinians who believe he favors Israel and knows little about
their plight.
	   U.S. officials said the tour was the Palestinians' idea, while
Palestinian officials said it was initiated by Ross.
	   Ross, the senior U.S. peace envoy, has come under increasing
criticism from Palestinians in the last two years for his handling
of negotiations. A newspaper column published Wednesday in the
Palestinian Authority's official newspaper used an anti-Semitic
reference in calling for his removal from the negotiations.
	   Palestinian leaders have privately questioned Ross'
effectiveness, presumably in part because he is Jewish.
	   Known for his stoic nature, Ross tried to loosen up a bit
Thursday as he visited with families, businessmen and students
inside the densely populated Gaza Strip.
	   The Palestinians were receptive _ and perhaps hopeful as well.
	   At a meeting with the families of political prisoners, children
held up photos of their fathers along with signs as they sat in
their mothers' laps. ``Freedom to my Dad,'' read one sign. ``Mr.
Ambassador, Please I want my father back home,'' entreated another.
	   And at a school, Ross was greeted by large U.S. and Palestinian
flags, marching girls and cheers. Inside, two girls asked him for
his autograph.
	   In the classroom, Ross revealed a little about his family life,
telling the high school students he thought he could understand
them because he has children their age.
	   While Ross encouraged students as they struggled to read
prepared questions in halting English, he did not abandon his
knotty diplomat's jargon.
	   ``Our initiative is an effort not just to make a statement but
to actually reach an agreement between the two sides and allow them
to create a very different basis on which to proceed,'' Ross said
while explaining the purpose of his mission.
	   In broad terms, he emphasized the need for mutual understanding,
a recurrent theme of the day.
	   ``From your perspective, you look and see all the things
Israelis do that in your eyes they shouldn't do. From the Israeli
perspective, they see the same thing,'' Ross said. ``Oftentimes
when I meet with the people from each side they're very well aware
of their own grievances and have a hard time understanding the
other side's views.''
	   Ross is scheduled to depart the region Friday after a week of
inconclusive talks with both sides on reaching agreement over a
long overdue Israeli troop withdrawal and an end to an 18-month
impasse in Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking.

	   SMITHS FALLS, Ontario (AP) _ Goaltender Rachel Barrie has made
the roster of the Smiths Falls Bears, becoming the first girl to
play in the Ontario Central Junior A Hockey League.
	   Rachel, who will be in uniform when the Bears meet the
Brockville Braves in Friday's season-opener, plays down her role as
a gender pioneer.
	   ``I just think of it as signing a card and making the team,''
the 15-year-old said.
	   Barrie may start in Friday's game because No. 1 goaltender Cory
McEachran suffered a strained knee in a recent exhibition game.
	   ``She's technically sound, and she came to camp prepared to
play,'' said Bears' coach Michael McLean. ``All the things she can
control as an athlete, she does.''
	   Rachel adopts a butterfly style like her idol, Patrick Roy of
the Colorado Avalanche. She hopes to land a hockey scholarship to a
U.S. college.
	   She recently stopped 11 of 12 shots in a rookie exhibition game
against Brockville.
	   Bears' captain Dwight Merkley said Barrie has earned her
teammates' respect by her performance during the exhibition season.
	   ``She's played awesome,'' he said. ``If you didn't know she's a
girl you just think she's a good goaltender.''

Most Americans in new poll support UN, say issue of payments would

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ In spite of U.S. lawmakers' criticism of
the United Nations and failure to pay U.S. back dues, most
Americans asked in a recent poll support the world body and want
Washington to pay an estimated dlrs 1.3 billion in arrears.
	   By a three-to-one margin, those Americans polled favored
Congress paying the money America owes. And 49 percent of those
favoring payment are so concerned about the issue that it would
affect their vote for lawmakers, said the poll sponsored by the
U.N. advocacy group United Nations Association of the USA.
	   ``There's some kind of disconnect between public opinion about
the United Nations and the voting record in Congress, at least in
recent years,'' said UNA-USA chairman John C. Whitehead, a former
deputy U.S. secretary of state.
	   Support for the United Nations among Americans has risen an
average of 10 percentage points since the last survey was conducted
in 1996, Whitehead said.
	   This year's survey comes at a time when the United States is
threatened with a loss of its vote in the General Assembly if it
doesn't pay a chunk of the money it owes.
	   According to the poll, which was conducted by the group Wirthlin
Worldwide, 60 percent of respondents said the United Nations was
doing a ``good job,'' the organization's highest approval rating
since 1959, and up from 49 percent in 1996.
	   Seventy-two percent view the United Nations as ``very
important'' for American policy engagement, up from 54 percent in
the 1996 survey. By contrast, the ratings for other international
organizations such as NATO and the World Bank remain unchanged, the
poll found.
	   A majority of those polled _ 54 percent _ say they would be less
likely to vote for a member of Congress who favored pulling out of
the United Nations.
	   Republican congressional leaders have in the past linked
legislation that would pay off U.N. arrears with abortion
restrictions on U.S. funding for overseas family planning programs
that promote less restrictive abortion laws in some countries. U.S.
President Bill Clinton has threatened to veto any legislation with
such restrictions.
	   Eighty percent of Americans polled reject conditions linking
U.N. dues to the abortion legislation, the poll found.
	   Fifty-three percent of those asked approve of Secretary-General
Kofi Annan's job performance, compared to 14 percent who
disapprove. In the last survey, former Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali's approval rating was 30 percent, compared to 22
percent who disapproved of his performance.
	   The telephone survey was conducted among 1,005 U.S. adults
between Aug. 21-25. The margin of error was plus or minus 3.1
percentage points.

Israel vows to fight Palestinian agenda at upcoming UN session
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG LANGLOIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel said Thursday it plans to ``wage
defensive warfare'' against Palestinian proposals for statehood
which the PLO plans to bring before a special session of the United
Nations General Assembly next week.
	   After a summer vote enhanced their U.N. observer's status to
that near equal to other nations, the Palestinians will address the
assembly for the first time ever next week.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is expected to take the
opportunity to rally support for his plan to declare statehood in
May 1999, in the absense of a final peace agreement with Israel.
	   The government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
opposes Palestinian independence and will challenge the proposals,
said Yitzhak Lior, a deputy director general in Israel's foreign
ministry.
	   In a briefing with reporters, Lior said that Israel would
counter Palestinian calls for statehood both within and outside of
the United Nations, a forum Israel has traditionally seen as siding
against it.
	   Lior said Israel received assurance from the U.N. that Arafat
would only speak after all other world leaders, in line with
protocol for those without full status at the world body.
	   Lior said Israel would have to wait and see what exactly
Arafat's speech entails before it reacts. ``We can wage defensive
warfare depending on the Palestinian initiatives,'' he said.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai told Israeli radio
Thursday that the Palestinians would be making a big mistake if
they unilaterally declared an independent state. Israel's response
to such action could be upsetting to both sides, he warned, but
stopped short of saying Israel would annex more territory.
	   Palestinian Cabinet Secretary Ahmed Abdel Rahman, said threats
would nothing would prevent eventual Palestinian statehood.
	   ``The Palestinian people have the right to liberate their land
and to declare their sovereignty on it whether Netanyahu likes it
or not,'' Abdel Rahman said.

Yeltsin meets with Hashimoto, pledges to boost ties

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details of meeting, fresh quotes. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday met with
former Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and pledged to
carry out earlier promises to improve ties.
	   ``We have good relations and I'm sure that ... the specific
proposals we signed will be carried out,'' Yeltsin told reporters
after the meeting in a reference to agreements he signed with
Hashimoto during previous meetings.
	   Yeltsin and Hashimoto developed friendly relations during two
informal summits, one in Russia last November and one in Japan in
April. The meetings were hailed as a breakthrough in relations
strained by a territorial dispute over the Kuril Islands off the
southern Japanese coast.
	   The two countries have never signed a peace treaty formally
ending World War II, mainly because of a disagreement over control
of the islands, claimed by Japan but held by Russia since the end
of the war.
	   Yeltsin and Hashimoto did not ``concretely'' discuss the dispute
over the Kurils, said Sergei Prikhodko, Yeltsin's deputy chief of
staff. But they did discuss a plan to sign a broad bilateral
treaty, and the two nations' Foreign Ministries are cooperating on
it, Prikhodko said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Akio Kawato, Minister Counsellor of the Japanese Embassy in
Moscow, said that the two men had agreed that their countries
should conclude a peace treaty as soon as possible, Interfax
reported.
	   ``The view of Russia among the Japanese has changed dramatically
recently,'' Hashimoto was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news
agency. ``We are happy that our friendly relations are developing
so.''
	   Hashimoto resigned as prime minister last month and was named
special foreign policy advisor by his successor, Keizo Obuchi.
	   Obuchi, who served as foreign minister under Hashimoto, said
last month that he wanted to sign a peace treaty and normalize
relations with Russia by 2000.
	   Hashimoto's visit to Russia is paving the way for one by Obuchi
scheduled for November, the first official trip to Moscow by a
Japanese prime minister since 1973.

Family of slain Hamas fugitives lash out against Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ The family of two Hamas fugitives
killed by Israeli commandos lashed out against Israel Thursday,
accusing it of premeditated murder and demanding that return of the
bodies.
	   Speaking at a joint press conference with Palestinian human
rights organizations, Huda Awadallah, the wife of Adel Awadallah,
said that she could not rest until the bodies were returned.
	   ``We want to know exactly what happened and we want the bodies
back,'' Awadallah said. ``We will only be sure that they are dead
when we see the bodies for ourselves.''
	   Israel buried the two brothers in unmarked graves and has so far
refused to return the bodies, possibly holding them as bargaining
chips in future dealings with the militant Islamic group Hamas. The
family said it will hold a symbolic funeral Friday.
	   Palestinian officials and human rights organizations have also
pleaded on behalf of the family for the return of the Awadallah
brothers, so they could receive a proper Muslim burial.
	   The brothers were killed last week when Israeli troops raided
their West Bank hideout. Israel said the two were heavily armed
inside a rented home. But Palestinian officials Thursday accused
Israel of arresting the brothers and then killing them as part of
an premeditated assassination plot.
	   ``This crime is a war crime which means that all those
responsible should be put on trial,'' said Abdel Jawad Saleh, a
Palestinian legislative council member.
	   The killings sparked a chain of riots in the West Bank and
Hamas, which opposes peace with Israel and has carried out several
deadly attacks, threatened to retaliate with a spree of suicide
bombings and other acts against Israeli civilians and soldiers.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Three people have been arrested in a high-profile
case involving accusations that banks embezzled dlrs 237 million in
government funds that had been intended for supplying fighter
aircraft to India, a news report said Thursday.
	   Russian prosecutors have been investigating accusations that
Unikombank, one of the country's largest banks, and Andrei Vavilov,
former deputy finance minister and now adviser to the gas monopoly
Gazprom, diverted dlrs 512 million in government funds in two
separate deals in 1996 and early 1997. The aircraft deal alone was
worth dlrs 237 million, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Both Unikombank and Vavilov denied the allegations. Vavilov has
been among those mentioned as a possible finance minister in the
new government, and he held meetings with top government officials
on Thursday.
	   Two arrests were announced earlier this month in connection with
the deal involving the sale of MiG fighter aircraft to India.
ITAR-Tass identified the two arrested suspects as Maxim Tkachyov,
former financial director of the MAPO-MiG company, and Dmitry
Baranov, chairman of the Kreditny Soyuz bank.
	   ITAR-Tass, which cited an unidentified source in the Prosecutor
General's office in its report of a third arrest Thursday, gave no
additional details.

English weekly complains of censorship by Egyptian government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS censors being unreachable graf 6; government sensitivity
on Coptic issue graf 7; no pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Government censors have struck out two
articles in Egypt's largest-circulation weekly in English, the
newspaper said Thursday.
	   The Middle East Times had to remove from its Sept. 19-25 issue
an article on U.S. Coptic Christians and another on social violence
in Egypt, said its managing editor, Rod Craig.
	   The article on Copts details how American members of Egypt's
church are campaigning against the Cairo government's
discrimination against Christians and their support for the U.S.
Senate bill on freedom from religious persecution.
	   While the article states that not one of Egypt's 28 provincial
governors and 15 university presidents is Christian, it also quotes
an American Copt as dismissing the activists as lacking grass roots
support.
	   ``In my view (the article's) quite anodyne and no threat to
anyone,'' Craig said.
	   The censors could not be reached for comment late Thursday, but
the Middle East Times issued a statement saying that when it asked
them why the article was excised, they replied ``we've been through
all this and we don't talk about it anymore.''
	   The government is known to be extremely sensitive to allegations
that the Copts, who number about 10 percent of Egypt's 62 million
people, suffer discrimination.
	   The censors said the article on social violence was
``unacceptable,'' the statement said. The article was based on a
report by the Egyptian Organization of Human Rights.
	   Craig said the weekly had been submitting its articles to the
censors for about two years in order to avoid having whole issues
banned.
	   ``It's a very necessary compromise. Before we were losing whole
editions,'' he said.
	   The Middle East Times has a circulation of about 5,000, mostly
in Egypt. It sells some copies in Cyprus, Lebanon, Israel, Europe
and North America.
	   Craig said the newspaper, which was founded in 1983, had got
used to censorship.
	   ``It's rather sad. We weren't trying to influence the state. We
were doing our job: acting as any normal newspaper would -
reporting what is going on.''
	   In the past 12 months, the government has closed one newspaper
and temporarily forced several publications, such as the Middle
East Times and the Cairo Times, to be printed outside of Egypt. In
addition, four journalists have served short prison terms for
libel.

<TEXT>
	   BEITUNIA, West Bank (AP) _ Tensions between Israel and the
Palestinians soared Thursday with the shooting death of a
Palestinian teen-ager, apparently by Israeli motorists, and an
announcement by Israel to expand a Jewish settlement.
	   Both the boy's death and the expansion across more West Bank
land, came as U.S. President Bill Clinton's peace envoy wrapped up
an unsuccessful effort at completing a deal to end months of
stalemate between the sides and get a long overdue Israeli troop
withdrawal off the ground.
	   Thursday's fatal shooting occurred in the village of Beitunia
and police said they were questioning an Israeli suspect.
	   ``A 35-year-old male from a Jewish settlement in the area turned
himself into the police ... he is being held for questioning,''
Israeli police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat called the shooting ``another
crime as part of the continued conspiracy by the settlers against
our people.''
	   The shooting took place around noon when some 12 Palestinian
high school students were walking along the village's main road on
their way back from school.
	   A Ford with Israeli license plates pulled up next to them, the
passengers rolled down their windows and started shooting from a
pistol and an assault rifle, said one of the students, Raed Abdel
Rahman. ``Everybody started to jump and take cover,'' he said.
	   Two of the teen-agers were hit in the stomach and taken to
nearby Ramallah Hospital where 17-year-old Iyad Hashem later died
of his wound. The second boy was in stable condition.
	   Abdel Rahman insisted that the teen-agers had not stoned the
Israeli car first and that the motorists opened fire without
provocation. However, in the past, Israeli drivers have repeatedly
fired shots at Palestinian stone throwers targeting their cars from
rocky hilltops along West Bank highways.
	   But Israel radio said police found damage to the suspect's car
from stones. The radio said the settler suspect had called a
regional security hotline when his vehicle was attacked by stone
throwers. A few moments later he fired towards the youths and drove
off. The radio said the suspect turned himself in when he heard
from news reports that one of the youths had died.
	   Palestinian officials had wanted to hold Hashem's funeral after
dark Thursday, in keeping with swift Muslim burial, but also
perhaps to avoid riots which rarely break out at night. However the
boys' family insisted on holding the funeral Friday, after noon
prayers.
	   At the Hashem family's modest apartment, his mother sat on the
living room floor in a house robe and sobbed, slapping her legs in
disbelief. ``My beloved, you didn't come home with your school
books today,'' Mrs. Hashem wailed. Dozens of family members and
neighbors had gathered to mourn with the boy's parents.
	   Adding to the situation were fears by Israel of retaliatory
attacks from Islamic militants just as the country prepared for the
Jewish holiday season. Israeli radios said Israel would enforce a
tight closure on its internal borders, barring all Palestinians
from entering its cities.
	   And Israel's Channel 2 TV said security forces had unprecedented
warnings of plans by Palestinian militants to kidnap Israeli
soldiers, possibly as bargaining chips for the bodies Israel holds
of two Hamas fugitives killed in their West Bank hideout last week.
	   U.S. mediator Dennis Ross was scheduled to leave the region
Friday and it seemed increasingly unlikely that he would be able to
arrange a three-way summit in New York next week with Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to wrap up such a deal.
	   The three leaders will be in New York for the U.N. General
Assembly. However, it was U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright who would likely hold separate talks with Arafat and
Netanyahu.
	   Despite the lack of progress, Albright sounded upbeat at a
speech in Washington. ``We are very hopeful we will be able to move
toward an agreement,'' she said, adding that she planned meetings
with both leaders.
	   Meanwhile, Palestinian officials condemned Israeli plans to
expand in tenfold a Jewish settlement on disputed West Bank land.
	   Netanyahu told the Yediot Ahronot daily that plans to build 600
new homes in Yitzhar, where two residents were killed last month in
a drive-by shooting by Palestinian militants, was his response ``to
terrorist perpetrators.''
	   The United States has urged Israel to halt settlement expansion
on land which the Palestinians want for a hoped-for state.
	   ``This expansion policy is the bomb that will explode all the
efforts to put the peace process back on track,'' said Ahmed Abdel
Rahman, the secretary-general of the Palestinian Cabinet.
	   The Yediot Ahronot daily said Israel would confiscate land from
four Palestinian villages for the new construction.
	   But Peter Lerner, a spokesman for Israel's military government
in the West Bank, said no private Palestinian land would be
expropriated for the construction.

Russia's most visible commercial bank falls fast into limbo

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In the universe of Russian banks, SBS-Agro stood
out for all the services it offered from its branch inside the
parliament building and those in crumbling towns far from Moscow's
glitter.
	   Today, SBS-Agro, the country's second biggest savings bank, is
about dlrs 2 billion in debt. And customer service amounts to icy
exchanges such as those clogging a hotline the Komsomolskaya Pravda
daily set up recently between depositors who can't get their money
and SBS-Agro chief Alexander Smolensky.
	   ``I understand, you're not disturbed that I'm left with no work
and I need money. But then, I'm not disturbed by your problems,''
fumed a caller who identified herself as Natalia Valentinovna. ``We
have a contract _ kindly fulfill it!''
	   ``You're absolutely right. There's a judicial solution. File a
suit,'' Smolensky responded, according to the paper's transcript.
Few callers would be led down that path; for average Russians, the
possibility of successfully going to court are nil.
	   SBS-Agro is among hundreds of commercial banks brought to the
brink of bankruptcy last month in Russia's deepest financial crisis
since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Most have been powerless to
cope: Undercapitalized and under-regulated, they've also been
under-managed.
	   Even in the strongest banks, managers had just five to seven
years' experience, noted Neil Parison, the Moscow representative of
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
	   It's been a bruising fall for a bank that was a pioneer in
providing services customers wanted. In a country where people
still don't have checkbooks and most transactions are cash,
SBS-Agro was the first private bank to offer accounts to
individuals _ and it won the confidence of 5.7 million people.
	   It also was the first to issue a large number of debit cards and
develop a wide network of cash machines.
	   And it was one of the few banks that made loans to companies
that weren't part of its owner's business empire. Most Russian
banks were formed by large financial groups to funnel money into
their other business activities.
	   ``Banking was its business,'' said Charles Ryan, CEO of Moscow's
United Financial Group, an investment bank.
	   Today, SBS-Agro is in a standoff with Russia's Central Bank. The
Central Bank imposed temporary administration over SBS-Agro and
called for it to be nationalized, suspecting it of stripping assets
to avoid punitive lawsuits and the confiscation of its property.
	   SBS-Agro won't let auditors in the door and even got an
injunction from a regional court. Bank spokesman Eduard Krasnyansky
said the asset-stripping allegation was absurd.
	   ``We have enough assets to pay our debts three or four times
over,'' Krasnyansky told The Associated Press. He said the Central
Bank's campaign to nationalize the bank stemmed from SBS-Agro's
being ``the sweetest morsel'' in the banking system.
	   Meanwhile, SBS-Agro customers, who fear the bank could go under
at any time, are trying to recoup their savings. According to the
Kommersant Dengi weekly, they'd squirreled away more than dlrs 500
million as well as 2.6 billion rubles (worth dlrs 419 million in
mid-August, now dlrs 325 million).
	   SBS-Agro reluctantly has agreed to a plan to transfer those
accounts to the state savings bank, where deposits are guaranteed.
But the rate offered those holding dollar deposits is 9.3 rubles to
the dollar, lower than it will be once the transfers take place.
Friday's official exchange rate, for example, is 14.6 rubles to the
dollar.
	   Smolensky refuses to let the bank be nationalized without a
fight, calling SBS-Agro ``one of the giants on which the whole
Russian banking system is built.''
	   Smolensky, a former manager at a Soviet state construction
company, founded Stolichny Bank in 1989. Stolichny acquired the
giant state Agroprombank in 1996, immediately resulting in the
largest network of branches in the country after the state savings
bank. But it also inherited large debts in the poorly performing
agricultural sector and backward technology; Agroprombank clerks
still were using abacuses.
	   So, SBS-Agro began a capital-intensive drive to bring its
1,200-branch network into the modern age.
	   ``This crisis came at the worst possible time for them. SBS was
not intrinsically more unsound'' than other banks, said Juliet
Johnson, an expert on the Russian banking system and a visiting
assistant professor at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire.
	   Beginning in 1993, Russia's chronically cash-starved government
bought up credit at interest rates far higher than it could afford.
So, when the government defaulted on its credit payments on Aug.
17, it left banks such as SBS-Agro in a bind. Those banks had
borrowed heavily outside Russia to enable them to finance Russia's
state debt.
	   And the banks _ buffeted by a drop in global oil prices and the
Asian economic crisis _ already were in deep trouble.
	   SBS-Agro has dlrs 1 billion locked up in loans to 61 Russian
regions, Krasnyansky said, and Kommersant Dengi reported it owes
dlrs 1 billion to Western banks. On the other side of the ledger,
Smolensky says, are more than 150,000 loans.
	   ``We're told to cut off our credit portfolio,'' Smolensky
complained to the Kommersant daily. ``How are we supposed to do
that? If we have, say, loans out to a farmer, are we supposed to
take away his combine?''
	   Smolensky has given frantic depositors a ``101 percent
guarantee'' that the bank won't be closed. The question he can't
answer is whether SBS-Agro will emerge from the current turmoil as
anything resembling the onetime flagship of Russia's commercial
savings banks.

Hundreds of flood victims flee small town in southern Mexico
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAPASTEPEC, Mexico (AP) _ Jostling and elbowing one another,
survivors of floods that devastated this small town in southern
Chiapas state crowded around military helicopters Thursday trying
to flee.
	   About 400 men, women and children have been leaving in army and
navy choppers every day for nearly a week in this farm community of
about 10,000. Most have left with only the clothes on their backs.
	   One of them was Juan Manuel Villafuerte Figuero, 38, a
small-scale farmer waiting with his wife and three children in the
Mapastepec soccer field, where the helicopters were landing.
	   ``We're leaving because we were left without a home, without
land. We have nothing to eat, nowhere to live,'' he said.
	   ``We'll look for relatives in other cities _ for now. Later, we
hope the government will help us, even with a few sheets of
corrugated metal to build a roof.''
	   Chiapas has been devastated by three tropical depressions and a
tropical storm that drenched the state over the past 10 days.
Rivers overflowed their banks and gulches that had been dry for
years turned into roaring torrents.
	   By government count as of Thursday, 119 bodies have been
recovered from the floods, another 554 people have been listed as
missing. But, authorities said, the toll may be much higher, since
scores of communities are isolated. About 450,000 people have been
left homeless.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo traveled for the fourth time since the
disaster hit to Tapachula, 100 miles (160 kilometers) southeast of
here on the Guatemalan border, where relief efforts are
concentrated. He said he wanted to get better damage estimates and
coordinate help.
	   Experts accompanying him said 250,000 people will probably have
to relocate from their lowland houses, and the government may have
to build as many as 25,000 low-cost homes soon.
	   Aid has been pouring in from all over the country, through the
Red Cross and other rescue agencies. But Chiapas authorities are
having a hard time distributing it because of flooded roads,
wrecked bridges and bad weather.
	   On Thursday, all 500 members of the Chamber of Deputies _
Mexico's House of Representatives _ voted to donate a day's pay,
equivalent to about dlrs 160, to help the state.
	   The Treasury Department also earmarked dlrs 200 million, or
about half the Federal Disaster Emergency Fund, for reconstruction.
	   It stopped raining overnight, but the forecast was for more
heavy storms in the area.
	   About 30 helicopter flights were landing every day in the
Mapastepec soccer field, bringing about 30 tons of food, medicine,
drinking water, clothing and blankets and evacuating between 15 and
24 refugees, depending on the size of the aircraft.
	   The disaster hit Mapastepec full-force Sept. 8, when the already
swollen Novillero River overflowed its banks and joined waters with
half a dozen roaring streams nearby. Floods swept over half the
town.
	   Of those staying behind, about 800 people go every day or spend
the night in the town auditorium, which has been turned into a
military-run shelter. Army cooks in a makeshift kitchen dole out
skimpy rations of food, often nothing more than beans, tortillas,
toasted bread and coffee.
	   Children get only powdered milk.
	   Most of the refugees spend their nights on the auditorium's
cement floor. A few have slung hammocks from handrails.
	   Outbreaks of conjunctivitis _ an eyelid infection also called
``pink eye'' _ and some cases of cholera have been reported in
other devastated areas. But so far, a small team of military
doctors have found none here.
	   Esperanza Avendano and her eight children are among the refugees
at the auditorium. Their house and everything else was swept away,
and Avendano waited her turn for rations.
	   ``We have nothing, nothing to eat,'' she said.

Jospin meets with Saudi Crown Prince
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, hosting a
dinner in honor of Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, said
Thursday he hoped his visit would inspire new talks aimed at
getting the Middle East peace process back on track.
	   ``Your presence in Paris is an occasion for France and Saudi
Arabia to pursue at the highest level consultations made all the
more necessary by the urgent and serious current situation in the
Middle East,'' Jospin said during a toast at the French Foreign
Ministry.
	   Jospin, who also met earlier in the day with Abdullah, said both
countries wanted ``the establishment of a fair and durable peace in
the Middle East allowing all countries to live within secure and
recognized borders.''
	   He added that it must also allow Palestinians ``to exercise
their legitimate rights, including having a state of their own.''
	   Abdullah arrived in Paris on Wednesday after a visit to London.
On Sept. 19, he is scheduled to leave for the United States.
	   His trip is aimed at discussing the peace process, regional
security issues, and business.
	   France and Egypt have outlined plans to set up an international
conference to discuss the stalled Middle East peace process, but no
date has yet been suggested.
	   French, British and American forces are stationed in Saudi
Arabia to help patrol a ``no-fly'' zone over southern Iraq that was
set up after the 1991 Gulf War to protect Shiite Muslims from the
Iraqi regime.
	   Since Saudi King Fahd suffered a stroke in 1995, Abdullah has
been running the country's day-to-day affairs.

 &UR; By BRUCE MEYERSON &QC;

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ U.S. stocks plunged Thursday after investors in
Asia and Europe pushed markets lower on Alan Greenspan's denial
that world finance leaders had agreed to cut interest rates.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled as much as 235.06 in
the morning, and only recovered a little of the lost ground. It
closed down 216.01 at 7,873.77, leaving it back below where it
began the year, at 7,908.25. Broader indicators also fell sharply
in active trading that was below Wednesday's heavy volume.
	   The Dow's drop of 2.7 percent followed a 2.4 percent fall in
Tokyo's main index to a 12-year low. In Europe, major indicators
closed down 5.5 percent in Paris, 3 percent in London and 3.9
percent in Frankfurt, Germany. In Sao Paulo, Brazil, Latin
America's largest market, the leading index was off 4.8 percent,
above its lows for the day.
	   The global flight from stocks sent money flowing into U.S.
Treasury bonds, a traditional haven in times of uncertainty. Yields
on 30-year Treasury bonds, which move in the opposite direction of
prices, fell closer toward 5 percent, a level that has never been
reached since the government began regular sales of such bonds in
1977.

Fistfight breaks out in South Africa's parliament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN (AP) _ A lawmaker from the ruling African National
Congress slugged an opposition lawmaker Thursday on the floor of
parliament.
	   Although tensions remain high between the ANC, which won power
in South Africa's first all-race did not appear to be racially
motivated, according to the South African Press Association.
	   It started when a lawmaker from the National Party asserted that
he had been denied a chance to speak on a motion about
nongovernmental organizations. The lawmaker's identity was not
available.
	   ANC lawmaker Johnny de Lange accused the lawmaker of lying,
prompting National Party lawmaker Manie Schoeman to shove de Lange.
De Lange then floored Schoeman with a blow to the jaw, according to
the news agency.
	   Other members of parliament separated the combatants.
	   No other details were available.
	   Disheveled lawmakers jostled each other as they left the
chamber.
	   It was the first time in memory that a debate had come to blows
in parliament.
	   House Speaker Frene Ginwala demanded that everyone involved
appear in her office Friday morning to explain the altercation.

Corruption undermines countries, discourages investments, report
</HEADLINE>
says &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Bribery and corruption threaten developing
countries, destabilize governments and discourage badly needed
investments, a U.N. report said Thursday.
	   ``When corruption is associated with organized crimes,
legitimate business and private sector development are discouraged
and a government's political legitimacy is compromised,'' the U.N.
Development Program said.
	   The report, drawn from case studies, was prepared by the UNDP
and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. It
is aimed at creating global and national strategies that can be
used to fight corruption.
	   ``Corruption really attacks the very root of political
legitimacy. It also negatively affects the perception in terms of
foreign investments'', said G. Shabbir Cheema, director of the
UNDP's management development and governance division.
	   There are no precise estimates on the amount of hard currency
diverted by corruption, the UNDP said.
	   The report also listed successful anti-corruption programs and
gave information on the latest policies followed by OECD members to
control corruption in their own countries.
	   As examples of how it is working to fight corruption, the UNDP
pointed out that in Pakistan, the UNDP produced a learning guide
and study course for U.N. staff to train Pakistanis to spot and
deter corruption.
	   In the Philippines, the UNDP said is collaborating with the
Center for Investigative Journalism to strengthen the effectiveness
of journalism as a tool for deterring and exposing corruption.
	   The OECD, which has 28 members including the United States,
Britain, Germany, France and Japan, is aimed at helping its member
countries develop their economy and trade.

	   ROME (AP) _ Midfielder Philippe Douglas volleyed home a
second-half equalizer to give Swiss club Lausanne a 1-1 draw in a
Cup Winners Cup first round, first leg game at Lazio of Rome, which
played with 10 men almost from the start.
	   Lazio saw Yugoslav midfielder Dejan Stankovic sent off after two
minutes for a hand ball in the goalmouth, but 'keeper Luca
Marchegiani dove to his right to slap away the ensuing penalty kick
by Lausanne striker Fabio Celestini.
	   The visitors dominated the early action before about 15,000
spectators at Olympic Stadium, and wasted another golden chance
when unmarked Slovenian striker Saso Udovic sent a firm header off
the left post in the 29th minute.
	   Lazio settled down and managed to take the lead in the 37th on
Czech midfielder Pavel Nedved's header, off a pinpoint assist from
Chilean striker Marcelo Salas.
	   Douglas then fixed the final score in the 54th, running on to
direct in a cross from 5 meters (yards) out.

leg of the Cup Winners Cup.
	   French international Frank Leboeuf put Chelsea ahead 1-0 in the
43rd minute on a free kick from 18 meters (yards) that hugged the
ground through a maze of players and went in off the left hand of
Helsingborgs' goalkeeper Sven Andersson.
	   Chelsea dominated most of the match but had trouble breaking
trough the defense-oriented Swedes. The one-goal cushion will be an
uncomfortable one when the English side visits the southern Swedish
city in two weeks for the second leg.
	   Helsingborgs _ fourth in the Swedish league with seven matches
remaining _ knocked English club Aston Villa out of the UEFA Cup
two years ago.
	   Chelsea's Norwegian forward Tore Andre Flo went off in the 54th
minute after a hand injury when he fell near the goal. Early
reports said he dislocated two fingers.

	   NEWCASTLE, England (AP) _ Newcastle defeated Yugoslavia's
Partizan 2-1 in the first round, first leg of the Cup Winners Cup
Thursday on a late goal by Greek Nikolas Dabizas.
	   England international Alan Shearer scored in the 12th minute as
Ruud Gullit's team took a 1-0 lead. Shearer, on Newcastle's only
opportunity from open play in the half, took a defense-splitting
pass from Stuart Pearce and hammered the ball into the goal off the
left hand of Partizan goalkeeper Nikola Damjanac.
	   Vuk Rasovic scored for Partizan on a penalty in the 69th minute
after Newcastle's Laurent Charvet was called for a challenge in the
area.
	   But Dabizas got the winning goal in the 71st on a looping
header.

	   EL SAUZAL, Mexico (AP) _ Gunmen apparently sent by a drug lord
yanked three families from their beds before dawn Thursday, lined
them up against a wall and killed at least 19 men, women and
children near a popular Baja California resort.
	   At least one man was seriously wounded. Police have a witness in
protective custody, a 15-year-old girl who hid under a bed during
the slaughter, The Associated Press has learned.
	   The attorney general of Baja California state, Marco Antonio de
la Fuente Virrarreal, said the head of one of the households grew
marijuana for the Arellano Felix drug-smuggling gang, the
government news agency Notimex reported.
	   He said the man, Fermin Castro, oversaw the Arellano Felix's
marijuana plantations nearby. Castro wasn't killed in the attack,
but was in very serious condition with a bullet wound to the head,
health officials said.
	   Police said the attack took place at 4:30 a.m. in El Sauzal, a
suburb of the resort town of Ensenada, a popular beach destination
for Californians that's only a 1 1/2-hour drive from San Diego.
	   The victims appeared to be asleep when the gunmen showed up;
most of the bodies were wearing pajamas _ or nothing at all _ and
the beds in at least one of the houses were unmade, as if sleeping
people had been pulled from them.
	   Television images showed the victims lined up in a pool of blood
in front of a wall. A television reporter said one woman was
clutching a baby in her arms; both were dead.
	   The director of the Red Cross in Ensenada, Eugenio Carrillo,
said the victims were the residents of three neighboring houses. He
said the dead included nine adults, two teen-agers, six children
and a baby.
	   A 15-year-old girl hid under a bed and escaped notice by the
attackers, and police were questioning her about what she saw, a
judicial police officer told the AP on condition of anonymity. He
did not elaborate and the report could not be confirmed
independently.
	   Children's toys littered the yard outside one house, according
to the television footage. The yard was filled with broken glass
and chairs were overturned on the porch, indicating a struggle.
Turkeys cackled in the yard.
	   Dozens of bullet casings surrounded the bodies, and the Televisa
television network said most were from a Kalashnikov assault
weapon, although some were from smaller-caliber weapons and
shotguns.
	   Ensenada Judicial Police officer Jose Ramon Espinoza said the
victims were members of three families: the Flores family and two
families that both had the last name Castro. It was unclear whether
the three families were related.
	   ``It appears they rounded them all up, lined them up and gunned
them down,'' Espinoza said. He said he had no information on
suspects or a possible motive.
	   The drug gang led by the Arellano Felix brothers is based in
Tijuana, 60 miles (100 kilometers) to the north.
	   The brothers, once known for the violence with which they
controlled their territory, had recently been settling into a
quieter, more businesslike style after making themselves famous for
shootouts in broad daylight.
	   But Mexican authorities suspect the Arellano Felix brothers were
behind the slaying of a rival last week in Ciudad Juarez, just
across the border from El Paso, Texas.
	   Rafael Munoz Talavera, considered a front-runner to succeed
deceased Juarez cartel leader Amado Carrillo Fuentes, was found
shot to death in the back seat of an armored Jeep Cherokee.
	   Analysts said the killing might signal a shift back to the
violence of the past.

Ruling party, opposition still deadlocked over bank bills

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ After marathon meetings that went straight through
the night, the opposition on Friday rejected a compromise proposed
by the ruling party on key banking reform bills.
	   Talks were temporarily called off after 5 a.m. (2000 GMT
Thursday), with both sides agreeing to resume negotiations later
Friday.
	   ``If this is all they have, forget it,'' Kansei Nakano, deputy
head of the opposition Democratic Party, told reporters after a
series of talks over proposals and counter-proposals that began
Thursday. ``We're done for tonight.''
	   For weeks, the governing Liberal Democratic Party has been
trying to pass legislation to begin cleaning up the massive bad
loans leftover from the excessive lending of the 1980s ``bubble''
era.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi is anxious to get an
agreement on the bills before his summit with U.S. President Bill
Clinton next Tuesday.
	   Washington has prodded Tokyo to act more quickly to fix the bad
loan problem.
	   And the impasse over the bills _ although not unusual in
Japanese politics _ has set off fears that Japan will not be able
to pull itself out of its worst recession in 50 years.
	   A deepening recession in the world's second largest economy is a
threat to the entire global economy.
	   The main sticking point has been the governing party's
controversial plan to use taxpayer money to bail out the
cash-strapped Long-Term Credit Bank, one of the nation's largest
banks.
	   The opposition can stall the passage of bills because the ruling
party lacks a majority in the upper house of Parliament.
	   Another area that the two sides fail to agree is a new committee
that will oversee the banking clean-up.
	   The opposition wants the committee to take over the Finance
Ministry's power to set policy for the financial industry. The
ruling party has resisted such a drastic reduction of the
ministry's powers.
	   On Thursday, both sides had said they were close to an
agreement.
	   The ruling party was bending to opposition demands on nearly
every issue of contention, Japanese media reports said. But after
the overnight talks, it was unclear when an agreement might happen.
	   The pillar of the ruling party's bill is the creation of a
``bridge bank'' that would use public funds to take over insolvent
banks and run them until they are healthy enough to be sold back to
the private sector.

Crash investigators say undersea fragments may hold key clues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ The quest to explain why Swissair
Flight 111 crashed into the North Atlantic may hinge on small bits
of high-tech debris scattered across the ocean floor, investigators
said Thursday.
	   The chief crash investigator, Vic Gerden, confirmed that
searchers no longer believe there are large, mostly intact sections
of the fuselage on the seabed.
	   He also said investigators doubt they can solve the mystery of
the Sept. 2 crash solely through information from the plane's
flight data and cockpit voice recorders. Both stopped six minutes
before the plane smashed into the ocean, killing all 229 people on
board.
	   Gerden said the two recorders will provide useful clues, but
suggested the answer to why smoke began filling the cockpit may lie
in some of the sophisticated electrical equipment being sought by
divers amidst the jagged undersea wreckage.
	   Two of the plane's three engines also have been sighted, Gerden
said, and may provide additional clues about the apparent power
failure aboard the plane.
	   ``It's a very, very difficult process _ time consuming and
potentially hazardous if not done right,'' Gerden said. ``It's
definitely a challenge.
	   He said the main debris field is about 70 yards (meters) by 30
yards (meters), strewn with small pieces of debris. The wreckage is
jumbled, he said _ a piece from the plane's nose might be found
near a piece from the tail.
	   ``The size of the pieces would indicate the violence of the
initial impact,'' Gerden said.
	   A Canadian navy officer involved in the search and recovery
operation, Capt. Phil Webster, explained that the shapes detected
by sonar that initially were thought to be the fuselage turned out
to be piles of jumbled rubble from the plane.
	   The pilots reported smoke in the cockpit about an hour into the
flight from New York to Geneva, and the plane crashed 16 minutes
later.
	   Gerden revealed new information Thursday from the cockpit voice
recorder _ that the pilots spoke to each other about detecting an
abnormal smell in the cockpit three minutes before their first
distress call to air traffic controllers.
	   One of the toughest tasks in the aftermath of the crash has been
the identification of human remains.
	   Because the remains were so badly fragmented, the main hope for
most identifications lies with matching DNA samples from the
victims with DNA samples provided by victims' families.
	   Police said Thursday they have now established DNA fingerprints
for 142 people aboard the flight, and hope to match those with
samples received thus far from 80 families.

	   BEITUNIA, West Bank (AP) _ Tensions between Israel and the
Palestinians soared Thursday with a Palestinian teen-ager's
shooting death, apparently by Israelis who opened fire from a car
on high school students heading home from class.
	   The attack, coupled with an announcement by Israel to expand a
Jewish settlement, came while Israel was on high alert, bracing for
possible attacks by militants before the Jewish holiday season.
	   The incident also occurred as President Bill Clinton's peace
envoy wrapped up an unsuccessful effort to complete a deal to end
months of stalemate between the two sides over a long overdue
Israeli troop withdrawal.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat called the shooting ``another
crime as part of the continued conspiracy by the settlers against
our people.''
	   The fatal shooting happened in the West Bank village of
Beitunia, and police said they were questioning an Israeli suspect.
	   ``A 35-year-old male from a Jewish settlement in the area turned
himself into the police. ... He is being held for questioning,''
Israeli police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said.
	   The shooting took place around noon when about 12 Palestinian
high school students were walking along the village's main road on
their way back from school.
	   A car with Israeli license plates pulled up next to them, the
passengers rolled down their windows and started shooting from a
pistol and an assault rifle, said one of the students, Raed Abdel
Rahman. ``Everybody started to jump and take cover,'' he said.
	   Two of the teen-agers were wounded in the stomach and taken to
nearby Ramallah Hospital, where 17-year-old Iyad Hashem later died.
The second boy was in stable condition.
	   In the past, Israelis driving in the West Bank have opened fire
to repulse Palestinian stone-throwers on rocky hilltops.
	   But Abdel Rahman insisted that the teen-agers had not stoned the
Israeli car before the shooting and that the gunfire occurred
without provocation.
	   At the Hashem family's modest apartment, his mother sat on the
living room floor in a house robe and sobbed, slapping her legs in
disbelief. ``My beloved, you didn't come home with your school
books today!'' Mrs. Hashem wailed. Dozens of family members and
neighbors had gathered to mourn with the boy's parents.
	   Palestinian officials had wanted to hold Hashem's funeral late
Thursday, in keeping with swift Muslim burial, and perhaps in an
effort to avoid violent protests, which rarely happen at night.
However, the boy's family insisted on holding the funeral Friday
afternoon, increasing the risk of rioting during the day.
	   Adding to the situation were fears by Israel of retaliatory
attacks from Islamic militants just as the country prepared for the
Jewish holiday season. Israeli radios said Israel would enforce a
tight closure on its internal borders, barring all Palestinians
from entering its cities.
	   U.S. mediator Dennis Ross was scheduled to leave the region
Friday and it seemed increasingly unlikely that he would be able to
arrange a three-way summit in New York next week with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
to wrap up such a deal.
	   The three leaders will be in New York for the U.N. General
Assembly. An Israeli Foreign Ministry official said it was more
likely that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would hold
separate talks with Arafat and Netanyahu. And Arafat said he would
only meet Netanyahu, if Israel accepts the terms for a U.S. peace
initiative.
	   Despite the lack of progress, Albright sounded upbeat at a
speech in Washington. ``We are very hopeful we will be able to move
toward an agreement,'' she said.

Annan proposes Ogata's term be extended for two years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan recommended
Thursday extending for two years the term of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees, whose agency has been accused recently
of losing millions of dollars because of mismanagement.
	   While Sadako Ogata emerged relatively unscathed from the
allegations, she has said she didn't want to be considered for the
five-year term when the post comes up for re-election in December.
She said in July, however, that she was prepared to serve a shorter
term.
	   In his proposal to the General Assembly, Annan requested Ogata
remain on the job through Dec. 31, 2000. He noted ``her
distinguished contribution to the United Nations and her
preference, for personal reasons, not to serve another full term.''
	   It was unclear when the assembly would take up the proposal.
	   Ogata, 71, has headed the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
since 1991.
	   The London-based Financial Times in July reported incompetent
management, dubious accounting and possibly fraud were costing the
UNHCR millions of dollars after an independent audit.
	   At the time, Annan expressed support for Ogata.
	   Since then, the agency identified and said it will address
numerous shortcomings in its management and operations in Guinea
and other West African countries. In Guinea, financial problems
were found in the agency's dealings with its local partner
organizations.
	   The UNHCR has a dlrs 1 billion annual budget.

Often-shunned Algeria praises relations with Italy, faults Catholic

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's increasing efforts to reach out to isolated
regimes in the Islamic world won it praise Thursday from Algeria's
foreign minister _ although he accused a Rome-based Catholic
mediating group of interfering in his country's affairs.
	   Ahmed Attaf's harsh words for the Community of Sant' Egidio were
his only criticism offered on an RAI television program on
relations between Italy and his nation's often-shunned military
regime.
	   The same program also drew Italian Premier Romano Prodi, who has
led a push to improve Western relations with countries under U.S.
or U.N. embargo for suspected links to terrorism _ Iran and Libya _
and those simply criticized, like Algeria.
	   ``Islam (in itself) is not linked to terrorism,'' Prodi said.
	   Algeria's Islamic regime has been widely accused of atrocities
in its fight against a 6-year-old Islamic insurgency. Algeria has
resisted foreign attempts to mediate in the conflict, which has
killed an estimated 75,000 people, mostly civilians.
	   The Community of Sant' Egidio in recent years has been one of
those trying to bring Algerian guerrillas and government officials
to the negotiating table, as it has done successfully in Albania,
Guatemala and Mozambique.
	   The group held talks in Rome that included Islamic hard-liners,
although members of the Armed Islamic Group, blamed for much of the
violence, were not included.
	   Thursday, the Algeria foreign minister pointedly spoke of ``the
meddling of Sant' Egidio.''
	   Sant' Egidio officials did not immediately return a call for
comment Thursday night.
	   Prodi spoke of the importance of keeping open relations with
Algeria, saying Italy _ geographically and otherwise _ was by
rights an important figure in the Mediterranean.
	   In July, Prodi became the first European Union leader to travel
to Iran for talks since 1992. The same month, Italy and Libya
signed an accord on terrorism, human rights and weapons
proliferation.
	   Italy depends on Algeria and Libya for much of its energy;
Thursday's program also featured the managing director of
state-owned ENI, Franco Bernabe, speaking from an Algerian oil
field.

	   PARIS (AP) - Israel's Maccabi Haifa pulled off one of the
biggest shocks in the first round, first leg of the Cup Winners Cup
Thursday scoring an 87th minute goal to snatch a 1-1 draw at Paris
Saint-Germain.
	   PSG, which has spent heavily under new manager Alain Giresse,
was in total domination of the match from the start but couldn't
break through the visitor's defense until the 84th minute when
Bruno Carroti was fouled in the penalty area.
	   Captain Marco Simone converted the penalty.
	   But PSG's relief soon turned to despair when a defensive lapse
allowed Yossi Benayoun to beat goalkeeper Bernard Lama from close
range.
	   Igor Yanovski, Nicolas Oudec and Patrice Loko all missed good
chances for the French cup winners.

Europe vs. U.S. in Solheim Cup

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ohio (AP) _ Patriotism and pressure.
	   The Solheim Cup, the women's version of the Ryder Cup, begins
Friday. And finding the right combinations for the 12-player teams
has been tricky stuff for the captains of the U.S. and European
squads.
	   ``I tried to go with eight players that I thought complemented
each other and that I thought could take the heat,'' U.S. captain
Judy Rankin said Thursday after the foursomes for alternate-shot
pairings for Friday morning were announced.
	   The pressure is such in the biennial trans-Atlantic team
match-play competition that both sides have tried to offset
inexperience with experience and to pair players who have
previously played together.
	   ``I wanted a lot of our players who have been around a long time
and feel more comfortable,'' said European captain Pia Nilsson.
	   Two of the four U.S. groups played together in last December's
Diners Club Matches, with Juli Inkster and Dottie Pepper winning
that event.
	   Donna Andrews and Tammie Green, who is six months pregnant and
will have her obstetrician follow her around the course, also were
teamed at the Diners Club and will again swap shots at Muirfield
Village Golf Club.
	   ``It's when you're most aware that you are playing partnership
golf,'' Rankin said of the alternate-shot format of foursomes.
``There is someone relying on what you do in a different way than
the way you play professional golf all year long.''
	   There is also the matter of matching players by temperament and
playing style.
	   Meg Mallon and Brandie Burton, in the second pairing, have been
teammates on the last four U.S. Solheim teams. Kelly Robbins and
Solheim rookie Pat Hurst make up the fourth American pairing.
	   The four European pairings have a combined foursomes record of
13-11-2 in Solheim play, while the U.S. players are 6-7-3.
	   The all-England grouping of Laura Davies and Trish Johnson, who
have been together on each of the five Solheim teams, will play in
the first group opposite Pepper and Inkster.
	   Even with a 3-1 record in foursomes, Davies said she still gets
nervous.
	   ``That's what makes it fun,'' she said. ``You're scared of
losing the point for the team and scared of messing up. That's the
thing that gets you going. That fear inspires you to play better.''
	   Johnson will play despite a neck problem that has limited her
practice time. Nilsson called team alternate Maria Hjorth on
Tuesday and asked that she fly in. But Johnson said that despite
some stiffness Thursday she was ready to play.
	   The rest of the Europe groupings have a Swede in each pairing:
Helen Alfredsson with Alison Nicholas, Liselotte Neumann with Lisa
Hackney and Annika Sorenstam with Catriona Matthew. Alfredsson and
Nicholas were paired at last year's Solheim _ halving their
four-ball match _ and also played together at the Diners Club.
	   Sorenstam, the No. 1 player in the world rankings, was a natural
to be paired with Matthew, a Scot who playing in her first Solheim.
Matthew is a rising star on the European LPGA Tour but has never
finished in the top 10 in her 22 tournaments on American soil.
	   Sorenstam said after two years of playing for themselves the
pros get to become patriotic for a weekend.
	   ``That's what makes it so special. I have as many friends on the
U.S. team as I do on the European. For some reason, you come here
and you just turn very yellow and blue,'' she said, referring to
the European team colors.
	   Nilsson held her other two Solheim rookies _ Sorenstam's younger
sister Charlotta and Sophie Gustafson _ out of the foursomes along
with France's Marie Laure De Lorenzi and four-time Solheim veteran
Catrin Nilsmark.
	   Sitting out the foursomes for the U.S. are Solheim rookie Chris
Johnson, Sherri Steinhauer, Rose Jones and Hall of Famer Betsy
King.
	   In the afternoon, the captains will submit new pairings for the
four-ball or best-ball matches. The same format follows on
Saturday, with 12 singles matches Sunday.
	   Each match is worth a point, with 28 points available. The U.S.
team can retain the cup if it wins at least half the points.
	   The Americans have won three of the previous four matches, but
the Europeans boast four of the top five players in the world
rankings. Neumann is No. 3, Alfredsson No. 4 and Davies No. 5. No.
2 Karrie Webb ineligible because she is from Australia.

Holder Chelsea wins; Lazio, Paris Saint-Germain get poor draws
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Chelsea opened defense of its Cup Winners Cup with
a narrow 1-0 victory Thursday over Sweden's Helsingborgs, one of 16
matches in the first leg, first round.
	   But two European powers, Lazio and Paris Saint-Germain, had to
settle for disappointing home draws while England's Newcastle got
off to a 2-1 victory over Yugoslavia's Partizan.
	   In west London, French World Cup star Frank Leboeuf got the
winner in the 43rd on a free kick from 18 meters (yards) that
hugged the ground through a maze of players and went in off the
left hand of Helsingborgs' goalkeeper Sven Andersson.
	   Chelsea dominated the match but had trouble breaking trough the
defense-oriented Swedes. The one-goal cushion will be an
uncomfortable one when the English side visits the southern Swedish
city in two weeks.
	   Helsingborgs _ fourth in the Swedish league with seven matches
remaining _ knocked English club Aston Villa out of the UEFA Cup
two years ago.
	   In Rome, midfielder Philippe Douglas volleyed home a second-half
equalizer to give Swiss club Lausanne a 1-1 draw at Lazio, which
played with 10 men almost from the start.
	   Lazio _ the UEFA Cup finalists last season _ saw Yugoslav
midfielder Dejan Stankovic sent off after two minutes for a hand
ball in the goalmouth, but 'keeper Luca Marchegiani dived to his
right to slap away the ensuing penalty kick by Lausanne striker
Fabio Celestini.
	   The visitors dominated the early play and wasted another chance
when unmarked Slovenian striker Saso Udovic sent a firm header off
the left post in the 29th minute.
	   Lazio took the lead in the 37th on Czech midfielder Pavel
Nedved's header, off a pinpoint assist from Chilean striker Marcelo
Salas. Douglas then got the tying goal in the 54th, running on to
direct in a cross from 5 meters (yards) out.
	   In Paris, Israel's Maccabi Haifa pulled off a big shock,
snatching a 1-1 draw at Paris Saint-Germain.
	   PSG, which has spent heavily under new manager Alain Giresse,
dominated the match from the start but couldn't break through the
visitor's defense until the 84th minute when Bruno Carroti was
fouled in the penalty area and Marco Simone converted.
	   But PSG's relief soon turned to despair when a defensive lapse
allowed Yossi Benayoun to beat goalkeeper Bernard Lama from close
range in the 88th for the tying goal.
	   In Newcastle, England, Newcastle stopped Yugoslavia's Partizan
2-1 on a header in the 71st by Greek Nikolas Dabizas.
	   England international Alan Shearer scored in the 12th minute as
Ruud Gullit's team took a 1-0 lead. Shearer, on Newcastle's only
opportunity from open play in the half, took a defense-splitting
pass from Stuart Pearce and hammered the ball into the goal off the
left hand of Partizan goalkeeper Nikola Damjanac.
	   Vuk Rasovic scored for Partizan on a penalty in the 69th after
Newcastle's Laurent Charvet was called for a challenge in the area.
	   In Bucharest, Romania, Rapid Bucharest and Valerenga of Norway
drew 2-2 as Marius Sumulica and Zeno Bundea scored for the
Romanians and John Carew scored twice for Valerenga.
	   In Athens, Panionios defeated Finland's Haka 2-0 on goals by
Garry Haylock 35th and Mark Gordon.
	   In Ljubljana, Slovenia, Croatian side Varteks Varazdin defeated
Rudar Velenje of Slovenia 1-0 on a late goal by Paul Matas.
	   In Linz, Austria, SV Ried 2 defeated MTK Budapest 2-0 on goals
by Gerald Strafner and Ronald Brunmayr.
	   In Sofia, Bulgaria, Copenhagen defeated Bulgarian side Levski
2-0 with goals from Bjarne Goldbaek and Niclas Jensen.
	   In Kiev, Ukraine, Lokomotiv Moscow defeated CSKA of Ukraine 2-0
with Yevgeni Kharlachov and Zaza Dzhanashiya scoring.
	   In Heerenveen, Netherlands, Heerenveen won 3-1 over Amica Wronki
of Poland on goals by Jeffrey Talan, Dumitru Mitrita and Boudewijn
Pahlplatz. Amica Wronki got a goal from Grzegorz Krol.
	   In Istanbul, Besiktas won 3-0 over Solvak side Spartak Trnava on
goals by Mehmet Ozdilek, Oktay Derelioglu and Christoper Ohen.
	   In Duisburg, Germany, Duisburg and Genk of Belgium drew 1-1.
Marcus Wedau scored for the Germans and Juhn Reini got Genk's goal.
	   Other scores: Metalurgs 0, Braga 0; Apollon Limassol 2, Jabolnec
1; Hearts 0, Mallorca 1.

After cancer, Cullen fighting for spot on Lightning
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: repeating to some points &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FELDKIRCH, Austria (AP) _ John Cullen will return to the ice
Friday for the first time since winning a year-long fight with
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
	   Thoughts of his aggressive chemotherapy and bone-marrow
transplant will fade into the background for a couple of hours as
the 34-year-old center vies with younger, fitter players for his
old position on the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey
League.
	   The Lightning, along with the Buffalo Sabres, are using the
International Challenge tournament in Austria to kick off their
pre-season training.
	   On Tuesday, when the Lightning posted a convincing 4-1 win over
European champions Feldkirch, Cullen sat on the bench.
	   Tampa Bay coach Jacques Demers and General Manager Phil Esposito
promised Cullen, who hasn't played a game since March 1997, that
he'd get his chance during Friday's showcase final of the Challenge
Cup against the Sabres in Innsbruck.
	   ``It's been a long, tough ride, and just to be back on the ice
is incredible,'' said Cullen. ``This is my 12th training camp.
	   ``You wouldn't think a veteran would enjoy camp, but I really,
truly am.''
	   Just 18 months ago, playing hockey had become torture for
Cullen, who suddenly started having chest and throat pains, sore
teeth, and was finding it difficult just to skate the length of the
ice.
	   Assuming it was a chest infection, Cullen chose to ignore his
suffering, with his team three points out of the hunt for a playoff
berth.
	   Worried about her usually stoic husband's complaints, his wife
called team officials before a game against Hartford, and a large,
dark shadow on Cullen's chest X-ray was discovered.
	   Though a tumor was listed among the possible causes, Cullen said
he ``never for a second gave cancer any consideration.''
	   The next day, March 29, 1997, a CT scan and biopsy revealed the
presence of a grapefruit-sized tumor in his chest.
	   Despite six grueling months of chemotherapy and radiation
treatment, traces of the cancer still remained.
	   In October, Cullen underwent a painful procedure in which bone
marrow was drilled out of his lower back, ``purged'' or cleansed,
then reintroduced into his body.
	   Four days later, his heart stopped beating for almost a minute
before doctors were able to resuscitate him.
	   The aggressive treatment proved effective.
	   Six months ago, Cullen was told he's cancer-free, although he'll
have to undergo regular tests to make sure the disease stays in
remission.
	   ``My main motivation to get better was my wife, daughter and
family,'' said Cullen, who lost 40 pounds along with all his hair
during treatment. ``Hockey was another motivation, but not the main
one.''
	   The next five years, when the cancer is the most susceptible to
return, will be the toughest for Cullen.
	   ``When I get a cold, I think, `Oh my God, it's back,''' said
Cullen, who has since regained all his weight. ``I sometimes panic
a bit when I'm not feeling well. I call my doctor and he tells me
it's OK, I'm allowed to get colds, it's normal.
	   ``It'll never end. When you get cancer, you fight it for the
rest of your life, always worrying and wondering.''
	   For the moment, however, Cullen is worrying and wondering about
his first NHL game in a year and half.
	   ``When I told Phil (Esposito) about the tumor, he was very
upset, but I said, `Don't worry, I'll be back,''' said Cullen. ``He
must have thought I was crazy, but here I am.
	   ``It's going to be good to get out there and get banged around
again.''

	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Claiming victory in last
weekend's election, Bosnian Serb hard-liners warned Thursday of a
political crisis if international overseers try to deny them power.
	   The threats were issued one day after the leader of the Serb
Radical Party, Nikola Poplasen, said he defeated the U.S. favorite,
Biljana Plavsic, for president of the Serb-run Bosnian enclave,
Republika Srpska.
	   The streets of many Bosnian Serb towns swelled late Wednesday
with hundreds of flag-waving, cheering Poplasen supporters shouting
insults against Plavsic and her moderate government.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
ran the weekend election, has refused to release any results,
citing a complicated ballot, numerous contested posts and the need
for accuracy.
	   But Hanns Schumacher, a deputy to Carlos Westendorp, the top
international official in Bosnia, confirmed Thursday that Plavsic
was trailing, although he stressed that many absentee ballots
remain uncounted.
	   Nevertheless, Schumacher said preliminary results had shown
hard-liners faring better than the Americans and Europeans had
hoped.
	   Plavsic's defeat would be a severe setback for U.S. and European
efforts to promote politicians supportive of the 1995 Dayton peace
accords, which envisioned a unified Bosnian state where Bosnian
Serbs, Muslims and Croats could live in peace.
	   Poplasen is an ally of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic, barred from political life because he is under indictment
by an international tribunal in The Hague for war crimes during the
1992-95 Bosnian conflict.
	   Last month, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited
the country to give a personal boost to pro-Dayton candidates. On
Thursday, U.S. special envoy Robert Gelbard returned to Sarajevo
for what diplomatic sources termed ``consultations about the
elections.''
	   OSCE officials have denied holding up release of the returns in
an effort to manipulate the outcome.
	   ``The only results that will matter are the final results,''
declared Nicole Szulc, an OSCE spokeswoman in Sarajevo. Robert
Barry, head of the OSCE in Bosnia, said results probably will be
announced next Wednesday or Thursday _ at least 10 days after the
voting.
	   But the OSCE scheduled a meeting Friday in Sarajevo to weigh
whether to punish the Radicals for campaign violations. Sanctions
could include disqualifying Poplasen.
	   Dragan Cavic, a vice president of another hard-line party,
warned the OSCE against any move to disqualify candidates, saying
it could have ``bad implications.''
	   Cavic, of the Serb Democratic Party, said his side also had
filed complaints alleging electoral irregularities by moderates.
	   Even before the election, some analysts in the Serb-run half of
Bosnia predicted a strong showing for the nationalists at the
election, despite international efforts to boost Plavsic and her
coalition by supplying millions of dollars of economic aid.
	   Analysts believe that nationalist sentiment among Bosnian Serbs
has been rekindled because of the clashes in the Serbian province
of Kosovo against largely Muslim ethnic Albanians.
	   Rising Western pressure on President Slobodan Milosevic over
Kosovo also hurt the pro-Western Plavsic at the polls, they said.
	   During the election, Bosnians chose candidates for the
three-member joint national presidency, a national parliament and
regional and local posts. Those in the Serb-run area also voted for
their president.
	   According to sources in Sarajevo, another Western favorite,
Kresimir Zubak, also was faring poorly. Zubak has recently split
from the Bosnian Croat hard-liners and formed a new, more moderate
party.

	   CAPE TOWN (AP) _ A lawmaker from the ruling African National
Congress slugged an opposition lawmaker Thursday on the floor of
parliament.
	   Although tensions remain high between the ANC, which won power
in South Africa's first all-race did not appear to be racially
motivated, according to the South African Press Association.
	   It started when a lawmaker from the National Party asserted that
he had been denied a chance to speak on a motion about
nongovernmental organizations. The lawmaker's identity was not
available.
	   ANC lawmaker Johnny de Lange accused the lawmaker of lying,
prompting National Party lawmaker Manie Schoeman to shove de Lange.
De Lange then floored Schoeman with a blow to the jaw, according to
the news agency.
	   Other members of parliament separated the combatants.
	   No other details were available.
	   Disheveled lawmakers jostled each other as they left the
chamber.
	   It was the first time in memory that a debate had come to blows
in parliament.
	   House Speaker Frene Ginwala demanded that everyone involved
appear in her office Friday morning to explain the altercation.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban army accused
Iran on Thursday of killing 56 Afghan refugees living there.
	   The Taliban's Radio Shariat urged the international community to
condemn Iran, calling the killings ``an inhuman act.''
	   The allegations came as Iran's armed forces massed along the
border with Afghanistan and the Taliban army threatened to respond
with medium-range Scud missiles to any Iranian attack.
	   The Taliban say Iran is arming and training its Shiite Muslim
enemies, while Tehran and the Afghan opposition say Pakistan is
supplying weapons and training to Taliban troops.

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
expressed skepticism Wednesday about a ceasefire announced by
Basque separatists and said he would have to study the declaration.
	   Aznar, on an official visit to Peru, spoke to reporters at
Lima's presidential palace after meeting with President Alberto
Fujimori.
	   Spain's Basque separatist group ETA declared a unilateral truce
Wednesday in its war to establish an independent homeland. The
ceasefire was to go into effect Friday.
	   ``After 30 years of terrorist activity, we cannot afford to give
the ETA the benefit of the doubt. There have been truces and
negotiations in the past, but we have never seen the ETA listen to
our citizens' call for peace,'' Aznar said.
	   Aznar said he would consult with leaders of Spain's democratic
parties to determine how to use the ETA truce to help attain a
permanent peace.
	   Aznar's four-day visit to Peru is aimed at strengthening ties
between the impoverished Andean nation and Spain, its biggest
foreign investor.
	   The leaders signed three agreements, including an offer of
Spanish aid to help Peru cut production of coca leaf, which is used
to make cocaine. Peru is one of the world's top coca producers.
	   Aznar also offered Peru millions of dollars in low-interest
loans to help it recover from the effects of the El Nino weather
phenomenon.
	   Aznar arrived in Lima Wednesday from the city of Iquitos in
Peru's Amazon jungle, 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) to the
northeast, where he visited a fruit processing plant, a
multilingual school and other projects financed by Spanish foreign
aid.
	   On Saturday, Aznar will visit Cuzco and the stone ruins of Machu
Picchu, Peru's top tourist attraction, then return to Madrid.

Hundreds of flood victims flee small town in southern Mexico

	   MAPASTEPEC, Mexico (AP) _ Jostling and elbowing one another,
survivors of floods that devastated this small town in southern
Chiapas state crowded around military helicopters Thursday trying
to flee.
	   About 400 men, women and children have been leaving in army and
navy choppers every day for nearly a week in this farm community of
about 10,000. Most have left with only the clothes on their backs.
	   One of them was Juan Manuel Villafuerte Figuero, 38, a
small-scale farmer waiting with his wife and three children in the
Mapastepec soccer field, where the helicopters were landing.
	   ``We're leaving because we were left without a home, without
land. We have nothing to eat, nowhere to live,'' he said.
	   ``We'll look for relatives in other cities _ for now. Later, we
hope the government will help us, even with a few sheets of
corrugated metal to build a roof.''
	   Chiapas has been devastated by three tropical depressions and a
tropical storm that drenched the state over the past 10 days.
Rivers overflowed their banks and gulches that had been dry for
years turned into roaring torrents.
	   By government count as of Thursday, 119 bodies have been
recovered from the floods, another 554 people have been listed as
missing. But, authorities said, the toll may be much higher, since
scores of communities are isolated. About 450,000 people have been
left homeless.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo traveled for the fourth time since the
disaster hit to Tapachula, 100 miles (160 kilometers) southeast of
here on the Guatemalan border, where relief efforts are
concentrated. He said he wanted to get better damage estimates and
coordinate help.
	   Experts accompanying him said 250,000 people will probably have
to relocate from their lowland houses, and the government may have
to build as many as 25,000 low-cost homes soon.
	   Aid has been pouring in from all over the country, through the
Red Cross and other rescue agencies. But Chiapas authorities are
having a hard time distributing it because of flooded roads,
wrecked bridges and bad weather.
	   On Thursday, all 500 members of the Chamber of Deputies _
Mexico's House of Representatives _ voted to donate a day's pay,
equivalent to about dlrs 160, to help the state.
	   The Treasury Department also earmarked dlrs 200 million, or
about half the Federal Disaster Emergency Fund, for reconstruction.
	   It stopped raining overnight, but the forecast was for more
heavy storms in the area.
	   About 30 helicopter flights were landing every day in the
Mapastepec soccer field, bringing about 30 tons of food, medicine,
drinking water, clothing and blankets and evacuating between 15 and
24 refugees, depending on the size of the aircraft.
	   Flooding caused by heavy rains Thursday also forced authorities
to evacuate about 1,000 people in nine communities north of the
central Pacific coast resort city of Puerto Vallarta. One person
was reported missing.
	   Ten shelters were set up in Puerto Vallarta and many schools
canceled classes.

Pakistani police arrest hundreds in religious violence crackdown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ A prominent Shiite Muslim leader was
gunned down Thursday in eastern Punjab province after police
arrested at least 200 people in a crackdown on rival Islamic
groups, police said.
	   In recent months, scores of people have been killed throughout
the country in the ongoing feud between militant members of Sunni
and Shiite Muslim groups.
	   Agha Wajeeb Abbas Naqvi, a leader of the Shiite Muslim group
Tehrik-e-Jafria of Pakistan, was gunned down by two men on a
motorcycle. An 8-year-old boy was wounded in the shooting, police
said.
	   No one was arrested, although police believe the gunmen may have
belonged to the militant Sunni group, Sipah-e-Shaba, or Guardians
of the Friends of the Prophet.
	   Those arrested earlier Thursday in the eastern Punjab capital of
Lahore were both Shiite and Sunni Muslim activists.
	   Supporters of Sipah-e-Sahaba threatened to storm jails to free
its members unless they are released by next week, the group's
spokesman Saifullah Khallid told The Associated Press.
	   A key leader, Shoaib Nadeem, and three others members of the
Sunni group were murdered by four gunmen on a highway near
Islamabad on Sunday. The killing set off widespread demonstrations.
Militants also set fire to a Shiite mosque and three houses in Wah
Town, 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Islamabad on Monday night.
	   About 200 Sunnis were arrested in those demonstrations on
Monday. Police said another 200 militants, including Sunni and
Shiites, were arrested on Thursday in the Lahore region.
	   Militant Sunnis, the majority in Pakistan, and extremist Shiite
Muslims routinely kill each other a nationwide feud that has
intensified in recent years. Most Sunnis and minority Shiites are
moderate, however, and live together peacefully.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's
initial skeptical reception of the unilateral truce declared by
armed Basque separatists appeared to pour cold water on the
enthusiastic welcome it received from Basque nationalist leaders.
	   Aznar said Thursday there was no reason to believe that the
armed group ETA was on the point of abandoning its 30-year violent
campaign for an independent Basque homeland.
	   ``There have been truces before....If ETA truly wants to end its
trajectory of death and win credibility, it must do so with actions
and not with declarations,'' Aznar said in Lima, Peru on the second
day of a two-day official visit.
	   `` ETA and only ETA holds the burden of proof....We have no need
to demonstrate anything,'' he added in a statement televised live
on national Spanish television.
	   But in Spain's northern Basque region, leading politicians said
the truce was a historical step forward requiring others to take up
the challenge.
	   ``This is an important landmark. This is an unconditional,
unilateral and indefinite truce,'' said Basque regional president
Jose Antonio Ardanza.
	   ETA, the Basque-language initials for Basque Homeland and
Freedom, has called cease-fires before, but only of limited
duration.
	   ``Now a process has begun in which everybody else must take
responsibility (for building peace),'' Ardanza added.
	   Basque nationalists had been pressuring the ETA to call an
indefinite truce ahead of Oct. 25 Basque region elections. While
most nationalists support the ETA's goal, they reject the use of
violence.
	   On Saturday, nationalists and other groups held an ``Ireland
Forum'' in the Basque town of Lizarra. The closing appeal for
all-party negotiations and an end to the violence was signed by 23
political parties, labor unions and grassroots groups, including
the ETA-allied Herri Batasuna coalition.
	   The Forum was boycotted by the ruling Popular Party and its main
opposition, the Socialists, which see it as a campaign tactic to
build support for Basque nationalists. The two parties have opposed
negotiations with ETA until the group renounces violence forever.
	   ETA's announcement also drew praise from Northern Ireland, where
the Good Friday peace accord, raising hopes for ending decades of
sectarian violence between Catholics and Protestants, inspired the
``Ireland Forum.''
	   ``I would urge all of those involved, and particularly the
Spanish government, to learn the lessons of our experience. Don't
prevaricate, don't create obstacles, don't delay. The emphasis now
should be on building confidence and trust and getting negotiations
under way speedily,'' said Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the Irish Republican Army.
	   Cuban leader Fidel Castro also said the cease-fire made him
``enormously happy,'' state-owned television reported.
	   Meanwhile, Aznar has brought forward his return from Peru by 24
hours to Saturday, state-run radio reported.
	   He had already announced he would be holding consultations with
``democratic parties,'' regarding the ceasefire and called on them
to ``demonstrate unity and agreement.''
	   ETA set no conditions on the cease-fire but said it would not
surrender its arms, and would call off the truce, due to start
midnight Thursday, in the event of a ``confrontation'' with the
government.
	   But in Herri Batasuna's official response to the cease-fire,
party spokesman Arnaldo Ortegi appeared to raise the stakes.
	   At a press conference in the northern city of Pamplona, Ortegi
described the cease-fire as, ``A clear message of (ETA's)
willingness to substitute violent confrontation with democratic
confrontation if, and only if, this country (the Basque region) is
given guarantees of its national rights,'' Ortegi said.
	   ETA gunmen and bombs have killed nearly 800 people since the
group began fighting in the late 1960s for an independent Basque
homeland straddling the border between Spain and France.
	   The last ETA attack came on June 25 when it killed a town
councilor of the ruling Popular Party in the Basque town of
Renteria. He was the sixth person killed by ETA this year.

Galapagos eruptions threaten giant tortoises

<TEXT>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Volcanic eruptions on the largest of the
Galapagos islands are threatening three colonies of a rare giant
tortoise unique to the island chain, authorities said Thursday.
	   The Cerro Azul volcano on Isabela Island began erupting Tuesday,
spewing flames and a river of lava that could reach the 1,670
Galapagos tortoises, said Elecir Cruz, director of Galapagos
National Park.
	   ``The area affected by the volcano is close to three tortoise
nesting grounds, which could be harmed depending on the direction
the lava flows,'' Cruz said.
	   Authorities have not ruled out moving the tortoises, which weigh
hundreds of kilometers (pounds), to a different part of the island
if the danger to them increases, Cruz said.
	   A river of lava has covered about 2 miles (3 kilometers) of
uninhabited hillside that is outside the islands' main tourist
routes. Authorities fear the lava could also set off brush fires
because of a recent drought.
	   But Isabela island's approximately 1,000 human inhabitants are
not in danger. The nearest village, Puerto Villamil, is 30 miles
(50 kilometers) from the volcano.
	   Cerro Azul last erupted in 1979.
	   The Galapagos archipelago is 600 miles (965 kilometers) west of
mainland Ecuador and is the South American nation's main tourist
attraction.
	   Its species of plants and animals, found nowhere else in the
world, have unique characteristics that helped Charles Darwin
develop his theory of evolution.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish government tried to dampen
public enthusiasm Thursday about a unilateral cease-fire announced
by the Basque separatist group ETA after a 30-year fight for an
independent homeland.
	   Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said Thursday there was
no reason to believe that the armed group ETA was on the point of
abandoning its violent campaign.
	   ``There have been truces before. ... If ETA truly wants to end
its trajectory of death and win credibility, it must do so with

	   ``This is an important landmark. This is an unconditional,
unilateral and indefinite truce,'' said Basque regional president
Jose Antonio Ardanza. ``Now a process has begun in which everybody
else must take responsibility.''
	   ETA's four-page truce announcement was released by the radical
Basque newspaper Euskadi Informacion, a small-circulation
publication that grew out of the daily Egin, shut down by the
government in July over its alleged links to ETA.
	   The armed group set no conditions on the cease-fire, to begin at
midnight Thursday. But it said it would not surrender its arms and
warned it would end the truce in the event of a ``confrontation''
with the government.
	   ETA, the Basque-language initials for Basque Homeland and
Freedom, has called cease-fires before, but only of limited
duration.
	   Basque nationalists had been pressuring the ETA to call an

opposition, the Socialists, which see it as a campaign tactic to
build support for Basque nationalists. The two parties have opposed
negotiations with ETA until the group renounces violence forever.
	   ETA's announcement drew praise from as far away as Northern
Ireland, where a peace accord was reached in April in a bid to end
decades of sectarian violence between Catholics and Protestants.
	   ``I would urge all of those involved, and particularly the
Spanish government, to learn the lessons of our experience. Don't
prevaricate, don't create obstacles, don't delay. The emphasis now

Teamwork necessary to solve financial problems in global economies

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ No nation is immune from the economic
turmoil that brought down an Indonesian president and prompted some
of the worst riots in that country's history, the Indonesian
foreign affairs minister said Thursday.
	   ``The threat of a worldwide recession, even possibly a global
depression, is real,'' Ali Alatas told members of the General
Assembly gathered to discuss the pros and cons of global economic
interdependence. ``In the ultimate analysis, no country is safe
from the hazards of globalization.''
	   The two-day conference that began Thursday focused on the social
and economic impact of the world's increasingly intertwined and
interdependent economies.
	   Many speeches from U.N. officials and representatives of poorer
countries urged industrialized nations to remember that they shared
responsibility for the crises hitting the developing world. The
industrial world reaped the benefits of developing nations' initial
quick growth, they said.
	   ``The contagion effect of every financial and economic crisis in
every country and in every region will always threaten the
financial and economic stability of every other country and
region,'' Alatas said.
	   The collapse of Indonesia's currency last summer was part of an
Asian financial crisis whose effects have spread across the globe,
sparking riots in Indonesia and causing stock markets to gyrate
wildly in Asia, Europe and the Americas. The latest victim has been
Russia, where the plunging value of the ruble has rocked the
government.
	   ``As the world contemplates these events, some are questioning
the desirability of free markets, and the increasing
interdependence of national economies,'' said Brian Atwood,
administrator at the U.S. Agency for International Development.
	   However, he cautioned, the problems of the day shouldn't be
allowed to define globalized economies. ``The benefits still vastly
outweigh the costs,'' he said.
	   Echoing those sentiments, Alatas said lessons can be drawn from
financial crises, but solving the problems takes teamwork.
	   ``Globalization is by no means an evil force but it is a blind
one,'' he said. ``Like the winds of change in the ocean of history,
it can shipwreck us or carry us to our intended destination.
	   ``The developed and developing countries are all in the same
boat. Our fate depends on how well we work as a team in trimming
the sails,'' he said.

Campaign turns nasty with Labor attack on heroin proliferation
</HEADLINE>
under conservatives &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Updates with Labor radio commercial withdrawn. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The election campaign turned nasty
Thursday as the Labor Party accused Prime Minister John Howard of
putting young lives at risk by allowing cheap heroin into
Australia.
	   Opposition Labor Party justice spokesman Nick Bolkus was later
forced to apologize for his attack, although he denied he had meant
Howard was personally responsible for heroin overdose deaths.
	   Howard was outraged. ``I think that's a pretty cheap, tawdry,
guttersnipe attack,'' he said in Perth.
	   Howard called on opposition leader Kim Beazley to pull his key
spokespeople into line.
	   ``It seems that the pattern of the Labor Party is that the boss
sails on serenely in a civil manner, but at the margins he allows
his minions to say anything they like,'' he said.
	   Howard's governing conservatives and Beazley's Labor party are
battling toward an Oct. 3 national election.
	   Thursday's row erupted after Bolkus issued a statement
attempting to undercut Howard's announcement of increased funding
to fight illicit drugs.
	   Bolkus accused Howard of risking young lives by neglecting law
enforcement and said 60 young people had died from heroin overdoses
in Perth last year.
	   ``And why? Because under John Howard the price of a cap of
heroin has dropped from 40 dollars to as little as 5 dollars --
cheaper than a packet of cigarettes,'' he said.
	   (That is equivalent to a price drop of U.S. dlrs 24 to U.S. dlrs
3).
	   Labor blames the conservatives for deep funding cuts to law
enforcement over the last 2 1/2 years, which are only partially
being restored now during the campaign.
	   On Thursday, Labor withdrew radio ads from the Sydney market
making the same point, broadcasts which said: ``These cuts are
criminal, Mr. Howard.''
	   Bolkus later issued another statement regretting his attack had
been interpreted as blaming Howard for heroin deaths.
	   Meanwhile, Howard's predecessor as conservative leader, John
Hewson, undercut Treasurer Peter Costello's rosy economic outlook,
saying economic growth will fall off dramatically this year and the
Asian crisis could go on for decades.
	   Hewson, chairman of the Australian arm of investment bank ABN
Amro, said he believed domestic demand was slowing and that further
impact from Asia was about to flow through to the Australian
economy.
	   His comments came a day after Costello said the economy could
pick up speed as early as next year after a temporary slowdown in
1998/99, and that the Asian financial crisis could pass
``quickly.''
	   Hewson also suggested treasury's projection of 3.5 percent
economic growth for 1999/00 was ``odd'' in the current global
circumstances.

Oscar the dlrs 100 million man against Chavez
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Oscar De La Hoya has always had the
million-dollar looks. By the time he steps into the ring for a
rematch Friday night with Julio Cesar Chavez, he'll also have a
dlrs 100 million bankroll.
	   De La Hoya will make another dlrs 12 million or so for taking on
the aging Chavez for the second time, bringing his career earnings
in just 29 fights to over dlrs 100 million.
	   De La Hoya, who stopped Chavez on cuts in the fourth round when
they met two years ago, is a prohibitive favorite to beat his
Mexican rival once again. But even a potential mismatch hasn't
stopped this fight from once again being a lucrative event for De
La Hoya and his promoters.
	   ``This isn't a fight I even wanted to have,'' promoter Bob Arum
said. ``They've already fought once and there was no reason for
them to fight again. But now I'm glad we did it.''
	   De La Hoya (28-0, 23 knockouts) defends the WBC welterweight
title he won from Pernell Whitaker for the fifth time in the
scheduled 12-round fight before an expected crowd of some 18,000 at
the UNLV campus arena.
	   The rematch is one weight division heavier than when the two met
June 7, 1996, but De La Hoya sees no reason that the result won't
be the same. De La Hoya weighed in Thursday at 146 1/2 pounds (65.9
kilograms) to 144 1/2 (65 kilograms) for Chavez.
	   ``I'm prepared to make him look like an amateur in the ring,''
De La Hoya said.
	   It may be the last hurrah for the 36-year-old Chavez, who got
the rematch not because he had fought particularly well since
losing to De La Hoya, but because De La Hoya is upset that Chavez
never gave him proper credit for the first victory.
	   ``This fight is a very personal fight to me. I'm fighting for
the respect I never got beating him the first time,'' De La Hoya
said. ``If it were up to me, it wouldn't even be in the record
books. That's how personal it is.''
	   Chavez, considered Mexico's greatest boxer, is at the tail end
of a remarkable career in which he has won 101 fights while losing
two and drawing two. He has looked mediocre in the ring in recent
years, and is coming off a third-round knockout of Ken Sigurani
June 25 in which he was cut badly over his right eye.
	   Chavez has also had his troubles out of the ring, and his dlrs 6
million payday will help cover some of the tax charges that
prompted authorities in Mexico City to arrest him when he returned
home after beating Sigurani.
	   ``I don't care what has been said about me,'' Chavez said.
``This fight will be entirely different than my other fights.''
	   That Chavez even got the rematch speaks more about his ability
both to irritate De La Hoya and also sell tickets to the Mexicans
who will crowd this gambling city for an independence day weekend.
	   After getting his face cut open by De La Hoya's jab in the first
round of their first fight, Chavez was battered for three more
rounds before the ring doctor recommended the fight be stopped in
the fourth round.
	   Chavez later claimed he was cut the week before the fight while
playing with his son, but fought anyway because of the importance
of the bout. He has refused to concede that De La Hoya actually
beat him in the ring.
	   ``How am I supposed to give him any respect if I'm cut?'' he
asked. ``It doesn't make any sense.''
	   Arum said he did not want De La Hoya, whose third-round knockout
of outclassed Patrick Charpentier in El Paso, Texas, in June was
his only fight of the year, to fight Chavez again.
	   But De La Hoya, angry that Chavez won't concede defeat, wanted
the fight badly. He wants a knockout this time around almost as
badly.
	   ``My only satisfaction will be getting a knockout,'' De La Hoya
said. ``I look at him as my next victim. I don't like him and he
doesn't like me.''
	   De La Hoya, a 2-1 favorite when they met for the 140-pound
(63-kilogram) title, is an 8-1 favorite this time around. It's even
money that the fight will go longer than the middle of the fifth
round.
	   Chavez spent nearly two months in the mountains of Colorado
putting his body into shape for the fight, and his weight is indeed
down. But after 18 years of ring wars his reflexes have slowed, and
his performances in recent years have only raised more questions
about how much he has left.
	   De La Hoya, on the other hand, seems to have grown comfortably
into the 147-pound (66-kilogram) class only six years after
starting his career out at 130 pounds (58.5 kilograms). He toyed
with Charpentier, the No. 1 challenger, in their June 13 fight,
barely letting him land a punch before knocking him down three
times in the third round.
	   ``The fight will last only as long as Oscar wants it to last,''
said veteran trainer Gil Clancy, who has been helping De La Hoya
train. ``Oscar's gotten a lot better since the first time they met.
There's no way Chavez has gotten better.''
	   Arum is so confident that De La Hoya will win that he has
already signed a fight with undefeated Ike Quartey for Nov. 21 in
Las Vegas. After that, he will fight in Mexico next February, and
possibly fight IBF welterweight champion Felix Trinidad in May.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Reeling from one of Mexico's worst natural
disasters, officials are debating whether a scheduled Oct. 4
election can take place in a state where thousands of communities
are still half-buried in mud.
	   The Chiapas Electoral Council said in a statement Thursday that
the elections for local and state officials should only be
postponed in the coastal areas hit by last week's floods.
	   National Action Party Chairman Felipe Calderon said his party,
which governs the municipalities of Huixtla and Tonala in the
damaged areas, wants elections held as scheduled in unaffected
areas.
	   Federal Health Secretary Juan Ramon de la Fuente, who has toured
the disaster area, said elections should be indefinitely postponed
throughout the state, where flooding has killed at least 119 people
and left nearly half a million homeless.
	   Representatives of the Institutional Revolutionary and
Democratic Revolution parties also said they favor postponing
elections in Chiapas.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexican authorities say they have arrested
what they described as an important U.S. drug trafficker.
	   Randy Spradling, also known as Jeffrey Peterson, was arrested
Wednesday in a luxurious mansion in the western city of
Guadalajara, the Mexican attorney general's office said in a
statement. No age or hometown was given.
	   It said Spradling was wanted by the FBI in connection with a
two-ton shipment of cocaine in California. The FBI did not
immediately respond to messages seeking comment.
	   The statement accused Spradling of financing and organizing a
system for importing tons of cocaine into the United States. Under
the method, two boats would meet to exchange cocaine and alkaloids,
which are used to produce the drug. It said one such shipment was
intercepted in international waters by U.S. authorities.
	   Spradling had been imprisoned on drug charges in Mexico in 1992,
but was freed in 1994, the statement said. He faces possible
extradition to the United States.
	   ___
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Three armed men stormed into one of
Brazil's largest home appliance stores Thursday, and kidnapped its
82-year-old owner, police said.
	   Girsz Aronson was abducted minutes after he opened the main
store of his chain Thursday morning in downtown Sao Paulo.
	   The chain, called G. Aronson, recently filed for protection from
creditors through a mechanism similar to Chapter 11 of the U.S.
bankruptcy law.
	   The anti-kidnapping unit said Aronson's family asked police to
stay away from the case.
	   ___
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Fifteen national police officers have
been arrested for corruption this year and are being dropped from
the ranks, a senior police commander said Thursday.
	   Eva Sacasa, the National Police inspector general, said the most
recent case was that of Francisco Javier Paniagua Vargas, a member
of the anti-riot squad, who was caught with three civilian
accomplices robbing an electrical equipment store.
	   Paniagua was arrested Wednesday and turned over to a criminal
court on Thursday.

Britain withdraws troops from South Atlantic island
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain is pulling its troops out of South
Georgia, the uninhabited South Atlantic island where the 1982
Falklands War began, the Ministry of Defense said Thursday.
	   The 15 soldiers will be withdrawn by 2000, and replaced with a
permanent team from the British Antarctic Survey, who will carry
out environmental research into sustainable fishing.
	   Argentina, which claims the Falkland Islands as an inheritance
from the Spanish crown, used South Georgia to launch its invasion
in 1982. But Argentina's attempts to recover the islands were
blocked by Britain during a 74-day war in which nearly 1,000
servicemen, most of them Argentine, died.
	   Armed Forces Minister Doug Henderson said the British withdrawal
would not jeopardize security.
	   The 2,000-strong garrison on the Falkland Islands, 800 miles
(1,300 kms) away, will be responsible for the safety of South
Georgia and the neighboring South Sandwich Islands, Henderson said.
	   ``If military support is required, we have plans in place to
make sure it will be provided promptly and efficiently, and we will
continue regular patrols in the area,'' he said.
	   The soldiers currently stationed on South Georgia will be
redeployed to other sites, he said.

Bean readies for Holyfield bout
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ED SCHUYLER JR. &QC; 
 &UR; AP Boxing Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Vaughn Bean is a heavyweight contender whose
success is built upon failure.
	   The IBF's top-ranked challenger will take a 32-1 record into his
title bid against Evander Holyfield Saturday night in the Georgia
Dome, but only seven of those 33 opponents had winning records at
the time they fought Bean.
	   In fact, the records of Bean's opponents, excluding Michael
Moorer, at the time they fought him, totaled 152-294-14, according
to Fight Fax Inc., a boxing record-keeper based at Sicklerville,
New Jersey.
	   The losers were led by James Wilder (3-35-1) and James Holly
(2-27). The winners Bean beat were Warren Williams (7-4), Maurice
Harris (5-4-2), Isaac Brown (11-8), Kevin Parker (5-4-1), Michael
Benning (5-3) and Ron McCarthy (7-5-1). Only Williams, Harris and
Brown still have winning records.
	   Quality opposition aside, the 25-year-old Bean has parlayed
promoter Butch Lewis' formula into two title shots. That formula,
said Lewis, ``is just keep on winning.''
	   He failed in a bid for the IBF title when he lost to Moorer on a
majority decision March 29, 1997. He then stopped his next four
opponents and earned a mandatory challenge to Holyfield as the
IBF's No. 1 contender. The WBA title also will be at stake.
	   Holyfield, who weighed in officially Thursday at 217 pounds
(97.7 kilograms), retained the WBA title and won the IBF title by
stopping Moorer in the eighth round in his last fight Nov. 8. Bean
weighed 231 pounds (104 kilograms).
	   As for the lack of quality opponents, Bean said, ``I just do my
job and leave the rest of it to Butch.''
	   Lewis said that the need to keep winning to get title shots and
lucrative television matches has had a lot to do with Bean's
opposition.
	   ``One of the reasons young boxer can't fight the big guys in the
division is that when I call the promoters and tell them I've got a
young kid with a 20-0 record, they said, `Butch, are you crazy?
I've got everything to lose and nothing to gain by fighting your
kid,''' Lewis said.
	   Lewis also noted that some of Bean's opponents fought well
against established fighters and that in matching Bean he tried to
find men of varying styles.
	   Although he lost to the left-handed Moore, Bean feels the fight
was a step in the right direction.
	   ``I learned a lot in the Moorer fight for this fight,'' Bean
said. ``I could have thrown more punches. It's important to be
busy, to keep your hands moving.''
	   In Holyfield, Bean will be facing a very busy fighter, a man who
likes to take the battle to an opponent. Bean has 25 knockouts, the
same as Holyfield (35-3), but Holyfield's have been against better
opposition.
	   One who thinks Bean has improved since losing to Moorer is one
of Bean's trainers, former heavyweight champion Joe Frazier.
	   ``I see a whole lot of difference in Bean,'' Frazier said. ``He
is doing the things that we want him to do. He is paying attention
real well. He is getting shots off. His speed has improved. This
guy has a lot of power.''
	   It would appear, however, that Bean's best chance is to outbox
Holyfield. The champion thinks awkwardness and good lateral
movement are Bean's biggest assets.
	   More than 26,000 tickets have been sold for Holyfield's first
fight in his hometown since he stopped Bert Cooper in the seventh
round of a championship defense Nov. 23, 1991, in the Omni. The
Georgia Dome is set up for a crowd of 42,000 for the fight.
	   The fight is scheduled to begin 15 minutes after a 12-round
middleweight bout between Robert Allen of Atlanta and Abdul Ramadan
of Canada.
	   The Allen-Ramadan match is billed as being for the interim IBF
middleweight title. Champion Bernard Hopkins will be unable to
fight for some time because of a badly sprained ankle suffered when
he was inadvertently pushed out the ring by referee Mills Lane in
the fourth round of his title defense against Robert Allen on Aug.
28. The bout was declared no contest. When Hopkins fights again, he
will be required to defend against the Allen-Ramadan winner.
	   Also on the 13-bout card will be a WBO bantamweight title
defense by Jorge Eliecer Julio of Colombia against Adonis Cruz of
Nicaragua.

Tyson must talk a good game to box again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Mike Tyson goes looking for work again with a
lot more to explain to the men deciding his fate than why he bit
Evander Holyfield's ears.
	   At the top of the list is why he allegedly attacked two men
following a traffic accident last month _ just when he was trying
to convince everyone that he had learned to control the fiery
temper that got him in trouble against Holyfield.
	   Tyson's chances of regaining his boxing license _ which many
thought a foregone conclusion as late as a few weeks ago _ are
suddenly clouded again in the wake of the latest charges filed
against the former heavyweight champion.
	   When he goes before Nevada boxing authorities on Saturday, Tyson
will be doing so with the risk of a rejection that would keep him
out of boxing for at least one more year.
	   ``The whole issue is his temper and self-control,'' Nevada
Athletic Commission chairman Dr. Elias Ghanem said. ``Everything
that has happened since we revoked his license we have to find out
about.''
	   Tyson, who pulled out of an ill-fated attempt to get licensed at
the last moment in New Jersey in August, will personally plead his
case.
	   He's expected to get some help from a Denver psychotherapist who
has been meeting with Tyson the past week and probably will appear
to lobby on his behalf.
	   A lot is at stake for the 32-year-old Tyson, who will still
command millions of dollars if he fights again. Already, he has
begun training, and tentative plans call for a late November or
early December fight that would be televised on pay-per-view and
make Tyson millions.
	   He apparently needs the money despite having made more than dlrs
100 million in the ring since his release from prison in 1995 after
serving a sentence for rape. Last month, the Internal Revenue
Service slapped a dlrs 6.3 million lien on his Farmington, Conn.,
mansion.
	   But first Tyson has to convince the same commission that had no
trouble banning him from the sport that he should be allowed to
return. And he must answer questions about charges two men filed
that they were attacked by Tyson following a car accident in a
Washington suburb.
	   ``It's going to be a very, very tough hearing I'm pretty sure if
only because of what has happened recently,'' Ghanem said. ``That
all has to come into play. We will want to know all the answers to
those things.''
	   The commission has only three real options: approve Tyson,
reject him or ask that he return at a later date when he can better
answer questions arising from the traffic accident.
	   If Tyson is rejected, he can't apply again until Sept. 19, 1999.
	   Nevada law does not allow for Tyson to be given any sort of
conditional license, said Kirk Hendrick, a deputy attorney general
who advises the commission.
	   ``It will be yes, no or come back when you can give us the
answers,'' Hendrick said.
	   Tyson's new adviser, Shelly Finkel, declined to discuss Tyson's
altercation in which he allegedly kicked a 50-year-old man in the
groin and hit a 62-year-old man in the chest before being
restrained by his bodyguards.
	   Finkel, though, said Tyson would tell his side of the story to
commissioners and that he was still optimistic he would get
licensed.
	   ``I believe we'll have a fair chance at it,'' Finkel said. ``You
never know until it's over, though.''
	   One person who believes Tyson should be licensed is Holyfield.
	   ``What he did in the ring he paid the price for,'' Holyfield
said this week. ``All I'm concerned about he was he did in the
ring.''
	   Tyson's boxing license was revoked and he was fined dlrs 3
million by the commission July 9, 1997, for biting Holyfield's ears
during their aborted rematch for the WBA heavyweight title.
	   Tyson did not appear before the commission to contest the
license revocation, and instead spent the day buying a dlrs 250,000
Ferrari in New York.
	   He has no choice but to appear this time, and he figures to need
an appearance as smashing as some of his knockout wins to carry the
day.
	   ``He's got to rise to the occasion during this licensing because
it's going to be a test of what kind of person he is. They call him
Iron Mike,'' Ghanem said, ``but we'll just have to wait and see.''

	   MAPASTEPEC, Mexico (AP) _ Jostling and elbowing one another,
survivors of floods that devastated this small town in southern
Chiapas state crowded around military helicopters Thursday trying
to flee.
	   About 400 men, women and children have been leaving in army and
navy choppers every day for nearly a week in this farm community of
about 10,000. Most have left with only the clothes on their backs.
	   One of them was Juan Manuel Villafuerte Figuero, 38, a
small-scale farmer waiting with his wife and three children in the
Mapastepec soccer field, where the helicopters were landing.
	   ``We're leaving because we were left without a home, without
land. We have nothing to eat, nowhere to live,'' he said.
	   ``We'll look for relatives in other cities _ for now. Later, we
hope the government will help us, even with a few sheets of
corrugated metal to build a roof.''
	   Chiapas has been devastated by three tropical depressions and a
tropical storm that drenched the state over the past 10 days.
Rivers overflowed their banks and gulches that had been dry for
years turned into roaring torrents.
	   By government count as of Thursday, 162 bodies have been
recovered from the floods, and hundreds more are missing. But
authorities said the toll may be much higher, since scores of
communities are isolated.
	   About 450,000 people have been left homeless.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo traveled to the area Thursday for the
fourth time since the disaster hit.
	   ``Four days ago the situation was desperate, but now it is under
control, although people are suffering greatly,'' he told residents
of Mapastepec, a community in Chiapas near Mexico's border with
Guatemala
	   Experts accompanying him said 250,000 people will probably have
to relocate from their lowland houses, and the government may have
to build as many as 25,000 low-cost homes soon.
	   Aid has been pouring in from all over the country, through the
Red Cross and other rescue agencies. But Chiapas authorities are
having a hard time distributing it because of flooded roads,
wrecked bridges and bad weather.
	   On Thursday, all 500 members of the Chamber of Deputies _
Mexico's House of Representatives _ voted to donate a day's pay,
equivalent to about dlrs 160, to help the state.
	   The Treasury Department also earmarked dlrs 200 million, or
about half the Federal Disaster Emergency Fund, for reconstruction.
	   It stopped raining overnight, but the forecast was for more
heavy storms in the area.
	   About 30 helicopter flights were landing every day in the
Mapastepec soccer field, bringing about 30 tons of food, medicine,
drinking water, clothing and blankets and evacuating between 15 and
24 refugees, depending on the size of the aircraft.
	   Flooding caused by heavy rains Thursday also forced authorities
to evacuate about 1,000 people in nine communities north of the
central Pacific coast resort city of Puerto Vallarta. One person
was reported missing.
	   Ten shelters were set up in Puerto Vallarta and many schools
canceled classes.
	   The disaster hit Mapastepec full-force Sept. 8, when the already
swollen Novillero River overflowed its banks and joined waters with
half a dozen roaring streams nearby. Floods swept over half the
town.
	   Of those staying behind, about 800 people go every day or spend
the night in the town auditorium, which has been turned into a
military-run shelter. Army cooks in a makeshift kitchen dole out
skimpy rations of food, often nothing more than beans, tortillas,
toasted bread and coffee.
	   Children get only powdered milk.
	   Most of the refugees spend their nights on the auditorium's
cement floor. A few have slung hammocks from handrails.
	   Outbreaks of conjunctivitis _ an eyelid infection also called
``pink eye'' _ and some cases of cholera have been reported in
other devastated areas. But so far, a small team of military
doctors have found none here.
	   Esperanza Avendano and her eight children are among the refugees
at the auditorium. Their house and everything else was swept away,
and Avendano waited her turn for rations.
	   ``We have nothing, nothing to eat,'' she said.

	   OAKLAND, California (AP) _ Ken Griffey Jr. hit his 53rd homer, a
three-run shot in the first inning, and Jamie Moyer pitched a
four-hitter as the Seattle Mariners beat the Oakland Athletics 8-0
Thursday.
	   Griffey's homer, his 11th in the last 23 games, was a drive into
the right-field stands that came after Carlos Guillen and Alex
Rodriguez began the game with singles off Tom Candiotti (11-16).
	   On Wednesday night, in a 4-1 win over the A's, Griffey stole a
base to join Willie Mays and Brady Anderson as the only players in
major league history with 50 homers and 20 stolen bases in a
season.
	   The Mariners, who have won four straight, added three runs in
the fourth on RBI singles by Russ Davis and Joe Oliver and an RBI
double by Shane Monahan. Raul Ibanez had RBI singles in the fifth
and ninth.

	   EL SAUZAL, Mexico (AP) _ Gunmen yanked three sleepy families
from their beds early Thursday, lined them against a wall and
killed at least 18 men, women and children near a popular Baja
California resort.
	   At least two people were seriously wounded in the attack, and
police have a witness in custody: a 15-year-old girl who hid under
a bed during the slaughter, The Associated Press has learned.
	   ``It was full of blood. There were bodies everywhere,'' said
Capt. Humberto Hernandez del Parra of the Federal Highway Police.
	   ``In all my life, I've never seen anything like this. It looked
like a scene from Rambo.''
	   The attorney general of Baja California state, Marco Antonio de
la Fuente Virrarreal, shied away from speculating on a motive
Thursday afternoon.
	   ``We cannot say 100 percent that it was an aspect of drug
trafficking or for some other motive... Information is still
lacking,'' he said.
	   Earlier in the day, the government news agency Notimex quoted
him as saying the head of one of the households grew marijuana for
the Arellano Felix drug-smuggling gang.
	   He reportedly said the man, Fermin Castro, oversaw the Arellano
Felix's marijuana plantations nearby. However De la Fuente did not
repeat that claim at the later news conference.
	   Castro wasn't killed in the attack, but was in very serious
condition with a bullet wound to the head, health officials said.
	   Police said the attack took place at 4:30 a.m. in El Sauzal, a
suburb of the resort town of Ensenada, a popular beach destination
for Californians a 1 1/2-hour drive from San Diego.
	   The victims appeared to be asleep when the gunmen showed up;
most of the bodies were wearing pajamas or underwear and the beds
in at least one of the houses were unmade, as if sleeping people
were pulled from them.
	   Television images showed the victims lined up in a pool of blood
in front of a wall. A television reporter said one woman was
clutching a baby in her arms; both were dead.
	   Officials distributed a list of 18 confirmed dead, though there
were unconfirmed reports that one or two other people had died
after the attack at hospitals.

Gambill has no problem with Milwa.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Gambill, making his Davis Cup debut, trusts the state's sports
fans will be able to peel themselves away from the Green Bay
Packers.
	   ``Hopefully they can squeeze it in,'' Gambill said. ``We would
love to get some cheeseheads out there really getting rowdy in the
crowd going hard for the USA. I think that would be great.''
	   Agassi was upset by the choice of Milwaukee as the semifinal
site and said he won't play in the final if the Americans advance
to play the Sweden-Spain winner for the championship
	   ``If it was in my backyard, I wouldn't walk out the back door,''
Agassi said at the U.S. Open earlier this month.
	   Agassi, who played against Russia and Belgium in the first two
rounds, wanted the semifinal to be played on the West Coast, where
he could also participate in a charity match he runs in Las Vegas.
	   When team captain Tom Gullikson, a native of Onalaska,
Wisconsin, announced Milwaukee as the site, Agassi said the
players' wishes are simply ignored.
	   ``It should be our say-so entirely. Instead of it being
discussed, we read it in a news release that we're going to
Milwaukee and Gully is really pumped he gets to bring it to his
home state,'' Agassi said. ``God bless Milwaukee. But it's still
something they should discuss with the players.''
	   Agassi isn't the only U.S. tennis star upset over Davis Cup
matters. Top-ranked Sampras also says changes need to be made
because of the already crowded calendar.
	   ``Less is more,'' he said. ``If they had it less, it would get
more attention. Look at the Ryder Cup. It's the biggest thing in
the world.''
	   The Ryder Cup golf tournament is held every two years between
teams from the United States and Europe, and has become one of the
success stories of international sports.
	   Sampras said the Davis Cup ``gets lost in the shuffle in the
U.S.''
	   Sampras also said his performance to help the United States win
the Davis Cup against Russia in Moscow at the end of 1996 left him
empty because of the subdued response at home.
	   ``Pete saying things like that really doesn't help it,'' Gambill
said. ``I think it would help if the players would promote it maybe
a little bit as well.''
	   The U.S. team consists of veterans Jim Courier and Todd Martin
and rookies Gambill and Justin Gimelstob. Crowds of 6,000-plus are
expected each of the three days at the 10,900-seat Milwaukee Arena.
	   Martin is ranked 27th in the world, the only one of the quartet
better than No. 50.
	   Gambill reached the third round of the U.S. Open, losing to
French Open champion Carlos Moya in a fifth-set tiebreaker, a
performance that has him pumped up for his first Davis Cup.
	   ``Playing Davis Cup is every American's dream,'' he said. ``And
it is not an easy thing to do because we have so many amazingly
great players in the U.S.''
	   Gambill said he couldn't imagine turning down a spot on the
Davis Cup team.
	   ``I will always do it. If I have a chance, I will do it every
time,'' he said.

Campaign turns nasty with Labor attack on heroin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates with Labor radio commercial withdrawn in new grafs
10-11 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The election campaign turned nasty
Thursday as the Labor Party accused Prime Minister John Howard of
putting young lives at risk by allowing cheap heroin into
Australia.
	   Opposition Labor Party justice spokesman Nick Bolkus was later
forced to apologize for his attack, although he denied he had meant
Howard was personally responsible for heroin overdose deaths.
	   Howard was outraged. ``I think that's a pretty cheap, tawdry,
guttersnipe attack,'' he said.
	   Howard called on opposition leader Kim Beazley to pull his key
aides into line.
	   ``It seems that the pattern of the Labor Party is that the boss
sails on serenely in a civil manner, but at the margins he allows
his minions to say anything they like,'' he said.
	   Howard's governing conservatives and Beazley's Labor party are
battling toward an Oct. 3 national election.
	   Thursday's row erupted after Bolkus issued a statement
attempting to undercut Howard's announcement of increased funding
to fight illicit drugs.
	   Bolkus accused Howard of risking young lives by neglecting law
enforcement and said 60 young people had died from heroin overdoses
in the city of Perth last year.
	   ``And why? Because under John Howard the price of a cap of
heroin has dropped from 40 dollars (U.S. dlrs 24) to as little as 5
dollars (U.S. dlrs 3) _ cheaper than a packet of cigarettes,'' he
said.
	   On Thursday, Labor withdrew radio ads from the Sydney market
making the same point, broadcasts which said: ``These cuts are
criminal, Mr. Howard.''
	   Bolkus later issued another statement regretting his attack had
been interpreted as blaming Howard for heroin deaths.
	   Meanwhile, Howard's predecessor as conservative leader, John
Hewson, undercut Treasurer Peter Costello's rosy economic outlook,
saying economic growth will fall off dramatically this year and the
Asian crisis could go on for decades.
	   Hewson, chairman of the Australian arm of investment bank ABN
Amro, said he believed that domestic demand was slowing and that
further impact from Asia was about to flow through to the
Australian economy.
	   His comments came a day after Costello said the economy could
pick up as early as next year, with the Asian financial crisis
possibly passing ``quickly.''

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks plunged Thursday as world markets jeered
the wait-and-see stance on the global financial crisis taken by
Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan and central bank chiefs
from other major nations. The Dow Jones industrial average fell
216.01 _ or by 2.7 percent _ to 7,873.77, giving back nearly half
of the 475 points gained in the prior four sessions and sinking
back below this year's break-even point of 7,908.25. (US-CLOSING
STOCKS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Dow's drop of 2.7 percent followed a 2.4
percent fall in Tokyo's main index to a 12-year low. In Europe,
major indicators closed down 5.5 percent in Paris, 3 percent in
London and 3.9 percent in Frankfurt, Germany. In Sao Paulo, Brazil,
Latin America's largest market, the leading index was off 4.8
percent, joining the selloff. The global flight from stocks sent
money flowing into U.S. Treasury bonds, a traditional haven in
times of uncertainty. Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds, which move
in the opposite direction of prices, fell closer toward 5 percent,
a level that has never been reached since the government began
regular sales of such bonds in 1977. (WORLD MARKETS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ America's trade deficit widened to dlrs 13.9
billion in July as the Asian currency crisis cut more deeply into
the ability of U.S. farmers and manufacturers to sell overseas.
Concerns about the widening financial crisis and disappointment
that coordinated interest rate cuts to spur growth will not be
forthcoming sent financial markets around the world skidding
Thursday. The Commerce Department trade report showed that the July
deficit was 2.1 percent above June's imbalance of dlrs 13.6
billion. That made July the third-highest monthly deficit on
record, surpassed only by May and April of this year. The
deterioration in July reflected a big jump in the U.S. deficit with
Pacific Rim countries, the epicenter of a currency crisis that
began in Asia but has now spread to Russia and is threatening Latin
America. (US-ECONOMY)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Inflation stayed under control in July, helped
by falling prices for energy, produce and telephone service. The
Labor Department said Thursday that its Consumer Price Index rose a
seasonally adjusted 0.2 percent in August, the same as in July.
Despite labor shortages that have begun to drive up wages _ which
can prompt price increases from companies seeking to maintain their
profits _ inflation has remained contained. It's running at a 1.6
percent annual rate this year, compared to 1.7 percent for all of
last year. That's partly because hard times in other countries have
dampened world demand for many products, lowering prices on
commodities from gasoline to coffee. (US-INFLATION)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ For the third time in a month, Russia said
Thursday it was trying to work out a new deal over dlrs 40 billion
in bad loans with foreign banks in the hope of attracting more
Western money to rescue the shattered economy. President Boris
Yeltsin said it would take another week to form a full Cabinet to
deal with the economic crisis, despite warnings that the Kremlin
must take swift action. Finance officials clashed again over
whether the Central Bank should print more money and risk
hyperinflation. The new government clearly wants to get off on the
right foot with foreign lenders, who have faced huge losses since
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's predecessor announced on Aug. 17
that Russia would default on its loans. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   GENEVA (AP) _ If it is to be effective, the International
Monetary Fund must reform the way it tries to help countries in
financial trouble, the U.N. trade and development agency said
Thursday. Financial turmoil in East Asia has laid bare some of the
problems in the conventional IMF approach to managing crises
triggered by the sudden withdrawal of foreign capital and mass
sales of local currencies, the U.N. Conference on Trade and
Development said. The IMF has coordinated emergency funding for
troubled economies in Indonesia and elsewhere in Asia, but its
efforts have usually come too late to stop the recipient country's
currency from plunging in value, according to the 229-page report.
(UN-TRADE-IMF)
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Senior bankers warned Thursday that the Asian
financial crisis could spread and called for industrialized
countries to take swift action to ward off a global economic
meltdown. Painting a gloomy picture of the world economy for the
next couple of years, bankers from Lehman Brothers, Warburg Dillon
Read, Goldman Sachs, and Tokai Asia said Asia's problems could
spread unless governments in Asia, Europe, and the Americas work
together. And the first to do that should be Japan, they said.
``Japan is the problem, globally speaking,'' said Russel Jones,
chief economist for Asia and senior vice-president at Lehman
Brothers Japan. (ECONOMIC FORECAST)

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   EL SAUZAL, Mexico (AP) _ Gunmen apparently sent by a drug lord
yanked three families from their beds before dawn Thursday, lined
them up against a wall and killed at least 19 men, women and
children near a popular Baja California resort. At least one man
was seriously wounded. Police have a witness in protective custody,
a 15-year-old girl who hid under a bed during the slaughter, The
Associated Press has learned. The attorney general of Baja
California state, Marco Antonio de la Fuente Virrarreal, said the
head of one of the households grew marijuana for the Arellano Felix
drug-smuggling gang, the government news agency Notimex reported.
The victims appeared to be asleep when the gunmen showed up; most
of the bodies were wearing pajamas _ or nothing at all.
(MEXICO-MASSACRE)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The House Judiciary Committee unexpectedly
delayed a decision Thursday on the release of President Bill
Clinton's videotaped grand jury testimony. Republicans demanded an
FBI inquiry into an alleged ``systematic attempt to intimidate''
the panel's chairman and others. There was no immediate explanation
for the delay, which was announced by a committee spokesman at the
end of several hours of closed-door discussions. Spokesman Paul
McNulty said it is unlikely any material would be released until
sometime after Friday. The tape is expected to show Clinton
struggling to answer some pointed and graphic questions about his
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and
arguing over legal and linguistic technicalities.
(US-CLINTON-CONGRESS)
	   BEITUNIA, West Bank (AP) _ Tensions between Israel and the
Palestinians soared Thursday with a Palestinian teen-ager's
shooting death, apparently by Israelis who opened fire from a car
on high school students heading home from class. The attack,
coupled with an announcement by Israel that it would expand a
Jewish settlement, came while Israel was on high alert, bracing for
possible attacks by militants before the Jewish holiday season. The
incident also occurred as U.S. President Bill Clinton's peace envoy
wrapped up an unsuccessful effort to complete a deal to end months
of stalemate between the two sides over a long overdue Israeli
troop withdrawal. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat called the
shooting ``another crime as part of the continued conspiracy by the
settlers against our people.'' (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Former President Sali Berisha called
Thursday for nationwide protests against the government, which
moved closer to arresting him on suspicion he fomented riots aimed
at topple it. A parliamentary commission recommended that Berisha,
a member of parliament, be stripped of his immunity against arrest.
The legal step, if approved by the full Parliament, could further
fan the conflict already smoldering in Albania. Berisha urged
supporters earlier to demonstrate Friday against Prime Minister
Fatos Nano's government, which he called a communist-style
dictatorship that killed its opponents. Such a reference resonates
in Albania, once among the world's most hard-line Stalinist
countries. But Western officials and many Albanians view Berisha
himself as hungry for power and interested only in personal gain.
(ALBANIA)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ After marathon meetings that went straight through
the night, the opposition on Friday rejected a compromise proposed
by the ruling party on key banking reform bills. Talks were
temporarily called off after 5 a.m. (2000 GMT Thursday), with both
sides agreeing to resume negotiations later Friday. For weeks, the
governing Liberal Democratic Party has been trying to pass
legislation to begin cleaning up the massive bad loans leftover
from the excessive lending of the 1980s ``bubble'' era. Japanese
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi is anxious to get an agreement on the
bills before his summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton next
Tuesday. The impasse over the bills _ although not unusual in
Japanese politics _ has set off fears that Japan will not be able
to pull itself out of its worst recession in 50 years. (JAPAN-BANK

Cash flow from Miami keeps Cuban families afloat

	   HAVANA (AP) _ Tears well up in the sea-green eyes of Mercedes
Perez de Rodriguez as she looks at the kitchen calendar recording
the devotion of her second son Omar, now living in Miami.
	   ``Omar called,'' is written again and again, three or four days
a week.
	   ``He's a good boy,'' says Mrs. Rodriguez, wiping the tears back
into her short strawberry blond hair. ``He's a good worker.''
	   Another sign of the devotion of Omar Rodriguez, 27, comes less
frequently: Once every month or so he sends a dlrs 20 bill, a dlrs
50, a dlrs 100 tucked in the luggage of virtual strangers.
	   Rodriguez is one of thousands of Cuban emigres living abroad who
send U.S. dollars to relatives struggling with economic hardship in
communist Cuba.
	   While the total sent to loved ones is unknown, no one disputes
that in recent years it has grown to hundreds of millions of
dollars annually. That despite a U.S. government ban on the
practice that was only recently lifted and the passionate criticism
of other emigres who believe the cash flow into Cuba helps keep
Fidel Castro in power.
	   ``I remember once in Miami a man threatened me with a knife
because I send money to Cuba,'' Rodriguez said.
	   ``But I will continue to do so despite him, over the head of
Clinton, over the head of Fidel Castro if necessary,'' the thin
young man said defiantly in his clipped Spanish. ``Because they are
my family. How can you not help your mami?''
	   He spoke recently in Cancun, Mexico, where he went to meet his
older brother Ivan, who had just arrived from Havana. Ivan wanted
to find a job in Mexico so he, too, could send money to their
parents.
	   Rodriguez is no supporter of the Castro government. He fled his
homeland in the fall of 1994 during what was supposed to be a
vacation to Russia.
	   Instead of Moscow, Rodriguez went to Dublin, then Miami, where
U.S. immigration authorities held him for three months until he
convinced them he had been persecuted in his homeland for being
outspoken.
	   After he was granted political asylum in early 1995, he studied
to become a medical technician. Shortly after he was hired at a
small clinic, he began sending money to his folks, always with
friends of friends going to Cuba who charged 10 percent for their
trouble.
	   But agencies charge up to 20 percent for a series of complicated
bank transfers that convert dollars to another foreign currency,
and back again, to dodge the U.S. embargo.
	   Soon, every month or so, Rodriguez's parents would get a call on
the telephone shared with next-door neighbors in a dreary high-rise
in the Havana suburb of Alamar.
	   Money had arrived from Miami. Come pick it up.
	   Living through Cuba's worst economic crisis since the triumph of
the 1959 revolution quickly became much more bearable.
	   An occasional dlrs 50 or dlrs 100 meant a scarce pork chop with
the government subsidized diet of rice and beans. It also meant
vegetable oil, milk, shampoo and soap, all available only with U.S.
dollars.
	   ``If you just lived off the `libreta''' _ the government ration
card _ ``you couldn't survive,'' said Mrs. Rodriguez, 52, retired
as a secretary at a clothing factory.
	   About all the ration provides these days is sugar, hard bread,
rice, dried peas and beans, coffee and unfiltered cigarettes of
black tobacco. Almost everything else requires U.S. dollars at
government stores or on the ``bolsa negra'' _ the black market.
	   The family remittances have set the Rodriguez household somewhat
apart from their government-employed neighbors.
	   ``Most of the people here in the building don't have dollars,''
Mrs. Rodriguez said. ``There is jealousy, but for a long time we
didn't have dollars, either.''
	   Without that family help, the Rodriguezes would have to survive
on government pensions of 140 or 160 pesos (dlrs 7 or dlrs 8) a
month.
	   ``Just having dlrs 50 can make a big difference,'' said the
father of the family, Narciso Rodriguez, 53. ``It's a salve for the
Cuban family.''
	   The United Nations Economic Commission on Latin America
estimates that some dlrs 800 million in family help was sent to the
island in 1996, despite the U.S. government ban. Most economists
put the figure closer to dlrs 500 million, saying the U.N. figure
includes other funds.
	   The ban imposed after Cuban military jets shot down two private
American planes off the island's coast on Feb. 24, 1996, was lifted
earlier this year. Now, an individual may send up to dlrs 1,200 a
year to relatives in Cuba. But because most cash is sent through
private couriers rather than by bank transfer, the limit is
impossible to enforce.
	   Ernest H. Preeg, of the Washington-based Center for Strategic
and International Studies, has estimated that family remittances
now nearly equal the combined net dollar influx from Cuba's top two
exports, tourism and sugar, combined.
	   ``Cuban-Americans are undermining the embargo by sending
increasingly large amounts of U.S. currency to friends and
relatives in Cuba,'' Preeg wrote in The Washington Post last
November.
	   Whatever the figure, it is a lot of hard currency for a
struggling socialist nation that lost dlrs 6 billion in annual
subsidies when the Soviet Union collapsed early in this decade.

	   And signs are that the money will continue to flow so long as
Cuban emigres have relatives on the island who need it.
	   Like their son, Omar, the Rodriguezes are annoyed by those
Cuban-Americans who oppose family remittances.
	   ``When Omar sends us money, he is not helping the Cuban
government. He is helping us,'' Mrs. Rodriguez said. ``Why does
everything always have to be about politics?''
	   She gazed at the large color photograph of Omar that is a
fixture on a living room table. Omar's dark eyes peer from beneath
a red baseball cap as he sits in his used Honda sedan in the Miami
suburb of Hialeah.
	   While his family has used much of the money he sends just to get
by, several thousand dollars were set aside over the years so Ivan
could emigrate legally to Mexico in July.
	   The brothers say they feel a special duty to their parents
following the death of their younger brother, Juan Carlos. In 1990,
at age 17, he was struck by a bus while he was riding his bicycle.
	   While living with his family in Cuba, Ivan helped his parents
with his monthly earnings of 250 pesos, about dlrs 12, as a cook at
a Havana hotel.
	   But he expects that the few dollars in tips his co-workers
shared with him every month in Cuba will pale by any salary he
hopes to earn in Cancun's mega-tourism industry.
	   ``I have to start working right away,'' he said. ``I have to
help, too.''

Concerns raised by U.S. military ranges along Panama Canal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EMPERADOR, Panama (AP) _ Danger lurks in the military bases that
the United States is giving up along the banks of the Panama Canal.
	   Untold numbers of live bombs, rockets and other explosives lie
in the earth from decades of gunnery practice.
	   Cleaning up former firing ranges to make the land safe is among
the greatest challenges the U.S. government faces as it prepares to
cede the bases next year. Panama wants to use the land for tourist
facilities, commercial property and upscale housing.
	   The government hopes development of the former bases will
replace the dlrs 300 million that the departing American military
pumped into Panama's economy each year.
	   Neither country has any figures on the amount of unexploded
weapons and no one has an estimate on how much the cleanup will
cost, although it is expected to take more than 20 years.
	   The two governments remain at odds over how thorough the cleanup
will be and whether the United States will continue to retain
responsibility for the cleanup after it withdraws from the bases on
Dec. 31, 1999.
	   Panama insists the United States is responsible for making the
land safe under the treaties covering the return of the canal zone
to Panama's control.
	   U.S. officials say they can only do their best to clean up the
property. They warn that some areas may never be fully cleared of
explosives because of rocky terrain covered by dense, moist
vegetation.
	   ``There is no technology that will guarantee full and exact
localization of non-detonated explosives,'' especially in such
terrain, said Maj. Reynold Hoover, commander of Task Force 111,
which is overseeing the disposal of explosives.
	   So far, the U.S. government has cleared explosives and related
materials from about 12,000 hectares (about 30,000 acres), leaving
3,000 hectares (7,000 acres) of firing ranges needing a cleanup.
	   About 5,500 kilograms (about 12,000 pounds) of materials have
been found on the former firing ranges _ a little over 4,500
kilograms (10,000 pounds) was junk, but nearly 800 kilograms (1,700
pounds) was undetonated artillery shells, bombs and other
explosives. Most explosives were detonated where they were found.
	   The rest of the cleanup will be difficult without cutting down
dense jungles and thus harming flora and fauna along the canal,
Hoover warned. The area is home to some 70 animal species,
including jaguars, spider monkeys and tapirs.
	   However, explosives contain lead that can be leached out by the
high acidity of the area's soil and run off into rivers and lakes,
said Sayda de Grimaldo, director of environmental affairs for the
Interoceanic Region Authority. Panama set up the authority to
oversee development of the former military bases.
	   Any explosives left in the ground also will present a constant
risk for poor families that live near the former firing ranges,
where children play and look for munitions to sell.
	   ``There are still undetonated munitions that can kill,''
Grimaldo said, noting there have been 22 accidents, including seven
fatal ones, involving unexploded ordnance. ``The cleanup of these
areas is fundamental.''
	   The ranges, used by the U.S. military since before World War II
to train soldiers to defend the canal, are located at Emperador and
Balboa West at the canal's Pacific end and Pina on the Atlantic
side.
	   During training exercises, troops used small munitions, hand
grenades, rockets, mortars and bombs. Practice exercises also
reportedly included mustard and tear gas.
	   American explosive specialists say they are doing their best to
find old weapons and continue to look through old records and maps
to pinpoint where the remaining munitions may be.
	   ``Our principal goal is safety,'' said Col. Richard Wright,
chairman of the U.S. Defense Department's Explosive Safety Board.
``These studies will help to obtain the information that we need to
make safety decisions.''

Court frees on bail journalists sued by former Chief Justice
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ The director and a reporter of a Santiago
newspaper were freed on bail Thursday, after being jailed on
charges of defaming Chile's former chief justice.
	   Fernando Paulsen, director of the mass circulation daily La
Tercera, and reporter Jose Ale paid 100,000 pesos (dlrs 220) each
to walk out of the Santiago Capuchinos jail.
	   The Santiago Court of Appeals said a panel of judges voted to
free Ale and Paulsen.
	   Servando Jordan filed a lawsuit claiming defamation over a story
analyzing his two-year tenure as chief justice. In that story, Ale
wrote that during Jordan's tenure ``the prestige of Chile's
judiciary fell to one of its lowest levels ever.''
	   As chief justice, a position he left late year, Jordan barely
survived an impeachment vote at Congress for alleged corruption.
	   The lawsuit is based on the security laws aimed at protecting
top Chilean officials. If convicted, the two could face prison
sentences of up to five years.

Always a top finisher, Fredericks misses gold again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Again, the gold slipped his grasp.
Sprinter Frankie Fredericks of Namibia burst out of the starting
blocks but ended in a familiar spot.
	   Second.
	   The Namibian star handily dispatches most opponents, but there
always seems to be a track star who prevails over him at the most
prestigious events. In an amazing series of nearly misses, he won
silver at the last two Olympics in both the 100 and 200 meters.
	   At the Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur on Thursday, his
nemesis was Ato Boldon of Trinidad and Tobago, who won the 100
meters in 9.88 seconds. Fredericks was .08 seconds behind, a
sizeable gap at that pace.
	   Obadele Thompson of Barbados, who ran 9.87 at altitude in
Johannesburg on Friday, was third in 10.00.
	   ``It is frustrating,'' Fredericks said of his frequent role as
runner up on the medal podium. ``All I know is that every time I
step on the track I try my best.''
	   Fredericks, a former soccer player who turns 31 next month,
nearly didn't make it to the games in Kuala Lumpur. He was angry
that his prime minister now considered him Namibia's second best
sportsman behind a boxer because he had failed to win an Olympic
gold.
	   ``I'm happy that I came here despite all the circumstances,''
said Fredericks, who shrugged off his failure to win any major
international 100-meter title.
	   ``I'm not going to do anything that is not within myself to win
the title,'' he said without bitterness. ``If I retire without the
title, then so be it. But I'm just going to keep trying and train
harder and hopefully one day I'll win.''
	   With his shaved head and brush moustache, Fredericks is a
popular figure even among fans unfamiliar with track. The stadium
crowd roared whenever his image appeared on a giant television
screen, and he raised his arms in acknowledgement.
	   Fredericks, graceful on the track and an unassuming personality
off it, is no stranger to victory. He won the 200-meter gold in the
1993 world championships as well as at the 1994 Commonwealth Games
in Victoria, British Columbia.
	   At the 1996 Bislett meet in Oslo, Norway, he ended Michael
Johnson's two-year winning streak in the same distance.
	   But he was a silver medalist in the 200 meters at the world
championships in 1991, 1995 and 1997.
	   Boldon, a 24-year-old whose brash, showboating style contrasts
with Fredericks' low-key demeanor, paid tribute to his older rival.
	   ``This is not an easy game that we play out there,'' Bolden
said. ``It's really tough sometimes to beat your friends.''

Dow loses 216 points as world markets boo central banks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By BRUCE MEYERSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Dow industrials slid as much as 235 points
as world stock markets jeered the wait-and-see stance on the global
economic crisis taken by the Federal Reserve and central banks in
other major nations.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average ended Thursday down 216.01 at
7,873.77, halting a four-session winning streak and giving back
nearly half of the 475 points gained during that span.
	   Exactly two months after peaking at 9,337.97 on July 17, the Dow
is back below this year's break-even point, 7,908.25, and about
1,465 points, or 15.7 percent, from record terrain.
	   Broader stock indicators also took a heavy beating on Thursday
as the latest global selloff eroded much of the confidence that had
been building since Friday.
	   While Wall Street shrugged off Wednesday's congressional
testimony by Fed chairman Alan Greenspan, European markets tumbled
early Thursday as Germany's central bank held its key lending rates
unchanged, underscoring Greenspan's assertion that there's no
multinational rate cut in the works.
	   Speculation about such an initiative sprang up on Monday when
President Clinton called for the leading industrial powers to work
together to contain the fiscal crises in Asia and Russia and
stimulate the global economy.
	   Reinforcing that sentiment, finance ministers and central bank
chiefs from the world's seven richest countries issued a joint
statement that same day, stressing cooperation in dealing with the
crisis.
	   While Greenspan didn't rule out a coordinated rate cut in the
future, his remarks on Wednesday dampened hopes the Fed would lead
the way by lowering its own key rates soon.
	   ``There's no question that the market's disappointed that the
(German) Bundesbank shelved this coordinated interest rate
reduction,'' said Peter Canelo, U.S. investment strategist at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, adding that the Fed may act on its own.
	   ``They don't have much of a choice. Whether or not we go it
alone, we will lower interest rates, although it's better if we do
it in concert with everybody,'' said Canelo.
	   The global selloff sent money flowing into U.S. Treasury bonds,
a traditional haven in times of uncertainty. Yields on 30-year
Treasury bonds, a key influence on mortgage rates and other
interest rates, fell to 5.18 percent, the lowest level since the
government began selling such securities in 1977.
	   After leading the Dow's advance in recent days, financial shares
suffered some of the heaviest damage on Thursday: J.P. Morgan fell
4 1/2 to 89 3/4, American Express fell 3 3/16 to 83 7/8, and
Travelers Group fell 2 7/16 to 40 11/16. The Dow was also hurt by
IBM, down 3 3/4 to 126 3/4; Alcoa, down 3 1/8 to 57 5/16; and
Procter and Gamble, down 3 3/16 to 66 13/16.
	   The Standard and Poor's 500 fell 26.61 to 1,018.87, and the
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 43.66 to 1,642.25 as
Cisco Systems fell 3 1/8 to 61 1/2, Intel fell 2 1/16 to 83, and
Microsoft fell 3 1/4 to 104 15/16.
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume totaled 822.38
million shares, down sharply from Wednesday's pace.
	   The NYSE composite index fell 11.74 to 506.31, and the American
Stock Exchange composite index fell 7.88 to 621.25.
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 4.56 to 355.29.
	   In Tokyo, the Nikkei stock average fell 2.4 percent to a new
12-year closing low. Frankfurt's DAX index dropped 3.9 percent,
London's FT-SE 100 was down 3 percent and the CAC-40 in Paris was
down 5.5 percent.
	   The main index in Brazil fell as much as 10 percent,
automatically halting trading for a half hour, before finishing
with a loss of 4.8 percent.

Western officials try to deflate national protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania's figurehead president and
international officials are urging Albanians to disregard calls by
ex-President Sali Berisha for a nationwide protest Friday to force
the current government to resign.
	   ``We feel it will be very good for people to stay at home, so
that they are not being misused for political ends,'' said Daan
Everts, the representative of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
	   President Rexhep Meidani also issued a public appeal for calm
after meeting with Everts and other Western officials, who fear the
protest could spark unrest similar to the two days of rioting this
week that brought Albania to the brink of implosion for the second
time in 18 months.
	   Berisha remained defiant despite a parliamentary commission's
recommendation that his immunity from prosecution be stripped. If
approved by the full Parliament, the legal move means Berisha could
be arrested for fomenting the rioting that tried to topple the
government of Prime Minister Fatos Nano.
	   While also appealing for calm, Berisha accused Nano, his
longtime political foe, of seeking confrontation.
	   ``I'm not impressed by the decision'' of the parliament
commission, Berisha said Thursday night. ``Nano wants to direct the
country toward civil conflict.''
	   Berisha earlier urged supporters to demonstrate throughout the
country Friday against Nano's elected government, which he called a
Communist-style dictatorship that killed its enemies.
	   Such a reference has resonance in Albania, one of the most
hard-line Communist countries of the Soviet era. But Western
officials and many Albanians consider Berisha a power-hungry,
corrupt leader only interested in personal gain.
	   For the second straight day, about 2,000 Democratic Party
supporters held a brief, peaceful protest Thursday in Tirana's
central square to denounce the Nano government. Others were
prevented from joining it by roadblocks at key intersections, where
armed police wearing black hoods searched for weapons.
	   Police told the state news agency that 50 people were detained
Wednesday.
	   Western diplomatic sources said behind-the-scenes negotiations
Thursday involving Everts, special European Union envoy Herbert
Grubmayr and others sought a ``cooling off'' period to reduce the
threat of more violence.
	   They said Berisha's possible arrest would likely come only next
week to avoid an immediate, emotional backlash from his supporters.
	   Nano's elected government is backed by Western powers desperate
to prevent the unrest from influencing other crises in the region,
mainly the violence in neighboring Kosovo province in the Yugoslav
republic of Serbia.
	   While the parliamentary commission moved to lift the immunity
from arrest Berisha enjoys as a member of the legislature, it
decided against removing the immunity of five of his Democratic
Party allies, pending further evidence.
	   The crisis began with the slaying Saturday of popular politician
Azem Hajdari, a close aide to Berisha. Nobody has claimed
responsibility for the slaying, but Berisha immediately blamed
Nano.
	   Rioting Sunday and Monday by Berisha's supporters damaged the
parliament and prime minister's office. They briefly took over the
state television station, burned cars and looted some shops. Three
people died and scores were injured.
	   Much of Berisha's support comes from former government
functionaries and workers during his five years in power who lost
their jobs when Nano took over last year. In seeking a return to
power, Berisha has exploited outrage over Hajdari's killing and
widespread disappointment with the government's inability to revive
the economy and restore confidence in the nation's future.

In West Bank, pursuing your stolen car is a personal matter

	   EDITOR'S NOTE: Car theft is rampant in Israel, where an
automobile is snatched every 12 minutes. Now the epidemic has
spread to the Palestinian lands, where a network of thieves and
chop shops appears to flourish. Palestinian police do little to
recover stolen vehicles, so owners often take matters into their
own hands. An Associated Press reporter whose car was stolen in the
West Bank describes her efforts to get it back.
	   ___
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ The call came less than 24 hours
after my car was stolen in broad daylight just two blocks from the
Palestinian police station.
	   ``Did you lose a car?'' the mystery caller asked.
	   It was the beginning of my odyssey into the car-theft underworld
in Ramallah, the commercial capital of the West Bank.
	   A day earlier, on a busy Saturday, I had parked my car _ a
popular Japanese model, light blue, a bit battered _ in the middle
of downtown about 1:30 p.m. When I returned an hour later after
running errands, it was gone.
	   I was incredulous. The car was 10 years old, a clunker.
	   That, I was to learn, was part of its appeal. The make I owned
was known for its simple locks. Apprentice thieves like to practice
on them. Its parts are in high demand.
	   This was one of a number of lessons I'd be learning about the
West Bank car-theft trade.
	   ___
	   I reported the car stolen. Standing behind a battered wooden
counter, the desk sergeant at the Ramallah police station advised
me to take out a newspaper ad describing the car and providing a
contact number.
	   That, he said, might bring a call from a middleman who _ for a
fee _ might help me get my car back.
	   The ad appeared the next day. So did my caller.
	   The man who contacted me asked for a meeting outside a taxi
company in the center of town, near falafel joints and discount
clothing stores. He described himself so I would be able to find
him _ tall, skinny, with a light complexion _ but never told me his
name.
	   I insisted we walk, unwilling to get into a car with a stranger
with obvious underworld ties. For the next two hours, in scorching
heat, the middleman took me on a tour of four lots full of stolen
cars that were now for sale, thinking we might spot mine.
	   He rattled off prices of cars, all with brand-new fake plates,
just in case I'd be ready to give up my search and buy another car.
Seeing how tired I was getting, he bought me a soda.
	   We didn't find my car.
	   It was time to start visiting thieves.
	   ___
	   Car theft is a big business in Israel. Last year, more than
45,000 vehicles were stolen, double the figure from three years
ago. Most end up in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, where they are
sold or stripped for parts.
	   The epidemic has driven up insurance rates, along with Israeli
resentment _ especially because Palestinian police often look the
other way or even license stolen cars.
	   Until recently, car thefts in the Palestinian areas were rare.
But Israeli security forces have been cracking down on car theft,
raiding chop shops and used-car lots in areas of the West Bank
still under Israeli control.
	   Prompted by the thefts, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
government has come up with a plan to create an obstacle course of
boulders, concrete walls and electronic devices separating Israel
and the West Bank.
	   Feeling the heat, the car thieves are looking closer to home.
	   ___
	   None of the Ramallah thieves I talked to had my car _ or would
admit to having it. But they gave me lots of tips.
	   One, a man in his early 20s, said he hadn't seen my car, but
said if I'd come a couple days earlier, he could have sold me a
nice 1997 Opel with the keys still in the ignition for only dlrs
500 (1930 new Israeli shekels). He'd obviously done well for
himself, judging by a large screen TV and new furniture in his
living room.
	   Another thief, balding and elderly, said he'd keep an eye open.
He knew of several cars of the same make that had been stolen
recently.
	   I was advised to check the Amari refugee camp south of Ramallah,
where unemployment is high and many men cannot get permission to
work in Israel. Some are dealing in stolen cars, I was told.
	   Another tip: tour chop shops in villages around Ramallah,
especially in Qibiya, a remote place west of the city.
	   Still no luck. Finally, my middleman said it was time to
introduce me to someone else. That was Hashim, the ``main man'' in
the Ramallah stolen-car scene.
	   ___
	   He was a little man, dressed in sweatpants and a T-shirt. He
greeted us in his living room, furnished with carpets and
overstuffed sofas.
	   Hashim was solicitous, insisting I have a cup of tea, telling me
not to worry.
	   ``We don't have it, but I'll make calls to the others,'' he said
reassuringly. ``And if we don't find it, it's chopped up.''
	   If that turned out to be the case, he said, I still had no cause
for concern. For about dlrs 600 (2,316 new Israeli shekels), he
could get me a car of exactly the same make and color.
	   And it would have forged license plate and a fake serial number
to match the ones on my stolen car. That way, he said, I could
renew my Israeli license for it. It would be as if the theft had
never happened.
	   Unacceptable, I told him. Impossible.
	   He laughed.
	   I'm still waiting for news.

25 years after end of war, search for remains continues

	   THANH SON, Vietnam (AP) _ The face of the missing pilot stares
out from the black-and-white photo stuck to a bulletin board.
	   Nearby, U.S. soldiers and Vietnamese civilians dig methodically,
under an nthropologist's supervision, seeking bones, teeth or
anything else that will confirm that the pilot was buried here
after his jet crashed 33 years ago.
	   It's grueling, expensive and sometimes fruitless work. But the
photo reminds the Americans that this was one of their own, a man
with relatives who live with uncertainty.
	   ``When I'm sitting in a rocking chair with my grandkids, I can
say I didn't serve in Vietnam, but I helped a lot of families,''
said Sgt. George Hampton of Chicago, second-in-command of this dig.
	   Overall, 2,081 Americans still are listed as missing in action
23 years after the Vietnam War ended although many were known to be
lost over water. Of those, 1,554 are in Vietnam; the rest are in
Laos and Cambodia. Many veteran organizations in the United States
were planning events Friday to honor the missing. Defense Secretary
William Cohen was to preside over a Pentagon ceremony.
	   All cases of ``last known alive'' have been investigated at
least once, and U.S. officials say there is no credible evidence
that Americans still are being held. Vietnam says it handed over
all prisoners of war in 1973.
	   There are about four excavation operations each year in Vietnam,
with several teams flown in from Hawaii to dig simultaneously.
	   In between, the full-time U.S. staff in Hanoi interviews
witnesses, goes through documents released by the Vietnamese
government and decides the best prospects for future searches.
	   ``Never before has there been such an intense, continuing effort
to account for MIAs,'' said Lt. Col. Matt Martin, head of the U.S.
MIA office in Hanoi.
	   The last digs, June 23-July 25, yielded seven sets of remains
that were sent to the military's Central Identification Laboratory
in Hawaii for positive identification.
	   The recovery work is getting harder. Most of the easier sites
already have been examined. Urban sprawl covers some; others are
under water. The hot, humid conditions speed decay.
	   In one case, a team used 10,000 sandbags to divert a stream and
rented an elephant to help with the heavy work.
	   In Laos, a mountainous crash site was so inaccessible that a
helicopter landing pad had to be built from logs. Each day the
chopper shuttled workers, with one landing skid on the pad, the
other over air.
	   For 20 years, American concerns over Vietnam's cooperation in
recovering the remains of MIAs impeded normalization of relations
between the two countries. The countries finally opened embassies
in each other's capital in 1995, and U.S. Ambassador Pete Peterson
is a former POW.
	   Martin says the Vietnamese government has been cooperative,
although there occasionally are problems dealing with local
officials.
	   Relations have improved dramatically since 1988, when the first
U.S. team was allowed to visit but its members were viewed as
spies.
	   ``Today, we can go more or less where we want,'' Martin said.
``The Vietnamese have given us hundreds of documents that we never
thought we'd see, for instance on how the prison camps were run.''
	   The government has made it illegal to hold on to remains and has
taken out newspaper ads encouraging people to cooperate, even
though payment is limited to ``reasonable costs'' related to
recovery.
	   Some 602 cases have been designated as ``no further pursuit.''
They remain open, but all leads have been exhausted.
	   The current monthlong search involves 16 sites _ six primaries
and 10 alternatives _ in 10 provinces. As a team finishes one site,
it moves on to another.
	   The site in Pho Tho province's Thanh Son district is on the side
of a hill a half-hour drive on a rutted dirt road from the nearest
village, then a 15-minute uphill hike.
	   The report on the case is just more than a page long, compiled
from interviews with fellow pilots and Vietnamese civilians.
	   As part of Operation Rolling Thunder, several jets were
providing cover for bombers hitting a North Vietnamese ammunition
factory northwest of Hanoi when they came under attack from
surface-to-air missiles.
	   One F-4C was hit. The copilot ejected and was taken captive.
After his release nearly eight years later, he said the pilot went
down. Local villagers said they hurriedly buried the remains,
fearing a follow-up air assault.
	   The site already has been excavated twice. But memories fade,
and the unmarked grave has been hard to find. The last dig found a
tooth fragment, some 2.38-caliber rounds, a 1965 penny, part of a
watchband and a piece of a helmet shell _ not enough to close the
case.
	   The digging is relatively shallow, using a trenching method that
looks for aberrations in the soil indicating a burial site.
	   While state-of-the-art technology like the ground-penetrating
radar could be useful in some places, boulders and roots here mean
the work must be done by hand _ picks, shovels and
quarter-inch-gauge screens.
	   When remains are found, there is a huge sense of relief. Often,
the Vietnamese workers will hold a Buddhist ceremony at the scene
and make a sacrifice of a water buffalo.
	   If this dig doesn't yield evidence, ``We'll get the witnesses
back and go through it again,'' said Dr. Brad Stern, the
anthropologist on the 12-person U.S. team that supervises about 90
Vietnamese. ``But to come along 25-30 years later and ask them to
try to find the site is difficult.''
	   And at some point, if all the leads fail to pan out, there could
be a decision to give up.
	   ``It's extremely sad, because in some cases, the family is not
going to get their loved one back,'' Stern said. ``You give it your
best shot.''

	   HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (AP) _ Do Thi Kim Hong has no team of
forensic specialists and only the money she can cajole from friends
and relatives.
	   Still, the 50-year-old former nurse vows to continue her
personal search for the remains of Vietnamese listed as missing in
action from the Vietnam War until she no longer can dig. So far,
she estimates she has found about 1,000.
	   While the cases of the 2,081 American MIAs from the Vietnam War
have garnered considerable international attention, some 300,000
Vietnamese still are listed as MIA.
	   The Vietnamese government, trying to raise the standard of
living for one of the world's poorest countries, has higher
priorities than committing the sizeable resources that would be
necessary to find them.
	   Some official efforts continue, occasionally with information
provided by former U.S. soldiers, but Hong's crusade is the most
intense. She toiled in relative obscurity for 12 years, seeking
remains of North and South Vietnamese soldiers, until she was given
a medal in March.
	   Hong has focused her efforts on Tay Ninh province, near the
Cambodian border. It was there that a bomb from an American B-52
bomber fell on a North Vietnamese camp, killed all 18 of her
colleagues and left her temporarily paralyzed with a neck injury.
	   She recovered and had two children, suffered a relapse in
1977-78 and finally sneaked out of the hospital in 1986 after
managing to walk again on crutches. She found herself drawn back to
Tay Ninh.
	   ``At the time, I thought I couldn't contribute to society
because of my health,'' Hong said. ``Looking for my comrades was
the one thing I could do. It's hard for me to explain why I have
pursued this so long. My conscience kept pushing me even when I
didn't have money.''
	   Early on, people tried to persuade her to stop, Hong said,
thinking she was crazy. ``Now, I think my family supports me,'' she
said.
	   She uses hand-sketched maps that she makes in small notebooks,
based on her memories of battles and interviews. She shows
photographs of dozens of piles of remains laid out near dig sites.
	   The general lack of dogtags for Vietnamese soldiers means that
Hong looks for names etched on canteens or written on a sheet of
paper and stuffed in a plastic tube, something soldiers sometimes
did before a battle. Only a third of the remains she has found have
been identified.
	   She hires three to six workers each time she goes out. ``Because
I'm a volunteer, I bear all the costs,'' she said. ``Sometimes the
goverment contributes, but not much.''
	   She said she has been lucky so far, considering the number of
unexploded bombs or land mines.
	   ``I have stepped on mines that haven't exploded,'' she said. ``I
have collected so many mines and asked the government to come get
them, but sometimes they're slow, so I keep them at home.''
	   While she keeps finding remains, she has not been able to search
for the body of her father, who died in Cambodia. ``To travel that
far takes a lot of money, but I'm still hoping to find him.''

Preliminary VX results in, UN mum on what they say
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations has received
preliminary, unofficial results of tests of Iraqi warheads
suspected of carrying the deadly VX gas, but U.N. officials refused
Thursday to characterize the findings.
	   The officials say they won't know until the final results come
in if the tests in French and Swiss laboratories back findings by a
U.S. army lab that missile fragments had traces of the deadly nerve
agent.
	   A French official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
preliminary results were ``inconclusive,'' because not all the
tests were complete.
	   Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler has said that even
if the French and Swiss labs don't turn up traces of VX, Baghdad
still has to answer for the findings by the Aberdeen Proving Ground
laboratory.
	   The lab disclosed in June that it found traces of VX in
fragments of missile warheads that Iraq had filled before the 1991
Gulf war. A few drops of the nerve agent can kill a person.
	   Butler agreed to test other fragments at Swiss and French labs
after Iraq disputed the U.S. findings.
	   Baghdad has acknowledged it tried to produce VX but was never
able to make enough of it, or stabilize it sufficiently, to load it
into weapons.
	   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Thursday the final results from
the European labs weren't expected until the end of the month.
	   The Swiss and French labs are working off about 40 swipes from
fragments of about 43 to 45 missile warheads that were destroyed
during the war or right after.
	   Most of the parts were recovered at al-Nibai, the site where
Iraq in 1991 unilaterally destroyed and buried warheads designed to
carry chemical weapons.
	   Severe U.N. trade sanctions imposed against Iraq for its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990, which led to the Gulf War, will not be
lifted until U.N. arms monitors certify that Baghdad has eliminated
all its banned weapons.

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ After his campaign of humble contrition,
President Bill Clinton's videotaped testimony promises to resurrect
the picture of a man who dodged answers, split legal hairs and
fumed at prosecutors. That is not the image the White House wants
Americans to remember.
	   Clinton's lieutenants worry the tape could undermine the
carefully nurtured appearance of a president seeking forgiveness.
Also, that snippets from the four hours will wind up in Republican
ads before the Nov. 3 election and contribute to Democratic
defeats.
	   On the other hand, Americans are telling pollsters
overwhelmingly that they are tired of this scandal, sick of the
details and don't want to see the videotapes. Some analysts believe
the tapes' release could reinforce the impression that Kenneth
Starr is an overzealous prosecutor asking needlessly embarrassing
questions of the president.
	   ``At the end of the day it's not going to be that damaging to
him (Clinton) and may end up ironically more damaging to Starr and
the Republicans,'' said Marvin Kalb, director of a Harvard
University center on press and public policy.
	   Kathleen Jamieson, a communications expert at the University of
Pennsylvania, said the videotape, expected to be released soon,
could affect public opinion if the prosecutors' questions appear
unfair or invasive, or if Clinton is too legalistic or
uncomfortable.
	   ``To the extent this appears to be a fair and judicious process,
this could be damaging to Clinton,'' she said. ``If (Starr) is
unfair and injudicious, Clinton is helped. Clinton is a very
powerful communicator. The question is, did he retain that capacity
in these answers.''
	   Clinton testified in the White House Map Room on Aug. 17 and
then went before the nation that night with a televised address
that was considered a public relations disaster even by his closest
allies. He was still angry about intrusive questions from Starr's
prosecutors and it showed. Clinton later said publicly he had not
been contrite enough, and he went on to say he had sinned and
repented.
	   Attorneys familiar with Clinton's testimony say he was at times
angry and defiant, struggling uncomfortably to answer some
questions and at one point accusing prosecutors of trying to
criminalize his private life.
	   Democrats have been complaining that Clinton's attorneys, in
trying to protect him from perjury charges, have been relying on
absurdly contorted definitions of what constitutes sex.
	   Clinton may face the same criticism about his testimony.
	   ``You are free to infer that my testimony is that I did not have
sexual relations, as I understood this term to be defined,''
Clinton testified, according to the Starr report.
	   Another time he said: ``It depends on how you define 'alone.'
... There were a lot of times when we were alone, but I never
really thought we were.''
	   Asked why he had not corrected his attorney who said on Jan. 17
that ``there is absolutely no sex of any kind in any manner, shape
or form,'' Clinton responded with a discussion of definitions. ``It
depends on what the meaning of `is' is,'' the president began.
	   White House officials have not seen the tape but already are
mounting a counterattack.
	   Clinton lieutenant Rahm Emanuel said, ``The one thing you learn
from this tape release is this is more about the loss of
bipartisanship in Congress and the emergence of partisanship.''

Dollar falls, Tokyo stocks rise in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The dollar was sharply lower against the yen in
early Asian trading on Friday following a big drop in U.S. stocks
overnight. Tokyo share prices rose moderately.
	   The U.S. dollar was trading at 131.72 yen, down 2.58 yen from
its level of 134.30 late in Tokyo on Thursday and below its rate of
132.18 late in New York.
	   The dollar continued a decline that began overseas on worries
about losses in the U.S. stock market.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 216.01 points, or 2.7
percent, to 7,873.77, leaving it back below where it began the
year, at 7,908.25.
	   U.S. stocks plunged after investors in Asia and Europe pushed
markets lower on Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's denial
that world finance leaders had agreed to cut interest rates.
	   The dollar was also under pressure as some Japanese businesses
began selling the U.S. currency for yen to bring money home before
the end of the fiscal half-year on Sept. 30.
	   The companies are selling dollar-denominated securities and
assets to beef up their balance sheets before mid-year financial
reports, traders said.
	   On the Tokyo stock exchange, shares rebounded from an early
decline as market participants focused on a crucial government
debate on a series of bank bills.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 105.55 points,
or 0.76 percent, in the first hour of trading to 13,964.69.
	   The rebound followed a huge decline on Thursday, when the Nikkei
closed down 338.56 points, or 2.38 percent, to a 12-year low of
13,859.14. Thursday's finish for the Nikkei was the lowest since
March 5, 1986, when it closed at 13,807.46.
	   After marathon meetings that lasted until dawn Friday, Japan's
opposition parties rejected a compromise proposed by the ruling
party on its banking reform bills.
	   The main sticking point has been the governing party's
controversial plan to use taxpayer money to bail out the
cash-strapped Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, one of the nation's
largest banks.
	   Both sides agreed to resume negotiations later Friday.
	   The ruling party is under pressure to forge an agreement so
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi can present a solid plan to deal with
the nation's banking crisis when he meets with U.S. President Bill
Clinton next Tuesday in the United States.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 0.87 points, or 0.08 percent, to 1,068.19. On
Thursday, the TOPIX closed down 18.44 points, or 1.69 percent, to
1,069.06.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to another record low of 0.645 percent from
0.665 percent on Thursday, driving its price up to 115.74 from
115.60 yen.

New poll: Labor gaining, public losing faith in conservatives' tax
</HEADLINE>
reform &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The Labor opposition is ahead of Prime
Minister John Howard's governing conservatives as the favored party
in the Oct. 3 national election but the race is too close to call,
a new poll said Friday.
	   Labor now leads at 52 percent, a rise of 3 percent since last
week, while support for Howard's conservatives fell 3 points to 48
percent, the ACNielsen poll published in the the Sydney Morning
Herald said.
	   The poll, conducted Tuesday and Wednesday among 1,960 voters,
had a margin of error of about 2 percent, so the parliamentary race
is still to close to call.
	   But the trend was ominous for Howard and his conservatives
halfway through the campaign, as they lost momentum.
	   Even more seriously, the voters polled are turning against their
key campaign issue, the introduction of a 10 percent goods and
services tax in exchange for lower income tax rates.
	   Disapproval for the tax reform was up 10 percent, to 52 percent.
	   Reflecting the trend in public opinion, a report released Friday
by four prominent economists said imposing a 10 percent tax on food
would be unfair and would hit poorer Australians the hardest.
	   The study from the Australia Institute says Howard's proposed
goods and services tax would be a major cause of inequity.
	   James Cook University economist John Quiggin said low-income
households would pay billions of dollars in food taxes because the
government was incapable of distinguishing between a bag of
groceries and a restaurant meal.
	   Howard rejected suggestions of any revolt within his party ranks
over the goods and services tax.
	   ``There is no disquiet,'' Howard told a Melbourne radio station.
``We are facing the reality unless this country reforms its tax
system it will go further down as things get worse overseas.''
	   He said the tax would make Australia more competitive at a time
of international economic uncertainty.
	   But some members of the rural conservative National Party, the
junior partner in the governing coalition, fear the new tax will
boost gasoline, fuel and telephone costs in the outback among their
constituents.
	   ACNielson's poll also shows that Labor leader Kim Beazley was
the clear winner of last Sunday's nationally televised debate,
polling at 38 percent, 15 percent ahead of John Howard, while 30
percent declared the debate a draw.
	   There was little movement in support for the minor parties, with
the Democrats down 1 percent to 3 percent and the right-wing
populist One Nation party unchanged at 8 percent, the poll said.
	   Labor needs to win an additional 27 seats to win government, a
feat no Australian opposition party has ever achieved.
	   In the House of Representatives, Howard's governing Liberal
Party and rural National coalition holds 90 seats, the Labor Party
holds 49, independents 8 and the Northern Territory's Country
Liberal Party, 1.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The World Wide Fund for Nature said Friday it is
trying to help save tigers and rhinoceroses in flood-stricken
Kaziranga National Park in India's northeastern Assam state.
	   WWF said some 31 Asian one-horned rhinos were among the animals
that died as a result of the flooding. The park is home to 60
percent of India's 1,500 one-horned rhinos and to about 80 tigers.
	   It did not report that any tigers had drowned, but said 20
endangered wild buffalo and six elephants were among the animals
killed.
	   Not all the rhinos drowned, it said. Five were killed by
poachers at the height of the crisis, when flood waters peaked
Sept. 4-7.
	   WWF said aid it is supplying should help park guards combat
poachers of tigers and rhinos.
	   The organization said it had sent communications equipment,
night-vision binoculars and a small truck as well as money to buy
boats to add the the fleet of 30 already in use.
	   WWF said it is providing a tranquilizer gun to sedate marooned
animals so that they can be moved to safety.

Ruling party, opposition meet again to seek bank reform compromise

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ After a series of fruitless negotiations overnight,
Japan's ruling and opposition parties struggled Friday to find a
compromise on banking reform in time for Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi's visit to the United States next week.
	   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Friday he wanted the two
sides to reach a compromise by the end of the day, warning that
delay could further roil already jittery financial markets.
	   Shares of major Japanese banks were lower in generally bearish
trading early Friday as the parties struggled to reach accord on
bills to stabilize the nation's shaky financial institutions.
	   Lawmakers met through the night, but called negotiations off at
5:00 a.m. (2000 Thursday) after failing to reach an agreement.
	   Obuchi's Liberal Democratic Party is seeking passage in
Parliament of a series of bills to speed the clean up of the
banking industry's bad loans.
	   But the opposition, which controls enough seats in the upper
house of Japan's bicameral legislature to block the bills, has
demanded several significant changes.
	   One of the biggest points of contention is curtailing the scope
of Japan's powerful Finance Ministry. The opposition has said it
will only agree to the bills if they include measures giving
oversight of financial markets from the ministry to some new
finance committee.
	   Talks have also stalled over the use of public money to bail out
ailing banks. LDP proposals have called for bailing out banks
before they fail to engineer a ``soft landing'' and avoid shocks to
the financial system.
	   Opposition leader Naoto Kan, of the Democratic Party, had called
this an irresponsible use of taxpayers funds, saying the government
should only step in after banks fail to protect depositors and
healthy borrowers.
	   Kan has also demanded greater disclosure of a failed bank's
financial records, the resignation of executives and writing off as
many bad loans as possible using stockholders' capital before
introducing taxpayers' money.
	   These issues came to a head over the LDP proposal to use public
money to bail out the cash-strapped Long-Term Credit Bank, one of
the nation's largest lenders.
	   Japanese newspapers reported the two sides were nearing an
agreement to nationalize the bank while its bad loans are sold off
_ effectively proclaiming it bankrupt.
	   Obuchi is under pressure to reach a compromise on the banking
bills before he meets President Bill Clinton Tuesday in New York.
	   Top U.S. officials, such as Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky, who visited Tokyo this week, have criticized Japan for
dragging its feet and not doing more to revive its economy and ease
the economic crisis in Asia.
	   The impasse over the bills has roiled world financial markets by
stirring fears that Japan will not be able to pull itself out of
its worst recession in 50 years.

Giant metal lizard blocks Jabiluka uranium mine site
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ An old car dressed up to look like a
frill-necked lizard blocked the entrance to the Jabiluka uranium
mine site inside the borders of Kakadu National Park on Friday.
	   A dozen protesters opposed to the uranium mine chained
themselves to the car-lizard about 4 a.m., according to blockade
spokeswoman Kerry Nettle.
	   She said it represented the animals in the surrounding Kakadu
park which would be endangered by the construction of a uranium
mine which is expected to extract almost 20 million metric tons of
uranium ore over 28 years.
	   Mine builder Energy Resources of Australia has denied the mine,
which it says will inject 6.2 billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs
3.7 billion) into the Australian economy, will have any adverse
impact on Kakadu.
	   Senior Police Sgt. Alan Thomson of the nearby Jabiru police said
the protesters locked on to the car will be removed by police.
	   Thomson said the car looked like a lizard ``with the help of a
lot of imagination.''
	   Federal opposition leader Kim Beazley confirmed Thursday that
the Labor Party would stop Jabiluka being built if it won
government at the Oct. 3 national election.

 &UR; Always a top finisher, but Fredericks misses the gold
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS to ``near misses'' sted ``nearly misses'' in graf 3. &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Again, the gold slipped his grasp.
Sprinter Frankie Fredericks of Namibia burst out of the starting
blocks but ended in a familiar spot.
	   Second.
	   The Namibian star handily dispatches most opponents, but there
always seems to be a track star who prevails over him at the most
prestigious events. In an amazing series of near misses, he won
silver at the last two Olympics in both the 100 and 200 meters.
	   At the Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur on Thursday, his
nemesis was Ato Boldon of Trinidad and Tobago, who won the 100
meters in 9.88 seconds. Fredericks was .08 seconds behind, a
sizeable gap at that pace.
	   Obadele Thompson of Barbados, who ran 9.87 at altitude in
Johannesburg on Friday, was third in 10.00.
	   ``It is frustrating,'' Fredericks said of his frequent role as
runner up on the medal podium. ``All I know is that every time I
step on the track I try my best.''
	   Fredericks, a former soccer player who turns 31 next month,
nearly didn't make it to the games in Kuala Lumpur. He was angry
that his prime minister now considered him Namibia's second best
sportsman behind a boxer because he had failed to win an Olympic
gold.
	   ``I'm happy that I came here despite all the circumstances,''
said Fredericks, who shrugged off his failure to win any major
international 100-meter title.
	   ``I'm not going to do anything that is not within myself to win
the title,'' he said without bitterness. ``If I retire without the
title, then so be it. But I'm just going to keep trying and train
harder and hopefully one day I'll win.''
	   With his shaved head and brush moustache, Fredericks is a
popular figure even among fans unfamiliar with track. The stadium
crowd roared whenever his image appeared on a giant television
screen, and he raised his arms in acknowledgement.
	   Fredericks, graceful on the track and an unassuming personality
off it, is no stranger to victory. He won the 200-meter gold in the
1993 world championships as well as at the 1994 Commonwealth Games
in Victoria, British Columbia.
	   At the 1996 Bislett meet in Oslo, Norway, he ended Michael
Johnson's two-year winning streak in the same distance.
	   But he was a silver medalist in the 200 meters at the world
championships in 1991, 1995 and 1997.
	   Boldon, a 24-year-old whose brash, showboating style contrasts
with Fredericks' low-key demeanor, paid tribute to his older rival.
	   ``This is not an easy game that we play out there,'' Bolden
said. ``It's really tough sometimes to beat your friends.''

Daimler shareholders vote on merger
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Shareholders meeting opens at 0800 GMT. Vote will follow
shareholder comments, expected to extend into the night. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Before Daimler Benz shareholders vote
Friday on the megamerger with Chrysler, they'll grill chief
executive Juergen Schrempp on details of the dlrs 38 billion deal,
in particular about whether he's in for a hefty pay raise.
	   The disparity in executive pay between Germany and the United
States is a chief shareholder concern going into the vote. Some
fear Daimler managers will use the merger to raise their income.
	   Last year, Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton took home dlrs 16
million in total compensation, compared to about dlrs 2 million for
Schrempp.
	   Some shareholders with union ties also worry about
merger-related layoffs, despite promises from both chiefs that no
one will lose his or her job.
	   And there are concerns the merger might dull the image of
Daimler's Mercedes brand. How, one watchdog asked, will Schrempp
and Eaton be able to keep the Chrysler and Mercedes brands separate
if, at the same time, they speak about large synergy effects from
sharing platforms and merging their purchasing?
	   Spokesmen for Germany's biggest industrial firm expected the
comment phase of the shareholders meeting to extend into the night.
Their only deadline: the vote on the merger must be held before
midnight.
	   With the stakes so high, thousands of shareholders were expected
to attend. For example: A record 14,000 shareholders attended the
annual meeting in May after the merger was announced, and addressed
the board of directors until 10:30 p.m.
	   During that meeting, executives demurred from any discussion of
the merger _ putting it off until the day of vote.
	   Analysts expect that shareholders in both Germany and the United
States will approve the merger. Chrysler shareholders also vote on
the deal Friday, but most will vote by mail or on the Internet and
the meeting in Delaware is expected to be brief.
	   Despite concerns about high U.S. salaries, analysts expect
Daimler to raise executive pay over the next few years to prevent
top performers from defecting to other companies.
	   Executives will be trying to appease shareholders' concerns
during the meeting not only to get approval for the merger, but
also to encourage voluntary participation in the stock swap.
	   Both Daimler and Chrysler want 90 percent of the shareholders to
turn in their shares for shares in the new company later this
month, although they only need 75 percent. The higher level will
enable the companies to use the more favorable ``pooling of
interests'' accounting method.
	   If less than 75 percent participate, Daimler and Chrysler said
they will have to cancel the whole deal.

New poll: Labor gaining, but race still too close to call
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The Labor opposition is ahead of Prime
Minister John Howard's governing conservatives as the favored party
in the Oct. 3 national election but the race is still too close to
call, a new poll said Friday.
	   Labor now leads at 52 percent, a rise of 3 percent since last
week, while support for Howard's conservatives fell 3 points to 48
percent, the ACNielsen poll published in the the Sydney Morning
Herald said.
	   The poll, conducted Tuesday and Wednesday among 1,960 voters,
had a margin of error of about 2 percent, making it impossible to
predict a winner in the parliamentary election.
	   Still, the trend was ominous for Howard and his conservatives
halfway through the campaign, as they lost momentum.
	   Even more seriously, the voters polled are turning against the
conservatives' key campaign issue, the introduction of a 10 percent
goods and services tax in exchange for lower income tax rates.
	   Disapproval for the tax reform was up 10 percent, to 52 percent.
	   Reflecting public opinion, a report released Friday by four
prominent economists said imposing a 10 percent tax on food would
be unfair and would hit poorer Australians the hardest.
	   The study from the Australia Institute says Howard's proposed
goods and services tax would be a major cause of inequity.
	   James Cook University economist John Quiggin said low-income
households would pay billions of dollars in food taxes because the
government was incapable of distinguishing between a bag of
groceries and a restaurant meal.
	   Howard rejected suggestions of any revolt within his party ranks
over the goods and services tax.
	   ``There is no disquiet,'' Howard told a Melbourne radio station.
``We are facing the reality unless this country reforms its tax
system it will go further down as things get worse overseas.''
	   He said the tax would make Australia more competitive at a time
of international economic uncertainty.
	   But some members of the rural conservative National Party, the
junior partner in the governing coalition, fear the new tax will
boost gasoline, fuel and telephone costs in the rural outback among
their constituents.
	   ACNielson's poll also shows that Labor leader Kim Beazley was
the clear winner of last Sunday's nationally televised debate,
polling at 38 percent, 15 percent ahead of John Howard, while 30
percent declared the debate a draw.
	   There was little movement in support for the minor parties, with
the Democrats down 1 percent to a level of 3 percent and the
right-wing populist One Nation party unchanged at 8 percent, the
poll said.
	   Labor needs to win an additional 27 seats to win government, a
feat no Australian opposition party has ever achieved.
	   In the House of Representatives, Howard's governing Liberal
Party and rural National coalition holds 90 seats, the Labor Party
holds 49, independents 8 and the Northern Territory's Country
Liberal Party, 1.

With four kisses, 63rd homer ball goes back to ``Mr. Sammy''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERNIE WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ With four kisses, the man who caught Sammy
Sosa's 63rd home run gave it to the Chicago star with heart-felt
exuberance.
	   Fabian Perez Mercado of Tijuana, Mexico, held up the ball,
kissed it and had his wife and two young children do the same. He
gave the ball to his 2-year-old son, Carlos Fabian Perez, to hand
to the Dominican hero.
	   ``Viva Dominican Republic! Viva Mexico! Viva baseball!'' Perez
Mercado said Thursday.
	   Sosa had launched the ball into the second deck of Qualcomm
Stadium on a dramatic tiebreaking grand slam with two outs in the
eighth inning Wednesday night, pulling back into a tie with Mark
McGwire.
	   ``It's a real honor, especially to be here with all his family,
and this is something that really, really breaks my heart,'' Sosa
said. ``I mean, I have to say that this man right here, it is
amazing he comes to me with all his family and gives me the ball
and also make everybody kiss the ball first. That's something
unbelievable.''
	   The 32-year-old Perez Mercado, a supervisor at a bakery, clearly
enjoyed the moment.
	   ``Sincerely, we wish to give this ball to Mr. Sammy,'' Perez
Mercado said. ``Sammy Sosa is No. 1, Mark McGwire is No. 1 and
baseball is the No. 1 American game.''
	   For his generosity, Perez Mercado will get two jerseys, two
gloves, a bat, two balls, five caps _ all signed _ plus seven prime
tickets for each of the Padres' home games in the first round of
the playoffs.
	   ``For me, it is nice,'' Sosa said. ``This ball is really, really
important to me.''
	   Sosa still hasn't gotten back his 62nd home run ball, which he
hit out of Wrigley Field on Sunday during a two-homer performance
that pulled him even with McGwire. If Sosa gets the ball, he said
he'll give it to the Hall of Fame.
	   ``Probably this ball, if not to the Hall of Fame, I'm going to
give it to my mother,'' Sosa said.
	   Sosa's grand slam, his third of the season, came on Mexican
Independence Day.
	   ``I come out here to a number of games when there is a hot Latin
player,'' said Perez Mercado, born in the same state as Fernando
Valenzuela. ``Sammy is an example for everybody in Latin America.''
	   The family was sitting in loge section 9, row 8, seats 16, 17
and 18. Perez Mercado said he plays baseball for his company team,
``and I know my first action is to go back!''
	   Sosa was still high-fiving teammates after the slam when Perez
Mercado emerged from a tangle of bodies, waving homer ball No. 63.
	   ``The ball bounced to me exactly in front in the next chair. The
first person to take the ball, I am!'' He said he braced himself at
one point by putting his hands on someone's head, and heard that
person cry out in pain.
	   The crowd of nearly 50,000 went wild when Sosa homered.
	   Padres players, meanwhile, were angry that the organization
flashed congratulations to Sosa on the four scoreboards in the park
after the historic shot that led to a 6-3 Cubs' win. Also, a burst
of fireworks was shot off. One club employee said that was
inadvertent.

Dollar falls, Tokyo's main stock index bounces back moderately
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Nikkei's morning close, midday dollar and bond

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The dollar fell against the yen Friday morning in
Tokyo following a sharp drop overnight in U.S. stocks. Tokyo share
prices bounced back moderately.
	   The U.S. dollar bought 131.12 yen in midday trading, down 2.18
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its rate of 132.18
late in New York overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 60.49 points,
or 0.44 percent, to 13,919.63 at the end of the morning session.
The rebound followed a large decline on Thursday, when the Nikkei
closed down 338.56 points, or 2.38 percent, to a 12-year low of
13,859.14.
	   Traders said the dollar's weakness carried over from its similar
trend in New York on Thursday following a renewed decline in U.S.
and Latin American share prices.
	   The dollar was also under pressure as some Japanese businesses
began selling the U.S. currency for yen to bring money home and
beef up their balance sheets before the end of the fiscal half-year
on Sept. 30.
	   Minoru Shioiri, assistant foreign exchange manager at Nippon
Credit Bank, said the dollar also came under pressure from
lingering speculation about a possible U.S. interest rate cut.
Lower rates hurt a country's currency by lowering returns for
investors.
	   On the stock market, the Nikkei 225 average rebounded from an
early decline as selling pressure eased ahead of Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi's visit to the United States, traders said. Some
investors bought shares at bargains following recent falls.
	   Investors are hoping that Japan's ruling and opposition parties
will reach a compromise on banking reform in time for Obuchi's
visit to the United States next week, traders said.
	   The main sticking point has been the governing party's
controversial plan to use taxpayer money to bail out the
cash-strapped Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, one of the nation's
largest banks.
	   Both sides agreed to resume negotiations later Friday.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 2.22 points, or 0.21 percent, to 1,066.84. On
Thursday, the TOPIX closed down 18.44 points, or 1.69 percent, to
1,069.06.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 0.670 percent from 0.665 percent on
Thursday, driving its price down 115.55 from 115.60 yen.

O'Neill chasing Mary T. Meagher

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ As a child Susie O'Neill was
content to have Mary T. Meagher's autograph. As an adult nearing
the end of her swimming career she wants a lot more _ like the
American's world 200-meter butterfly record.
	   O'Neill became the greatest swimmer in Commonwealth Games
history Thursday when she won her 10th gold medal.
	   The fact she won the 200 fly was not unexpected _ she is the
Olympic and world champion.
	   But O'Neill, tired after eight events yielding six golds and two
silvers, saved her best for last and went surprisingly close to
Meagher's enduring record.
	   O'Neill's 2:06.60 was the second fastest all-time swim behind
Meagher's 1981 record of 2:05.96, the oldest pool record.
	   Meagher was 15 when she set her record. O'Neill is 25 and will
retire after the Sydney Olympics.
	   ``I met her when I was 12, she came to our state titles and I've
got her autograph at home in the back of my competitor's pass,''
O'Neill said Thursday.
	   O'Neill has never seen Meagher on tape and believes she was
``just at the right place at the right time'' to set such a
long-standing mark.
	   ``There's still a bit more work to do really and I haven't got
many chances so I better hurry up,'' O'Neill said. ``It's hard to
know if I'll be right by Pan Pacs next year, my last chance might
have to be Sydney. I'll just do my best and see if I can get it.''
	   No doubt any record bid will be surrounded by the enormous hype
at home that has shadowed her Commonwealth hunt for 10 golds.
	   The brilliant butterfly swimmer was under intense pressure as
she chased compatriot Mike Wenden's record of 10 golds across three
Commonwealth games.
	   ``I found it pretty hard especially this afternoon, it was all
going through my head the 10 golds and the record,'' O'Neill said.
``In the warmup _ it was just after one of the Australian selectors
came up and asked me if I won a gold medal in Auckland _ that my
coach sat me down and talked to me about not thinking about the
medal count.
	   ``I was thinking about so many things that I really wanted to
cut down what I was thinking about.''
	   O'Neill said she was glad she had swum her final race at a
Commonwealth Games. She won a gold as a rookie in 1990 and three as
a disappointment in 1994.
	   ``It probably won't really hit me until I've retired I suppose,
which is coming pretty soon,'' O'Neill said. ``When I made my first
games team I never thought I'd still be going now. I'm glad it's
over in some ways to be perfectly honest. I've had a long career
and it's getting pretty tiring.''
	   Her time was a complete shock and she can't remember the race.
	   ``Athletes talk about being in a zone where it's over really
fast and it's probably the first time it's ever happened to me,''
O'Neill said.

Giant metal lizard blocks Jabiluka uranium mine site
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ An old car dressed up to look like a
frill-necked lizard blocked the entrance to the Jabiluka uranium
mine site inside the borders of Kakadu National Park on Friday.
	   A dozen protesters opposed to the uranium mine chained
themselves to the car-lizard about 4 a.m., according to blockade
spokeswoman Kerry Nettle.
	   She said it represented the animals in the surrounding Kakadu
park which would be endangered by the construction of a uranium
mine which is expected to extract almost 20 million metric tons of
uranium ore over 28 years.
	   Mine builder Energy Resources of Australia has denied the mine,
which it says will inject 6.2 billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs
3.7 billion) into the Australian economy, will have any adverse
impact on Kakadu.
	   Senior Police Sgt. Alan Thomson of nearby Jabiru police said the
protesters locked on to the car would be removed by police.
	   Thomson said the car looked like a lizard ``with the help of a
lot of imagination.''
	   Federal opposition leader Kim Beazley confirmed Thursday that
the Labor Party would stop Jabiluka being built if it wins the
government at the Oct. 3 national election.

Typhoon Todd approaches southern Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A powerful typhoon was moving toward the southern
Japanese island of Kyushu on Friday, threatening to bring with it
heavy rains and strong winds, the Meteorological Agency said.
	   Typhoon Todd, packing sustained winds of 126 kilometers per hour
(78 miles per hour), was 240 kilometers southeast of Tanegashima
island at the southern tip of Kyushu as of 11 a.m. (0200 GMT)
Friday.
	   Tanegashima is about 1,100 kilometers (626 miles) southwest of
Tokyo.
	   The typhoon, the sixth of the season, was moving northwest at 40
kilometers per hour (25 miles per hour), according to the agency.
	   The agency forecast the center of the typhoon would pass through
Kyushu later Friday evening, bringing maximum rains of 200
millimeters to 300 millimeters (8 inches to 12 inches) Friday and
Saturday to Kyushu and the island of Shikoku.
	   The meteorological agency warned of the possibility of
landslides.
	   The typhoon was not expected to pass over Japan's more heavily
populated main island.

Chinese police tell dissidents they can't form party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A top Chinese dissident said Friday that police
interrogated him for more than three hours and warned him to give
up efforts to set up an opposition political party.
	   Ren Wanding, who has spent 11 of the last 19 years in prison,
said the long questioning on Thursday succeeded in getting him to
give up plans to register the China Democracy Party branch in
Beijing.
	   ``They told me `Now we're still under the Communist Party's
leadership. Setting up political parties is not permitted,''' Ren
said.
	   Ren said at least three of his four colleagues in the would-be
China Democracy Party's Beijing branch also had separate run-ins
with police.
	   Ma Shaohua and Wang Linhai were interrogated at length on
Wednesday and Thursday nights, while police ransacked the home of
Zhao Xin, who was out of town, he said.
	   Police also placed Ren's home in a Beijing suburb under
surveillance and order him not to go out, he said.
	   Ren said that during the interrogation police indicated to him
that the prohibition against opposition parties applied nationwide.
	   In the past two weeks, dissidents in five provinces who sought
to register branches of the China Democracy Party did not meet
outright refusal, sparking speculation communist leaders were
considering permitting the first legal opposition in 49 years.
	   Police detained 12 people in July after they tried to register
the party in Zhejiang province while Clinton was in China. All have
since been released.
	   The police action is part of an apparent clampdown on dissent
that the ruling Communist Party began shortly after U.S. President
Bill Clinton ended a nine-day China tour in July.
	   Police have since rounded up, mostly for short periods, more
than two dozen democracy and labor rights campaigners and this
month detained a leading Chinese journalist who edited a popular
book on political change.
	   Other dissidents have reported stepped up surveillance and
harassment by police.
	   On Tuesday morning, police ransacked Jia Wei's home in
northeastern Changchun city for the fourth time in 2 1/2 months,
New York-based Human Rights in China reported Friday.
	   On Wednesday, they made another of their repeated visits to the
offices of his older brother and sister, the group said.
	   Jia Wei traveled to Beijing to try to give political tracts to
Clinton in June but was detained and taken back to Changchun in
custody, Human Rights in China said.
