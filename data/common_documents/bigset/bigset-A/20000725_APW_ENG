<HEADLINE> Taiwan's Vice Premier Resigns  </HEADLINE>
By MARCOS CALO MEDINA
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan's vice premier on Tuesday resigned
over a botched rescue mission that has embarrassed the island's new
government and prompted the popular premier to offer to step down.
</P>
<P>
   Yu Shyi-kun, who also heads a rescue operation task force in the
cabinet, ''has assumed all responsibility'' for the government's
failure to rescue four workers trapped in a weekend flash flood,
said a government statement.
</P>
<P>
   Premier Tang Fei, Taiwan's No. 3 leader, said he had accepted
President Chen Shui-bian's request for him to stay at least until
''the political situation stabilizes.'' Tang, who offered to resign
on Monday, did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan was riveted over the weekend by TV coverage of the four
construction workers in their gray shirts and straw hats gripping
each other tightly as they stood knee-deep in the rushing waters on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers tried in vain to throw them a rope and pull them
out of the Pachang River in central Chiayi county, and helicopters
arrived too late to help. Two bodies have been found, and scuba
divers on Tuesday searched for the other two.
</P>
<P>
   Tang said Monday the national police chief, two Defense Ministry
generals and 11 other officials would be either demoted or
officially reprimanded for the bungled rescue mission.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's emergency efforts have come up short in the past,
especially during last September's massive earthquake, which killed
about 2,400 people and destroyed thousands of homes. Emergency
workers were not prepared for the disaster, and hundreds of people
died waiting for help.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, air force officials said their rescue team, which was
close to the scene, turned down a request to help in this latest
case. The team only acts on orders from the military, and the
police are responsible for such rescue operations, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers with Chen's Democratic Progressive Party apologized
for the incident at a morning press conference. Meanwhile, both the
victims' families and politicians from the opposition Nationalist
Party blamed Tang's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Yang Chun-ying, a Nationalist lawmaker, called the accident
''homicide committed by the bureaucracy.'' Some of the victims'
families said helicopters purchased with their tax dollars should
have been used to rescue their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, cable news showed public monuments and government
offices spray-painted with graffiti condemning the government's
inaction.

Cheney Said To Be GOP VP Pick
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush on Monday selected former
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to be his running mate, rounding out the GOP
ticket with a Washington insider who played a pivotal role in his father's
presidency. Two highly placed GOP sources said Bush planned to make the offer
Tuesday morning. Cheney has told associates he will accept it. Bush spokeswoman
Karen Hughes confirmed that Bush had made his selection, but said, ''He has not
yet notified that individual or told anyone else about his choice.'' Republicans
open their presidential convention, where Bush will be officially nominated,
next Monday.

Japanese Cultist Sentenced to Death
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A former member of the cult behind the 1995 nerve gas attack on
the Tokyo subways was sentenced to death Tuesday for killing an anti-cult lawyer
and joining an earlier gas attack, the court said. Satoru Hashimoto, 33, and
four other cult members had already been found liable in civil lawsuits for the
1989 killings of attorney Tsutsumi Sakamoto, his wife and infant son. Hashimoto
was the second former member of the Aum Shinri Kyo cult to be sentenced to death
in the case. Kazuaki Okazaki, 39, was handed the sentence last October but has
appealed.

Two Dead at Fla. Hostage Site
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- police said a three-day standoff inside a suburban home
ended Monday with the death of a hostage and the suicide of the murder suspect
who began the ordeal. Authorities said the captor, Jamie Dean Petron, 41, killed
himself with a shot to the chest and was found dead in the master bedroom. The
hostage, Andrea Hall, 40, had been dead for several hours. Hall, 40, might have
been shot Sunday by police sharpshooters who fired into the home, said Orange
County Sheriff's Capt. Steve Jones. It's also possible she was hit when Petron
fired at a police robot that entered the home Monday morning, Jones said.

   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- The National Transportation Safety Board next month
plans to release a report with all the evidence investigators have gathered on
the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990, including the transcript of the cockpit voice
recorder. The document will contain no analysis about how the plane went down,
but paves the way for the NTSB's final conclusions to be released. NTSB Chairman
James Hall has testified before Congress that the movements of the plane were
''consistent with a deliberate action on the part of one of the crew members.''
NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz would not say whether anything in the upcoming

<HEADLINE> Japanese Cultist Sentenced to Death  </HEADLINE>
By KOZO MIZOGUCHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A former member of the cult behind the 1995 nerve
gas attack on the Tokyo subways was sentenced to death Tuesday for
killing an anti-cult lawyer and joining an earlier gas attack, the
court said.
</P>
<P>
   Satoru Hashimoto, 33, and four other cult members had already
been found liable in civil lawsuits for the 1989 killings of
attorney Tsutsumi Sakamoto, his wife and infant son.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto was the second former member of the Aum Shinri Kyo
cult to be sentenced to death in the case. Kazuaki Okazaki, 39, was
handed the sentence last October but has appealed.
</P>
<P>
   The Tokyo District Court also found Hashimoto guilty of
involvement in a sarin nerve gas attack in central Japan in 1995
that killed seven people. Hashimoto helped a group of cultists
spread the deadly gas.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto was one of six former cultists charged in the Sakamoto
killings, including former guru Shoko Asahara. Asahara is currently
on trial for those murders and the 1995 attack on the Tokyo
subways, which killed 12 people and sickened thousands of others.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto had argued during the trial that he did not deserve
the death penalty because he could not defy Asahara's orders.
</P>
<P>
   ''You acted at the orders of Asahara, but you bear a heavy
responsibility for joining in the crime of your own will,'' Judge
Toshio Nagai responded, Kyodo News agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto and four other top cultists strangled Sakamoto, his
wife, and their 1-year-old son on Nov. 4, 1989, at their home in
Yokohama, just south of Tokyo, at the direction of Asahara, police
say.
</P>
<P>
   Sakamoto was preparing a lawsuit against the cult when he was
killed, accusing Aum of luring youngsters into the group. The
bodies of the Sakamoto family, buried in remote mountains of
central Japan, were not discovered until after the gas attack in
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   In the civil lawsuit, Hashimoto and three other cultists were
ordered in 1997 to pay $4.5 million in damages to Sakamoto's
parents. Asahara was found liable in an earlier court decision.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 4, Rockies 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Kevin Brown pitched eight innings of three-hit
ball and Gary Sheffield hit his major league-leading 34th home run
Monday night as the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Colorado Rockies
4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Brown (10-3), who limited the Rockies to one hit in eight
innings last Wednesday, struck out five and walked one. He is 6-2
in his last 10 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield went 3-for-3 with a homer, triple and double, and
drove in three runs.
</P>
<P>
   Needing a single to become the first Dodgers player to hit for
the cycle since Wes Parker in 1970, Sheffield was hit by a pitch in
the seventh inning and walked in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield is 16-for-40 with seven homers and 13 RBIs in his last
12 games.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fetters got his fifth save as the Dodgers won for the fifth
time in six games.
</P>
<P>
   Rolando Arrojo (5-9) gave up three runs and seven hits in six
innings in losing his fourth consecutive decision.
</P>
<P>
   Brown didn't allow a hit until Todd Walker tripled into the
right-field corner with one out in the third inning. Arrojo struck
out and Tom Goodwin grounded out to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield followed a one-out walk to Mark Grudzielanek with a
triple over the leaping Larry Walker and off the scoreboard in
right field in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek singled to start the third and Sheffield hit an RBI
double over the head of left fielder Butch Huskey. Sheffield's solo
home run in the fifth made it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers added a run in the seventh on Shawn Green's
bases-loaded single off Julian Tavarez.
</P>
<P>
   Huskey homered leading off the eighth inning for Colorado.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Walker's triple was the first hit allowed by Brown in 11
innings. ... Brown took Goodwin's one-hopper off the his right shin
with one out in the sixth inning, but remained in the game. ...
Walker made his first start in right field after playing 29 games
in left since coming off the DL on June. ... Arrojo matched a
season high with eight strikeouts. ... Rockies reliever Mike DeJean
left the game with strained oblique muscle in his right side after
pitching to one batter in the seventh.

<HEADLINE> Boston's Everett Drops Appeal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Carl Everett dropped his appeal of a 10-game
suspension and began serving it Monday night as the Boston Red Sox
opened a three-game series with Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The All-Star outfielder, who took batting practice before the
Red Sox faced the Twins, apparently elected to start serving the
penalty because of soreness in his right hand, though manager Jimy
Williams played down the injury.
</P>
<P>
   Everett hurt himself while punching a bat rack following the
ejection that led to his suspension. He is batting .316 and leads
Boston with 26 home runs and 75 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Everett was suspended last week for twice bumping home plate
umpire Ronald Kulpa on July 15 during a wild argument about whether
he was in the batter's box.
</P>
<P>
   ''He withdrew his appeal and this is the best time to do it, all
things considered,'' said Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette, who
refused to acknowledge Everett's injury when asked. ''I don't know
Carl's thinking, but we're facing a number of left-hander pitchers
over the next 10 days.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette went on to say that Everett is not being fined by the
club.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, though, didn't admit to any injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's fine. He could have played today,'' Williams said after
Boston's 4-2 loss. ''It's just a decision he decided to make. He
just felt it was better to get it behind him and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Williams acknowledged he was waiting to see how
Everett felt before he made out the lineup. The club didn't inform
the media of Everett withdrawing his appeal until the game was a
few innings old.
</P>
<P>
   In a game against the New York Mets, Everett became upset with
Kulpa after the umpire drew a line on the inside of the batter's
box with his left foot, then his right, showing where the hitter
could stand.
</P>
<P>
   The two had words and Everett was ejected.
</P>
<P>
   Everett, a switch-hitter, was using an open stance -- as he
usually does against left-handers -- where his back foot appears
over the inside line.
</P>
<P>
   During the ensuing argument, Everett bumped Kulpa before firing
his helmet to the ground. After that, he bumped Kulpa again,
causing the umpire to jerk his head back. Everett had to be
restrained by Williams and coaches Tommy Harper and Wendell Kim.
</P>
<P>
   After going to the dugout, Everett threw a bat on the field,
knocked over a water cooler and punched the metal bat rack.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Everett dropped his bat during his final time
up, showing some discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems to go back to the weekend,'' team physician Dr. Bill
Morgan said. ''He apparently injured it when he had that problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett did not play on July 18 and also sat out Sunday's 1-0
victory over the Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Barring rainouts, Everett will be eligible to return Aug. 4,
when the Red Sox play Kansas City at home.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Recognizes Congress' Attempts  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Fidel Castro on Monday night urged the entire
population of Havana to turn out for a massive march to protest the
U.S. trade embargo and celebrate the start of the revolution that
triumphed 41 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is more important than that 26 of July when we started
the armed struggle,'' Castro said on a live television program.
''It is a strategic fight'' this time.
</P>
<P>
   ''More than 1 million of us will participate in this march,''
the Cuban president predicted. ''Every revolutionary, every patriot
who can.''
</P>
<P>
   Havana has about 2 million residents.
</P>
<P>
   The march on Wednesday, coming amid growing moves in Congress to
chip away at nearly four-decade-old trade sanctions against Cuba,
appeared aimed at influencing American public opinion on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba has been under agricultural and other trade sanctions since
July 1963, longer than any other country except North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Castro has credited the huge rallies and marches conducted
almost daily during the fight to bring 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez
back to Cuba last month after his father's custody battle with U.S.
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   In its first public reaction to last week's moves in Congress to
ease sanctions against Cuba, the country's leadership Monday
recognized the ''noble and constructive'' moves, but said only a
full lifting of the embargo would help the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a duty to appreciate their noble and constructive
efforts,'' said an editorial that ran on the front page of three
official Cuban newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   But the editorial in the Communist Party daily Granma, the
Communist youth daily Juventud Rebelde and the weekly journal of
Communist workers Trabajadores went on to say that Cuba ''would not
have the resources to buy food and medicine under the conditions''
outlined in the proposed legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the language in one of the House measures say that
financing restrictions would effectively render impossible most
sales to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 301-116 Thursday to stop enforcing provisions
that ban U.S. food exports and limit sales of American medicine to
Cuba and four other nations -- Iran, Libya, North Korea and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed a bill the same day to permit food and medical
sales to the five countries.

<HEADLINE> Two Killed in Building Collapse  </HEADLINE>
By JEN LIN-LIU
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Adolph Stahl had decided to close the
57-year-old variety store passed to him from his father. Neighbors
say he and his wife were finally going to take it easy.
</P>
<P>
   But the building, which was undergoing renovations, collapsed
Monday after a wall shifted. Stahl and a construction worker,
Robert Scherer, 39, were killed. Stahl's wife, Faith, was able to
escape.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were going to retire,'' the Stahls' daughter, Cecelia
Driscoll, said tearfully. Neighbor Marie Brennan added: ''They were
talking about how great their lives were going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Construction crews had been digging beneath the wall that
supported much of the building's weight, Licenses and Inspections
Commissioner Edward McLaughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   The contractor, Vaccone Co., had an interior demolition permit
but appeared to have exceeded what they were allowed to do and
''undermined the bearing wall on one side,'' McLaughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Vaccone Co. did not return a call seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl was about to open Aunt Louise's Variety Store for business
about 9 a.m. when the building collapsed. During the search for
victims, rescuers brought in a crane to stabilize the building's
roof, and residents in adjacent buildings were evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl's body was removed from the rubble about four hours after
the collapse. Scherer's was found an hour later.
</P>
<P>
   The store, a neighborhood fixture, carried everything from
parade costumes to school supplies. The Stahls had planned to close
most of it and sell only lottery tickets and pretzels from a
window.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was very nice, very accommodating,'' said Elma Witiw, a
41-year resident of the neighborhood. ''You had to be if you were
in business for that long.''

<HEADLINE> Largest Mexico leftist party Beaten  </HEADLINE>
By AMPARO TREJO
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- With squabbling and recriminations, Mexico's
largest leftist party is struggling to cope with the fact that the
champion of change emerged elsewhere to end 71 years of
single-party rule in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''Vicente Fox seized our banners and left us stunned,'' said
Sen. Felix Salgado as leaders of the Democratic Revolution Party
held a rancorous meeting over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Party President Amalia Garcia won a vote of confidence late
Sunday, but only after several factions repeatedly demanded she
resign and only on condition that the party's leadership be
expanded to include more of her rivals. Garcia insisted the
leadership meeting had no power to oust her because she had been
elected in a nationwide referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Revolution was created in 1989 out of the alliance of
small leftist parties and breakaway members of the ruling party
that had backed Cuauhtemoc Cardenas in his surprisingly strong run
for the presidency the year before, an election many Mexicans
believe was stolen from Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   But Cardenas finished third both in 1994 and in the July 2
presidential election, and saw Fox's center-right National Action
Party seize the banner of change that Cardenas represented in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   In the July 2 elections, Democratic Revolution lost 74 of the
126 seats in Congress it had won in 1997. It narrowly held onto the
mayorship of Mexico City, but lost control of the city council to
National Action.
</P>
<P>
   The party also proved unable to mobilize two groups it has
traditionally counted upon, impoverished farmers and youth.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Democratic Revolution will have less public
funding, which depends on vote percentage. The $320 million a year
it achieved in 1997 will fall to $282 million next year.
</P>
<P>
   While Cardenas denounced Fox as a reactionary and an economic
elitist during the campaign, he urged party members to cooperate
where possible with the new government.
</P>
<P>
   Many party leaders over the weekend complained of struggles for
power -- partly an outgrowth of the factions that formed the party --
and of a tendency to mimic the practices of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party that lost power in the July 2 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''We told the people what they should do and that is bad; in
politics, I don't know of any party that can survive like that,''
Salgado said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Changes in our party cannot wait,'' said Cardenas, who blamed
the party for its failures -- irritating some members who hold
Cardenas' own election team responsible for much of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cardenas is an ethical politician of great moral authority,
one of the few men in this country who have the status of
statesman,'' said political scientist Carlos Fazio.
</P>
<P>
   But he noted that critics accuse Cardenas of dominating the
party, stifling the emergence of new leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Some leaders, notably Zacatecas state Gov. Ricardo Monreal, have
called for the party to reach out to a broader base by pulling in
left-leaning members of the even-more-stunned ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes hinting at a new party, Monreal had called for a
''third way'' following the election and had promoted an alliance
with Fox before it. As a result, he was hissed as a ''traitor'' by
some at the party's weekend meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''We seek a left that includes activists and leaders,
intellectuals, academics and activists of other parties,
nongovernment organizations and all of civil society to clean the
party of inertia and dogmas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly another party could be formed if we continue with the
same plans, if this doesn't change and we do not reclaim our
essence,'' Salgado said.

extremes of public life in Latin America, where people with a sense
of service often find themselves moving between vastly different
worlds of revolution and orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by Che Guevara, Petkoff joined Venezuela's Communist
Party and battled a military dictatorship. Now he's one of the most
outspoken critics of Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's revolutionary
president who staged a famous but unsuccessful coup attempt eight
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Petkoff has taken the helm of Tal Cual, a maverick newspaper
that is already raising a ruckus.
</P>
<P>
   ''We aren't trying to create a journalistic revolution'' Petkoff
told The Associated Press. ''But I do want to create a paper that
carries some weight, that matters to its readers.''
</P>
<P>
   That translates into some controversial headlines.
</P>
<P>
   The day after its April 3 debut, the newspaper's
much-talked-about front page featured the headline ''The Official
Line'' next to a photograph of Chavez and a story whose entire text
read, ''Bla, bla, bla.''
</P>
<P>
   Petkoff says the newspaper is responding to one of the most
critical moments in this oil-rich but poverty-stricken country's
history.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Venezuelans will vote for president and other offices
as part of a reform plan Chavez launched more than 17 months ago
when he became president promising a ''social revolution'' in this
South American nation of 23 million. Chavez has virtually erased
the old political parties and pushed through a new constitution
that requires voters to ''re-legitimize'' most public offices
through new balloting.
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't just what Petkoff is saying. How he is saying it is
capturing the attention of Venezuela's rich and poor alike.
</P>
<P>
   His unapologetic and caustic editorials offer sharp attacks on
everything from Chavez's longwinded speeches to the president's
view of flies as ''small insects, generally dissidents, who oppose
the revolutionary hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   And at a time when the press has increasingly come under attack
by Chavez, Petkoff insists Tal Cual's private backers will
guarantee it remains an independent voice.
</P>
<P>
   That is a priority for Petkoff, who left his last post as editor
of the Caracas daily El Mundo after what he called undue pressure
from a senior government official in a pending legal battle
involving the paper's owners.
</P>
<P>
   To friends, Petkoff is a brilliant thinker whose lack of
allegiance to political doctrine has given him credibility with
Venezuela's masses while negotiating deals with the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   But to his critics Petkoff is a brusque, intolerant neoliberal
who betrayed the left.
</P>
<P>
   ''Teodoro has become an instrument of savage capitalism,'' says
Nora Castaneda, a former rebel.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a Bulgarian father and Polish Jewish mother, Petkoff
flirted with journalism nearly 40 years ago when he joined the
Communist Party and began writing for its newspaper, Tribuna
Popular.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that is when Teodoro discovered himself as a
journalist,'' says Pompeyo Marquez, a former guerrilla leader.
</P>
<P>
   That career was interrupted when a military junta closed the
newspaper. Petkoff turned to politics, helping form a Marxist rebel
group that once kidnapped a U.S. colonel.
</P>
<P>
   Petkoff was eventually captured and sent to prison, where he
served three years and escaped twice.
</P>
<P>
   After breaking with the communists, Petkoff launched the
Movement to Socialism, a leftist party that eventually became the
third most powerful political force in the country. He cut his ties
to that party after it backed Chavez's presidential candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Petkoff's most surprising role came in 1994 when
President Rafael Caldera named him planning minister and entrusted
him to spearhead a market-oriented reform package. The appointment
shocked many Venezuelans who still remembered Petkoff as a Marxist
rebel.
</P>
<P>
   For Petkoff, the attention he and Tal Cual are generating are
simply part of his lifelong assault on the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see any inconsistencies in my thinking or what I have
done,'' says Petkoff. ''I am a man of politics.''

<HEADLINE> Admissions Policy Unconstitutional  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) -- A federal judge has ruled that the
University of Georgia's admissions program is unconstitutional
because it discriminates in order to admit more black students.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Avant Edenfield of Savannah rejected the
university's arguments that promoting diversity in higher education
is of compelling state interest.
</P>
<P>
   ''To base racial preferences upon an amorphous, unquantifiable
and temporarily unlimited goal is to engage in naked racial
balancing,'' Edenfield wrote in Monday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ruled in favor of three white women denied admission
in 1999. He also ordered the university to offer the women
admission and to compensate them for having to pay more money to
attend other schools.
</P>
<P>
   University president Michael Adams said he would consult with
legal counsel before deciding whether to appeal the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''We respect the court and we want UGA admissions to comply with
federal law,'' Adams said. ''We also want to be as aggressive as
possible within the law in attracting people of all races and
backgrounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The university has admitted about 90 percent of its students
strictly on academic performance. The rest were accepted on a
combination of up to 12 characteristics, including race and gender.
</P>
<P>
   The three white female plaintiffs would have been considered for
admission had they been minority male applicants, Edenfield noted.
</P>
<P>
   Preferences are no longer given to male applicants. In
September, Adams said the school will continue to use race-based
preferences in an effort to remain representative of the total
state population.
</P>
<P>
   Other state university systems have addressed similar issues.
After a 1996 federal appeals court ruling, a judged banned Texas
universities from using race as a factor in admission policies. A
Florida plan bars consideration of race and gender in university
admissions.
</P>
<P>
   The University of California no longer considers race and gender
in admissions.

<HEADLINE> Dead Guatemalans Bodies Arrive Home  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN RAFAEL LA INDEPENDENCIA, Guatemala (AP) -- The 22 bodies
arrived in two trucks and were unloaded on a basketball court
before a crowd of hundreds who had been waiting since dawn in this
impoverished, mostly-Indian town.
</P>
<P>
   The town's square late Monday filled with cars, pickups, buses
and vans, as more than 500 people -- men in dingy cowboy hats and
women in traditional, pastel-colored Mayan garb -- waited for the
victims who drowned during their illegal odyssey to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some are here to pay their respects, some are here just to
watch,'' said Mirina Setea, whose first language is the Mayan
tongue of Acateco but who also speaks Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   The victims -- between the ages of 4 and 45 -- died July 12 when
their motorboat capsized off Mexico's Pacific coast as they were
trying to elude immigration officials.
</P>
<P>
   The smell of death was overpowering when their 22 coffins of
varying sizes were unloaded onto the shabby basketball court in
this town of 20,000, located some 256 miles northwest of Guatemala
City. From there, the bodies were sent for burial to the five rural
mountain villages they were trying to escape.
</P>
<P>
   In the village of San Pedro Soloma, the sole survivor from the
motor boat, Juan Miguel Francisco, stood Sunday by the six
freshly-dug graves prepared for his relatives
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't say why I'm alive now, there is no reason behind it,''
said Francisco, who had to help police identify seven of the bodies
recovered the night of the accident. ''The sea let me live.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't face them again,'' said Francisco, 22. ''This will be
very tough for me, for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the dead was Francisco's cousin, Hugo Domingo Matiz, the
man who planned the ill-fated trip.
</P>
<P>
   Funerals for the six will be humble -- without a priest, even --
because the family was forced to pay about $1,700 for the safe
return of each corpse.
</P>
<P>
   A deal to have the Guatemalan government foot the bill for the
repatriation of all the bodies remains in the works.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, collections taken in each of the villages have
raised little more than $130.

<HEADLINE> Giants 3, Padres 0  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Mark Gardner held San Diego to five hits in
seven scoreless innings to win his fifth straight decision and the
San Francisco Giants took advantage of Brian Meadows' first-inning
control problems to beat the Padres 3-0 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner (7-4), who took the rotation spot of Russ Ortiz to start
the second half, has won five of his last six starts. He was coming
off a no-decision in a 4-3, 10-inning loss to the Padres at San
Francisco last Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner struck out eight and walked one. After allowing Ryan
Klesko's two-out single in the first, Gardner retired nine
straight.
</P>
<P>
   Robb Nen got the final three outs for his 23rd save in 28
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Meadows (7-8) pitched eight strong innings against the Giants
last Wednesday, but lost his third straight decision because of his
inability to throw strikes in the first inning. Throwing 34
pitches, he allowed three runs on three walks and three singles.
</P>
<P>
   With one out, Meadows loaded the bases on two singles and a
walk. He then issued consecutive walks to Ellis Burks and J.T. Snow
to force in the first two runs, followed by a two-out single to
Doug Mirabelli. Meadows had 1-2 counts against both Burks and Snow.
</P>
<P>
   Meadows allowed three runs on six hits in seven innings, struck
out four and walked four.
</P>
<P>
   The closest the Padres came to scoring was when Bret Boone hit a
two-out triple in the sixth, and replays showed that it should have
been a home run. The ball hit a concrete support post behind the
fence and bounced back in off the top of the fence.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Giants are on the second stop of a 12-game, four-city
trip that started in Los Angeles and will continue in Chicago and
Milwaukee. ... Padres 1B Ryan Klesko shared NL Player of the Week
honors with Colorado's Todd Helton. Each player batted .419
(13-for-31) for the week. Klesko led the NL with 11 RBIs and five
doubles, hit two homers, scored four runs, had 24 total bases and
compiled a .774 slugging percentage. He also drove in seven runs
against the Rockies, helping the Padres win two of three at Coors
Field. On Sunday, he hit a tying solo homer in the ninth and a
game-winning, two-run shot in the 10th. ... Leadoff hitter Eric
Owens missed his second straight start due to a deep bruise at the
base of his right thumb. He pinch-hit for Kory DeHaan in the eighth
and remained in the game in right field.

<HEADLINE> Angels 6, Rangers 5, 12 Innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- The Texas Rangers lost star catcher Ivan
Rodriguez for the rest of the season because of a broken right
thumb, then blew a three-run lead in the ninth inning and fell in
the 12th, 6-5 to the Anaheim Angels on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   On a frustrating night for the Rangers, they thought they had
won in the 10th on a balk. But with Texas already celebrating, the
call was reversed.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, the reigning AL MVP, was injured in the first inning
when his thumb hit Mo Vaughn's bat on a swinging third strike as he
threw to second base on Kevin Stocker's steal attempt. Stocker was
called out by home plate umpire Gerry Davis on batter's
interference.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, 28, played earlier this month in his ninth straight
All-Star game. He has won eight consecutive Gold Glove awards, an
AL record.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' career hits leader was batting .347 with 27 home
runs and 83 RBIs. Rodriguez will have surgery Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Down 5-2, the Angels scored three times in the ninth, giving
John Wetteland his sixth blown save in 31 chances. Bengie Molina
hit an RBI double with two outs and Scott Spiezio followed with a
home run.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Salmon had three hits for Anaheim, including an RBI single
in the 12th. He also homered.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Kennedy led off the Angels 12th with a single off Tim
Crabtree (1-6) and stole second. Kevin Stocker walked and one out
later, Salmon singled.
</P>
<P>
   Shigetoshi Hasegawa (7-2) pitched three scoreless innings for
the win. Troy Percival pitched the 12th for his 23rd save.
</P>
<P>
   In the 10th, the Rangers put runners on second and third with
one out. With a 1-1 count on Gabe Kapler, plate umpire Gerry Davis
called a balk and motioned for pinch-runner Scarborough Green to
come home.
</P>
<P>
   But the Angels argued and Davis, after huddling with his umpire
crew, changed the call and kept the runners at second and third.
Kapler fouled out and, after an intentional walk to Mike Lamb,
Royce Clayton flied out.
</P>
<P>
   Angels left fielder Darin Erstad tied a major league record for
putouts by an outfielder with 12. He was the 13th to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Palmeiro hit his 386th home run, moving past Dwight Evans
into 37th place on the career list, and Kapler and David Segui also
connected for Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler's solo homer in the fourth off Kent Bottenfield snapped a
2-2 tie. Texas made it 5-2 in the sixth on Segui's solo homer and
Luis Alicea's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro hit a two-run homer in the first. His 25th home run
barely cleared the right-field wall, just out of the reach of a
leaping Salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon's 19th homer leading off the fourth tied it at 2.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad led off the game with a triple and scored on Stocker's
single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Erstad had a triple and a double, the 12th time he's had
two or more hits in his last 18 games. ... Salmon has 23 career
homers against Texas, 10 at The Ballpark in Arlington. ... Bill
Haselman came in to catch for Rodriguez. When Haselman was lifted
for a pinch-hitter in the 10th, Texas was forced to use reserve INF
Scott Sheldon as a catcher.

   GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- A commission that would oversee a $295
million remodeling of Lambeau Field has authorized a referendum in
which Brown County voters will decide whether to accept a
fund-raising sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   A resolution creating the Sept. 12 referendum was approved
Monday by the commission as one of the steps required by the state
legislature in response to the Green Bay Packers' request for
public financing.
</P>

   Revenue from the one-half percent county sales tax would be used

<P>
   The Packers contend they need the extra income that a remodeled
stadium would generate. Their plan calls for adding 10,000 seats to
the 43-year-old city-owned stadium, including luxury boxes and club
seats. They also want to add shops and a museum.
</P>
<P>
   Other funding would include $92.5 million from a season ticket
holders' user fee, $20.4 million from the Packers' stock sale and a
$13 million NFL construction loan.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Urge Mental Exercise  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The brain is like a muscle: Use it or lose it.
</P>
<P>
   That's the growing conclusion of research that shows fogged
memory and slowed wit are not inevitable consequences of getting
old, and there are steps people can take to protect their brains.
</P>
<P>
   Mental exercise seems crucial. Benefits start when parents read
to tots and depend heavily on education, but scientists say it's
never too late to start jogging the gray matter.
</P>
<P>
   People have to get physical, too. Bad memory is linked to heart
disease, diabetes and a high-fat diet, all risks people can counter
by living healthier lives.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, provocative new research suggests these
brain-protective steps, mental and physical, may be strong enough
even to help influence who gets Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are some things that, if you know you have a family
history (of Alzheimer's) and you're just 20 to 30 years old, you
can start doing to increase your protective factors,'' said Dr.
Amir Soas of Case Western Reserve University Medical School in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   It's also good advice for the average baby boomer hoping to stay
sharp, or the mom priming her child for a lifelong healthy brain.
</P>
<P>
   Most important: ''Read, read, read,'' Soas said. Do crossword
puzzles. Pull out the chessboard or Scrabble. Learn a foreign
language or a new hobby. ''Anything that stimulates the brain to
think,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And cut back on TV, Soas insists. ''When you watch television,
your brain goes into neutral,'' he said. So much so that Case
Western plans to study whether people who contract Alzheimer's
watched more TV throughout life than healthy seniors.
</P>
<P>
   The stereotype of the forgetful grandma has its roots in
now-outdated dogma. Just a few years ago, scientists believed the
brain was wired forever before age 5, and that over the ensuing
decades a person irrevocably lost neurons and crucial brain
circuitry until eventually mental decline became noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. Scientists now know the brain continually rewires and
adapts itself, even in old age; large brain-cell growth continues
into the teen years; and even the elderly can grow at least some
new neurons.
</P>
<P>
   So cognitive decline doesn't have to be inevitable. Indeed,
mental tests given for 10 years to almost 6,000 older people found
70 percent maintained brain power as they aged, lead researcher
Mary Haan of the University of Michigan told an international
Alzheimer's meeting this month.
</P>
<P>
   What keeps brains healthy? Clues come from Alzheimer's research.
</P>
<P>
   Case Western scientists studied 550 people and found those less
mentally and physically active in middle age were three times more
likely to get Alzheimer's as they grayed. Particularly protective:
increasing intellectual activity during adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous studies show people with less education have higher
risks of Alzheimer's than the better-educated. Haan found less than
a ninth-grade education a key threshold; other studies suggest a
difference even between holders of bachelor's and master's degrees.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just formal education. Reading habits between ages 6
and 18 appear crucial predictors of cognitive function decades
later, said Dr. David Bennett of Chicago's Rush University. The
theory: Challenge the brain early to build up more ''cognitive
reserve'' to counter brain-damaging disease later. Bennett is
preparing to test that by counting neurons in autopsied brains.
</P>
<P>
   And remember that brain-muscle analogy? Brain scans show
mentally ''exercising,'' which London cabbies do while navigating
without a map or pianists do when practicing, makes regions used
for those intellectual challenges grow, while less-used areas
shrink.
</P>
<P>
   But physical health is important, too. A healthy brain needs
lots of oxygen pumped through healthy arteries. Haan studied people
who have a gene called ApoE4, which significantly increases the
risk of Alzheimer's. Brain function of gene carriers declined four
times faster with age if they also had hardened arteries or
diabetes. High-fat diets increased the risk seven times, Case
Western researchers found.
</P>
<P>
   That means exercising and eating right -- the very things that
prevent heart disease and diabetes -- helps the brain, too. And Haan
said it spotlights the next research frontier: Testing whether
cholesterol and blood pressure treatments might prevent dementia.
Stay tuned.

<HEADLINE> Some Agreement Seen at Camp David  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- Offering a glimmer of hope after two
grueling weeks of Mideast peace talks at Camp David, the White
House indicated that Israel and the Palestinians could be making
''some'' progress toward resolving their bitter disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The assessment came as Clinton plunged into intensive, hands-on
mediation following a four-day trip to Japan, keeping long,
late-night hours in an effort to shepherd the two sides toward a
historic accord.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are trying to find areas of agreement,'' White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters on Monday, the 14th day of
talks at the secluded presidential retreat in the mountains of
Maryland. ''They have probably found some.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the summit's American hosts have avoided any
characterization of the substance of the talks, other than to note
how difficult and divisive the issues are.
</P>
<P>
   The main point of dispute is Jerusalem, which both sides claim
as their capital. Also on the table is the fate of several million
Palestinian refugees and the boundaries of a future Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was stepping in as lead
mediator again Tuesday, with Clinton planning a daylong absence to
attend a memorial service in Arkansas for Diane Blair, a University
of Arkansas political science professor and a close friend who died
of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was leaving at lunchtime and returning after midnight,
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright twice has taken the reins at the summit, most recently
while Clinton attended an economic summit on Okinawa. She filled in
for him one day during the first week as well.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting until 5 a.m. Monday with delegates from both
sides, Clinton headed into a fresh round of talks in the evening.
Asked if the negotiators might pull another all-nighter, Lockhart
said: ''It's certainly possible.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think everyone is feeling the effect of some late nights,
but they're still at it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has met with both Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat since his return -- he met with
Arafat again Monday evening -- but most of his time has been devoted
to joint sessions with negotiators from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   In directly engaging the delegates, Clinton echoed the type of
detail-heavy encounters that President Carter had with negotiating
teams at the first Camp David summit, in 1978. That watershed
gathering set Israel and Egypt on the road to peace.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart told reporters that as long as Clinton thinks
''discussions are substantive and have the potential of leading to
an agreement, he will remain here, and keep the parties here.''
</P>
<P>
   The parties, themselves, though, were reluctant to commit to
open-ended talks. An Israeli Cabinet minister who is serving as one
of his country's negotiators said it should be clear soon whether
it was worthwhile to keep talking.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think within 24 hours we will know if we have gone forward
or sideways,'' Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, Israel's transportation
minister, told Israel's Channel Two from inside Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians' frequent spokeswoman, Hanan Ashrawi, predicted
the two sides could achieve only an interim accord, ''either some
kind of vague framework or damage control to prevent a total
breakdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who has been under constant pressure from right-wing
political opponents at home, got a new reminder Tuesday of the
battle that could await him if he makes sweeping concessions to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a rare news
conference broadcast live in prime time on both Israeli TV
channels, said he wanted to prevent a ''ripping apart'' of Israeli
society ''that could happen in the next few days.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What we hear from most of the reports out of Camp David does
not answer our hopes,'' Netanyahu said, demanding that Barak reject
any deal that would call for sharing sovereignty over Jerusalem
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   On a U.S. political matter, Lockhart was asked whether the Camp
David talks could overlap with next week's Republican national
convention, where Texas Gov. George W. Bush will be nominated as
the GOP presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think there's a sense that those two things are going
to collide,'' he said. ''Governor Bush has been properly supportive
of the president and his efforts, so I don't think on either side
there's an attempt to play politics with this.''

<HEADLINE> Wreckage recovered from fatal copter crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WAILUKU, Hawaii (AP) - Investigators began Monday to piece
together the parts of a tour helicopter that crashed on Maui,
killing all seven people on board.
</P>
<P>
   The wreckage was removed Sunday from the 2,900-foot level of a
mountainside deep in Iao Valley. It was scattered 200 feet down a
steep slope, said George Petterson, an investigator for the
National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very fragmented,'' Petterson said. ''There is fire damage
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of the seven victims were retrieved Saturday by
rescue teams that had to rappel down to the crash site by
helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Hawaiian Helicopters twin-engine AS355 crashed Friday
during a 35-minute tour of the West Maui mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter crashed about 26 minutes into its flight,
according to a transponder recovered from the chopper, Wayne
Pollack of the National Transportation Safety Board said Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The transponder shows the crash occurred two miles west of Iao
Needle, at an altitude of 2,900 feet, Pollack said.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter departed Kahului heliport at 9:54 a.m., headed
northwest, then traveled counterclockwise around the island until
it was about 10 miles west of the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter was in Iao Valley, traveling at 3,700 feet, by
10:19 a.m. A minute later, the chopper dropped to 3,100 feet and
crashed a short time later, Pollack said.
</P>
<P>
   Data on Friday's weather conditions, the maintenance history of
the chopper and the experience of pilot Larry Kirsch also are being
studied by the NTSB.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the helicopter and engine manufacturers are
taking part in the investigation, which will involve starting to
put the helicopter back together in a hangar at Kahului heliport,
Petterson said.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary report on the cause of the crash should be ready
by the end of the week, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kirsch, 55, identified by police as the pilot, was a Vietnam
veteran with more than 12,000 hours of flight time and had been
with the company more than a year, said Patti Chevalier, co-owner
of the company.
</P>
<P>
   He was involved in a 1996 midair collision in Alaska that led to
the suspension of his commercial license, a Federal Aviation
Administration spokesman told the Asbury Park Press of Neptune for
Tuesday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   Kirsch was flying a small helicopter over Healy, Alaska, on Aug.
4, 1996, when he collided with a single-engine Cessna carrying
Italian tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators eventually suspended Kirsch's commercial
pilot's license for 45 days, said Roland Herwig, a spokesman for
the Federal Aviation Administration. The suspension took effect
Dec. 7, 1998, more than two years after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers in New Jersey identified four of the victims as a
family from the town of Shrewsbury. They are William John Jordan,
an economic professor at Seton Hall University; his wife,
psychiatrist Jan Herscovitz, and their children, Max Jordan, 16,
and Lindsey Jordan, 15.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier news reports had identified the woman as Jan Hortivick.
</P>
<P>
   Also killed were two lifelong friends from Texas: Natalie
Prince, 14, of Fort Worth, and Whitney Wood, 14, of Burleson.
</P>
<P>
   Police have yet to release an official list of the victims, and
won't until autopsies are completed.
</P>
<P>
   Known to colleagues as ''Jack,'' Jordan had taught at Seton Hall
since 1977, and Herscovitz was a psychiatrist in Shrewsbury.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dr. Jordan was a professor who was extremely dedicated to his
craft,'' said Karen Boroff, acting dean of the university's
Stillman School of Business. ''He was a very knowledgeable teacher
who acted as a mentor to his students. This is a tremendous loss
for Seton Hall University, our students and his colleagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Police in Shrewsbury on Monday referred calls to the Maui Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Don Streeter, grandfather of Natalie Prince, said his
only granddaughter was the apple of his eye. He last saw at the
airport, before she left for the weeklong trip to Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got a big hug and a kiss from her,'' Streeter said. ''That's
the last time I saw her. It hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Streeter said Natalie and Whitney had been best of friends since
the age of 4, and remained nearly inseparable even though they
lived in different towns and went to different schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're almost like sisters, maybe better than sisters,
because they never fought,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Wood, Whitney's father, said the girls were always
together.
</P>
<P>
   ''You couldn't pry them apart with anything,'' Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   Wood was apprehensive about letting his daughter make the trip
with the Prince family, but relented after his daughter said she
badly wanted to go.
</P>
<P>
   And now his worst fears were realized.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's one call you pray you never will receive,'' he said.
''We just lost two daughters.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the victims suffered ''severe impact injuries,''
according to Maui County medical examiner Dr. Anthony Manoukian.
There was indication of a minor fire, but none of the victims
suffered significant burns, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Positive identification of the passengers will be more difficult
because of the severity of the injuries and the fact that three are
girls all about the same age, Manoukian said.
</P>
<P>
   Dental records were due to arrive Monday, and officials hoped
they would help to speed up the identification process.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first accident involving a Blue Hawaiian tour
helicopter since the company began operations in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hawaii's third major aircraft crash in 11 months. On
Sept. 25, a tour plane crashed on the slopes of Mauna Loa on the
Big Island, killing all 10 people on board. On May 10, a private
jet slammed into a hillside while approaching an airport on
Molokai, killing all six people on board.

<HEADLINE> Artist who did backgrounds for classic Disney films dead at 84  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTEREY, Calif. (AP) - New York native Eyvind Earle, who
painted the backgrounds for the classic Disney films ''Sleeping
Beauty'' and ''Lady and the Tramp,'' is dead at 84.
</P>
<P>
   He died Thursday of esophageal cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Earle came to Walt Disney's attention in the early 1950s, when
he created the look for the animated short ''Toot, Whistle, Plunk
and Boom,'' which won both an Oscar and a Cannes Film Festival
award.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the decade, Disney kept him busy painting the
settings for such stories as ''Peter Pan,'' ''Paul Bunyan'' and
''Lady and the Tramp.''
</P>
<P>
   For ''Sleeping Beauty,'' he not only did the movie's magical,
medieval background but also the Disneyland dioramas for Sleeping
Beauty's Castle.
</P>
<P>
   Earle was already a well-established artist when Disney
discovered him, having had his first exhibition in France when he
was 13.
</P>
<P>
   He was showing his work in galleries in Hollywood and Beverly
Hills when he was 20, and when he was 21 he bicycled across the
country, paying his way by painting watercolors. He was 23 when he
sold his first watercolor to the New York Metropolitan Museum of
Art.
</P>
<P>
   He began adapting his landscapes to Christmas cards in the
1940s, eventually painting more than 800 designs that have sold
more than 300 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   Earle began painting when he was 10, after his father challenged
him to either paint a picture a day or read 50 pages a day. He
chose to do both.
</P>
<P>
   After his parents divorced, he traveled the world with his
father for a time, painting in such exotic locales as Mexico, Cuba,
Spain, Holland, Belgium, France and Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   The New York native eventually returned to the United States,
settling in Los Angeles with his mother. There, he dropped out of
high school shortly before graduation to take a job as a sketch
artist at United Artists studios.

<HEADLINE> Mariners 6, Athletics 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Edgar Martinez hit his 25th home run, leading
Jamie Moyer and the Seattle Mariners over the Oakland Athletics 6-4
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   All-Star shortstop Alex Rodriguez was activated from the 15-day
disabled list before the game by the Mariners, but did not play.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer (11-3) beat the A's for the sixth straight time. Overall,
he's won eight of his last nine decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer gave up three runs and six hits in 6 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Kazuhiro Sasaki pitched the ninth, giving up an RBI single to
Terrence Long, for his 24th save in 26 opportunities. He's been
successful in his last 14 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Appier (8-8) tied a career high with his fifth loss in a
row. He allowed five runs on nine hits and six walks in six
innings, and remained winless since June 23.
</P>
<P>
   Appier struggled in the first inning, throwing 32 pitches as the
Mariners took a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle loaded the bases with a one-out single by Martinez
sandwiched between a pair of walks. Stan Javier then beat out an
infield hit and, after Mike Cameron struck out, David Bell was hit
by a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   After a single by Mark McLemore and a double by Rickey Henderson
to open the Mariners second, Carlos Guillen had an RBI groundout
and John Olerud singled home a run to give Moyer a comfortable 4-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland got an unearned run in the fourth. With one out, Randy
Velarde reached on an error by third baseman David Bell, Jason
Giambi singled for the Athletics' first hit and Olmedo Saenz hit an
RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez homered in the bottom half, giving him a major
league-leading 94 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners scored a run with two outs in the eighth, Cameron
singled, stole second and scored on an RBI single by Bell.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Appier made his 300th start of his career, making him the
22nd active pitcher to reach that plateau. ... Appier is 13-6
lifetime record against Seattle. ... Oakland's season-best streak
of homering in all 11 games since the All-Star break was snapped.
... The A's, who lead the majors with 92 errors, have not made an
error in the last four games. ... Javier left the game after three
innings with a mild groin strain. ... Moyer is 6-0 in six starts
following a Mariners loss this season. ... Henderson's fifth-inning
single moved him into a tie with Frankie Frisch for 33rd place on
the career hit list with 2,880.

Biodegradable Surgical Tools Studied

   DALLAS (AP) -- Tiny coils used to prop open the clogged arteries of heart
patients now come in a biodegradable form -- and they may work just as well as
widely used metal versions, according to a new study. Tests of the biodegradable
coils, called stents, could change the way doctors perform surgery to reopen
narrowed blood vessels, according to Japanese researchers who performed the
tests on a small group of human patients. No deaths, heart attacks or bypass
surgeries were recorded among the 15 heart patients who were given the plastic,
zigzag-shaped coils over a six-month period, according to the lead researcher,
Dr. Hideo Tamai of Shiga Medical Center in Shiga, Japan.

and joining an earlier gas attack, the court said. Satoru Hashimoto, 33, and
four other cult members had already been found liable in civil lawsuits for the
1989 killings of attorney Tsutsumi Sakamoto, his wife and infant son. Hashimoto
was the second former member of the Aum Shinri Kyo cult to be sentenced to death

himself with a shot to the chest and was found dead in the master bedroom. The
hostage, Andrea Hall, 40, had been dead for several hours. Hall, 40, might have
been shot Sunday by police sharpshooters who fired into the home, said Orange

<HEADLINE> Peru Adds 18 Russian Fighter Jets  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Despite threatened cuts in anti-narcotics aid
from the United States, President Alberto Fujimori said Peru will
carry on the fight against drug trafficking with its fleet of
Russian-made fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
   At an anniversary ceremony for Peru's air force Sunday, Fujimori
announced that 18 Sukhoi-25 tactical fighter jets purchased for the
country's now-ended border conflict with Ecuador would be used for
anti-narcotics efforts. Peru and Ecuador signed a peace treaty in
October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even if it is only with our own resources, Peru will be a
barrier to narcotics trafficking,'' Fujimori said. ''Peru's
struggle against narcotics trafficking will not be halted.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States acknowledges Fujimori as one of its most
effective regional partners in the fight against narcotics. But
Congress last month held back $42 million of emergency
anti-narcotics and development aid and threatened to cut back
millions more following Fujimori's win of a third term as president
in a May 28 election tainted by irregularities and fraud
allegations.

<HEADLINE> Nevada Coalition Registering Voters  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT SONNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENO, Nev. (AP) -- The nation's fastest growing state is
notoriously sluggish when it comes to elections.
</P>
<P>
   Two out of three Nevadans choose not to go to the polls on
Election Day in 1998, the lowest percentage in the nation. The last
presidential election was a little better, but the 38 percent
turnout didn't bump Nevada from its worst-in-the-nation status. The
national average in 1996 was 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're a bit embarrassed about being 50th in the nation,'' said
Vicki LoSasso of the Nevada Women's Lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Now a coalition of groups representing the state's women,
minorities, gays and environmentalists has launched a
voter-registration drive to put more Nevadans behind the voting
curtains.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe the most direct way to give power back to
low-income women is to register them to vote and then get them to
vote,'' said Teresa Benitez, interim director of the Nevada
Empowered Women's Project.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada said
Monday they plan to target low-income and minority communities in
hopes of registering 3,000 new voters statewide.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to register all people to vote, especially us
minorities who haven't taken part in the past. This is a crucial
year,'' said Onie Cooper, past president of the Reno-Sparks NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   Others participating in the $40,000 campaign called ''Vote
2000-Nevada Freedom Summer'' include hotel and restaurant
employees, Latinos for Political Education, Nevada Urban Indians,
the Great Basin Mine Watch and the Reno-based gay rights
organization, A Rainbow Place.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a diverse group, everything from environmentalists
to social justice, workers' rights and Latino organizations,'' said
Tom Stoneburner, director of the Alliance for Workers' Rights
northern Nevada chapter in Reno.
</P>
<P>
   The voter registration effort is nonpartisan, with no
preferences for candidates. However, the groups participating
traditionally have been viewed primarily as Democratic
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada's turnout hasn't always been poor. During President
Kennedy's tenure, it was 58 percent but has gone into a downward
spiral ever since, according to Ted Jelen, chairman of the
political science department at the University of Nevada at Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Rocio Lopez, a field organizer for the Progressive Leadership
Alliance of Nevada, said one of the reason's for Nevada's low
turnout is the transient nature of the area.
</P>
<P>
   The Las Vegas-area population jumped 55 percent between 1990 and
1998 to reach 1,321,546 residents -- an increase of 468,900, the
Census Burean said. Many new arrivals move into the state thinking
they won't stay long and so they don't register to vote. Other
elements that affect voting include a suspicion of government and
political cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Fulkerson, executive director of the alliance, said the
highest voter turnout in Nevada comes from older white residents
with moderate to upper incomes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are targeting youths, low- to moderate-income people of
color with traditionally low turnout,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez agreed: ''We're going to go out and talk to people who
look like us. We can go into disenfranchised communities and
explain to them first hand why it is important to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a twist, the alliance hopes to take a page from an
unlikely inspiration -- the Christian right.
</P>
<P>
   ''The religious political extremists vote in droves,'' said
Fulkerson. ''They have meetings every Sunday and they make sure
they all are registered. It is very admirable. It is something we
need to aspire to.''

<HEADLINE> Peru Opposition Jeers Defectors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Opposition lawmakers jeered and threw coins at
one of several elected legislators whose defection to President
Alberto Fujimori's ranks appears to have given the authoritarian
leader majority control of Peru's Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Before swearing his oath for a five-year term on Monday, Luis
Caceres retrieved the coins -- a symbolic message that his
allegiance to Fujimori was bought -- and defiantly hurled them back
at his opposition critics.
</P>
<P>
   Caceres jumped to Fujimori's party last month after the Supreme
Court surprisingly reversed an embezzlement conviction and a
suspended three-year jail sentence stemming from when he was mayor
of Arequipa, Peru's second-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   The National Election Board immediately endorsed his
congressional win, which otherwise would have been blocked because
of his criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's foes said the move demonstrated the level of control
that the president has over the courts and election system.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori and his supporters have denied charges from
presidential opponent Alejandro Toledo and others that $50,000
bribes, along with promises of up to $10,000 a month, were offered
as incentives to switch to the government's side.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori claimed an unprecedented third five-year term May 28 in
an election riddled with irregularities and allegations of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters took 52 seats in the April 9 general elections --
nine short of the 61 seats needed to maintain his eight-year
majority in the 120-member unicameral chamber. Fujimori has said
publicly that he has 60 lawmakers on his side, and defectors said
Fujimori claimed privately that 63 have jumped ship.

<HEADLINE> Navy enlisted man gets 15 years on plea bargain in toddler's death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAY MINETTE, Ala. (AP) - A Navy enlisted man charged with the
murder of a toddler he was baby-sitting was sentenced Monday to 15
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Jose Ramirez, 25, of North Bergen, N.J., accepted a plea
bargain with prosecutors in Baldwin County Circuit Court, pleading
guilty to the lesser charge of first-degree manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The case had been scheduled to go to trial Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Foley police had charged Ramirez with killing 22-month-old Mason
Evans Brunson on July 24, 1999 in Foley. Mason was found dead in
bed at his home.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez was baby-sitting the child that day while the mother was
gone, investigators said. He originally told police that Mason had
fallen from a child's playground set.
</P>
<P>
   The Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences office in Mobile
ruled the death a homicide caused by blunt-force injuries.
</P>
<P>
   According to the arrest warrant, Ramirez ''intentionally''
killed Mason by ''throwing the child repeatedly against a wall
within the residence ... inflicting multiple blunt-force injuries
to the head and body.''
</P>
<P>
   By taking the prosecution's offer, Ramirez will likely be out of
prison within three to five years, according District Attorney
David Whetstone.
</P>
<P>
   Whetstone said a jury could have bee swayed by an initial
autopsy report that concluded Mason's death was an accident.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no doubt that the failure to do the complete autopsy
injured the state's case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The baby's father, Jim Brunson, also is in the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   A petty officer second class, Ramirez has been in the Navy since
1993 and assigned to Barin Outlying Landing Field near Foley since
October 1998.

<HEADLINE> Program hopes mixing water will improve oxygen levels in canals  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLARKSVILLE, Del. (AP) - The Delaware Coastal Program is
conducting two summer-long tests that scientists hope will improve
oxygen levels at the bottoms of the state's canals.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a million Atlantic menhaden suffocated, many
in a dead-end canal at the north end of Rehoboth Bay. Low levels of
oxygen near the canal bottom may have been to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are mixing canal water to try to equalize oxygen
levels, which are low at the bottom of the canals and high at the
top.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the mixers - about the size of a tall kitchen garbage
can - seem to be equalizing oxygen levels at a dead-end canal at
Indian River Acres near Clarksville and another in South Bethany
Beach, according to David B. Carter, a scientist and manager with
the Delaware Coastal Program.
</P>
<P>
   Carter and his team have found results mixed. More fish and more
types of fish have emerged at Indian River Acres, where open water
is near the canal system, than in South Bethany, where open water
is more than a half-mile away.
</P>
<P>
   The mixing equipment brought the oxygen levels closer together,
but in some sections of the South Bethany canal, oxygen levels were
still very low.
</P>
<P>
   Polluted water in the inland bays have sparked surface algae
blooms that draw dissolved oxygen from deeper water. In the bays'
dead-end canals, lack of circulation of new water from ocean or bay
tributaries, exacerbates the problem.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 study of dead-end canals in Delaware and Maryland found
that the channels were among the most environmentally degraded
places in the coastal bays, plagued by low oxygen, highly
contaminated bottom sediments and a low diversity of fish and other
species. The report was put together by Delaware, Maryland, the
Environmental Protection Agency and an independent consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, some have suggested the only way to improve
water quality is to fill in the canals. But Carter doesn't see that
as a practical solution.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're never going to be pristine,'' he said, ''but at least
we want to be sure they are not killing fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter is using grant money from the nonprofit Center for the
Inland Bays to test the mixing theory.
</P>
<P>
   If the technology is effective and can be used at a reasonable
cost, the benefits could be widespread. Along the Delaware and
Maryland coastal bays there are 91 separate, man-made canal
systems.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Ga. Governor Headed to Senate  </HEADLINE>
By DICK PETTYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- After nearly 40 years in politics, Zell Miller
said his 18 months in retirement were the finest of his life. When
the former Georgia governor and Marine was asked to do his duty
again, he had a simple response: ''Yes sir!''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes introduced his fellow Democrat as Georgia's
newest senator Monday. Miller was appointed to replace Republican
Paul Coverdell, who died last week of a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 68, said he will run in a special election in November
for the four years remaining in Coverdell's term. His appointment
increases the number of Democrats in the Senate to 46. There are 54
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I left the governor's office ... the fires of political
ambition that had burned so long and so strong within me had
finally cooled,'' Miller said. But he couldn't say no when Barnes
appealed to his sense of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was elected lieutenant governor in 1974 and served for 16
years. He was elected governor in 1990 -- beating Andrew Young and
Barnes, among others, in the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   Miller left office as one of the most popular governors in
Georgia history. His approval rating soared above 85 percent,
thanks mostly to his lottery-funded program that gave college
scholarships to any high school students with a ''B'' average or
better.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes called Miller the most qualified person for the Senate
job.
</P>
<P>
   ''The one who didn't want it was the one who had to take it,''
he said. ''It used to take seniority to get things done in the
United States Senate. Now it takes stature.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, anxious to reclaim the seat in November, said
Miller could be beaten despite his popularity and highly regarded
record as governor. State GOP chairman Chuck Clay suggested Miller
may belong more to the past than to Georgia's future.
</P>
<P>
   ''Georgia is a new state with hundreds of thousands of new
voters, mostly in Republican strongholds,'' he said. ''I think most
Georgians are going to want a Republican voice in a
Republican-controlled Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller campaigned for Clinton in 1992 and pushed up the Georgia
presidential primary that year to help his fellow Democratic
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he doubts that will be a factor in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have supported President Clinton when I thought he was right
and opposed him when I thought he was wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson said Barnes missed an opportunity to make
history by appointing a black. Several key black Democrats,
including state Attorney General Thurbert Baker, had been mentioned
as contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the safe way out, looking back, but it's not the right
way out, looking forward,'' Jackson said.

<HEADLINE> 'Big Brother' Draws Criticism  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Just thinking about the amount of work that
goes into ''Big Brother'' is exhausting.
</P>
<P>
   Camera crews and film editors work around the clock to bring the
housebound hi-jinks to television. The ''Big Brother'' contestants
work each other in hopes of gaining the $500,000 prize and instant
stardom.
</P>
<P>
   CBS is working overtime to promote the show, hoping against the
ratings evidence it will end up with another huge summer hit like
''Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   And TV viewers ... well, we're just getting worked over. The
artifice of this so-called reality show isn't contained by the
house; while the contestants are being manipulated by Big Brother,
so is the audience, in ways big and small.
</P>
<P>
   Consider last Thursday's show, when a breathless Julie Chen
prepared to announce the name of the first person to be kicked out
by fellow housemates and viewers. The answer, the
reporter-cum-ringmaster told us, would be coming up in a few
moments.
</P>
<P>
   When we finally learned that the loser was Philadelphia youth
counselor William Collins, more than 20 minutes had passed. A few
moments? In a medium that sells commercial time in 30-second
tidbits, that's a veritable lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Time was again an issue in the episode when Chen tried to
interview Collins about reports that emerged during his ''Big
Brother'' seclusion about a connection to the New Black Panther
Party for Self-Defense.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, given just about the length of a commercial break to
peruse news stories at the end of the show, was grudgingly
cooperative: ''Really, there's been no time for review. We need to
get the record straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Chen's visible discomfort, CBS couldn't have been too
concerned. Chen was only serving as a hawker for Bryant Gumbel's
interview with Collins on ''The Early Show'' Monday; otherwise, the
issue would have been raised with more than minutes to spare.
</P>
<P>
   More control games were ahead. When Collins was informed he
would be talking to Gumbel, his reaction seemed to be one of
displeasure. When he started to explain, Chen cut him off.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Big Brother'' contestants can diss each other for our
viewing pleasure. They can insult their spouses. But appear to
utter a word against a CBS celebrity and it's time to cover the
audience's ears.
</P>
<P>
   Collins was willing to keep his opinion of Gumbel to himself
during a news conference Sunday -- ''I've got to keep the hype
going,'' he said -- but vented about ''Big Brother'' itself and what
he sees as the show's dishonesty.
</P>
<P>
   The young man, who has dubbed himself ''Will Mega'' and has a
mega gift for gab, said viewers only got to see ''the intense,
analytical, debated, confrontational, argumentative, issue-pressing
Mega.''
</P>
<P>
   The prayerful Mega, the poetic Mega, were left on the editing
floor, he complained. Series executive producer Paul Romer, faced
with compressing 24 hours of footage into 22 minutes, was
unsympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   ''William's confrontations, in our opinion, were very
interesting. ... Those were a lot of the highlights, so we edited
them down and that was the show,'' Romer said.
</P>
<P>
   Not the truth, maybe, but the show. And, let's face it, Collins
himself seems to know as much about manipulation as a chiropractor
with a knack for cracking backs.
</P>
<P>
   He told reporters that he toyed with other contestants, playing
pranks and mind games, because of a lack of ''mental stimulus.''
But what he really cared about, he maintained, was using the show
as a forum for discussing race in America. Collins is black; most
of the ''Big Brother'' contestants are white.
</P>
<P>
   ''They need to understand that it's not necessarily important
for black people to have to assimilate into the majority's
culture,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Turning a banal enterprise like ''Big Brother'' into a vehicle
for social debate is a neat trick, and one worth applauding.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked Sunday about his relationship with the new Black
Panther Party and its leader Khalid Abdul Muhammad -- who was ousted
from the Nation of Islam for calling Jews ''bloodsuckers'' --
Collins acted coy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want the press to play Don King between me and brother
minister (Muhammad),'' he said, declining to give specifics about
his political beliefs. So much for making something worthwhile out
of his bully ''Big Brother'' pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe Collins was just ''trying to keep the hype going,'' as
he put it. If so, he could take lessons from series producer Romer.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the winning contestant gets only $500,000 -- relatively
paltry, given that the ''Survivor'' winner gets $1 million and
game-show brides expect multimillionaires -- Romer responded the
show was ''about the challenge and not about the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, brother. And CBS executives are chortling about 30-second
''Survivor'' spots going for $600,000 because it's all about the
accomplishment, not the cash.
</P>
<P>
   Just what kind of pushovers do these guys think we are?

</P>
<P>
   But hurting investors' mood was news from the National
Association of Realtors that existing home sales rose 2.8 percent
in June. Economists had expected sales to drop. Higher housing
sales could signal that the U.S. economy is still surging, which
could prompt Federal Reserve policymakers to raise interest rates
again when they meet next month.
</P>
<P>
   After falling for two days, stocks seemed to be drifting as
investors contemplate the impact of a slowing economy and wonder
whether the Fed is indeed done raising interest rates for the next
few months.
</P>
<P>
   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony before a House committee
today offered investors little new information about which way the
central bank is leaning on interest rates. Last week, Greenspan
told a Senate panel that inflation appeared to be under control and
he hinted the Fed might leave interest rates alone for the time
being.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is still looking for some guidance and not getting
it in terms of reaction to earnings,'' said Barry Hyman, chief
market strategist for Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. ''We are still
looking for some definitive answers on whether the economy is
indeed slowing.''
</P>
<P>
   He said stocks rose well in the weeks before earnings season,
and investors are selling on the largely positive profit reports.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceutical stocks drew investors' attention. Pfizer, down
$3.625 to $43.938, beat earnings projections by a penny after the
market closed Monday, but flat Viagra sales raised some concern
among analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Schering-Plough, maker of allergy pill Claritin, and Pharmacia,
maker of arthritis drug Celebrex, both met forecasts today. Shares
of Schering fell $2.25 cents to $42.125 and Pharmacia rose $3.50 to
$56.375.
</P>
<P>
   Dow component McDonald's matched Wall Street earnings forecasts
today, but said it sees stronger sales in the second half of the
year. The company's stock rose was unchanged at $30.50.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 432.34 million
shares, down from Monday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 2.14 at 512.12.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Looks to Future Mideast Deal  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- The Middle East peace talks at Camp David
collapsed Tuesday in a deadlock over the future of Jerusalem.
Conceding failure, President Clinton said the Israelis and
Palestinians ''couldn't get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton returned to the White House to say that the gaps between
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat had not been bridged, but forecast that they will be
''because I think the alternative is unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they both remain committed to peace,'' he said. ''I
think they will both find a way to get there if they don't let time
run away from them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli and Palestinian delegations said in a statement they
intended ''to continue their efforts to conclude an agreement on
all permanent status issues as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   They also said they understood the importance of avoiding
unilateral actions.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat spent two weeks at Camp David with Clinton as
the sponsor and sometimes personal mediator in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   It had become clear earlier in the day that no serious headway
was in sight despite an offer by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to recognize some sort of
Palestinian sovereignty in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton credited both sides with seeking a compromise on the
city's future, but appeared to suggest Barak took bolder steps.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Palestinians changed their position, they moved forward,''
he said, lifting the veil of secrecy he had imposed on the details
of the negotiations. ''The Israelis moved more.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, the president said ''Prime Minister Barak
showed courage and vision'' and Arafat ''made clear he remains
committed to peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian sources said the breaking point was Israel's refusal
to recognize Palestinian sovereignty over Jerusalem's walled Old
City, offering only access to the Al Aqsa mosque, the third-holiest
site in Islam. Arafat was infuriated, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan Abdel Rahman, the PLO's representative in Washington,
said Israel's offer of limited sovereignty was unacceptable and a
''nonstarter.'' He said the Palestinians had insisted on
sovereignty over all of the Old City.
</P>
<P>
   ''Regarding the issue of Jerusalem, as with other issues, the
Palestinians did not change their positions during the discussions,
so there was no chance of arriving at an agreement,'' said Gadi
Baltiansky, a spokesman for Barak.
</P>
<P>
   At 3 a.m. Tuesday, Arafat sent a letter to Clinton, saying he
saw no point in continuing because the Israeli position on
Jerusalem could never lead to an agreement, Palestinian sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you ask me did they make enough progress to get this done,
'yes,''' Clinton said. ''But they've got to go home and check,
they've got to feel around.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel that we have the elements here to keep this process
going. ... I think it can happen,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But the president said he was not trying to a ''sunny gloss'' on
the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ''They couldn't get there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he believes there could be Israeli-Palestinian
agreement before the end of his term, noting that the two sides had
earlier set a Sept. 13 deadline for an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The president said, as had been disclosed before, that the
status of Jerusalem was the more intractable issue. But even on
that, he said, there was not ''a great deal of disagreement'' on
the practical, operational questions of the way people there would
live under some future accord.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the breakdown was quick.
</P>
<P>
   ''This failure is another indication that the only choice we
have is resistance,'' said Hamas leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin. ''Only
by force are we able to retain our rights. ... We are ready to
become martyrs, and we say one short sentence: They will pay a high
price if they think to attack us and reoccupy the land.''
</P>
<P>
   The breakdown came despite redoubled efforts by Clinton, who
returned to Camp David Sunday night after a four-day trip to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   For the second night in a row, Clinton held late-night talks,
Tuesday's ending at 3:15 a.m., said spokesman P.J. Crowley. The
president was up again 5&AMP;frac12; hours later in an effort to jump-start a
15th day of talks.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the contentious summit, there had been repeated
reports that one side or the other was ready to pack their bags and
walk out. On Wednesday, the White House even formally announced
that the talks had ended in failure.
</P>
<P>
   The main point of dispute is Jerusalem, which both sides claim
as their capital. Other top issues were the fate of several million
Palestinian refugees and the boundaries of a future Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has insisted that Jerusalem can never be divided.
</P>
<P>
   The breakdown came shortly before Clinton was due to leave for
Arkansas for a memorial service for Diane Blair, a University of
Arkansas political science professor and a close friend who died of
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who has been under constant pressure from right-wing
political opponents at home, got a new reminder Tuesday of the
battle that could await him if he makes sweeping concessions to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a rare news
conference broadcast live in prime time on both Israeli TV
channels, said he wanted to prevent a ''ripping apart'' of Israeli
society ''that could happen in the next few days.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What we hear from most of the reports out of Camp David does
not answer our hopes,'' Netanyahu said, demanding that Barak reject
any deal that would call for sharing sovereignty over Jerusalem
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse freed Secretary of State Madeleine to flight to
Bangkok, Thailand, Tuesday night for a meeting of the Association
of SOutheast Asian countries. She plans talks there with North
Korea's foreign minister on that country's missile program.

<HEADLINE> Yanks Complete David Justice Trade  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Cleveland Indians made their choice -- they
want pitchers Jake Westbrook and Zach Day from the New York
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have sent Westbrook and Day to the Indians to
complete last month's trade for outfielder David Justice, the
Indians said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to a very good organization. It gives me a new
opportunity,'' Day said Monday at the Yankees' complex in Tampa,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was kind of shocked. But the way things have been going,
nothing surprises me. The Yankees are going after it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees sent outfielder Ricky Ledee and two players to be
named to Cleveland for Justice on June 29. At the time, the teams
agreed on about a half-dozen players the Indians could pick from.
</P>
<P>
   Westbrook, a 22-year-old right-hander, was 0-2 with a 13.50 ERA
in three games, two of them starts, for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Westbrook lasted only 1 2-3 innings against the Chicago White
Sox in his major league debut June 17. Boston chased him after 2
2-3 innings in his other start June 22.
</P>
<P>
   At Triple-A Columbus, he was 5-7 with a 4.87 ERA. He was
recently put on the disabled list with a strained left side.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees acquired Westbrook from Montreal last December in
the deal for pitcher Hideki Irabu. New York had hopes that he could
someday be part of the rotation -- he started the exhibition opener
for the two-time World Series champions.
</P>
<P>
   Day, also a 22-year-old right-hander, was 2-4 with a 4.19 ERA at
Class A Tampa. He began the season at Class A Greensboro.
</P>
<P>
   Day was the Yankees' fifth-round pick in the 1996 draft. This is
his fifth season in pro ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians were expected to assign Day to Double-A Akron.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's tough. I've played here four years. I know everybody in
the organization. It probably won't sink in for a couple days,''
Day said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Bears' Execs Placed Bets  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A convicted bookmaker says two former Chicago
Bears executives gambled on sports and never disclosed their
association with the team, the Chicago Sun-Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Glickman told the newspaper that Ken Valdiserri, the team's
former marketing executive, and Bryan Harlan, the former public
relations director, used bogus names to place bets for four or five
years, with each bet about $200 to $300.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL bars betting on its games by players and team employees
and prohibits them from associating with gamblers or gambling
activities that discredit the league.
</P>
<P>
   NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said this is a security issue for the
league. He said the accusations involve former employees and don't
affect players or coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Bears officials have said the organization maintains a
zero-tolerance policy regarding sports gambling. Bears spokesman
Scott Hagel on Tuesday refused to comment on the accusations
against Valdiserri and Harlan.
</P>
<P>
   Valdiserri, who left the team in April and is now the general
manager of Chicago's new XFL franchise, was subpoenaed two years
ago in a federal gambling probe but was not required to testify
before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Valdiserri has said he was not involved with any sports betting.
He could not be reached for comment Tuesday; no home telephone
listing could be found under his name and a message left with the
XFL was not immediately returned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Valdiserri has said he was subpoenaed because phone numbers
assigned to him by the team turned up in Glickman's records. He
said somebody borrowing his phones must have made the calls. He
said he routinely lent those phones.
</P>
<P>
   NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said Harlan, who resigned two
weeks ago, admitted violating league policy on gambling. The
Sun-Times said he was the subject of a federal investigation after
his phone number was found in a bookmaker's telephone records.
</P>
<P>
   Harlan has declined to speak publicly since his resignation. He
did not return a message seeking comment left on his home phone
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman, who was sent to federal prison for two years in 1976
for bookmaking, said none of his Bears customers revealed any
inside information. He also said no players or coaches placed bets
with him.

<HEADLINE> Senate Panel OKs Conservation Bill  </HEADLINE>
By BART JANSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate panel approved a landmark
conservation bill Tuesday that supporters say will provide a
reliable $3 billion a year for buying land, restoring coastlines
and protecting wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Western Republicans and other critics vowed to continue fighting
the bill, which they termed a federal land grab and ''pile of
pork.''
</P>
<P>
   The Energy and Resources Committee approved the bill 13-7 with
four Republicans joining all nine Democrats. The vote came after 11
hours of debate over five days.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the most significant commitment of resources ever made
to conservation by the Congress,'' said Chairman Frank Murkowski,
R-Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The White House supports the bill and the House overwhelmingly
approved a similar measure in May. Unlike the House version, the
Senate bill would require Congress to vote on each purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hardiman, a lobbyist for the American Land Rights
Association and bill opponent, said critics would step up efforts
to defeat the measure in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a $45 billion pile of pork,'' Hardiman said. ''We're
going to fight this to the last ditch.''
</P>
<P>
   Murkowski said he believes the bill has the 60 votes necessary
to stop a filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would create a $3 billion-a-year fund for 15 years to
pay for an array of conservation activities, from restoring beaches
to creating urban parks. The money would come from oil and gas
leases, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico and off Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would provide $450 million a year for federal land
purchases and another $450 million for states to buy property. The
remaining money would be spent on conservation programs, but only
if Congress spends the $450 million for federal land purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Despite inducements such as doubling payments to local
governments to replace lost tax revenue for federal land, Western
Republicans still don't like the bill. They say the government
mismanages land it already owns and shouldn't add more acreage.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 701.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan's Vice Premier Resigns  </HEADLINE>
By ANNIE HUANG
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Stranded in the middle of a raging river,
the four construction workers waited for hours to be rescued,
clutching each other until floodwaters broke their grips and swept
them away.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the weekend disaster claimed new victims: Taiwan's
Vice Premier Yu Shyi-kun resigned, taking the blame for a bungled
attempt to save the men. The top police and fire officials also
stepped down.
</P>
<P>
   The fiasco, which involved poor communication between military
and police helicopters, created the biggest crisis so far for
President Chen Shui-bian, who took office in May promising to make
the government more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, a former Taipei mayor, apologized to the victims'
relatives Tuesday and blamed the deaths on a rigid emergency rescue
system, according to a Presidential Office statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''The value of human life is supreme. This new government shall
not tolerate any tiny bit of the old bureaucratic mentality,'' Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan was riveted Saturday by live TV coverage of the four
workers in straw hats and gray shirts gripping each other as they
stood knee-deep in the rushing waters in southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers tried in vain to throw them a rope and pull them
out of the Pachang River in central Chiayi county, and helicopters
arrived too late to help. All four bodies have been found.
</P>
<P>
   At a legislative hearing Tuesday, Premier Tang Fei, Taiwan's No.
3 leader, said the delay in rescue operations was caused by faulty
communication between the air force and police teams -- resulting in
the police chopper flying to the scene hours after the workers were
discovered trapped.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters also said they tried to rescue the men but a gun
that shoots ropes out to the victims did not work.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition lawmakers seized on the rescue failure, saying it was
an example of the new government's inexperience and
disorganization. Some held up pictures of the victims in the
legislature, while others demanded that Chen cancel an upcoming
trip to Central America and concentrate on domestic affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue relief has long been a weakness for Taiwan. Last
September, hundreds of people died in the rubble of a massive
earthquake because emergency officials weren't prepared for such a
disaster. Rescuers lacked basic tools and communication was poor.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Returning Eritrean Refugees  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- The United Nations on Tuesday launched an
operation to return home some 90,000 Eritreans who fled to
neighboring Sudan after fighting flared between their country and
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   More than 18,000 refugees have registered to return, while
thousands more have returned on their own in recent weeks, said Ron
Redmond, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many more are enlisting to go back to Eritrea every day,''
Redmond said. ''The Eritrean government expects the operation to be
completed in one month, depending on the weather.''
</P>
<P>
   The first of some 80 trucks sent by Eritrea started loading
refugees at the Lafa and Gulsa camps in Sudan on Tuesday morning.
They will take the Eritreans to their homes or to transit centers
in Eritrea's western Teseney area.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees at a third camp in Shagarab, 44 miles from the border,
will travel home starting Wednesday, Redmond said.
</P>
<P>
   The Eritreans have been living in the camps for more than two
months. They were forced to flee their shops and farms because of
fighting during Eritrea's two-year war with Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting broke out May 12 when Ethiopia launched a sweeping
offensive into Eritrean territory, forcing some 1 million Eritreans
to flee.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia and Eritrea signed an agreement to end the fighting on
June 18. They also agreed to the deployment of a U.N. force to
secure a 15-mile buffer zone inside Eritrea, while independent
experts demarcate their disputed 620-mile border.
</P>
<P>
   Before the crisis, UNHCR had been preparing to bring home some
160,000 Eritreans who fled to Sudan at the start of their country's
war of independence 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That program was put on hold and will only resume once the
refugees from the latest fighting have left -- possibly at the end
of the rainy season in October, Redmond said.

<HEADLINE> Ottey Going To Her Sixth Olympics  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) -- Merlene Ottey will be going to her
sixth Olympics, but it is uncertain if she will run the 100 meters
for Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-year-old sprinter was placed on the 48-member team
Monday. The squad features five athletes who competed at the 1996
Atlanta Games, including Deon Hemmings, winner of the gold medal in
the 400 meter hurdles, and long jumper James Beckford, a silver
medalist in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Ottey, returning from a one-year ban from international
competition, placed fourth at the trials Friday. She finished in
11.21 seconds, behind national champion Peta-Gaye Dowdie, who
retained her title with a time of 11.19, as well as Beverley
McDonald and Tanya Lawrence. The four will run in the 4x100 relay.
</P>
<P>
   Ottey has won seven medals, including two silver ones at
Atlanta. If she competes in the 100, one of the other runners would
have to step aside.
</P>
<P>
   Ottey withdrew last summer from the world championships in Spain
after traces of the steroid nandrolone supposedly were found in her
system.
</P>
<P>
   The Jamaican Amateur Athletic Association cleared Ottey within
months, but the International Amateur Athletic Federation sent
Ottey's case to arbitrators. On July 3, the IAAF lifted the ban
after concluding the Swiss laboratory improperly tested Ottey's
urine sample.

<HEADLINE> Statement From Mideast Talks  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The trilateral statement issued Tuesday by the United
States,
Israel and the Palestinians on the Camp David summit:
<TEXT>
<P>
   Between July 11 and 24, under the auspices of President Clinton,
Prime Minister Barak and Chairman Arafat met at Camp David in an
effort to reach an agreement on permanent status. While they were
not able to bridge the gaps and reach an agreement, their
negotiations were unprecedented in both scope and detail. Building
on the progress achieved at Camp David, the two leaders agreed on
the following principles to guide their negotiations:
</P>
<P>
   1) The two sides agreed that the aim of their negotiations is to
put an end to decades of conflict and achieve a just and lasting
peace.
</P>
<P>
   2) The two sides commit themselves to continue their efforts to
conclude an agreement on all permanent status issues as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   3) Both sides agree that negotiations based on U.N. Security
Council Resolutions 242 and 338 are the only way to achieve such an
agreement and they undertake to create an environment for
negotiations free from pressure, intimidation and threats of
violence.
</P>
<P>
   4) The two sides understand the importance of avoiding
unilateral actions that prejudge the outcome of negotiations and
that their differences will be resolved only by good-faith
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   5) Both sides agree that the United States remains a vital
partner in the search for peace and will continue to consult
closely with President Clinton and Secretary Albright in the period
ahead.

<HEADLINE> 'Big Brother' Criticized Anew  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Three weeks into its three-month run, I have
watched every episode of CBS' ''Big Brother.'' I have spent time
pondering what it all means.
</P>
<P>
   In the ''Big Brother'' house, I'm a virtual lodger. And I want
out!
</P>
<P>
   But when I go, I'll be taking with me many unanswered questions.
For starters: Why is anybody else still watching this piffle?
</P>
<P>
   The stationary bike the houseguests pedaled for 1,000 miles last
week serves as an apt metaphor for the show: a long-distance
exercise that's going nowhere, with the same drab scenery hour
after hour.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of cameras track the stir-crazy houseguests, yet reveal
almost nothing. How can this round-the-clock vigil yield so little?
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, what's the deal with these contestants? Here they
are, fueled by some inflated sense of their importance, which is
sparked, of course, by their certainty that millions are following
their every move. So why can't these show-offs rise to the occasion
and do something more interesting than chatter, bicker, goof off
and obsess?
</P>
<P>
   Another question: What viewer would be enticed to buy Ikea
furniture from seeing it arrayed in what looks like a Motel 6 under
surveillance? (''Gee, honey, not only is 'Big Brother' a cool show,
it's also full of decorating tips!'')
</P>
<P>
   Me, I'll take the great outdoors of ''Survivor,'' CBS' fellow
''reality'' series that boasts a tropical adventure in a setting
designed by Mother Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Like ''Survivor,'' the object of ''Big Brother'' is to endure a
war of attrition. Who will be the last of the 10 houseguests on
site? Who will win the half-million-dollar prize?
</P>
<P>
   But that's still a ways off. For now, the contestants mostly
play a waiting game. They wait, hoping they'll get lucky -- in one
fashion or another. So does the audience, waiting to see if there's
life in these deadbeats after all.
</P>
<P>
   Or am I missing the point? Aren't the houseguests supposed to
demean themselves and one another for the viewers' amusement? Fine.
When do we get to the good stuff?
</P>
<P>
   So far, we've been privy to the sorrows of wild-eyed Karen, a
wife and mother of four who seemed to arrive at the house straight
from a John Cassavetes film. Why has she stayed with her cold-fish
husband for 22 years? '''You can work it out' -- that's what my
mom's said all along,'' Karen tells the group. ''I want to please
my mom.''
</P>
<P>
   There's Brittany, a 25-year-old card-carrying virgin with Pippi
Longstocking hair. ''Do you feel like cuddling today?'' she asks
Karen and Josh. By pushing two beds together, ''we could all three
fit on there and cuddle.'' They do.
</P>
<P>
   There's Eddie, the Long Island lad who lost his left leg to
cancer. To compensate for it, he carries a chip on his shoulder.
Eddie had a contentious relationship with Will, the black activist
who last week became the first houseguest voted out.
</P>
<P>
   Sample Eddie-and-Will dialogue:
</P>
<P>
   Eddie: ''How stupid is that?''
</P>
<P>
   Will: ''It's not stupid to ME.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie: ''Yes, it IS stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Will: ''It's stupid to YOU.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie: ''It's stupid. It's dumb. It's retarded.''
</P>
<P>
   Will: ''It's NOT retarded.''
</P>
<P>
   And we mustn't forget Jordan. A pretty, athletic young woman,
she came into the house bearing a secret with which she tormented
herself (and us): She spent two years as an exotic dancer at a
gentleman's club.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the shame of it! In one episode, she's sobbing in bed with
her wireless mike as she describes a dream where ''I was like at
this stupid strip club and it was like really cheap.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm totally losing it right now,'' she wails, ''and I don't
know why.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, neither do I. But I do know that her overwrought
confession to her housemates barely registered a blip. Like, who
cares?
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Jordan has been telling anyone who'll listen that
she's ''so-o-o sexually frustrated.'' She's flirting with Josh, the
resident male bimbo who I wouldn't trust to tote my empties to the
recycling bin.
</P>
<P>
   How did the producers choose these people? After a newspaper
report linked Will to a black-activist leader who has expressed
anti-Semitic views, CBS president Les Moonves said background
checks on any future contestants would be handled differently.
</P>
<P>
   But he admitted, ''I don't know what we would do differently.''
</P>
<P>
   I know! Here's a foolproof way to weed out unsuitable
candidates: Just ask everyone, ''Do you really want to be on a TV
show that locks you up with strangers, then watches what you do
around the clock?'' Those who answer ''Yes'' are automatically
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't that solve a lot of problems?

<HEADLINE> Army Gen. Being Reassigned Again  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army general who commanded Fort Campbell,
Ky., when a gay private was murdered last year is being reassigned
for the second time this summer, this time to an Army post in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Army spokesman Lt. Col. Russ Oaks said Maj. Gen. Robert T.
Clark, commander at Fort Campbell until June, requested the move
for ''compassionate family requirements.'' The Kentucky post is
home to the 101st Airborne Division, to which slain Pfc. Barry
Winchell belonged.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's move ''will permit him to continue in service to the
nation as well as provide his family access to needed expert
medical care,'' Oaks said. He would not elaborate on the nature of
the family medical issue.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials speaking on condition of anonymity insisted
Clark's move was not a result of the Army inspector general's
report last week on circumstances surrounding Winchell's murder in
July 1999. The inspector general absolved all commanders at Fort
Campbell of responsibility for the anti-gay behavior at Campbell
that included frequent taunting of Winchell in the days before a
fellow soldier beat him to death with a baseball bat.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's report found evidence of low morale and anti-gay
behavior among members of Winchell's unit, D Company, 2nd Battalion
of the 502nd Infantry Regiment. It concluded, however, that the
chain of command at Fort Campbell, including Clark, responded
appropriately with respect to enforcing the Pentagon's policy of
permitting homosexuals to serve in the military so long as they
keep their sexual orientation private.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress urged Defense Secretary William Cohen
to act against Clark, arguing that the general had not acted
forcefully enough to stamp out anti-homosexual behavior at his
post.
</P>
<P>
   Oaks said Clark is being reassigned as deputy commanding general
of the 5th U.S. Army at San Antonio, Texas, effective Aug. 4. After
leaving Fort Campbell in June, Clark was assigned to a post on the
Joint Staff in the Pentagon, considered an important step toward
earning a third star.
</P>
<P>
   ''I regret that I am unable to continue to serve as a member of
the Joint Staff,'' Clark said in a statement issued by the Army.
''But I have to do what is right for my family.'' He thanked Gen.
Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Army
Chief of Staff Gen. Eric Shinseki for their understanding.

<HEADLINE> Steroids Found in Infielder's Car  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Red Sox infielder Manny Alexander faces an
investigation by major league baseball after police found illegal
steroids in his car.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander lent his car to the team's bat boy while the Red Sox
were in Chicago for a weekend series against the White Sox late
last month. Boston police found vials and syringes in the glove
compartment on June 30, the Boston Herald reported.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander refused to comment, but team spokesman Kevin Shea
confirmed Monday that baseball's security office and local law
enforcement officials were investigating and the Red Sox will
cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said Cowart was still employed by the team. He would not
disclose any disciplinary measures against Cowart.
</P>
<P>
   No criminal complaint has been filed in connection with the
steroids. Possession of steroids without a prescription carries a
sentence of up to one year in jail and a $1,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   The bat boy, Carlos Cowart, has no driver's license and has a
criminal record that includes charges for possessing cocaine and
marijuana, the Herald reported.
</P>
<P>
   Police noticed the parked car sticking out into traffic in the
Boston neighborhood of Dorchester. Cowart was in the car but a
friend was behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested Cowart and impounded the car when they learned
Cowart had an outstanding warrant for driving without a license and
failure to stop. When they searched the car, they found the drugs
in an envelope in the glove compartment.
</P>
<P>
   Cowart was arraigned July 3 on the outstanding warrant charge.
He could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, who came to Boston this year in a trade with the
Chicago Cubs, retrieved the car from a tow lot.

<HEADLINE> Russia Prepares For New Space Link  </HEADLINE>
By NICK WADHAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Focused intently on their computer screens,
experts at Russia's Mission Control on Tuesday slowly guided the
international space station toward a linkup with its control
module, the Russian-made Zvezda.
</P>
<P>
   Once the long-delayed station docks with Zvezda, it will be
finally ready for its first crew, set to arrive in October. But the
space laboratory, a massive 16-nation project headed by the United
States, will not be complete for another five years, after more
than 40 space flights.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said everything was in working order and that the
automatic docking would take place early Wednesday morning, Moscow
time. Firing Zvezda's jets several times over the weekend, space
controllers brought the 24-ton cylindrical module into a stationary
orbit and aligned the rest of the station -- currently made up of
two components -- for a smooth approach.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after docking, Zvezda's solar arrays will begin tracking
the sun, and within a few days, its computers will take full
control of maintaining the station's orbit. The piece is crucial
for the station's immediate future, providing living quarters and
steering controls and distributing electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Although the docking should be a routine procedure, Russia is
taking extra precautions with Zvezda, which means ''star'' in
Russian. If anything goes awry, two Russian cosmonauts will go into
space to do the job manually.
</P>
<P>
   But that scenario is one Russia desperately wants to avoid. The
manual docking system the cosmonauts would use is the same one used
in a 1997 test aboard the Mir space station, when a cargo ship went
astray and collided with the orbiter, puncturing the hull.
</P>
<P>
   Zvezda's flawless launch on July 12 was a relief for both
Russian and American space officials, who called it a major success
for American-Russian space partnership. Since the launch, Zvezda's
systems have been tested several times and ground controllers
performed a simulated docking.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of delays and some $3 billion in cost overruns
because of problems on the Russian side, questions had arisen about
Moscow's reliability as a partner, particularly since Zvezda was
the first module to be built solely by the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the U.S. Congress are questioning whether to
fund NASA's spending projections on the $60 billion project,
particularly after the failed launches of two Mars missions last
year. But they expressed cautious optimism about the Zvezda launch.
</P>
<P>
   A failed docking would be a major setback for the new station
and could delay work on it for at least two more years, if not call
the entire mission into doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The station is now made up of the Zarya module, built by Russia
with U.S. funds and launched in November 1998, and the NASA-built
Unity connecting chamber, launched in December 1998. The next major
piece to be added is the U.S.-built Destiny science module, the
center of the station's research activity, due to be launched in
January.
</P>
<P>
   As the station expands, many of Zvezda's functions will be taken
over by other components, but it will remain the heart of the
Russian segments. Once the space station is complete, it will weigh
about one million pounds and have six laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has also been criticized for keeping the Mir station in
orbit, though Russian space officials maintain the 14-year-old
station is still useful. The Netherlands-based MirCorp, which runs
Mir, announced earlier this month that the station would be
permanently manned beginning early next year, including visits by
''space tourists.''

<HEADLINE> Ravens Punter Ends Holdout  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTMINSTER, Md. (AP) -- After a one-day holdout, Baltimore
Ravens punter Kyle Richardson signed and returned to training camp
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, who set an NFL record last season with 39 punts
inside the 20 yard line, signed for one year at $385,000.
</P>
<P>
   As an exclusive-rights player, Richardson could not negotiate
with any other team and could play only for the Ravens for the 2000
season.
</P>
<P>
   The punter is beginning his fourth season in the NFL and third
with the Ravens. In 1998, Richardson beat out veteran Greg
Montgomery for the starting job and last season, he averaged 42.3
yards per punt.
</P>
<P>
   His 39 punts inside the 20 broke the league record of 35, set in
1994 by Pittsburgh's Mark Royals and Houston's Rich Camarillo.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens coach Brian Billick said the holdout would not count
against Richardson, who missed two practices Monday and an earlier
team meeting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're thrilled to have him back at camp and now it's time to
move on,'' Billick said. ''Kyle and I are fine and that's the way
it should be. The football end is fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson joined the NFL as a free agent in 1997, playing five
games for the Miami Dolphins and Seattle Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Travis Taylor, one of the Ravens' two first-round draft
picks this year, and veteran defensive tackle Tony Siragusa,
continued their holdouts.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, picked 10th overall out of Florida, wants an
incentive-laden deal between four and six years while the Ravens
proposed a contract for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Siragusa, 33, is in the last year of a contract that will pay
him $1.5 million this season and wants a contract extension worth
$5 million over the next two seasons.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs $101M N.M. Ranch Bill  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton signed a bill Tuesday to pay
$101 million for a sprawling New Mexico ranch he called ''an
extraordinary national treasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's signature gave final approval to the federal purchase
of Baca Ranch, a 95,000-acre swath of forested mountains and grassy
valleys that includes the collapsed crater of an ancient volcano.
Supporters of the purchase, including New Mexico's entire
congressional delegation, say the ranch is a pristine natural jewel
that deserves to be preserved for all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''This property is unique,'' said Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M.
''It deserves to be treated in a special way, set aside for future
generations and made available to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton signed the legislation at Camp David, the Maryland
retreat where Middle East peace talks ended Tuesday. The Senate
passed the bill in April, with the House approving it 377-45 July
12.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the government is paying far too much for the ranch
northwest of Santa Fe, which the late Texas oil tycoon James P.
Dunigan bought for $2.1 million in 1962. Rep. John Duncan Jr.,
R-Tenn., called the purchase ''a colossal rip-off of the
taxpayers'' in House debate this month.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the ranch is worth the money and add that it will
be managed by a unique trust, unlike other federal lands in New
Mexico. A nine-member board of trustees, at least five of them New
Mexicans, will manage the property as a working ranch while
allowing public access for hunting, fishing, hiking and other
recreation.
</P>
<P>
   The trustees are to be named within 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now the challenge is for the trustees to run it right ... and
in the public interest,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M.
</P>
<P>
   The law also allows the Santa Clara Pueblo to buy 5,000 acres of
the ranch that includes the headwaters of Santa Clara Creek. The
tribe uses the creek for drinking and irrigation as well as for
cultural purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The creek is ''almost a lifeline to the pueblo itself,'' Santa
Clara Gov. Denny Gutierrez said.

<HEADLINE> Opera Star Hans Sotin Quits Festival  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAYREUTH, Germany (AP) -- Veteran opera star Hans Sotin,
scheduled to play Gurnemanz in Richard Wagner's ''Parsifal,'' quit
in a huff just a day before the start of the renowned Wagner music
festival in Bayreuth.
</P>
<P>
   Sotin, in a phone call Monday to the Nordbayerischer Kurier
newspaper, cited ''irreconcilable differences'' with the director.
There were no immediate specifics on the spat.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfgang Wagner, the 81-year-old grandson of Richard Wagner and
festival chief, said he regretted Sotin's decision, but didn't want
to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   This year's annual Richard Wagner Festival, the 89th, has been
clouded by a feud between Wagner's descendants over how the
festival he founded should be run.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has pitted Wolfgang Wagner, who has run the festival
for nearly 50 years, against other descendants who want to breathe
fresh air into the production.
</P>
<P>
   The festival runs from Tuesday evening through next Monday.

   But the sport's world governing body might have the last word on
their futures.
</P>
<P>
   European 200-meter champion Doug Walker was given the go-ahead
to run by a judge in London. Mark Richardson, the 400-meter runner,
was exonerated by his federation after researchers concluded
dietary supplements can trigger positive results for nandrolone.
</P>
<P>
   Both athletes hope to compete in the Sydney Olympics in
September.
</P>
<P>
   The British federation, UK Athletics, has consistently given its
athletes the benefit of the doubt in nandrolone cases, putting it
on a collision course with the International Amateur Athletic
Federation.
</P>
<P>
   The British research corroborated the findings of another recent
nandrolone study commissioned by FIFA, soccer's governing body.
</P>
<P>
   UK Athletics had cleared Walker a year ago for a positive
nandrolone test in November 1998. The IAAF refused to accept the
ruling and submitted his case to arbitration. A hearing is expected
Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, a 26-year-old Scottish sprinter, was cleared by a High
Court judge Tuesday to compete at the British Olympic trials Aug.
12-13.
</P>
<P>
   The IAAF said the ruling is valid only in Britain and Walker
remains banned from competing outside the country, pending the
arbitration hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that Tuesday's ruling could stand for only two
weeks, Walker said, ''It gives me a chance. It's all I can ask
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson may compete in the trials, but the IAAF could
intervene before then.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've pressed and harassed people to get some kind of review
on nandrolone,'' Richardson said. ''Now the scientific evidence is
on the table, and my name has been cleared.''
</P>
<P>
   In similar cases, UK Athletics cleared former 100-meter Olympic
and world champion Linford Christie, hurdler Gary Cadogan as well
as Walker after they all tested positive for nandrolone more than a
year ago. But the three were later suspended by the IAAF, which
wants to review their cases.
</P>
<P>
   According to IAAF rules, athletes with levels of a banned
substance above the allowed limit are considered offenders unless
they can prove the test results were erroneous or there were
medical reasons for the elevated levels.
</P>
<P>
   IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said from his headquarters in
Monaco that his group will need to examine the British study.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there is something unusual, something strange, there is the
possibility for the group to suggest that exceptional circumstances
surrounding the cases can alter the outcome of the test,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nandrolone has been available for decades and is easily
detectable in standard urine tests. There have been 343 positive
nandrolone cases in all sports around the world the past year.

<HEADLINE> Fire Wrecks Kim Novak's Mementoes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAGLE POINT, Ore. (AP) -- Veteran actress Kim Novak watched
helplessly as many of her priceless mementoes went up in flames
when a fire swept through her one-story wood-frame house.
</P>
<P>
   The Monday fire was apparently electrical, and probably linked
to a tree falling across a power line the night before, said Deputy
Fire Marshal Phil Cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   The flames destroyed her scripts from the Alfred Hitchcock
classic ''Vertigo,'' and ''Picnic,'' as well as the computer on
which she had been writing her autobiography. Novak said her dogs,
horses, llamas and a family of orphaned geese she had raised were
spared.
</P>
<P>
   ''I take it personally as a sign my story should not be told,''
Novak said of the book she has been working on for a decade. ''I
read signs. Unfortunately, they have to be pretty heavy duty signs
for me to recognize them.''
</P>
<P>
   Novak's husband of 23 years, veterinarian Bob Malloy, said a
cottonwood fell across a power line Sunday night, and power company
crews restored electricity about midnight.
</P>
<P>
   When the couple woke the next morning, Malloy said he switched a
circuit breaker to restore power. The next thing he knew, flames
had spread across the back of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Novak, 67, said this loss was easier to take than the
destruction of her home in Bel Air, Calif., during a mudslide in
the 1960s, which carried off paintings by Picasso and her own work.
</P>
<P>
   ''That made me realize what was valuable,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Ted Turner To Donate U.N. Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Billionaire media mogul Ted Turner has
announced plans here to dedicate $42 million of his United Nations
Foundation funds to social and environmental projects around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ''Working with the UN, we have developed an exciting program to
help protect some of the world's most important natural
resources,'' Turner, the foundation's chairman, said in a statement
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian First Lady Ruth Cardoso, who sits on the foundation's
board of directors, said another area of special focus would be on
improving the lives of adolescent girls.
</P>
<P>
   ''Addressing girls' needs for health, self-esteem, livelihood
opportunities and education has been extremely successful here in
Brazil, and UNF's support will help to promote a brighter future
for girls all over the world,'' Cardoso said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation was created by Turner in 1998 after he pledged to
donate $1 billion to the United Nations the previous year.

<P>
   SHREVEPORT, La. (AP) -- The musical act The Cox Family is trying
to regroup and plan for the future after two members were injured
in a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   Willard and Marie Cox were listed in fair condition Sunday at
LSU Hospital in Shreveport, according to hospital staff. They
perform alongside their son Sidney and daughters Evelyn and
Suzanne.
</P>
<P>
   Willard Cox, a Grammy Award-winning fiddler, has a crushed spine
and cannot walk. Marie Cox suffered a fractured vertebrae, a broken
arm and rib, a bruised kidney and a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in tough shape and don't know how it's going to turn
out. We'll just have to wait and see,'' Marie Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Cox said her father's mood was upbeat. ''We were all
really sad at first, but now we're trying to look a little ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple had stopped on a highway Wednesday when a logging
truck struck them from behind, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The family quartet from Cotton Valley is known for their brew of
gospel, bluegrass and country. They have played together since
1976, with Willard on the fiddle, Sidney and Evelyn on guitar and
Suzanne on mandolin.

<HEADLINE> Rangers' Rodriguez Out For Season  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- When Ivan Rodriguez's right thumb
crash-landed into the barrel of Mo Vaughn's bat, there went the
last bit of hope from an already disastrous season for the Texas
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Losing the reigning AL MVP and the team's only All-Star for the
rest of the season with a broken throwing hand ended any remote
chance of Texas retaining the AL West title it has won the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was scheduled to undergo surgery Tuesday on the broken
bone.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers general manager Doug Melvin is getting more than
consolation calls from his counterparts. With Texas 11&AMP;frac12; games out,
contenders are combing Texas' roster in search of players to put
them over the top.
</P>
<P>
   John Wetteland, David Segui and Luis Alicea are the most likely
to leave. All are free agents after this season, meaning the
Rangers could lose them anyway. Dumping them now would bring
something in return and help trim a payroll that's among the
highest.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland, the MVP of the 1996 World Series with the Yankees, is
the most attractive but teams may view him as a rent-a-reliever
because he would wind up re-signing with Texas in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know where this leaves us,'' Melvin said following
Rodriguez's injury Monday night. ''All I know is it is a sad day.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was hurt in the first inning of a 6-5 loss to Anaheim
while throwing to second base on Kevin Stocker's steal attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn had swung and missed and was trying to duck out of the
way, but his bat stayed up and Rodriguez caught it flush with his
follow-through.
</P>
<P>
   ''As soon as it happened, my thumb went numb,'' Rodriguez said.
''There was swelling and I knew it was broken and I'd be out for
the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say the bone should be healed within 10 weeks and
Rodriguez can resume athletic activity in 2-4 months. Unless
something goes wrong, Rodriguez should make a full recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a strong mind,'' Rodriguez said. ''I'll be ready for
spring training.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers will play the next 65 games without Rodriguez,
something that hasn't happened since early in 1991 when he was a
pudgy 19-year-old at Double-A Tulsa. He was called up June 20 that
year and started 81 of Texas' final 102 games.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Rodriguez has blossomed into the best all-around
catcher of his generation and one of the all-time bests. The
Rangers also have improved, going from also-rans to division champs
three of the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez came up with a laser arm and a weak bat. He steadily
improved at the plate while winning eight straight Gold Glove
awards for his performance behind it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, he hit .332 with 35 homers, 25 steals and 113 RBIs, all
career-bests; his 116 runs tied his personal high. In winning the
MVP, he sealed his place in baseball history alongside Johnny
Bench, Yogi Berra and Bill Dickey.
</P>
<P>
   By getting the most votes for this year's All-Star game,
Rodriguez also established himself as one of baseball's most
popular players. And, he was on pace to have even better statistics
than his MVP season.
</P>
<P>
   Batting cleanup, Rodriguez was leading the team in hitting at
.347 with 27 homers and 83 RBIs, all among the top seven in the AL.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was having a strong season, so it's disappointing for it to
end two months before it was supposed to,'' Rodriguez said. ''I'll
just go out and put up better numbers next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's absence leaves Rafael Palmeiro as the biggest threat
in Texas' lineup, even though the first baseman is having a down
year. He's likely to see fewer good pitches without Rodriguez
hitting behind him.
</P>
<P>
   In the field, Bill Haselman will take over as the starter. B.J.
Wazgis, who has never played in the majors, was called up from
Triple-A Oklahoma to be the backup.
</P>
<P>
   If there's any bright spot to losing Rodriguez, it's that he
won't continue beating up his body during a hot summer with little
chance of making the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez had played 91 of 97 games this season and between 144
and 153 the last four years. Those are all high workloads for a
catcher, even for someone 28 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The injury also could make Rodriguez think more seriously about
moving to another position, such as second base.
</P>
<P>
   ''We always take Pudge for granted that he's always going to be
out there,'' Melvin said. ''But you have to realize it can happen
to anybody. You wonder which player your team can least afford to
lose. He falls into that category.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Targets Colombian Cocaine Crop  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW SELSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   PUERTO ASIS, Colombia (AP) -- It was an all too common sight in a
region where leftist rebels and right-wing paramilitary groups
battle for control of the world's biggest cocaine-producing region:
a man's body with a handwritten sign on his back saying he was
killed for collaborating with the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Now, U.S.-trained and equipped troops are entering the lethal
environment as part of a major anti-narcotics offensive that has
alarmed not only coca farmers but local officials and human rights
advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian army troops, trained by Green Berets and other U.S.
Special Forces, will be flown into the jungles of Putumayo province
aboard U.S.-donated Blackhawk and Huey helicopters. Their mission:
to seize coca plantations so that low-flying planes can spray them
with herbicide without being shot down. Thousands are expected to
be forced from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The government contends beefing up the military and undercutting
rebel drug proceeds will strengthen peace negotiations with the
insurgents. But that logic is lost on many Putumayo officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a plan for peace. It is a plan for war,'' snapped
Manuel Alzate, mayor of Puerto Asis, a town in the heart of the
coca-growing region. He and other Putumayo officials are trying to
persuade the national government to call off the offensive that
forms part of a $1.3 billion U.S. aid package.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no sign the government is wavering. Meanwhile,
rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, are
preparing a counter-punch.
</P>
<P>
   The FARC -- which observers say earns millions of dollars per
week from a drug protection racket -- is reportedly already giving
weapons training to some coca farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Also involved in the drug trade is a national paramilitary
group, the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, with strong ties
to the Colombian military and many former government soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The paramilitary force has cut into rebel profits by buying coca
paste -- the coca derivative used to make cocaine -- from farmers at
better prices than the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups are notorious human rights violators.
</P>
<P>
   The paramilitary commander for Putumayo, who insisted on being
identified by his nom de guerre, Falcon, casually acknowledges that
his forces commit abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Clad in jeans and a black Armani Exchange T-shirt, Falcon said
such tactics make the paramilitary group a vital component to
government security forces.
</P>
<P>
   ''No area of Colombia has been taken by the government without
our presence. We can operate effectively because we don't have the
judicial restraints that are imposed on government forces,'' Falcon
said in an interview last week at his heavily guarded compound near
Puerto Asis.
</P>
<P>
   Barely an hour after the interview, Associated Press journalists
came across a body on a muddy road outside town.
</P>
<P>
   ''They killed me for being a collaborator with the FARC (and)
for being an informant,'' said a sign placed on the man. Passers-by
stared at the corpse, then quickly moved on.
</P>
<P>
   FARC has also murdered its opponents, and allegedly was behind
the 1998 assassination of a Roman Catholic priest in Putumayo.
</P>
<P>
   Few people dare discuss the killings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here it's the law of silence,'' said a woman vendor at a
Puerto Asis street stall. ''Talking can cost you your life.''
</P>
<P>
   During daytime, the town bustles. Shops offer expensive tools
and other wares not normally available in rural areas; motor
scooters, the town's favorite mode of transportation, crisscross
the streets.
</P>
<P>
   After dusk, Puerto Asis becomes a ghost town.
</P>
<P>
   On the few roads carved through the jungle, rebels or
paramilitary squads suddenly erect roadblocks. Motorists believed
to be partial to the wrong side are sometimes taken away and never
heard from again.
</P>
<P>
   It is into this lawless land that the United States is making
its stand against the drug trade and attempting to shore up an
embattled democracy, located only a three-hour flight from Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not East Timor, Kosovo or Sierra Leone,'' Deputy
Assistant Secretary of State William Brownfield said in an
interview in Washington. ''Colombia is one of the larger countries
in Latin America. One would have to be an idiot to argue that
Colombia does not have fundamental importance to us.''
</P>
<P>
   About 100 anti-narcotics troops, members of a battalion trained
by U.S. Special Forces, have begun reconnaissance operations in
Putumayo. Under the bill signed by President Clinton, the United
States will train two more battalions and provide 60 combat
helicopters. Full-scale operations are expected within months from
the Tres Esquinas army base, perched on Putumayo's northern border.
</P>
<P>
   Falcon said his forces would not attempt to defend the coca
fields. But some analysts believe the Colombian military may use
their paramilitary allies during the offensive, thus possibly
indirectly linking the U.S. aid to human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is concern whether the paramilitaries will be used as
some sort of force, using dirty-war tactics, to clear the
guerrillas out of the area. This is not in the U.S. policy, but
it's hard to tell what's going to happen,'' said Adam Isacson, an
analyst for the Washington-based Center for International Policy.
</P>
<P>
   For the government troops, finding the coca plantations in
Putumayo -- which produces an estimated 600 tons of cocaine per year
-- should be easy. Fields planted with the shiny green shrubs extend
to the outskirts of some towns -- a green ocean that pumps millions
of dollars into an otherwise moribund local economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coca is a way of survival for us,'' said Juliberto Rodriguez,
57, clearing jungle growth to grow more coca on his farm, an hour's
ride by motorized canoe upriver from Puerto Asis.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look, there are not even any roads here,'' he said, pointing
with his machete. ''If I had a good alternative, I wouldn't bother
with coca.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the U.S.-backed offensive in Putumayo and neighboring
provinces wipes out existing coca crops, the hardy bushes -- which
can be harvested four times a year -- are likely to pop up
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the helicopters and the troops come, we will have to
leave,'' said grower Victoriano Tocayo. ''But we don't have a place
to go, so what we'll do is head for a more remote area and start
growing coca all over again.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Move Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose modestly higher Tuesday as investors
reacted to strong second-quarter earnings reports but questioned
whether the economy is really slowing.
</P>
<P>
   In late afternoon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 36.87 at 10,719.92.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also moved slightly higher. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 8.31 at 1,472.60, and the Nasdaq
composite index was up 40.91 at 4,022.48.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, up 50 cents to $33.813, and Texas Instruments, up $4.25 to
$68.75 beat Wall Street earnings forecasts, giving a boost to the
technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   Also helping the market, the Conference Board said Tuesday its
Consumer Confidence Index rose, suggesting consumers are optimistic
that the U.S. economy is headed in the right direction. Most
analysts were expecting a decline in the confidence index.
</P>
<P>
   But news from the National Association of Realtors that existing
home sales rose 2.8 percent in June darkened investors' mood.
Economists had expected sales to drop. Higher housing sales could
signal that the U.S. economy is still surging, which could prompt
Federal Reserve policymakers to raise interest rates again when
they meet next month.
</P>
<P>
   Those mixed signals on the economy as well as mixed corporate
earnings have left stocks trading in a narrow range. Also, leading
to cautious trading, investors are still unsure whether the Fed is
indeed done raising interest rates for the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony before a House committee
Tuesday offered investors little new information about which way
the central bank is leaning on interest rates. He said economic
reports due later this month will help determine whether the Fed
will further tighten credit.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Greenspan told a Senate panel that inflation appeared
to be under control and he hinted the Fed might leave interest
rates alone for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is still looking for some guidance and not getting
it in terms of reaction to earnings,'' said Barry Hyman, chief
market strategist for Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. ''We are still
looking for some definitive answers on whether the economy is
indeed slowing.''
</P>
<P>
   He said stocks rose well in the weeks before earnings season,
and investors are selling on the largely positive profit reports.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceutical stocks drew investors' attention. Pfizer, down $4
to $43.50, beat earnings projections by a penny after the market
closed Monday, but flat Viagra sales raised some concern among
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Schering-Plough, maker of allergy pill Claritin, and Pharmacia,
maker of arthritis drug Celebrex, both met forecasts Tuesday.
Shares of Schering fell $2.125 cents to $43 and Pharmacia rose $3
to $56.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 768.34 million
shares, up from Monday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 1.72 at 512.53.

<HEADLINE> Israelis, Palestinians Frustrated  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN NOVECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Some feared the future might bring more
violence, others simply sighed and said peace would have to come
later. But few Israelis or Palestinians seemed surprised that the
painful issues that divide them proved insurmountable once again.
</P>
<P>
   Officials on both sides began the inevitable process of spin
after the failure of the Camp David peace summit between Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. But
ordinary people whose futures were at stake sounded like they'd
heard it all before.
</P>
<P>
   ''I won a bet, I knew there would be no peace,'' said Tzvi
Lewis, a policeman, just minutes after President Clinton's
announcement that the summit had ended with no agreement. ''We were
prepared to give Arafat certain portions of the country. But it's
known if you give him a finger he will ask for the whole arm.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm afraid there's going to be a big bang,'' said Lewis, 58.
''They might start attacking buses again, attacks on the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Omer Gavri, a 23-year-old art student, was less fearful for the
future, but sad for the present.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is very sad,'' he said. ''We're tired of war and we want
peace. I can understand both sides.'' But he added: ''We must not
be so pessimistic or so dramatic. Eventually peace will come, if
not this year, then next. We have no place else to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians in the walled Old City, which sits at the very
heart of the Mideast conflict with its potent symbols and holy
shrines, predicted trouble ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ''God knows what will happen, it's a really bad situation now,''
said Wassim Razzouk, 27, a restaurant manager. ''The worst thing
that can happen now is the intefadeh (Palestinian uprising) could
come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Souvenir shop owner Rani Yagmoor, 31, agreed. ''I think there's
going to be a war, and this time it's for real,'' he said. ''Now
there are guns, and not just kids with stones. Both sides will
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   But both men agreed that no deal was better than a bad one --
meaning a deal that would deprive Palestinians of what they
consider their rights: east Jerusalem as sovereign capital of their
independent state, the right of millions of refugees to return to
homes in Israel, and full return of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can't keep everything and not give us anything,'' said
Yagmoor. ''Give us our land and our capital.''
</P>
<P>
   On the official level, both sides expressed regret but were
quick to blame the other for inflexibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Palestinians did not bend in their positions,'' said Gadi
Baltiansky, a spokesman for Barak. ''They maintained their extreme,
unreasonable positions on our most basic, national issues,'' he
said, including Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Hanan Ashrawi, a frequent Palestinian spokeswoman, accused the
Israelis of ''attempting to browbeat the Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only was the Israeli position ''extremely hardline,'' she
said, but ''there was also an American attempt to bring the
Palestinians to comply with an Israeli perspective'' -- a
perspective, she said, that violated international law.
</P>
<P>
   Barak confidant Ofer Pines, leader of his Knesset coalition,
said the summit's failure was ''still hard for me to absorb. I
don't know what kind of reality we are returning to as a result of
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Barak's right-wing opponents expressed
pleasure that he'd come home with no deal. They repeated their
oft-stated charge that he'd gone to Camp David without a mandate
from the people.
</P>
<P>
   A deal ''would have been a disaster for the country,'' said
Shaul Yahalom of the National Religious Party, one of three parties
that deserted Barak's coalition on the eve of the summit, leaving
him without a majority in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would have divided Jerusalem, would have let in refugees,
would have dismantled dozens of settlements,'' Yahalom said. ''We
welcome what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Natan Sharansky, the former Soviet dissident whose party also
deserted Barak in protest, called on the prime minister to form a
national unity government with the opposition Likud party.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now is the time for a dialogue,'' he said. But leftist
legislator Zehava Gal On said talk of such unity was ''a smoke
screen, for those who do not want peace. A national unity
government is a government of national paralysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of the militant Islamic
group Hamas, issued a harsh warning to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''This failure is another indication that the only choice we
have is resistance,'' he said. ''Only by force are we able to
retain our rights. We are ready to become martyrs, and we say one
short sentence: They will pay a high price if they think to attack
us and reoccupy the land.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were glimmers of optimism. In the streets of
Jerusalem, waiting for a bus, Sonia Rozen-Weiner, who wouldn't give
her age other than to say she was a great-grandmother, called the
current situation ''very bad.'' But she added:
</P>
<P>
   ''Always we have to think that tomorrow is another day. We're a
young country and we will go on hoping for peace.''

<HEADLINE> German Leader Offers Condolences  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder offered his
deepest condolences Tuesday for relatives of the 113 people killed
in the Concorde crash near Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ''Germany and France are united in their horror over the
accident, in mourning for the victims and in sympathy for their
families,'' Schroeder said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor said his transport minister, Rheinhard Klimmt,
was en route to the crash scene. The German Foreign Ministry set up
crisis centers in Berlin and at the German Embassy in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers -- 97 Germans, two Danes and an American -- were
flying by Concorde to New York City, where they were joining the
luxury cruise ship MS Deutschland, flagship of the Peter Dielmann
Shipping Company, a tour operator based in the northern German town
of Neustadt in Holstein.
</P>
<P>
   The Air France supersonic jet crashed Tuesday in Gonesse,
outside Paris. All 100 passengers and nine crew onboard were killed
and four others died on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Dielmann, owner of the shipping company, told ZDF
television that 99 of the 510 passengers booked on the MS
Deutschland were to arrive on the Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   The Frankfurt international airport said a number of passengers
took flights from Frankfurt to Paris on Tuesday to join the
Concorde flight. The airport spokesman had no further information
on the passengers' points of origin.
</P>
<P>
   The shipping company set up its own hot line for relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The MS Deutschland, built by a Kiel shipyard in 1998 in the
style of the Golden '20s, holds up to 520 passengers. The five-star
luxury ship was to leave Wednesday from New York on a 16-day cruise
through the Caribbean and the Panama Canal to Manta, Ecuador, with
a return flight to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the ship is to sail to Tahiti, then on to Sydney,
Australia, for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   After short cruises in the Baltic, North and Mediterranean seas,
the MS Deutschland, Dielmann's flagship, began its first
round-the-world excursion in November 1998.

<HEADLINE> Peru's Fujimori Faces Protests  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori prepares to assume
a third five-year term this week, facing what could be the largest
mass protest in modern Peruvian history against his authoritarian
regime.
</P>
<P>
   Alejandro Toledo, the opposition candidate who withdrew from the
May presidential runoff accusing Fujimori of planning to rig the
results, has vowed to put hundreds of thousands of protesters into
the streets of Lima to disrupt Fujimori's inauguration Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said Tuesday that the aim is to show the world that there
is widespread opposition in Peru to Fujimori's ''illegitimate
government.''
</P>
<P>
   If the protests -- due to begin Wednesday and peak Friday -- turn
violent, ''it is the exclusive responsibility of Fujimori's
government,'' Toledo told foreign correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of police troopers will be in place to prevent
demonstrators from reaching the National Palace and Congress, where
the inauguration will take place.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori is also taking office amid growing international
isolation. Only two presidents will attend the swearing-in ceremony
in Congress -- Gustavo Noboa of Ecuador and Hugo Banzer of Bolivia,
both with questionable democratic credentials. Banzer is a former
military dictator and Noboa, elected vice president, came to power
in January after a military-backed coup ousted President Jamil
Mahuad. Fourteen Latin American presidents turned down invitations
to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be a victory for us if we force him to be sworn in at
the Pentaganito,'' Toledo said, referring to the pentagon-shaped
building that is army headquarters. It is located in a Lima suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, a president takes the oath of office before Congress
in downtown Lima, driving three blocks from the National Palace to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The government has announced plans to cordon off 35 square
blocks in the center to prevent protesters from clogging the
downtown area and blocking Fujimori from reaching Congress.
Businesses in the area have been ordered to shut their doors
beginning Wednesday for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   To guard the barricades, the Interior Ministry is deploying
40,000 helmeted police troopers armed with tear gas and assault
rifles, including 8,000 brought from the provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators are preparing for clashes with homemade gas masks.
Masks made from recycled plastic bottles are selling for 30 cents
each, and have become a hot item.
</P>
<P>
   Army troops will be inside the National Palace to protect it if
demonstrators break past police lines, according to intelligence
sources.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo has called his protest the ''March of the Four Suyos,'' a
reference to the four cardinal points of the ancient Inca empire.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said Tuesday that he expected as many as 250,000 people
to participate in the street marches in Lima. He said large
protests also will take place in major cities around Peru.
</P>
<P>
   According to news reports, police have been trying to stop
protesters from reaching Lima by pulling over trucks and buses and
questioning the legitimacy of vehicle ownership papers and drivers'
licenses.
</P>
<P>
   But Toledo said Monday that 30,000 had already arrived in Lima,
where many were sleeping in municipal parks and being fed in soup
kitchens set up by organizations opposed to Fujimori's continued
stay in power.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Veterans Benefits Measure  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Department of Veterans Affairs must
improve its efforts to help veterans file benefits' claims under a
bill passed in the House on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which passed 414-0, is aimed at reversing a recent
court decision that overturned the agency's responsibility to
assist veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Under that July 1999 U.S. Court of Appeals ruling, the VA is
prohibited from assisting veterans with claims for benefits until
after the veterans establish that their claims are
''well-grounded.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, the agency considered it had a ''duty'' to help
veterans establish well-grounded claims. The measure passed by the
House simply puts what had been considered a long-standing
responsibility of the agency into law.
</P>
<P>
   Such assistance from the agency would things such as helping
veterans request information from military records or informing the
veteran of the information and evidence needed to fully develop the
claim.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an effort to make the VA more user friendly, more
constituent friendly,'' said Rep. Jack Quinn, R-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also allows all veterans whose claims were denied since
the court decision to request that the VA review their cases.
</P>
<P>
   In another measure, the House passed by voice a bill that
enhances veterans benefits, including the authorization of cost of
living increases on disability compensation for veterans.

<HEADLINE> Charges Dismissed For Au Pair Folks  </HEADLINE>
By MARA D. BELLA
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The parents of former au pair Louise Woodward were
cleared Tuesday of defrauding an appeal fund set up in their
daughter's name, and they immediately pleaded for ''this whole
unhappy and upsetting episode'' to be put behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Judge John Roberts ordered jurors to find Gary and Susan
Woodward innocent of defrauding the Louise Woodward and Family
Trust of more than $13,500, saying the prosecution failed to prove
some of the money in the fund was not donated solely for the
parents' use.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the very beginning we denied any wrongdoing,'' the
Woodwards said in a statement read outside Chester Crown Court by
one of their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope that today's acquittal will now draw a line under this
whole unhappy and upsetting episode and that the press and other
news media will now leave us and our family alone,'' the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, both 44 and now estranged, refused to answer
reporters' questions.
</P>
<P>
   Louise Woodward, now 22 and a London law student, was convicted
in Massachusetts in 1997 of murdering 8-month-old Matthew Eappen, a
baby in her care. A judge later downgraded the conviction to
manslaughter and she was freed after serving 279 days in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The au pair's trial -- shown live on television -- made headlines
around the world, and prompted the public to donate some $325,000
to her appeal fund, started at a local pub in Chester, the
northwest England town where the Woodwards lived.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, after Louise Woodward returned to Britain, Cheshire
Police Superintendent Phil Thompson said he received a complaint
from an unidentified member of the public about how the fund money
was being spent.
</P>
<P>
   The au pair's parents had been accused of falsely claiming
reimbursement for the cost of accommodation at the home of their
daughter's Boston lawyer, Elaine Whitfield Sharp, before and during
the murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   While the judge agreed that prosecutors had presented evidence
that could lead jurors to conclude the Woodwards submitted the
invoice ''dishonestly,'' he said prosecutors failed to establish
fraud by proving some of the money used to reimburse the family
wasn't intended for their personal use anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield Sharp criticized the ruling, saying the Woodwards had
walked free on a technicality. She has denied that she ever charged
the family $2,200 a month for rent, as claimed on the submitted
invoice.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Woodwards may not, legally, be criminals,'' Whitfield
Sharp said in a statement from Boston. ''But they have proven
beyond a shadow of a doubt to be liars and swindlers.''
</P>
<P>
   The former au pair had accompanied her parents to the trial's
opening day last week, and was listed as a possible defense witness
at the trial, originally expected to last three weeks. She was not
in court on Tuesday, however.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents have maintained her conviction was ''a travesty''
and repeated Tuesday that they continue to hope ''that one day
justice will be done in her case.''

<HEADLINE> Burnett Back in Marlins' Rotation  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Now that A.J. Burnett is back in the Florida
Marlins' rotation, they're confident he'll stay there for years.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett missed more than half the season with a thumb injury,
then came off the disabled list Thursday and beat the Atlanta
Braves 6-1, allowing just three hits in seven innings. He'll face
them again Wednesday in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ''For him to do what he did in his first major-league start of
the year is phenomenal,'' Marlins manager John Boles said. ''When
we get the five-man rotation the way we envision it, he's going to
be in it. He's going to be a star.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnett, a hard-throwing right-hander, broke into the rotation
late last season and went 4-2 with a 3.48 ERA. The Marlins
anticipated that 2000 would be his season to blossom, but he
ruptured a ligament in his right thumb during fielding drills in
spring training and required surgery March 21.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I first hurt it, they told me I'd be out until August or
the whole year,'' said Burnett, 23. ''It was a big, big, big
letdown. I worked my butt off to be back sooner than that and prove
everybody wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   With his pitching arm idled by the injury, Burnett worked out
daily to strengthen his legs. He gained about 10 pounds, mostly
below the waist, and now carries 215 pounds on a 6-foot-5 frame.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has a little extra giddyap to his fastball,'' Boles said.
''He's a lot stronger in the legs, and he has much better balance
and body control on the mound. He made some good use of the time
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the thumb is fine, Burnett hopes to give the surprising
Marlins a boost down the stretch. Last year, when he was recalled
in August from Double-A Portland, the Marlins were trying to avoid
100 losses. Now they're around .500 and trying to stay in the
National League wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the things that motivates me the most is how good these
guys are playing,'' he said. ''I wanted to get back and pitch for
them as soon as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   In a locker room that lacks the personalities of high-payroll
teams, Burnett stands out. The Arkansas native is a free spirit who
wears nipple rings and listens to doom rocker Marilyn Manson. He
may be a bit brash for a pitcher with just five career victories,
but no one objects because he throws a nose-diving spike curve and
a fastball that can exceed 95 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got ice water in his veins,'' Boles said. ''He isn't
rattled by anything. It's great to have that kind of confidence. It
helps to have ability, too.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Racial Disparity on Hepatitis  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Studies have shown that many hepatitis C patients
recover from the liver-threatening disease, but new research
suggests black people are much less likely to become free of the
virus than whites.
</P>
<P>
   A study by Johns Hopkins School of Medicine showed that white
people are about five times more likely to become virus-free than
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which appears in Wednesday's Journal of the American
Medical Association, was not designed to explain the disparity,
although lead researcher Dr. David L. Thomas speculated that
genetics might be a possible cause.
</P>
<P>
   About 4 million people nationwide are infected with hepatitis C,
a virus that attacks the liver and is spread through contact with
an infected person's blood. It kills as many as 10,000 Americans
each year, mostly by causing cirrhosis or liver cancer. However, it
may remain dormant for decades and some people eventually lose all
trace of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   The research on 1,667 people who acquired the virus through
injected drug use supports previous findings showing most patients
don't get life-threatening liver damage.
</P>
<P>
   Government estimates have suggested that only 15 percent of
hepatitis C patients may develop cirrhosis and 5 percent may die of
cirrhosis or cancer. The new study showed lower death and disease
rates, which the authors said may have resulted in part from the
relatively young age and good health of their subjects.

<HEADLINE> SEC Proposes Rules To Aid Investors  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Investors often don't get the best price for
their buy or sell orders and most don't know what happens to their
orders after they make them. Federal securities regulators took a
step Tuesday they said could help change that.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission voted, 4-0, to propose
rules that would require brokers to disclose how often they route
their customers' stock orders to other brokers for execution. The
information would be published every quarter on free Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, specialists on stock exchanges and the new
electronic communications networks that trade stocks, known as
ECNs, would have to issue monthly data on speed of execution and
other measures for each stock traded.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 85 percent of market orders executed on the
all-electronic Nasdaq Stock Market are routed to brokers that are
not quoting the best price, SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt noted in
remarks before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Market orders are executed without regard to price. In volatile
markets, execution may be at a price that is very different from
the current quoted price of the stock. Limit orders, by contrast,
are executed only at a price specified by the investor or better.
Roughly 40 percent of orders on the Nasdaq are market orders.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can it be that most investors today simply do not know
what happens to their orders after they click 'Submit?''' Levitt
asked. He said ''it doesn't make sense'' given the fact that
missing the best price by the minimum increment available -- 1/16 --
on a 1,000-share order can cost an investor $62.50.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt said the SEC proposals would allow investors to
comparison-shop, as the financial news media published reports
showing the performance of various brokerage firms and other market
players.
</P>
<P>
   They would be ''incredibly powerful statistics,'' Annette
Nazareth, director of the SEC's market regulation division, told
reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   James Spellman, a spokesman for the Securities Industry
Association, said the group welcomed the SEC's move but had some
concerns about the proposed disclosure requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ''We support having the best flow of information to investors
and increasing market transparency,'' he said. However, he added,
the Wall Street group is concerned that the complex information on
order execution that would have to be disclosed may not be ''both
meaningful and understandable to investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Change has been sweeping the securities markets, as millions of
new investors and increasing competition from the ECNs have put
pressure on the nation's two biggest exchanges, the Nasdaq and the
New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt has expressed concern that the sprouting of competing
markets that don't share price information with each other could
prevent investors from getting the best price on their orders.
</P>
<P>
   He has warned that the nation's stock markets will lose their
competitive edge to foreign markets if investors lose confidence in
the ability to get their trades completed at the best prices,
commonly known as best execution.
</P>
<P>
   For stock options trading, the SEC proposed a rule that would
require brokers to tell customers when their orders were executed
at a price inferior to the best quote in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Investors would not be assured the right to request routing of
their orders to a specific market or broker, however. Some active
investors negotiate such arrangements with their brokers.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on the options rule was 3-0; Commissioner Laura Unger
recused herself to avoid a potential conflict of interest involving
her husband's work.
</P>
<P>
   All the proposed rules were put out for 45 days of public
comment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the SEC approved an electronic linkage plan
proposed by three options exchanges: the American Stock Exchange,
which is part of Nasdaq, the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the
International Securities Exchange. The agency did not order the
exchanges to participate in it, however.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC announced that it was establishing a federal advisory
committee to help it consider the public availability of market
information on stocks and options. The committee will be headed by
Joel Seligman, dean of the Washington University Law School, in St.
Louis who is an expert on securities regulation.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Company Must Ax 'Mc' Prefix  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) -- A start-up Swiss Internet health
company had to take the ''Mc'' out of its name after the McDonald's
corporation opposed its use.
</P>
<P>
   GetWellness said it changed its name from McWellness because the
fast-food chain refused to accept the name's registration in the
United States after it had already been approved in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-year-old company said it was unable to afford a protracted
legal battle after the hamburger giant rejected arguments that use
of McWellness would have little or no impact on its restaurant
operation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in health and they are in burgers. There's really very
little overlap,'' said company co-founder Barbara Staehelin, a
Swiss-American.
</P>
<P>
   The company provides an online health advice service for
executives who are on the move internationally and lack the time to
consult a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Staehelin estimates it has cost $1.1 million to change the
corporate name and try to gain the same level of recognition as the
old name.
</P>
<P>
   Staehelin said the company, which employs 45 people, had not
expected any trouble from McDonald's in the United States because
it had not opposed the registration in Switzerland and other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''I find it a pity that they are really showing us the cold
shoulder. We aren't harming them in any way. We are just
entrepreneurs trying to do the best we can and they are being
arrogant,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's spokesman Walt Riker said the company acted to
protect its interests.
</P>
<P>
   ''The so-called 'Mc' prefix is well established around the world
to be McDonald's,'' he said. ''When you do business in 119
countries, as we do, you have to be vigilant about protecting your
trademarks and your hard-earned properties. We take it seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Riker said the company was involved in many areas beyond
restaurants and had trade names including McJobs and McRecycle.
</P>
<P>
   The Ronald McDonald Foundation, a charity, ''has many links to
health programs. We are just trying to protect what we think is
legitimate,'' he said.

65 for Tuesday's lowest score, clinching the Rest of the World
team's victory over the Nordic team in the SAS Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   Franco, who won twice on the PGA Tour last year, beat Sweden's
Robert Karlsson by three shots in the next-to-last match of the day
on Oslo Golfklubb's hilly course, with the famed Nordic ski center
Holmenkollen as backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Garcia birdied the last hole after a spectacular approach
shot within two feet of the pin, earning the young Spaniard a tie
(68-68) with Norwegian Per Haugsrud in the last match that made the
final score 7&AMP;frac12;-4&AMP;frac12;.
</P>
<P>
   Haugsrud has been struggling on the European PGA Tour in recent
years, but nobody in the SAS field knows the Oslo course better. He
is still undefeated in the SAS event, defeating Mark O'Meara in
1998 when the American won both the (U.S.) Masters and the British
Open, and seven-time European PGA Tour money-winner Colin
Montgomerie in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides were tied 3-3 after the opening matches played
simultaneously Monday in the three other Nordic capitals of
Stockholm, Sweden; Copenhagen, Denmark; and Helsinki, Finland.
</P>
<P>
   Franco lost by seven shots in Helsinki to another Swede, Patrik
Sjoland, and was eager to make up for that performance on a course
he had never played before in Norway.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had seven birdies, no bogeys, and almost beat the course
record,'' Franco said. ''It was good for the gallery, the
tournament, the sponsors, good for everybody and good for me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second victory for the Rest of the World team since
the inaugural event in 1998. Last year, Tiger Woods' last-hole
eagle in the last match in Copenhagen gave the World team a tie.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' close friend, O'Meara, captained the World team for the
third straight time and the American tied (70-70) Thomas Bjorn of
Denmark, a runner-up Sunday at the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both of us could have made quite a few more under par, but
that's the way golf is,'' said O'Meara, who lost to Karlsson by
five shots Monday in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   Other winners for the Rest of the World team were last year's
British Open Champion Paul Lawrie of Scotland, who beat Anssi
Kankkonen of Finland (67-71), and former two-time (U.S.) Masters
champion Bernhard Langer of Germany, who downed Jesper Parnevik of
Sweden (67-69).
</P>
<P>
   Sjoland halved the other match, 68-68, with Retief Goosen of
South Africa.

<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Rashard Lewis has told the Seattle SuperSonics he
plans to return to the team.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-10 forward became a restricted free agent July 1, and
general manager Wally Walker has said signing Lewis is a top
priority.

<HEADLINE> Concorde Still Epitomizes Luxury  </HEADLINE>
By JILL LAWLESS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Passengers describe taking off on the Concorde as
''a kick in the back'' and complain about the stingy legroom. But
riding the supersonic jet -- a haunt of celebrities, royalty,
politicians and business tycoons -- also has been called an exercise
in nonstop pampering.
</P>
<P>
   That's why people pay $10,000 round-trip for the abbreviated
experience.
</P>
<P>
   The sleek, needle-nosed aircraft cross the Atlantic at an
altitude of 60,000 feet and at 1,350 mph, completing the journey
from London to New York in about 3 hours, 50 minutes -- half the
time of regular jets.
</P>
<P>
   ''The wonderful thing about Concorde is that you can get there
before you can imagine getting anywhere,'' said Seymour Druion, a
London-based businessman who flies it frequently. ''You can leave
London at 10 and be in New York at 9.''
</P>
<P>
   The quick flight time leaves little room to settle in and watch
a movie -- which is fortunate, because Concorde's stringent weight
restrictions leave no room for video equipment.
</P>
<P>
   There are no headphones, either, and the planes -- whose average
age is more than 23 years -- are so old they do not have telephones,
to the consternation of some business travelers.
</P>
<P>
   But there are compensations, including an unending stream of
gourmet food and drink, served on crystal, china and linen.
</P>
<P>
   Food critic Egon Ronay described the service on the British
Airways Concorde as ''oozing luxury and refinement'' -- and,
apparently, alcohol. One passenger was told that hand luggage was
restricted onboard because extra space was needed for the wine
cellar.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to popular imagination, however, the supersonic
journeys are almost as cramped as regular flights -- partly the
result of weight restrictions that would not apply in a bigger
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not the normal first-class service. It's pretty cramped
inside, but it's viewed as a time saver. It's not viewed as
luxurious an option as a first-class seat on a 747,'' said Mike
Stoddart, a transport analyst for Charterhouse Securities, a
London-based brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Philippe Gossard, a Paris-based aviation analyst for the
investment bank Credit Lyonnais Securities, said many business
travelers prefer to fly from Europe to the United States on
Concorde to save time, then return to Europe in the evening in
first class on a 747 so they can stretch out on an in-flight bed.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the supersonic jet might be losing ground, British
Airways -- which operates seven Concordes -- announced earlier this
year that it would spend millions of dollars to make the plane's
interiors brighter, the toilets bigger and the corresponding
airport lounges more luxurious.
</P>
<P>
   For pilots, flying a Concorde, which first took wing in 1969,
can be the pinnacle of their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a beautiful airplane to fly, it's a responsive,
thoroughbred of an aircraft,'' John Hutchinson, who flew it for
British Airways for 15 years, told the British Broadcasting Corp.
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But some passengers find their first experience of supersonic
travel unsettling, describing takeoff as seemingly vertical and the
resulting G-forces more than a little daunting.
</P>
<P>
   ''You are just thrust back into your seats,'' said Colin Frith,
50, who received a two-hour Concorde flight around Britain as a
birthday present.
</P>
<P>
   Another passenger said landing felt like someone had slammed on
the brakes in midair.
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday's crash of an Air France Concorde outside Paris,
at least, passengers could feel they were paying for peace of mind.
Although the Concorde fleet is aging, it previously had one of the
aviation industry's best safety records. Its only major scare came
in 1979 when a bad landing blew out a plane's tires.
</P>
<P>
   After the crash, Air France agreed to temporarily ground its
five remaining Concordes, and British Airways grounded its two
remaining flights for Tuesday night.

<HEADLINE> Survivor, Millionaire Top Ratings  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- For millions of Americans, there are only two
choices on television this summer: ''Survivor'' and ''Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   The shrinking gang from Pulau Tiga drew 26.1 million people to
their sets last Wednesday, even though the secret of who was going
to be voted off the island got out a few hours before the show went
on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Three editions of ''Millionaire'' each drew more than 20 million
viewers. The only other show to come close, a rerun of ABC's ''The
Practice,'' had 14.3 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   CBS's ''Big Brother'' drew 11.3 million people last Thursday as
the first contestant was banished from the house. It's a far cry
from ''Survivor'' numbers, but enabled CBS to win a time slot it
normally loses.
</P>
<P>
   For the week, ABC had a prime-time average of 10 million viewers
(6.8 rating, 12 share), CBS had 8.8 million viewers (6.3, 12), NBC
slipped to 8.1 million viewers (5.8, 11) and Fox had 6.1 million
(4.2, 8). UPN had 3.2 million viewers (2.1, 4), the WB had 2.4
million (1.6, 3) and Pax TV had 1 million (0.8, 2).
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ''Nightly News'' won the evening news ratings race with 9
million viewers (6.9 rating, 16 share). ABC's ''World News
Tonight'' had 8.3 million viewers (6.4, 14), while the ''CBS
Evening News'' had 7.3 million viewers (5.6, 13).
</P>
<P>
   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
   For the week of July 17-23, the top 10 shows, their networks and
ratings were:
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor,'' CBS, 15.9; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
(Sunday), ABC, 14.1; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Tuesday),
ABC, 13.9; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Thursday), ABC, 13.8;
''The Practice,'' ABC, 9.5; ''60 Minutes,'' CBS, 9.1; ''20/20''
(Wednesday), ABC, 8.9; ''20/20 Downtown,'' ABC, 8.8; ''Dharma &AMP;
Greg,'' ABC, 8.2; ''Will &AMP; Grace'' (Tuesday, 10 p.m.), NBC, 8.2;
''Will &AMP; Grace'' (Tuesday, 9:30 p.m.), NBC, 8.2.

<HEADLINE> With BC-NY--France-Concorde Crash, Bjt  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN MATHEWS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Just hours after an Air France Concorde crash
killed 113 people outside Paris, sports superagent Leigh Steinberg
was ready to board one of the supersonic jets Tuesday for a flight
to London.
</P>
<P>
   ''My sense is that if the pilot's willing to fly, I am,'' said
Steinberg, whose clients include NFL stars Troy Aikman and Ricky
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that one plane crashed is tragic, and my heart goes
out to those who are affected,'' Steinberg said. ''But automobiles
crash every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg was among a group of 27 passengers who had planned to
take a British Airways Concorde in the wake of the fiery crash in
the town of Gonesse, France.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways, rather than leaving its passengers to make a
difficult decision, instead suspended its two remaining Concorde
flights Tuesday afternoon. Passengers were switched to non-Concorde
flights or given the option of taking a Concorde on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The one-way fare on the jet is $5,900.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they did the right thing in canceling,'' said JoAnne
de Guardiola, a Manhattan designer booked on the same flight as
Steinberg. ''I have great faith in British Airways. We've been
flying it for years.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, British Airways said it had found cracks in the wings
of some of its supersonic Concorde aircraft, but said there was no
danger to passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The airline released a statement Tuesday canceling the two
flights between New York and London - one in each direction.
</P>
<P>
   ''All our aircraft are subject to continuing and exhaustive
safety checks,'' the British Airways statement said. ''We have
complete confidence in our Concorde aircraft and our engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, under the circumstances, we have decided to suspend
today's flights.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ziff, another Concorde passenger whose JFK flight was
canceled, said he would have no qualms about taking the jet in the
future. It was the first crash ever involving a Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   ''After 25 years, they had one accident,'' Ziff said. ''Most
planes should have such safety records. I feel safer in the
Concorde than in the car on the ride from Heathrow Airport.''
</P>
<P>
   At Pier 88 on the Hudson River, the captain of the MS
Deutschland said many of the tourists from the Concorde had been
expected to arrive Tuesday on the 500-passenger craft for the next
leg of an international tour.
</P>
<P>
   The Deutschland was scheduled to leave Thursday for Norfolk,
Va., on a two-week cruise to Ecuador, said Capt. Hayo Janssen.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are deeply shocked about the incident with the Concorde in
Paris,'' Janssen said. ''Our deepest regrets are with the
relatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who visited with the ship's captain,
said the city was bringing in grief counselors and would offer
transportation back to Germany for anyone who wanted to end their
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Only two of the passengers booked on the cruise had any
connection to those killed in the crash, the mayor said. They were
apparently friends with some of the victims, but were not related.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to offer the sympathy of all New York City and
offer our support, our prayers and our condolences,'' Giuliani
said.
</P>
<P>
   The ship chaplain, the Rev. Walter Grunwald, said a memorial
service for the crew and passengers was planned before the
Deutschland headed south.

<HEADLINE> Peru's Fujimori Faces Mass Protest  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori prepares to assume
a third five-year term this week, facing what could be the largest
mass protest in modern Peruvian history against his authoritarian
regime.
</P>
<P>
   Alejandro Toledo, the opposition candidate who withdrew from the
May presidential runoff accusing Fujimori of planning to rig the
results, has vowed to put hundreds of thousands of protesters into
the streets of Lima to disrupt Fujimori's inauguration Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said Tuesday that the aim is to show the world that there
is widespread opposition in Peru to Fujimori's ''illegitimate
government.''
</P>
<P>
   If the protests -- due to begin Wednesday and peak Friday -- turn
violent, ''it is the exclusive responsibility of Fujimori's
government,'' Toledo told foreign correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of police troopers will be in place to prevent
demonstrators from reaching the National Palace and Congress, where
the inauguration will take place.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori is also taking office amid growing international
isolation. Only two presidents will attend the swearing-in ceremony
in Congress -- Gustavo Noboa of Ecuador and Hugo Banzer of Bolivia,
both with questionable democratic credentials. Banzer is a former
military dictator and Noboa, elected vice president, came to power
in January after a military-backed coup ousted President Jamil
Mahuad. Fourteen Latin American presidents turned down invitations
to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be a victory for us if we force him to be sworn in at
the Pentagonito,'' Toledo said, referring to the pentagon-shaped
building that is army headquarters. It is located in a Lima suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, a president takes the oath of office before Congress
in downtown Lima, driving three blocks from the National Palace to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The government has announced plans to cordon off 35 square
blocks in the center to prevent protesters from clogging the
downtown area and blocking Fujimori from reaching Congress.
Businesses in the area have been ordered to shut their doors
beginning Wednesday for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   To guard the barricades, the Interior Ministry is deploying
40,000 helmeted police troopers armed with tear gas and assault
rifles, including 8,000 brought from the provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators are preparing for clashes with homemade gas masks.
Masks made from recycled plastic bottles are selling for 30 cents
each, and have become a hot item.
</P>
<P>
   Army troops will be inside the National Palace to protect it if
demonstrators break past police lines, according to intelligence
sources.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo has called his protest the ''March of the Four Suyos,'' a
reference to the four cardinal points of the ancient Inca empire.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said Tuesday that he expected as many as 250,000 people
to participate in the street marches in Lima. He said large
protests also will take place in major cities around Peru.
</P>
<P>
   According to news reports, police have been trying to stop
protesters from reaching Lima by pulling over trucks and buses and
questioning the legitimacy of vehicle ownership papers and drivers'
licenses.
</P>
<P>
   But Toledo said Monday that 30,000 had already arrived in Lima,
where many were sleeping in municipal parks and being fed in soup
kitchens set up by organizations opposed to Fujimori's continued
stay in power.

<HEADLINE> Schumer: Clinton will follow my lead on Jewish issues  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Sen. Charles Schumer, captured on videotape at
a fund raiser, assured supporters that Hillary Rodham Clinton will
''look to me'' to see how to vote on Jewish issues.
</P>
<P>
   The remark came as Jews jittery over several recent flaps
involving the first lady and the Jewish community, quizzed Schumer
about Clinton's commitment to Israel. The New York Democrat's
candid remarks, recorded in Woodmere in late June, were broadcast
Monday night by WCBS in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that Hillary Rodham Clinton will vote whatever her
feelings are and I think that will be better than you think,''
Schumer told his Jewish supporters. ''But my guess is she will vote
exactly as I vote on Jewish issues. She will look to me to see how
to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Jews make up a crucial voting bloc in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, in shirt sleeves, chatted casually with supporters on
the tape, seemingly unaware that a camera was rolling.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign of Clinton's rival, Rep. Rick Lazio, seized on
Schumer's comments Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''While it is both reasonable and gracious for Senator Schumer
to offer this much-needed help to Hillary Clinton, New Yorkers
deserve a senator who knows how to vote on an issue of such real
importance to so many New Yorkers,'' Lazio's campaign manager Bill
Dal Col said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Schumer said the Lazio camp ''is trying to
distort my words.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no doubt in my mind that Hillary Clinton will be a
strong voice on the issues important to Jewish voters,'' Schumer
said.
</P>
<P>
   But on the videotape, he also had this to say: ''Is she going to
be the leading voice in the Senate? No. Is she going to have the
same feeling about it that I do - born Jewish? No. But she will be
good. I bet she will be better than Lazio.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer is a recognized leader in Jewish issues on Capitol Hill
and an ardent supporter of the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton camp did not immediately return a phone call seeking
comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's troubles in the Jewish community began when she voiced
support for a Palestinian state. The issue resurfaced when, soon
after wading into the Senate race in New York, she made a visit to
the West Bank where she embraced and kissed Suha Arafat after the
wife of the Palestinian leader accused Israelis of using poison gas
on Palestinian women and children.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Clinton has been on the defensive about an
allegation that she used an anti-Semitic slur 26 years ago. She has
vehemently denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
   The videotape was shot by a Zev Brenner, who hosts a television
show on Jewish issues as well as a separate radio show. He first
aired the tape Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Brenner, a self-described Democrat, called the tape ''a
non-issue''
</P>
<P>
   ''The senator was quite clear in what he was saying ... if you
vote for Hillary everything's going to be all right.''

<HEADLINE> Russian Agent Probes Aeroflot Case  </HEADLINE>
By JIM HEINTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- A top Russian investigator flew to Switzerland on
Tuesday to continue his probe into allegations that hundreds of
millions of dollars were stolen from the Russian airline Aeroflot.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Volkov told RTR television that he expected to examine a
huge amount of documents.
</P>
<P>
   The documents relate to a case opened in 1999 into allegations
that Russian tycoon Boris Berezovsky and two Aeroflot executives
had funneled $200 million in fees paid to Aeroflot by foreign
airlines to the Swiss-based companies Forus and Andava.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the Swiss supreme court has disclosed that Russian
prosecutors allege a total of $715 million was diverted, including
profits and other funds.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky is one of the most visible of Russia's self-described
''oligarchs,'' tycoons who claim to wield substantial political
influence. Berezovsky reportedly was a Kremlin insider during the
administration of President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   But he has run into tensions with Yeltsin's successor, Vladimir
Putin, who has said cracking down on corruption is a priority. Last
week, Berezovsky resigned his seat in the lower house of the
Russian parliament to protest Putin's drive to exert more central
control on Russia's regions.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers conducted an audit of
Forus' transactions with Aeroflot and submitted a report to the
Russian Prosecutor-General in February saying there was no evidence
to support allegations of misappropriation, the accounting company
said in a statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
   However, since submitting the report the accounting company has
held a series of meetings with Volkov, PricewaterhouseCoopers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''While Mr. Volkov accepts the factual accuracy of the
PricewaterhouseCoopers report, his investigation continues to
encompass certain transactions involving Forus as they may have
some relevance to his connected investigations involving other
entities and the possible conduct of (Aeroflot) management,'' the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The firm declined further comment and spokesmen for the
Prosecutor-General's office could not be reached for comment on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials dropped the case against Berezovsky without
explanation last November, drawing allegations that the billionaire
used his influence with then-President Boris Yeltsin's inner
circle.
</P>
<P>
   Volkov, who as a top investigator in the prosecutor-general's
office, was quoted later by Russian newspapers as saying he had to
drop the charges because Berezovsky had no official job at Aeroflot
and his links with it couldn't be proven.
</P>
<P>
   But Volkov said he was collecting evidence against Berezovsky
and planned to reopen the case against him.

<HEADLINE> Kobe Bryant Debuts As a Rapper  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kobe Bryant played to mixed reviews in his
debut as a rapper.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was nice seeing him,'' Bernice Sanchez of West Covina said
after Bryant performed at the House of Blues in Los Angeles on
Sunday night. ''But I think Kobe should stick to his day job.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal, who has also done some rapping, led
the Lakers to their first NBA championship in 12 years last month.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, who turns 22 next month, presented lyrics such as: ''My
skull is the holster, my brain is the gun,'' and ''If you live life
fast, you'll probably die slow.''

<HEADLINE> Peace Talks Collapse Over Jerusalem  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- The Middle East peace talks at Camp David
collapsed Tuesday over rival claims to East Jerusalem.
Disappointed, President Clinton said he tried several approaches
but could not come up with a solution.
</P>
<P>
   ''They couldn't get there; that's the truth,'' Clinton said at
the White House after two weeks of intensive negotiations with
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is agonizing for both of them,'' Clinton said at a
hastily arranged news conference. ''I think they both remain
committed to peace. I think they both will find a way to get there
if they don't let time run away from them.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's own time to arrange a historic settlement could be
running out. With less than six months left in office, his legacy
as a peacemaker rested on the summit talks at the presidential
retreat in Maryland's Catoctin mountains.
</P>
<P>
   He was skeptical of bringing Barak and Arafat back to Camp David
for another try, but said peace was the goal, not which American
president helped achieve it between two people destined to live
side by side and to share ''a common future.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli and Palestinian delegations said in a statement they
intended ''to continue their efforts to conclude an agreement on
all permanent status issues as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   They also said they understood the importance of avoiding
unilateral actions -- an implicit pledge by Arafat not to declare a
Palestinian state outside negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a gesture to Arafat, the statement said the only path to
peace was resolutions adopted by the U.N. Security Council after
Middle East wars in 1967 and 1973. These call for Israel to
relinquish territory won from the Arabs in exchange for secure
borders.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat several times has said he would declare statehood if no
agreement was reached by Sept. 13, a deadline set by him and Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Tayeb Abdel Rahim, a top Arafat aide, blamed Barak for the
failure, saying he entered the talks with his ''no's.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Israeli position was the cause of failure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton credited both sides with seeking a compromise on the
future of Jerusalem, but suggested Barak took bolder steps than
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Palestinians changed their position, they moved forward,''
Clinton said, lifting the veil of secrecy he had imposed on the
details of the negotiations. ''The Israelis moved more.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, Clinton said, ''Prime Minister Barak showed
particular courage, vision and an understanding of the historical
importance of this moment,'' and Arafat ''made it clear that he,
too, remains committed to the path of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdel Rahim said Arafat would tour Arab countries and urge them
to convene a summit of foreign ministers to work on a unified Arab
position.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to implement what has been decided at the PCC
(the Palestinian Central Council) to declare the sovereignty of the
Palestinian state on Palestinian land,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan Abdel Rahman, the PLO's representative in Washington,
said in an interview with APTN that he hoped peace talks would
continue because ''the alternatives to a peace agreement are very
ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak, at a news conference, warned: ''If there will be a
unilateral declaration, we will be forced to make unilateral acts
of our own.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official said at the State Department: ''We will
not support unilateral moves. Our focus will continue to be on
good-faith negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's spokesman, Gadi Baltiansky, told Israel radio that over
the summit's last two days, it had become clear the Palestinians
were maintaining ''extreme, unreasonable positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian sources said the breaking point was Israel's refusal
to recognize Palestinian sovereignty over Jerusalem's walled Old
City, offering only access to the Al Aqsa mosque, the third-holiest
site in Islam. Arafat was infuriated, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli sources portrayed Barak as far more generous, offering
at first municipal control of some Arab neighborhoods and then
proposing Palestinian sovereignty over them.
</P>
<P>
   Rahman told The Associated Press that Israel's offer of limited
sovereignty was unacceptable and a ''nonstarter.'' He said the
Palestinians insisted on sovereignty over the entire Old City.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse occurred overnight, as Clinton engaged in another
protracted session with Israeli and Palestinian negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   At 3 a.m. Tuesday, Arafat sent a letter to Clinton saying he saw
no point in continuing because the Israeli position on Jerusalem
could never lead to an agreement, Palestinian sources said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you ask me, 'Did they make enough progress to get this
done?' Yes,'' Clinton said. ''But they've got to go home and check,
they've got to feel around.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel that we have the elements here to keep this process
going. ... I think it can happen,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the breakdown was quick.
</P>
<P>
   ''This failure is another indication that the only choice we
have is resistance,'' said Hamas leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin. ''Only
by force are we able to retain our rights. ... We are ready to
become martyrs, and we say one short sentence: They will pay a high
price if they think to attack us and reoccupy the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak had vowed never to divide Jerusalem, which Israel reunited
in the 1967 Six-Day war by forcing Jordanian troops to surrender
the Old City.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he offered a series of concessions from the
outset, including transferring much of the West Bank to the
Palestinians, dismantling of most Jewish settlements and permitting
thousands of Palestinian refugees to live in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   That cost Barak the support of three political parties that had
been in his government.
</P>
<P>
   Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a prime time
news conference before the talks broke down that Barak must reject
any deal that would call for sharing sovereignty over Jerusalem
with the Palestinians. Netanyahu said he wanted to avert a
''ripping apart'' of Israeli society.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 15; Nasdaq Rises 48  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose modestly Tuesday as some strong
second-quarter earnings reports helped investors overcome their
latest inflation fears and look for strong performers from the
technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   At the close on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average
was up 14.85 at 10,699.97, according to preliminary calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also moved higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was up 10.18 at 1,474.47, and the Nasdaq composite
index was up 47.99 at 4,029.56.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, up 0.437 cents at $33.75, and Texas Instruments, up $2.938
at $67.438, beat Wall Street earnings forecasts, giving a boost to
other high-tech stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Those upbeat results helped offset reports of a still-robust
economy that made investors uneasy about inflation and interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Realtors said existing home sales
rose 2.8 percent in June. Economists had expected sales to drop.
Higher housing sales could signal that the U.S. economy is still
surging, which could prompt Federal Reserve policymakers to raise
interest rates again when they meet next month.
</P>
<P>
   And the Conference Board said Tuesday its Consumer Confidence
Index rose, suggesting consumers are optimistic about future
economic growth. Most analysts were expecting a decline in the
confidence index.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are still unsure whether the Fed is indeed done
raising interest rates for the next few months. Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan's testimony before a House committee Tuesday offered
little new information about which way the central bank is leaning
on interest rates. Greenspan said economic reports due later this
month-- including employment cost data and gross domestic product
figures due out later this week-- will help determine whether the
Fed will further tighten credit.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Greenspan told a Senate panel that inflation appeared
to be under control and he hinted the Fed might leave interest
rates alone for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is still looking for some guidance and not getting
it in terms of reaction to earnings,'' said Barry Hyman, chief
market strategist for Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. ''We are still
looking for some definitive answers on whether the economy is
indeed slowing.''
</P>
<P>
   He said stocks rose well in the weeks before earnings season,
and investors are selling on the largely positive profit reports.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceutical stocks drew investors' attention. Pfizer, down $4
to $43.50, beat earnings projections by a penny after the market
closed Monday, but flat Viagra sales raised some concern among
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Schering-Plough, maker of allergy pill Claritin, and Pharmacia,
maker of arthritis drug Celebrex, both met forecasts Tuesday.
Shares of Schering fell $1.953 cents to $43.313 and Pharmacia rose
$3.109 to $55.625.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 856.54 million
shares, up from Monday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 2.54 at 511.71.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.16 percent,
Germany's DAX index gained 0.10 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose
.15 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 0.59 percent.

<HEADLINE> Ivory Coast OKs New Constitution  </HEADLINE>
By GLENN McKENZIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- In a landslide vote, Ivory Coast
residents approved a new constitution billed as a first step to
return the West African nation to civilian rule, according to final
results Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the referendum voted on Sunday and Monday
worried that the new charter will legally enshrine growing
anti-foreigner sentiment and ethnic tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Returns from all 58 voting districts showed 86.5 percent backing
the constitution, with 13.5 percent against, Interior Ministry
official Fidel Yapi told The Associated Press. He said 56 percent
of the country's 4.8 million registered voters turned out.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum came at a critical juncture for Ivory Coast. Once
among Africa's most stable nations, the country faces increasing
military unrest, a battered economy and concerns that things could
worsen.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the new constitution will help return the country
to civilian rule, culminating in presidential elections Sept. 17.
Junta leader Gen. Robert Guei, a former army chief, is widely
believed to be planning to run.
</P>
<P>
   Guei came to power in a December coup that was initially popular
among Ivorians, tired of the corruption and ethnic favoritism in
the ousted government. Many have since become disillusioned.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to the draft came mainly from residents with
immigrant backgrounds and northerners who fear the constitution
will promote anti-foreigner sentiment and ethnic tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Ivory Coast has some 19 million residents, about 40 percent of
them immigrants who came here when the country was the region's
economic powerhouse. Many of the immigrants cannot vote.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years as prices for the country's main exports, cocoa
and coffee have plummeted, the economy has stumbled and Ivory
Coast's hospitality has turned to a simmering anti-foreigner
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum, which began Sunday, was forced into a second day
Monday because of organizational problems. Voters had been widely
expected to approve the constitution after all political parties
backed it.

<HEADLINE> Ocean County authorities search for killer of Lakewood hotel manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAKEWOOD, N.J. (AP) - Ocean County authorities said Tuesday they
were searching for a suspect in the apparent stabbing death of a
Lakewood hotel manager who was found dead in his office the
previous afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   William Smithers, owner of the Jefferson Hotel, discovered John
McGee in the hotel office about 4:30 p.m. on Monday, Ocean County
Prosecutor E. David Millard said in a statement released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities declined to comment on the number of stabs wounds or
where he was stabbed until the autopsy, scheduled for Tuesday
evening, could be completed. Autopsy results are expected to be
available Wednesday, said executive assistant prosecutor Greg
Sakowicz.	   
</P>
<P>
   McGee, 54, had lived in the small apartmentlike complex, said
Sakowicz.
</P>
<P>
   The night manager, who declined to give his name to The
Associated Press when reached by telephone Tuesday afternoon, said
McGee was ''a good guy'' and could not think of any reason why
someone would want to hurt the divorced father.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no idea,'' he said. ''We used to sit around and talk
together. He was a very good friend of mine.''

<HEADLINE> Talks Shatter Jerusalem Taboos  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- It always begins -- and ends -- with
Jerusalem. The centuries-old quarrel over the ancient city scuttled
an audacious, ambitious U.S. peace effort in the mountains of
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   But despite recriminations and anger in the wake of the failed
Camp David talks, the negotiations could presage a new era in
Mideast peacemaking, one in which Israelis and Palestinians talk
openly for the first time about ways of sharing the city they both
claim as a capital.
</P>
<P>
   Just by engaging in the discussions they did, the two sides
shattered some long-standing taboos -- and helped set what could be
a new tone for future discourse on their bitterest dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the talks ended Tuesday without an accord,
participants acknowledged that Jerusalem was the most difficult of
the summit's so-called ''core issues'' -- even more so than
emotionally loaded topics such as the fate of several million
Palestinian refugees, or how the boundaries of a future Palestinian
state should be drawn.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to Jerusalem, the two sides have a long, long
tradition of not actually talking to each other. Instead, they have
talked past one another.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis insist that Jerusalem will never be divided. The
Palestinians reply that it will be the capital of their sovereign
state.
</P>
<P>
   Irreconcilable differences? Perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp David, though, the two sides explored a radical notion,
one being aired for the first time in an official forum: that the
city both want so badly could somehow be shared.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were really coming to grips with things they had never
come to grips with before,'' President Clinton said in a somber
post-mortem on the peace talks. ''This is agonizing for them, both
of them. And unless you have lived there and lived with them and
talked to them or lived with this problem a long time, it is hard
to appreciate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it takes political rhetoric a while to catch up with
on-the-ground realities. Jerusalem is already a highly segregated
city, with Palestinians rarely venturing into Jewish neighborhoods,
and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   The point where the two peoples overlap is also the prime point
of contention -- the crowded confines of the walled Old City, home
to sites sacred to Christians, Muslims and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   During the summit, the Vatican renewed a long-standing proposal
that the Old City's holy sites come under international stewardship
to ensure full religious access for all. Christian leaders in
Jerusalem, meanwhile, called for Palestinian sovereignty with a
pact that all worshippers could have free access to holy sites.
</P>
<P>
   As Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat headed home to their respective publics, neither said
much about just what kind of a deal he might have been willing to
make on Jerusalem. But it was clear that the notion of a shared
city had been on the table at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have considered some ideas ... to make Jerusalem wider and
stronger,'' Barak told reporters afterward in the nearby Maryland
city of Frederick. He spoke of the prospect of Israel annexing some
large Jewish settlements in the West Bank that lie close to the
city, and giving the Palestinians sovereignty over some
predominantly Arab areas in exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli leader hastened to add that the summit's collapse
rendered those ideas null and void. Still, they opened a door.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Barak, Arafat left town without making any public
statement. But Hassan Abdel Rahman, the Washington envoy of
Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization and a frequent spokesman
during the summit, said Jerusalem was the cause of the collapse.
''It was at the top of the list,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian sources said the talks' breaking point came when
Israel balked at the idea of Palestinian sovereignty over the Old
City, offering them only control of Arab neighborhoods elsewhere,
coupled with a guarantee of access to the Old City's Al Aqsa
mosque, the third-holiest site in Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat was infuriated by this, the sources said, and it was
clear the talks could go no further.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, the Palestinian leader wasn't heading straight
home. He was stopping en route to confer with Egypt's President
Hosni Mubarak, who throughout the summit has been conducting talks
with Arab leaders on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat may make whatever deal he chooses about the borders of
his future state, but Jerusalem's status is another matter
entirely. Arab leaders have made it clear they consider it a
pan-Arab issue, and Arafat must answer to them as well as to his
own people.

<HEADLINE> Irish citizen disappears in Adirondacks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONG LAKE, N.Y. (AP) - A 23-year-old man has been missing from
the Adirondacks for more than a week, according to state police.
</P>
<P>
   Liam S. Sheehy, an Irish citizen, was last seen on July 12,
walking in Whispering Woods Campground where he works.
</P>
<P>
   Police said there is no evidence of foul play and speculate that
Sheehy left voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Robert LaSountain said, ''He has disappeared in the past
under similar circumstances, and he was located at an airport.''
</P>
<P>
   LaSountain did not release the name of the airport or why police
think Sheehy is disappearing and then trying to go back to Ireland.
He said Sheehy took his wallet but left his passport and visa,
adding that it might be difficult for Sheehy to leave the country.

<HEADLINE> Concorde crashes outside Paris; at least 113 killed  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA DOLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   GONESSE, France (AP) - An Air France Concorde en route to New
York crashed outside Paris shortly after takeoff Tuesday, slamming
into a hotel and a restaurant. At least 113 people were killed when
the charter flight of mostly German tourists went down in the
first-ever crash of the needle-nosed supersonic jet.
</P>
<P>
   Police said all 100 passengers and nine crew members on board
Flight AF4590 were killed, and the Interior Ministry said four
others died at a small hotel next to the two-star Hotelissimo. All
the passengers were German except for one American, two Danes, and
an Austrian, Air France said. The airline said the American was a
retired Air France employee, but did not release a name.
</P>
<P>
   At least a dozen people were injured at the hotel. They were in
good condition, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, none of the Concordes was flying. Air France agreed
to temporarily ground its five remaining Concordes, and British
Airways, which owns the other seven Concordes, grounded its two
remaining flights for Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   French television showed a chilling photograph of the plane
flying low over the airport, flames already trailing from its
engine.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel the plane crashed into was in flames, and sections had
been reduced to rubble and twisted metal. Firefighters poured
streams of water on the blackened wreckage, which had broken up
into scattered, smoking chunks. The remains of the Concorde were
barely recognizable as an airplane fuselage.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate word on what might have caused the crash
of the jet, which had been in service since 1980, had flown 12,000
hours and had just had a mechanical checkup July 21. In the more
than 30 years that Concorde jets have flown, none had gone down.
</P>
<P>
   The plane had been chartered by Peter Deilmann Shipping Co., a
German tour group, and the passengers were on their way to New York
to join a cruise ship.
</P>
<P>
   The jetliner crashed at 4:44 p.m. in an area of farmland
crisscrossed by highways and the small town of Gonesse, about nine
miles northeast of Paris. It went down soon after takeoff from
Charles de Gaulle airport.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the supersonic aircraft was not able to gain
sufficient altitude before it crashed. Others said a huge cloud of
black smoke went up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Samir Hossein, 15, a student in Gonesse, was playing tennis with
friends when they saw the plane go by with an engine on fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw it lose altitude. It chopped off those trees and headed
to the ground,'' Hossein told The Associated Press. ''The pilot
tried to bank but the plane rolled over and smacked into the hotel
nose first and turned over.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw flames shoot up 40 meters (yards) and there was a huge
boom,'' he said. ''The pilot tried to yank it up, but it was too
late.''
</P>
<P>
   Frederic Savery, 21, was driving along a highway on the way home
when he saw the plane go down.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw the plane, it passed 30 meters above us, the whole back
end of the plane was on fire,'' Savery told the AP. ''We saw it
start to turn, but we didn't hear a noise when it crashed. All of a
sudden, everything was black.''
</P>
<P>
   Air France President Jean-Cyril Spinetta, who said he had
witnessed the crash but didn't specify from where, told reporters
at the airport: ''For those who were witnesses, of whom I was one,
it seems that there was a fire in one or more of the engines on
takeoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Clouds of dark smoke could be seen for miles around. Police
blocked off all roads leading to the crash scene, backing up
traffic on rural roads in the farm fields near the airport. Dozens
of fire trucks and ambulances rushed to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin and French Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot visited
the scene of the crash. ''It's a terrible moment,'' Gayssot said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton said he ''wanted to extend the
deepest condolences of the American people to the families of those
who are lost.'' In Berlin, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
canceled his evening appointments to stay on top of developments.
</P>
<P>
   An official at Peter Deilmann Shipping in the German city of
Neustadt said most of the passengers came from various German
states. They met in Paris to fly together for the cruise aboard the
MS Deutschland, which is anchored in New York City. There were
three young people under age 18 among the passengers, French police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The German Foreign Ministry has set up crisis management centers
in both Berlin and Paris, the ministry said. The ministry said more
information would have to wait until the passengers names' were
confirmed with passenger lists.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, British Airways said it had found cracks in the wings
of some of its supersonic Concorde aircraft, but said there was no
danger to passengers. After the crash Tuesday, the British airline
canceled its two Tuesday night Concorde flights between London and
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have complete confidence in our Concorde aircraft and our
engineering,'' the airline said in a press release. ''Nevertheless,
in these circumstances - and while information is still coming in -
we have taken the unprecedented step of canceling tonight's
flights.''
</P>
<P>
   French Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot asked France's
civil aviation authority to suspend all of Wednesday's scheduled
Air France Concorde flights. Spinetta, the airline president, later
said no Concordes would fly Wednesday and the day would be used to
check the rest of the company's fleet of Concordes.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released in Paris, Gayssot said the step, which
was taken in agreement with Air France, was necessary to allow time
for a preliminary investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde, which crosses the Atlantic at 1,350 mph, has been
considered among the world's safest planes. Its only major scare
came in 1979, when a bad landing blew out a plane's tires. The
incident led to a design modification.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 30 of this year, a Concorde aircraft made an emergency
landing at London's Heathrow Airport - the second such landing
within a 24-hour period by one of the supersonic jets. A cockpit
alarm had sounded, warning of a fire in the rear cargo hold, but
engineers found no problem.
</P>
<P>
   The previous day, one of four engines had shut down on a
Concorde as it approached Heathrow.
</P>
<P>
   The plane is popular with celebrities, world-class athletes and
the rich. It flies above turbulence at nearly 60,000 feet, crossing
the Atlantic in about 3&AMP;frac12; hours, less than half that of regular
jetliners.
</P>
<P>
   The first Concorde plane flew in 1969. Now, 13 of the jets are
operated by Air France and British Airways. A roundtrip Paris-New
York ticket costs $9,000, roughly 25 percent more than regular
first class. A London-New York roundtrip runs $9,850.
</P>
<P>
   Air France officials have said in the past that their current
fleet is fit to fly safely until 2007.

<HEADLINE> Jets Camp a Lot Quieter Now  </HEADLINE>
By BILL BARNARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Training camp is a lot quieter now that
Bill Parcells is gone after three years of terrorizing New York
Jets players.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, will Al Groh be as effective as Parcells, who
won two Super Bowls with the New York Giants, took New England to a
Super Bowl and nearly took the Jets there just two years after they
were 1-15?
</P>
<P>
   The Jets claim the coaching change is a matter of having
different styles with the same message.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells might have told a player he was so soft that he should
go back to his college team. Today, Groh expresses his
disappointment in a practice by saying players ''missed the mark.''
</P>
<P>
   But Groh, the Jets' former linebackers coach, said the ax will
fall just as heavily on cutdown day as it did before.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just because it's not as loud and colorful as before, there's
no less tension to perform and no less notetaking than before,''
Groh said. ''Notes are being made of who measures up, who causes
you to win and who causes you to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach said that ''even if they fail to respond or understand
(in practice), I will never fail to respond to whatever I see or
whatever they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells is still the team's director of football operations,
and while he doesn't participate when he appears at practice, his
presence is still felt.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is still Bill's team,'' linebacker Bryan Cox said. ''Al's
the coach, but they're still Bill's players and it's still the same
system. That's why I say it's still Bill's team.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorian Boose, a defensive end praised by Groh as a player who
might be ready to contribute in his third season, said he got
little ''positive feedback'' in ''Bill's'' his first two years.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he meant former defensive coordinator Bill
Belichick or Parcells, Boose hesitated before answering
''Belichick.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to look back at it and say they wanted to make me
better,'' Boose said. ''Now, the same message is there, it's just a
different approach. They make their point in a different way.''
</P>
<P>
   Guard Randy Thomas, who became a starter in the offensive line
as a rookie under Parcells last year, said a coach's style makes
little difference to him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whoever's in command, I'll listen, whether it's loud or it's
soft,'' Thomas said. ''I'm not going to take him lightly just
because he talks light. I'm just here to play football and to
listen. Al's the boss, and if you don't do what he wants, you won't
be here long.''
</P>
<P>
   Running back Curtis Martin, who followed Parcells from New
England to the Jets, recalled his style somewhat wistfully.
</P>
<P>
   ''Life is calmer,'' Martin said. ''It feels different not
hearing his quotes, those special moments in life that you'll never
forget. I had a lot of those with Parcells.'

<HEADLINE> NTSB Discusses FedEx '97 Crash  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The pilot of a Federal Express cargo jet
miscalculated the length of a Newark International Airport runway,
then missed a chance to abort a hard landing before the jet
cartwheeled in flames in 1997, federal investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing Tuesday, National Transportation Safety Board
experts said that when the plane first hit the runway and bounced,
the FedEx pilot could have channeled momentum from the bounce into
a take off for a ''go-around'' -- a second approach to land at the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he reacted to the bounce by pushing the nose of the
McDonnell Douglas MD-11 toward the ground and, perhaps
inadvertently, to the right.
</P>
<P>
   The second, awkward landing cracked a connection of the right
wing, causing a fuel leak and fire as the plane tumbled to a stop.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, the pilot chose the least desirable option of
attempting to salvage a landing from a destabilized and worsening
condition,'' said Capt. Paul Misencik, chairman of the NTSB's
operations group.
</P>
<P>
   The five-member board unanimously declared that the probable
cause of the crash was ''the captain's overcontrol of the airplane
during the landing and his failure to execute a go-around.''
</P>
<P>
   The captain, Robert M. Freeman, still works for Federal Express
but is not flying, company spokeswoman Darlene Faquin said. The
first officer, Donald E. Goodin, is flying for Federal Express.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman, Goodin, a visiting pilot sitting in the cockpit and two
FedEx employee passengers escaped with minor injuries from the
early morning crash on July 31, 1997, by crawling to safety through
a cockpit window.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman and Goodin also came under scrutiny by the NTSB.
</P>
<P>
   Their first error came several minutes before approaching Newark
Airport, when they compared data from a laptop computer and a
printed form to conclude they had a tight landing space.
</P>
<P>
   ''The crew erroneously perceived that their stopping margin on
the runway was an uncomfortable 780 feet,'' said Robert Benzon, the
lead NTSB investigator. ''Had they followed the correct procedure
... they would have determined that their actual stopping margin
was 1,680 feet.''
</P>
<P>
   The flight was normal until about 18 feet above the runway, when
the captain reacted to a minor drop in the plane's nose by pulling
it up abruptly. The first hard landing followed moments later.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB examined larger issues, such as whether crowded skies
and tight schedules make pilots reluctant to perform a go-around.
</P>
<P>
   ''Try this at O'Hare (Airport in Chicago) at 8 a.m. and you're
going to kind of foul things up for a while,'' Benzon said.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB investigator Tom Lasseigne said more than four hours passed
before the incident commander at the Newark airport learned from
FedEx that the plane was carrying hazardous materials, including
aerosols, a corrosive material and flammable liquids.
</P>
<P>
   FedEx is developing a new hazardous material tracking system
that will allow immediate access to flight manifests via computer.

<HEADLINE> RETRANSMITS to correct writethru sequence for state lines  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) - The Concorde flight from Paris to New York was
just the first stage in a world-class luxury tour.
</P>
<P>
   The Germany-based Deilmann Shipping Co. had booked at least 99
passengers killed in the crash at Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport
on a 16-day Caribbean cruise from New York, through the Panama
canal, to Ecuador aboard the five-star MS Deutschland passenger
ship.
</P>
<P>
   This was a trip to savor. Champagne on the Concorde, traveling
at twice the speed of sound over the Atlantic. Then, a leisurely
cruise on Deilmann's flagship MS Deutschland ocean liner built two
years ago to evoke the Roaring '20s, featuring crystal chandeliers,
an imperial ballroom and loom chairs in a palm-filled winter
garden.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's even a salt-water swimming pool sheltered by a glazed
promenade in case you want to take a dip,'' says the tempting
description on the shipping company's website. It boasts a Lido
Deck that offers a view of approaching ports: Norfolk, Virginia for
a day at the beach, a tour of the Kennedy Space Center in Cape
Canaveral and stops in Havana, Cuba and Playa del Carmen in Mexico,
before slipping through the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag: 8,490 marks, or dlrs 3,400, for a shared cabin.
And 22,130 marks, or dlrs 11,065, for a suite with an ocean view.
Transport to New York on the chartered Concorde flight was not
included.
</P>
<P>
   From Ecuador, passengers might catch a flight back to Frankfurt.
Or opt to continue on the ship's next leg, 19-days to Tahiti for
dlrs 5,500 - with an option to continue to Sydney - arriving on
Sept. 14 - a day before the opening ceremonies at the Summer
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise was marketed for the wealthy northern European
traveler craving warm summer seas.
</P>
<P>
   Tour operator Peter Deilmann said he had provided a list of the
99 passengers his company had booked on the Concorde to the Foreign
Ministry, but declined to release any names or hometowns other than
to say they were almost all from around Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's up to the Foreign Ministry,'' he said, adding that the
list had to be compared with the flight manifest from Air France in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   According to Air France, 97 of the passengers on flight AF4590
were German, two were Danes and one was American.
</P>
<P>
   German authorities were comparing the lists to determine who was
actually aboard the plane, said the Foreign Ministry. It confirmed
that 100 passengers and nine crew were killed in the crash - in
addition to four people in the hotel where the Concorde crashed.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman said 30 people at the Foreign Ministry crisis office
were trying to contact relatives and arrange transportation to the
accident scene.
</P>
<P>
   Deilmann said he was ''deeply dismayed'' about the accident and
expressed his sympathy to the victims' relatives. Speaking to
reporters at the cruise company's headquarters in the Baltic port
town of Neustadt in Holstein, he said two company representatives
from Germany would join two others in France on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He said the cruise, which had a total 510 passengers booked,
would not be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no sense letting the ship lie there,'' he said. ''Life
goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   His company had offered Concorde-cruise combinations three times
before, but added, ''there won't be anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder canceled his evening
appointments to stay on top of developments, and issued his deepest
condolences after speaking with French President Jacques Chirac and
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
</P>
<P>
   ''Germany and France are united in their horror over the
accident, in mourning for the victims and in sympathy for their
families,'' Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor sent his transport minister, Reinhard Klimmt, to
the scene and the German Foreign Ministry has set up a second
crisis center at the German Embassy in Paris, which was helping to
identify the dead.
</P>
<P>
   The entire German Cabinet, headed by Schroeder, will attend an
ecumenical service for the victims of the crash Wednesday morning
in Hanover at a chapel located on the grounds of the World's Fair.
The Cabinet had been scheduled to hold the last regular meeting
before its summer break at the German pavilion of Expo 2000.

<HEADLINE> NBA Players To Have Paychecks Cut  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARADISE ISLAND, Bahamas (AP) -- NBA players, from the
highest-paid superstar to the lowest-paid rookie, will lose 10
percent of their paychecks in the 2001-02 season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think players are going to be really upset when they learn
about it,'' said Orlando's Pat Garrity, who was elected Tuesday as
the union's secretary-treasurer. ''Ten percent is a pretty big
chunk.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10 percent giveback is known as the escrow tax, which the
players agreed to during negotiations to end the 1998-99 lockout.
</P>
<P>
   The tax would be triggered onoy if players received more than 55
percent of basketball-related income. But projections show the
players will receive 64 percent of such income in the upcoming
season.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, the players will be returning more than $150
million to the owners in 2001-02. The tax will stay in effect for
the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons under current basketball-income
projections, meaning the players will fork over close to a
half-billion dollars by the time the six-year collective bargaining
agreement expires.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not really something people are thinking about,'' Garrity
said, ''But the comfort is that the alternative was a hard salary
cap, which wouldn't have been good for anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Players received $1.38 billion in salaries and benefits during
the 1999-00 season, and the median salary rose 19 percent to $2
million.
</P>
<P>
   The median salary is up 40 percent in the two years since the
lockout, and 76 percent of the players are earning $1 million or
more, union officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Seven players, including Garrity, were elected to the union's
executive committee Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Alonzo Mourning of Miami, Sam Mitchell of Minnesota, Ray Allen
of Milwaukee, Jerome Williams of Detroit, Theo Ratliff of

<HEADLINE> House Passes Anti-Poverty Bill  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Forty impoverished communities to be chosen
nationwide would get tax breaks, regulatory relief and new
government programs under a bill passed overwhelmingly by the House
on Tuesday as a partial solution for places not sharing in
America's prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   With a solid 394-27 bipartisan vote, the House sent the bill to
the Senate, where a similar measure is pending. President Clinton
is an enthusiastic supporter with Republican leaders in Congress,
making the legislation one of the few major tax-related bills with
a chance of becoming law this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not pro-Republican or pro-Democrat. It's something
good for people,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Clinton said the bill would ''spur more
private sector investment'' in cities and rural areas that ''still
do not have access to investment capital and economic
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I look forward to working with members of both parties in the
House and the Senate this year to enact this historic and
innovative legislation,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-poverty legislation was rushed to the House floor under
special rules prohibiting amendments and limiting debate so it
would pass before Congress recesses in August for the Democratic
and Republican political conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it represents five years of effort by lawmakers from both
parties ''to find out what works from the people on the ground who
are working every day to revive these neighborhoods,'' said Rep.
J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, the fourth-ranking House Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, which would reduce government revenue by about
$6 billion over five years, the Department of Housing and Urban
Development would designate the 40 communities where the assistance
would apply from nominations submitted by states. In general, they
would be urban and rural places with ''pervasive poverty, high
unemployment and general economic distress.''
</P>
<P>
   They are places, in the words of Rep. Danny Davis, D-Ill.,
''where people have given up -- where people felt there was nothing
really for them.''
</P>
<P>
   These communities, in turn, would be eligible for tax breaks and
other provisions with the underlying theme of persuading private
companies to invest in inner cities and poor rural areas, thereby
creating jobs and economic activity while minimizing the role of
government.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't do it unless you provide capital,'' said Rep.
Charles Rangel, a Democrat who represents much of Harlem. ''Capital
goes where there's the least amount of risk.''
</P>
<P>
   A centerpiece of the bill is the ''New Markets'' initiative that
establishes 10 venture capital companies to invest in small
businesses located in poor neighborhoods. The government would
guarantee up to $150 million in loans and $30 million in grants for
companies licensed by the Small Business Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''It provides a roadmap for investment in underserved
communities,'' said Rep. Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   There also would be ''New Markets'' tax credits for investors in
community development entities that provide assistance and
businesses in low-income areas.
</P>
<P>
   Other tax breaks would help businesses pay a share of the salary
of each worker hired from a local neighborhood, allow small firms
to deduct more equipment costs immediately, permit immediate
deduction of ''brown-field'' environmental cleanup expenses and
eliminate capital gains taxes on sale of businesses or assets
located in one of the 40 renewal communities.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond spurring investment, the bill is aimed at freeing up
housing for the poor by boosting the low-income housing tax credit,
enabling HUD to transfer vacant, foreclosed and substandard
properties to local governments and nonprofit associations and
permit religious organizations nationwide to compete for federal
alcohol and drug treatment grants.
</P>
<P>
   There was some opposition to the last provision from House
members who contended it could result in discriminatory use of
federal money if a religious group decided to hire only members of
a particular faith. The bill exempts the organizations from civil
rights laws that govern hiring with federal money.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those exemptions should apply to private funds, not federal
funds,'' said Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors said, however, that the measure allows participants a
choice of accepting religious or secular treatment and also
protects religious organizations by prohibiting government from
forcing them to remove religious symbols or change their rules of
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ''It simply gives individuals a choice, and the reason is these
groups are often very effective at stopping drug or alcohol
abuse,'' said Rep. Jim Talent, R-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 4923.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy: Israel Violates Border  </HEADLINE>
By SAM F. GHATTAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- A U.N. envoy accused Israel on Tuesday of
violating its border with Lebanon, saying the Jewish state's
behavior was ''unnecessary, counterproductive and totally
unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   The accusations by Sweden's Terje Roed-Larsen followed earlier
complaints from Lebanese officials that Israel had committed fresh
encroachments across the U.N.-drawn frontier. Plans to deploy U.N.
peacekeepers along the border starting Wednesday were put on hold,
an official Lebanese statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Larsen said the Israelis were crossing into Lebanese territory
at various points along the border and that U.N. peacekeepers
confirmed the violations.
</P>
<P>
   Larsen, in his statement, ''expressed his deep disappointment
over this Israeli behavior and stressed that these repeated Israeli
violations were unnecessary, counterproductive and totally
unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   The envoy also conveyed to Israeli officials that ''this pattern
of behavior had to be changed immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Larsen, together with the deputy commander of the U.N. Interim
Force in Lebanon, were to inspect the border on Wednesday, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   At United Nations headquarters in New York, the U.N. Security
Council warned it would not tolerate any border violations and
''urged the parties to avoid any incident that could lead to an
escalation of tensions,'' council president Patricia Durant,
Jamaica's ambassador, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate Israeli comment, but Deputy Defense
Minister Ephraim Sneh told reporters earlier Tuesday that Israel
had fulfilled ''to the last millimeter'' a 1978 Security Council
resolution calling for its withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   It's time, he said, that ''the Lebanese do their part.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, the Lebanese government had given the green
light for the peacekeepers to deploy, saying it was satisfied by a
U.N. report that found Israel was no longer violating Lebanese
territory.
</P>
<P>
   But in an official statement later in the day, it said the
border had been violated at four points between Monday night and
Tuesday morning. A meeting of Lebanese army officers and the U.N.
peacekeeping force to plan the deployment of peacekeepers was
called off until further notice.
</P>
<P>
   Deploying peacekeepers along the border could ease tensions in
the region, where anti-Israeli guerrillas have taken control
following Israel's May 24 withdrawal from a south Lebanon border
strip it had held for 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   Beirut had refused to allow the U.N. deployment or to move its
own forces into the border region, because Israeli army posts,
patrols and a border fence still encroached in places across the
border drawn by the United Nations at the time of Israel's
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have worked for weeks surveying on the border to
resolve the claims of violations.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese government has prepared a combined force of 500
army troops and 500 policemen to deploy in the south.
</P>
<P>
   About 5,000 U.N. peacekeepers from 11 countries are already
stationed north of the border in southern Lebanon. Most have been
there since March 1978 when Israeli troops invaded southern Lebanon
to push back guerrillas firing on northern Israeli communities.
More peacekeepers were expected to arrive.

<HEADLINE> Financial consultant accused of defrauding 20 people of $1.2 million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CANANDAIGUA, N.Y. (AP) - A well-known financial consultant has
pleaded innocent to charges he duped 20 people out of more than
$1.2 million over the past seven years by selling them fictitious
bonds and certificates of deposit.
</P>
<P>
   James W. Rulison, a former account executive with Sage Rutty &AMP;
Co. who also wrote a weekly financial column for Messenger Post
Newspapers and founded a radio advice program, was arraigned in
Ontario County Court Monday on 20 counts of grand larceny.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were tipped to Rulison's alleged activities by a
suspicious investor, state police said.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Holly, president of Sage Rutty &AMP; Co., has said Rulison
acknowledged he acted alone. He said the investment firm plans to
reimburse the clients and keep open its Canandaigua office, where
Rulison worked from 1987 until being fired in May.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Getz, Rulison's attorney, told the judge his client intended
to secure assets in a trust to make restitution.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of the seven counts of second-degree grand larceny
and 13 counts of third-degree grand larceny, Rulison could be
sentenced to anything from a conditional discharge or probation to
a prison term of 10 to 20 years, said Livingston County District
Attorney Thomas Moran.
</P>
<P>
   Moran is acting as a special prosecutor in the case because
Ontario County District Attorney Michael Tantillo is a friend and
neighbor to Rulison.
</P>
<P>
   Rulison would not comment following the arraignment. He was
freed on $10,000 bail and scheduled to return to court Sept. 14.

<HEADLINE> Two high-ranking DC 37 officials convicted  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Two former high-ranking officers of the
city-employee union District Council 37 were convicted Tuesday on
charges of stuffing ballot boxes to win passage of an unpopular
labor contract in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Diop, former president of Local 1549, and Martin Lubin,
former associate director of the 120,000-member DC 37, were
convicted of scheming to defraud. Jurors found the two men created
votes to get the contract ratified.
</P>
<P>
   Diop, whose union represented 23,000 clerical workers, was also
convicted of falsifying business records, but acquitted of forgery.
Lubin, DC 37's No. 2 official, was convicted of forgery. He
personally marked ballots that had been printed for the rigged
vote, according to testimony.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Justice Bonnie Wittner let Diop, 65, of
Brooklyn, remain free on $125,000 bail and Lubin, 59, of Staten
Island, on $25,000 bail until sentencing Sept. 7. Both face up to
seven years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The contract Diop and Lubin wanted ratified was pushed by
Stanley Hill, then-executive director of DC 37, because it provided
for no layoffs. Union members disliked it because it contained no
raises for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Noel Desiderio, DC 37's mailroom and print shop supervisor,
testified at trial that he was ordered to print up 5,000 extra
ballots that would be used to boost the vote in favor of the
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Shaplo, 71, of Queens, testified that he helped Lubin mark
the bogus ballots - switching pens and using both his right and
left hands - to assure that the contract was accepted. Shaplo, who
pleaded guilty to embezzlement, was the third highest ranking
officer of DC 37.
</P>
<P>
   Diop's lawyer, Ramon Pagan, denounced the verdict and said he
plans to appeal. He said the jury convicted Diop of simply checking
to find out how the contract vote was going.
</P>
<P>
   Diop, a former close adviser to Hill, was forced by DC 37's
parent union, the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees, to resign his post after he was unable to
account for $2 million of Local 1549's money. he is scheduled to go
to trial in September on larceny charges.
</P>
<P>
   Lubin's lawyer, Pamela Hayes, said she was disappointed by the
verdict and she also plans to appeal.

   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - FOR SALE OR LEASE: 2.9 million gross square
feet of floor space on 350-plus shaded acres. Excellent highway
access, service roads and parking. Sixteen buildings, one designed
to withstand a nuclear bomb blast.
</P>
<P>
   That is what the real estate listing might look like should the
Pataki administration decide to privatize all or part of the Gov.
W. Averell Harriman State Office Building Campus in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   A New York City consultant is expected to report in September on
the best future uses for the complex, including the cost of
upgrading the buildings to year 2000 standards and the potential
advantages to the state treasury and local tax rolls of bringing in
private companies as owners or tenants.
</P>
<P>
   The disposition of the Harriman campus property is one aspect of
a $240 million-plus, long-term plan for the accommodation of the
state work force in and around the capital city.
</P>
<P>
   Other features of the ''Albany Plan'' have already taken shape,
including the ongoing construction of two office towers in downtown
Albany to house the state comptroller's office and the state
Department of Environmental Conservation. A 2,400-space parking
garage adjacent to the Empire State Plaza office complex in Albany
is nearly finished.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Albany Mayor Jerry Jennings hopes the Harriman
study will result in the state relinquishing the current tax-exempt
status of what is potentially some of his city's most attractive
office space.
</P>
<P>
   ''The privatization of the campus is totally consistent with our
Albany Plan, which the governor and I believe will result in the
continued revitalization of our urban center and the expansion of
the city's tax base,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But others caution that a decision to lease or sell off the
Harriman complex is not to be entered into lightly or rashly.
</P>
<P>
   State Assemblyman Jack McEneny remembers when the ''sand plain''
in west Albany was being fashioned in the late 1950s into the
Harriman complex. The bulldozers kicked up so much sand and dust
that the clocks in the McEneny home got clogged and stopped
working, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, city and state leaders favored the complex being
built on what was then the outskirts of the city as a way of easing
tight office space demands and congestion downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the design called for 20 major office buildings
spaced evenly around a 2.5-mile inner loop of highway. Sixteen
major buildings were eventually built, and today they are work
sites for some 9,000 state employees in agencies ranging from the
state police to the departments of taxation and finance,
transportation and labor.
</P>
<P>
   The project was scaled back somewhat when Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller became enthralled with an exciting new approach to
providing work space to state workers - his grandiose,
billion-dollar Empire State Plaza project next door to the state
Capitol. Some 11,000 state employees now work in the complex.
</P>
<P>
   The Harriman campus, with its utilitarian buildings and
campus-like setting - there is little to distinguish it from the
State University at Albany next door - has always been the low-key
cousin of the Empire State Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not on many postcards,'' McEneny said.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1991 and early 1992, the Harriman complex did gain
notice, however. In those months, Building 8 on the campus, housing
the tax department, had to be repeatedly evacuated because workers
were being sickened by chemical fumes. It took months for the
problem to be cleared up.
</P>
<P>
   Still, employees generally seem to like to work in Building 8
and in the Harriman complex, said T.J. O'Donnell, local president
for the Civil Service Employees Association at the tax department.
</P>
<P>
   ''One big thing is there is good parking,'' O'Donnell said.
''There are plenty of trees where people can walk around and have
their lunches outdoors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War era in which the complex was built has left its
stamp on the office complex. Deep beneath State Police headquarters
building is a bunker housing a nerve center for police, National
Guard and other personnel that is used at times of natural or
man-made emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   But the bunker was built with a more catastrophic disaster in
mind - nuclear war. It was designed to withstand the detonation of
a nuclear bomb at the typical ''blast zone'' of 2,000 feet over the
ground. The building upstairs would be wiped out, of course,
architects calculated, but the bunker would be intact for surviving
state officials to carry on.
</P>
<P>
   Another fallout of the era of the campus' construction is their
lack of accommodation for the computers and other electronic
fixtures of modern offices. In the early 1990s, a state study
placed the cost of renovating and modernizing the buildings on the
campus at more than $312 million.
</P>
<P>
   Those expenses will be one of the considerations of the
consultants studying the future of the complex. Another will be the
costs of relocating the campus' 9,000 employees to other work
spaces if privatization is deemed to be the way to go.
</P>
<P>
   McEneny said he favors an arrangement where the state would
lease buildings on the campus to suitable private companies -
insurance firms, high-tech companies, computer companies and the
like - while retaining title to the property.
</P>
<P>
   ''It depends on the buildings, and some of them are very
institutional,'' he said. ''They were not elegant when they were
put up and they are well behind the times.''
</P>
<P>
   By holding onto the property, the state can preserve the option
of someday incorporating the complex into the University at Albany
in case that college someday outgrows its current campus, McEneny
said.

<HEADLINE> NTSB says 'go-around' could have prevented 1997 FedEx crash  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - The pilot of a Federal Express cargo jet
miscalculated the length of a Newark International Airport runway,
then missed a chance to abort a hard landing before the jet
cartwheeled in flames in 1997, according to National Transportation
Safety Board investigators.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing Tuesday, NTSB experts said the FedEx pilot could
have channeled momentum from the plane's initial bounce to take off
for a ''go-around'' - a second approach to land at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he reacted to the bounce by pushing the nose of the
McDonnell Douglas MD-11 toward the ground and, perhaps
inadvertently, to the right.
</P>
<P>
   The second, awkward landing cracked a connection of the right
wing, causing a fuel leak and fire as the plane tumbled to a stop
upside down.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately the pilot chose the least desirable option of
attempting to salvage a landing from a destabilized and worsening
condition,'' said Capt. Paul Misencik, chairman of the NTSB's
operations group.
</P>
<P>
   The five-member board unanimously declared that the probable
cause of the crash was ''the captain's overcontrol of the airplane
during the landing and his failure to execute a go-around.'' A
contributing factor, the board found, was the crew's mistaken
belief that they had to touch down quickly because the runway was
short.
</P>
<P>
   The captain, Robert M. Freeman, still works for Federal Express
but is not flying, company spokeswoman Darlene Faquin said. The
first officer, Donald E. Goodin, is flying for Federal Express.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman, Goodin, a visiting pilot sitting in the cockpit and two
FedEx employee passengers escaped from the early morning crash on
July 31, 1997, with minor injuries by crawling to safety through a
cockpit window. Firefighters from Newark, N.J., and surrounding
areas spent hours fighting the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions of Freeman and Goodin came under particular
scrutiny by the NTSB.
</P>
<P>
   Their first error came several minutes before approaching Newark
Airport, when they compared data from a laptop computer and a
printed form to conclude they had a tight landing space.
</P>
<P>
   ''The crew erroneously perceived that their stopping margin on
the runway was an uncomfortable 780 feet,'' said Robert Benzon, the
lead NTSB investigator. ''Had they followed the correct procedure
... they would have determined that their actual stopping margin
was 1,680 feet.''
</P>
<P>
   A transcript of the cockpit voice recorder, released by the NTSB
in 1998, showed that the pilot and first officer warned the others
on board to expect ''a pretty abrupt stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The flight was normal until about 18 feet above the runway, when
the captain reacted to a minor drop in the plane's nose by pulling
it up abruptly. The first hard landing followed moments later.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB examined larger issues, such as whether crowded skies
and tight schedules make pilots reluctant to perform a go-around.
</P>
<P>
   ''Try this at O'Hare (Airport in Chicago) at 8 a.m. and you're
going to kind of foul things up for a while,'' Benzon said.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue raised by the FedEx crash involved identification
of hazardous cargo.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB investigator Tom Lasseigne said more than 4 hours passed
before the incident commander at the Newark airport learned from
FedEx that the plane was carrying hazardous materials including
aerosols, a corrosive material and flammable liquids.
</P>
<P>
   Some firefighters experienced nausea and tightness in their
chests despite standing upwind and using breathing equipment.
Lasseigne said the problems could have been much worse had the
incident commander not assumed, wisely, that the plane was carrying
hazardous materials.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey identified the
incident commander as Lt. Patrick Quinn.
</P>
<P>
   FedEx is developing a new hazardous material tracking system
that will allow immediate access to manifests via computer. The
NTSB also wants the Research and Special Programs Administration,
an arm of the Department of Transportation, to press other air
carriers to streamline reporting of hazardous materials.
</P>
<P>
   Wrapping up its 3-year investigation of the FedEx crash, the
NTSB issued 10 recommendations to the Federal Aviation
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Among them: convene a government-industry task force to develop
training tools on hard landings and go-arounds, and require
installation within one year of upgraded flight-control software on
MD-11 airplanes.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Uncertain on ABMs by 2005  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two consecutive failures to shoot down a mock
warhead in space with a land-based interceptor have ''called into
question the realism'' of having a national missile defense ready
by 2005, Defense Secretary William Cohen said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Cohen said that it is too early to give up on the
2005 target date. Yet he conceded in testimony before the Senate
Armed Services Committee that the failed flight tests in January
and July were unhelpful.
</P>
<P>
   ''Perhaps it has called into question the realism of the date,''
Cohen said, noting that this was the view of retired Gen. Larry
Welch, head of a panel that is advising the Pentagon on its
national missile defense project. He added that both he and Welch
believe the 2005 target date is ''the date we ought to continue to
focus on.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen is due to make a recommendation to President Clinton --
probably in mid-August -- on whether to proceed toward having a
system of 20 missile interceptors and a new high-powered X-band
radar ready by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that Cohen would recommend moving the start-up
date to 2006 or later. He gave no indication in his Senate
testimony that he thinks this is necessary, although he pointedly
left open that possibility by conceding under questioning that
testing thus far has failed to show the system is technically
feasible.
</P>
<P>
   The 2005 date is important because, according to Pentagon
projections, it would take five years to complete the construction
necessary for an anti-missile shield capable of defending all 50
states against a limited attack of ballistic missiles from North
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The initial system is designed explicitly to intercept a threat
from North Korea, which the Pentagon expects will have missiles
capable of reaching U.S. soil by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton does not give the go-ahead this fall to begin
groundbreaking work next year at the X-band radar site on Shemya
Island, Alaska, then the entire project will be set back by at
least one year, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen noted that it might be possible for Clinton to approve
awarding the construction contracts this fall, with the stipulation
that a separate decision would be made next year to actually
execute the contracts. Because of the harsh weather conditions on
Shemya, work can only be done during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed a law last year requiring the Pentagon to deploy
a national missile defense as soon as technologically possible.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Armed Services
Committee, said that in his view this law amounted to a national
decision to go ahead with missile defense. The only question is how
soon, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said, however, that determining when missile defense is
technologically possible is a more complicated question involving
such things as its affordability and the implications for broader
U.S. national security concerns, such as arms control agreements
with Russia, relations with China and European concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not simple. It's complicated,'' Cohen said. ''But that's
part of the work of diplomacy and persuasion, and that's what we've
been seeking to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Levin of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the committee,
told Cohen he believes Clinton should put off a decision on moving
ahead with deployment, in light of the January and July flight test
failures.
</P>
<P>
   ''The time has come to acknowledge that the 2005 deployment goal
is no longer realistic, and should be adjusted,'' Levin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''President Clinton does not need to -- and should not -- make the
determination this year that the currently proposed (national
missile defense) will be deployed,'' Levin said. Instead the
president should adopt a ''3-D'' policy of continuing development
of the technology, discussion of related arms control issues with
the Russians, and deferral of any decision to deploy a national
missile defense to the next administration.
</P>
<P>
   Levin pressed Cohen to say whether he agreed that the Pentagon's
testing so far has failed to show that the proposed national
missile defense is technologically feasible.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that's accurate, but I believe that the trend is such
that these are problems that are correctable,'' Cohen replied.

<HEADLINE> Lewis To Re-Sign With Sonics  </HEADLINE>
By LUIS CABRERA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Free-agent forward Rashard Lewis has decided to
re-sign with the Seattle Supersonics despite last season's problems
on and off the court.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had an up-and-down season,'' Lewis acknowledged Tuesday in
an interview from his home in Houston. ''But toward the end of the
year we played together as a team. Next year, if we can play
together as a team for the whole season, we'll do a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he would fly to Seattle next week to sign a contract.
He declined to discuss terms, saying the number of years and dollar
amounts had not yet been finalized.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Wally Walker said it did not appear the team
would have to clear salary cap room by releasing a veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been working on this for a long time, and I think it's
just a good decision on his part,'' Walker said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who turns 21 next month, played his first two seasons
with the Sonics after being drafted out of high school in the
second round in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He became a restricted free agent July 1, and Walker said
re-signing the 6-foot-10, 215-pound small forward was the team's
top priority.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis averaged 8.2 points and 4.1 rebounds as a sometime starter
for the Sonics last season. He was brilliant at times, including a
30-point, 12 rebound effort against Dallas on Feb. 9, and six other
20-point games.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics surprised many with a fast start but faded, finishing
with a 45-37 record and losing to the Utah Jazz in the first round
of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The team also had its problems away from the games. In March,
while the club was mired in a 13-17 slump, starting center Horace
Grant and reserve Chuck Person were injured while trying to break
up a weight room fight between All-Star point guard Gary Payton and
reserve guard Vernon Maxwell.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a good group of people,'' Walker said. ''If you have
competitive guys, there always are going to be some incidents. We
have guys with that raw competitive nerve who are still good
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker said coach Paul Westphal expected to play Lewis primarily
at small forward next year, though he would see significant minutes
at shooting guard.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he has been working hard to prepare for both spots.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just keep working on my weaknesses every day,'' he said.
''My main focus right now is working on my ballhandling and going
off the dribble, creating some shots for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis looks forward to seeing more time alongside Payton, who at
age 31 had perhaps his best season last year, averaging 24.2 points
and 8.9 assists.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's going to be a good deal for me,'' Lewis said. ''Gary is
one of the best point guards in the league, and that will leave
some of the attention off of me'' on offense.

<HEADLINE> Panthers Overhaul Defense  </HEADLINE>
By JENNA FRYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPARTANBURG, S.C. (AP) -- Eric Davis' smile was gaping. As he
looked around Carolina's practice field Tuesday and saw all the new
faces, the cornerback could envision a very good season.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what coach George Seifert had in mind when he
completely revamped the Panthers' defense. He brought in four key
free agents during the offseason, used seven draft picks on
defensive players, lured Reggie White out of retirement and signed
Eric Swann.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always want the best players on my team and looking around,
we've got 'em,'' Davis said. ''That's George -- he's not going to
start a race planning on coming in second.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the mentality he wants the rest of us to have and he
doesn't want anyone around who doesn't feel that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Seifert proved that with an aggressive overhaul of a team that
finished 8-8 last season -- one game out of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Because Carolina's offense was ranked sixth overall in the
league, he left it alone. The defense ranked 26th and Seifert
believed major changes were needed to push Carolina into the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ''The future is now in this deal, so we want to put the best
team or product on the field,'' Seifert said. ''You've got to go
for it. That's the mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   Seifert started in February when he convinced defensive end Jay
Williams to leave the St. Louis Rams. Williams had four sacks in a
reserve role with the Super Bowl champions and Seifert offered him
a shot at more playing time.
</P>
<P>
   He then went after defensive end Chuck Smith, who left Atlanta
ranked second on the Falcons' career sacks list. Smith, who had 10
sacks last season, takes over on the right side of the line for
Chuck Wiley, who had none.
</P>
<P>
   Then Seifert signed cornerback Jimmy Hitchcock away from
Minnesota for a three-way battle with Davis and Doug Evans for the
two starting corner spots.
</P>
<P>
   Next came linebacker Lee Woodall, who played under Seifert in
San Francisco, and fills the void created when Kevin Greene retired
and Michael Barrow was released.
</P>
<P>
   And on draft day, Seifert used his first two picks on defensive
backs. One of them, either Rashard Anderson or Deion Grant, will
start at free safety on opening day.
</P>
<P>
   But Seifert's biggest triumphs came in the last week when he
persuaded White to come out of retirement and Swann to sign a
one-year deal worth below his market value.
</P>
<P>
   Swann, released by the Arizona Cardinals two weeks ago, turned
down guaranteed offers from Denver and Jacksonville to play for the
Panthers at the league minimum of $440,000 with no signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   At his first practice Tuesday, Swann said the money meant very
little to him.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Panthers are very committed to winning now, committed to
winning today, and that's very important to me,'' Swann said. ''I
spent a lot of time watching last year because I knew where I
wanted to go when my time was up and I saw a lot of potential here.
I'm at the point now where that's what I want, and to just be happy
playing football again.''
</P>
<P>
   The potential is now there, but living up to it is the
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of coaches have been fired waiting for the potential to
rise to the surface,'' Davis said. ''We've got to live up to it
because what we look like on paper doesn't mean anything.''
</P>
<P>
   White, who is 38 and coming off a year of rest, might not be the
same player he once was. And Swann, who has had seven operations on
his arthritic knees, has missed 18 games over the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But Seifert estimates each will be used about 15 plays a game
and only on third down or in obvious passing situations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have to set a realistic goal and then anything
beyond that is frosting on the cake,'' Seifert said. ''If we said
to ourselves we're going to play them 50-60 plays a game, that
probably would be counterproductive. If we can approach this as
more of a substitutional situation, it gives us an opportunity to
be successful.''

<HEADLINE> Experts: Concorde Engines in Probe  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW FORDAHL
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investigators looking into the Air France Concorde crash outside
Paris will focus on apparent engine problems at the supersonic
jet's most vulnerable stage of flight, aviation experts said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses reported at least one engine was on fire and spewing
smoke moments before the luxury jetliner slammed into a hotel and
restaurant in Gonesse, killing all 109 people on board and four
people on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears to be a problem with insufficient thrust, which
usually means a problem with the engines,'' said Michael Barr,
director of the aviation safety program at the University of
Southern California. ''It appears the airplane stalled.''
</P>
<P>
   A stall occurs when there is insufficient airspeed over the
wings to create the lift that sustains an aircraft's flight.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde crashed moments after taking off, when all
airplanes are most vulnerable. Once past the runway, an aborted
takeoff is impossible, the plane is loaded down with fuel and the
aircraft is moving slowly compared to cruising speed.
</P>
<P>
   Possible explanations for Tuesday's apparent engine fire range
from birds flying into the air intake to a mechanical failure. Most
jet engines can withstand bird collisions without catastrophic
explosion, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's possible that there was some kind of flashback condition
or some type of failure within the combustion section, or possibly
within the turbine section,'' said Ann Karagozian, an engineering
professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Concorde flies higher and faster than passenger
jetliners, its four Rolls-Royce Olympus engines do not differ
greatly from slower and lower-flying models on other commercial
jets.
</P>
<P>
   At supersonic speeds, air entering the Concorde's engines is
slowed down before it is combined with fuel and combusted for
thrust -- like other commercial jetliners.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde is the only commercial jetliner to use
afterburners, which provide extra thrust. Afterburners, which are
typically found on fighters, mixes warm air and fuel in the
tailpipe of the engine.
</P>
<P>
   Concordes take off at subsonic speeds and do not break the speed
of sound until they are over the ocean. Because of their unique
design, they do take off faster and steeper than other jets.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you build a wing that works well low-speed, it doesn't work
well at high-speed and vice versa,'' said William Waldock,
associate director for the Center for Aerospace Safety Education at
Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. ''Some airplane designs like
the F-14, it's a very fast airplane, but to be able to fly it at
low speeds, you have to move the wing.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Concorde pilot David Brister, who flew the aircraft from
1976 to 1982, said other aspects of its design may have made it
vulnerable to engine problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''Concorde is unusual in that the two engines on each wing are
very close together. Any four-engined aircraft can cope perfectly
well with losing one engine but if two go on the same side you can
be in for a difficult time,'' he said. ''But with Concorde the
engines are so close that it is possible one could affect the other
and then you have a much more serious situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the crash occurred on land, it will be easier to piece
together the wreckage compared with the 1996 crash of TWA Flight
800 and last year's Egypt Air disaster, both over the Atlantic, or
this year's Alaska Airlines crash off Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a lot they should be able to see in terms of what was
burned up within the engine,'' Karagozian said.

<HEADLINE> PT Cruiser Performs Poorly on Test  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG's popular PT Cruiser scored
poorly on a government crash test, but company officials insist the
retro-look wagon is safe.
</P>
<P>
   The 2001 model, an instant hit with consumers when it was
introduced in March, received two out of a possible five stars on a
test measuring risk for serious injury in a front driver-side
crash, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A two-star result represents a 36 percent to 45 percent chance
of a life-threatening injury for a person wearing a seat belt.
</P>
<P>
   The PT Cruiser scored better on other tests. It got four stars
for a front passenger side crash and the same score for a side
crash on the driver's side. It got a perfect rating on the rear
passenger's side crash test.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Reynolds, DaimlerChrysler's director of vehicle safety,
said the company expected at least a three-star rating on the front
driver-side test. He said the company tested more than 100 of the
PT Cruisers and is confident it is safe.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is important to keep this type of rating in perspective,''
he said. ''DaimlerChrysler emphasizes real-world safety, which goes
beyond a single laboratory test simulating a type of crash that
rarely occurs in real-life situations.''
</P>
<P>
   The government test involves running the vehicle into a wall at
35 mph. Each test vehicle carries two dummies, one in the driver's
seat and one in the front passenger seat, to measure the impact on
an average-size person.
</P>
<P>
   The PT (for Personal Transportation) Cruiser has a $16,500 base
price and costs $20,685 loaded. DaimlerChrysler sold 21,657 through
the end of June, although it had taken orders for more than 80,000
and raised prices in June as much as $1,000 for higher-end models.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler will build about 100,000 PT Cruisers this year, with
40,000 exported from the factory in Toluca, Mexico, to markets
around the world. The company plans to build about 180,000 a year
once production is up to full speed.

<HEADLINE> Aging rocker sets his sights on the Senate  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY PARELLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTCH PLAINS, N.J. (AP) - The wallpaper is peeling at the
campaign headquarters. Parts of the ceiling are falling down. And
the rooms are bare.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't bother Pat DiNizio. He has a song and a
crusade.
</P>
<P>
   The lead singer of the Jersey-based rock band The Smithereens,
DiNizio Tuesday launched his bid for the U.S. Senate seat being
vacated by retiring Sen. Frank Lautenberg.
</P>
<P>
   He made the announcement at his new - and modest - campaign
headquarters in Scotch Plains, his hometown. The 44-year-old rocker
gave a brief speech and sung a song called, ''I Believe,'' a tune
he calls his campaign theme song.
</P>
<P>
   The official candidate for the reform party, which helped
wrestler Jesse Ventura get elected governor of Minnesota - DiNizio
admits he's fighting a tough battle on a shoestring budget.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no money in this campaign,'' said DiNizio. ''We get
$10 contributions here, $20 contributions there.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a sharp contrast to his opponents, especially investment
banker Jon Corzine, who spent $36.7 million in the primary campaign
alone. The Republican candidate is U.S. Rep. Bob Franks, R-Union.
DiNizio is one of nine alternative party candidates who filed to
run for the Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   DiNizio wants to run a campaign for the people, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a crusade of the people against the corporate interests,
electing real working candidates who care about people and want to
serve,'' DiNizio said.
</P>
<P>
   His platform includes allowing voters to decide social issues,
such as abortion and gay marriages. He opposes gun control but
supports border control, saying immigration should be more
''measured.'' He favors less government and lower taxes.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to travel around the state, using his guitar to bring
his message to people. He hopes fans will host backyard concerts,
selling tickets to raise money, said Veronique Cordier, DiNizio's
publicist.
</P>
<P>
   DiNizio admits his bid for Senate is ''the craziest and most
ambitious thing I've ever attempted.'' But he said he was pushed to
it when watching the Clinton impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I actually cried watching it,'' he said. ''I saw how divided
this country was.''
</P>
<P>
   That division disturbs DiNizio. He hopes that by traveling
around, talking about the issues and playing some songs, he'll at
least get people talking - and maybe even registering to vote. He
says if he can accomplish that much, then it was worth his time.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, he logged 50,000 miles, traveling around the
country, on a solo, ''living room'' tour.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a great and interesting way to get people involved in the
political process,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithereens have been recording for 20 years. The band's
most popular hits were in the 1980s, with the songs ''A Girl Like
You'' and ''Blood and Roses.''
</P>
<P>
   DiNizio still tours with the band. They're playing this weekend
in California. The group released an album last fall called, ''God
Save the Smithereens.'' It hasn't sold very well, DiNizio said.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters say they back the 44-year-old rocker because of
his honesty and the way he stands for everyman.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a very honest, straight forward person,'' said Todd
Sinclair, a longtime fan who lives in Morris Plains. ''I think he's
a man of the people. He's not beholden to the politicians.''

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Hoards Pennies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alan Greenspan's secret is out. He hoards
pennies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I admit to the fact that I have a lot more pennies than I
probably should have,'' the Federal Reserve Chairman said Tuesday.
''That's because when you get change they end up there and you
don't know what to do with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan told the House Banking Committee that he wasn't the
only one hoarding pennies and other coins. He suggested the
country's good economic times are to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ''Perhaps it's the general level of prosperity that people
perceive coins are throwaways and they just sit there without
interest and the like,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   To meet the increased demand for pennies, the Philadelphia and
Denver Mints boosted production sharply last year and put their
facilities on 24-hour, six-day-a-week schedules.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Michael Castle, R-Del., chairman of a Banking
subcommittee that handles coin issues, appealed to Greenspan to see
what else could be done to get more supplies of coins to local
banks. The Fed distributes coins and paper currency to the banking
system.
</P>
<P>
   Castle told Greenspan that the Fed was currently allowing banks
to order just 50 percent of their normal orders for pennies and 80
percent of their normal orders for quarters. He said this has
created serious problems for local banks dealing with unhappy
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Castle said that the next new quarter to be issued in the
popular state series is New Hampshire on Aug. 7 and local banks
have not been able to receive assurances of adequate supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're people who are frustrated because they can't get them

are complaining vociferously about this to the Mint, to the
Treasury and to the Federal Reserve.''

<P>
   Greenspan assured Castle that officials at the Fed and the other
government agencies were aware of the problem and were trying to
arrive at a solution.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a problem which the Mint is struggling with mightily,''
Greenspan said.

<HEADLINE> Reformist Iranian Paper To Close  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Authorities in Iran on Tuesday ordered a
reformist newspaper closed, only four weeks after the weekly began
publishing, the Islamic Republic News Agency and an official at the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Goonagoon was the latest to be closed after the
hard-line judiciary shut down 19 other papers -- all but one
pro-reform -- since April amid a power struggle between conservative
clerics in Iran's Islamic government and proponents of change.
</P>
<P>
   The Farsi-language Goonagoon was ordered closed by the judiciary
and its staff were told to remove their belongings before the
building was sealed, said the paper official, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Goonagoon, or Diverse, was publishing from the same building as
the reformist Asr-e-Azadegan, which was also closed down in the
media crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Except for its managing director, Goonagoon's staff was made up
of Asr-e-Azadegan's editors and writers.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-line crackdown on newspapers came in apparent backlash
to the overwhelming victory of reform candidates in February
parliamentary elections. Hard-liners have also jailed several
reformist writers and political activists.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Dairy Doctors Target Milk Ads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A group of doctors opposed to dairy products
wants the government to investigate health claims in the milk
industry's ''Got Milk?'' advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine said it will
file a petition with the Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday
questioning whether milk is as good for people as the ads say it
is.
</P>
<P>
   The ads feature a variety of celebrities, including singer
Britney Spears, a favorite of teen-age girls.
</P>
<P>
   ''Britney's ad might as well be captioned, 'Oops, I did it again
-- sold out for an unhealthy product,''' says Neal D. Barnard,
president of the doctors' group.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, his organization was unsuccessful in stopping
the Clinton administration from releasing the government's revised
dietary guidelines. The group claimed that the advisory group that
wrote the revision was biased toward the dairy industry.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for the dairy industry organization that sponsors the
ads were not immediately available for comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   An animal-rights group, People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals, also has taken aim at the ads.
</P>
<P>
   PETA tried a ''Got Beer?'' ad campaign that encouraged college
students to switch from milk to beer, and later targeted teens with
an ad that asked: ''Got Zits?'' That ad claimed that diary products
cause acne.

<HEADLINE> Rival Proposals on Jerusalem  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   President Clinton called Jerusalem the most difficult
problem at
the Camp David summit. Rival proposals could not be bridged.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat took the position that East
Jerusalem was occupied land, and should be transferred to
Palestinian control under U.N. Security Council resolutions adopted
after the 1967 and 1973 Mideast wars.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat wanted Palestinian sovereignty over the Old City,
intending it to be the capital of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   He was prepared to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the
western half of the city.

<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak insisted Jerusalem would not
be divided. He offered the Palestinians sovereignty over Muslim
holy sites and control over some Palestinian neighborhoods in the
eastern half of the city.

<HEADLINE> Sprinter Johnson Backs Off Comments  </HEADLINE>
By JIM VERTUNO
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- For a world-champion sprinter, Michael
Johnson is backpedaling pretty fast.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who bowed out of the U.S. Olympic trials last week with
a severe leg cramp during the 200-meter final, is backing off
statements he would never run the distance again.
</P>
<P>
   His coach, Clyde Hart, also chimed in, saying Johnson was
probably finished with the race this year but could run it in years
to come.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Johnson said on NBColympics.com he was finished with
the event in which he owns the Olympic goal medal and world record
at 19.32 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing for me to gain from it, so no more 200s for
me,'' Johnson said. ''There's no reason for me to run 200s.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, however, USA Today quoted Johnson as backtracking on
his earlier statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not saying I've totally retired from the 200,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman at Johnson's publicist's office said the sprinter
had returned home to Dallas and was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   But his coach said Johnson could be back in the 200 in years to
come.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel confident we will not run any more 200s this year but
forever is a long time,'' Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   Hart said Johnson's original declaration of quitting the 200 was
likely the result of frustration over the publicity surrounding his
ballyhooed matchup with Maurice Greene and the failure to qualify
in the event for the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it was a heat-of-the-moment thing. The trash talking --
he just doesn't like that,'' said Hart, noting that the 32-year-old
Johnson is still in prime racing form in the 200. ''He's run more
sub-20s this year than he has in his lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Johnson wanted to run a 200 again this year, he has no
reason to, Hart said. Johnson qualified to defend his 400-meter
title at the Olympics in September and will concentrate on that
distance, the coach said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The 200 is not something we've got to do to run 400s,'' Hart
said.
</P>
<P>
   The coach said Johnson will likely return to training for the
Olympics next week. He trains with Hart at Baylor University in
Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said on the Web site he is looking forward to defending
the 400 gold medal at the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Sydney will be a lot more fun now,'' he said. ''Not
because there's nobody in the 400 that can run with me. It'll be a
lot more fun because I don't have to be in the center of some kind
of matchup or showdown that turns silly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like matchups and showdowns, but when they turn silly, like
they always seem to do, I don't want anything to do with that.
That's not fun.''

<HEADLINE> 13 Killed in Jordan Plane Crash  </HEADLINE>
By JAMAL HALA
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- A military plane crashed Tuesday, killing
13 soldiers, including members on an elite army unit, a military
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-made C-130 transport crashed during a training flight
because of a technical fault, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The crash occurred at 6 a.m. near the desert village of Dabaan,
29 miles east of the Jordanian capital Amman, a military official
said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The army sealed off roads leading to the village, which lies on
a highway that leads to the Iraqi and Syrian borders.
</P>
<P>
   The military official said the Royal Air Force plane reported a
technical failure before it crashed, killing all on board.
</P>
<P>
   Other military officials, also insisting on anonymity, said the
victims included members of the army's elite Special Operations
Unit.
</P>
<P>
   The C-130 is one of a dozen military cargo planes that the
United States gave to Jordan in 1996 as a reward for signing a
peace treaty with Israel two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The crash is the third in Jordan this year. A Turkish pilot
flying a Jordanian attack helicopter crashed over the central
desert April 12 during joint military exercises.
</P>
<P>
   Two months earlier, a U.S. Marine Corps helicopter crashed
during a training flight over a desert area in central Jordan. The
two-man crew survived unharmed.

<HEADLINE> Historic home to join women's rights national park  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Hunt House, where the first women's rights
convention was planned, can become part of the Women's Rights
National Historical Park, under legislation that passed in the
House Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The bill allows the National Park Service to acquire the house
in Waterloo, N.Y. - opening it up for public tours and special
events along with the rest of the park.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Thomas Reynolds, a Republican, whose western New York
district contains Hunt House, sponsored the bill in the House.
</P>
<P>
   He urged his colleagues ''to support the preservation of
American history.''
</P>
<P>
   Such legislation has already passed in the Senate, sponsored by
New York Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan called the Hunt House ''a monument to our founding
mothers.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The house deserves this happy news,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was at a tea hosted by Richard and Jane Hunt in July 1848
that Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott and other early women's
rights activists hatched the idea of holding a women's rights
convention. Following the meeting, the women drafted the
groundbreaking Declaration of Sentiments. That manifesto was
presented at the Women's Rights Convention in Seneca Falls, N.Y.
later that month.
</P>
<P>
   The house was privately owned until 1999 when the National Trust
for Historic Preservation purchased it. They have been leasing it
to the Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton must still sign off on the bill.

<HEADLINE> Barak Tired To Placate Rightists  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREDERICK, Md. (AP) -- Ehud Barak strode into the news
conference, looking every inch the army general he once was, taking
the microphone just as Israel's prime-time news shows were ready to
cut to him live.
</P>
<P>
   His audience: virtually everyone in Israel. His message: that he
had held the line on issues most crucial to his nation's security --
but also that he stands ready to give peace another try.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three leaders at Camp David -- President Clinton,
Palestinian Authority head Yasser Arafat, and Barak -- the Israeli
prime minister had carry out perhaps the most delicately nuanced
damage control when the 2-week-old summit abruptly fell apart
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Barak arrived at Camp David harried and humbled by right-wing
political opponents contending he was ready to concede far too much
to the Palestinians. His governing coalition fell apart the day
before he left, and he only narrowly survived a no-confidence
motion practically as he boarded his plane to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The summit's failure gives Barak plenty of ammunition to assert
that he had not been willing to give the Palestinians too much. At
the same time, though, the prime minister -- who took power only a
year ago on a peace platform -- had to explain why talks had failed
to a country where most people had hoped for a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Looking straight into the cameras, Barak spoke in Hebrew for
eight minutes without a pause, directly addressing those at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I worked throughout the summit out of an obligation that was
moral and personal ... to do all that was possible to bring an end
to the conflict,'' he said, in a voice that occasionally cracked,
betraying the unrelenting tension of the past 14 days.
</P>
<P>
   As he often does in a crisis, Barak invoked his past as army
chief of staff and Israel's most decorated soldier.
</P>
<P>
   ''My entire life I have fought for the security of Israel, and
during these days I say again, we will not agree to concede on
Israel's essential interests,'' he said, chopping his hand for
emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   That said, he insisted he is not ready to abandon peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''The summit was an essential stepping stone and part of
intensive, far-reaching negotiations to reach a framework for a
final peace deal with the Palestinians,'' Barak said. As for peace
prospects now, ''I see it as my most important responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as he signaled firmness in protecting Israel's interests,
Barak appeared to be preparing his public for the possibility of
future concessions on Jerusalem, the most explosive issue addressed
at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Since winning the eastern part of Jerusalem from Jordan in 1967,
Israel always has insisted it will never share sovereignty over the
city. It was clear, however, that summit discussions envisioned
some form of Palestinian control in the city's Arab neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Barak spoke, without elaborating, of having been ready to
''touch the most sensitive nerve.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came another delicate task: rebuking Arafat for
intransigence at the summit, while reaching out to him anew as a
peace partner.
</P>
<P>
   Barak squarely blamed the Palestinian leader for the talks'
collapse, saying Arafat ''was wary of making the historic decisions
needed ... to end the conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's painful to realize the other side is not ripe for
peace,'' he said pointedly.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak quickly turned to talk of another summit after the two
sides have time to reflect.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he would leave ''no stone unturned'' in the quest for an
agreement, Barak counseled: ''We should not lose hope. The dream of
peace is not dead.''

<HEADLINE> Central Park reopens after spraying for virus-carrying mosquitoes  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE ROTH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Bill Fuller waited eight hours to get a front
row seat to the New York Philharmonic's free performance in Central
Park - only to be turned away Monday evening because of West Nile
spraying.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he patiently waited for hours - all over again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was seething mad last night, but in retrospect, I guess they
did the right thing by canceling the performance. This morning I
got here at 9 a.m., and I'm looking forward to a wonderful
evening,'' said Fuller, 54, a Manhattan real estate agent.
</P>
<P>
   The Philharmonic performance typically draws 30,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The 843-acre park reopened Tuesday morning after spraying for
mosquitoes bearing the West Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   Although Adams said concert turnout by Tuesday afternoon seemed
small in comparison to the same time on Monday, he and other New
Yorkers flocked back to Central Park, confidently walking dogs,
riding bikes, or just hanging out.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not pleased about the chemicals, but the alternative,
particularly for the elderly and the very young, made using them a
justifiable risk,'' said Rick Adams, 52, a city planner who was
sorely disappointed by Monday's postponement.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he and his daughter, Rosalind, played Frisbee to
pass the time as they waited for the evening concert.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll probably be wearing bug spray, just in case,'' said
Rosalind, 13.
</P>
<P>
   Virus-carrying mosquitoes have been found in the park and on
Staten Island. The city is expanding spraying across the city,
using the synthetic pesticides Sumithrin and Resmethrin, which can
cause breathing problems for the elderly and people with
respiratory ailments.
</P>
<P>
   ''The risk of spraying is very, very small, if not
infinitesimal, and (unlike West Nile virus) doesn't include the
chance of death,'' Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And many people seemed to have taken his advice to heart.
</P>
<P>
   Martin and Susan Goetz and their two daughters, visiting from
Jacksonville, Fla., never thought twice about their decision to
enjoy an afternoon of rowing in the park on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It didn't stop our trip. It's a beautiful day and I think the
chances of being infected by the virus - or harmed by the spray -
is very, very small,'' Martin Goetz said confidently after helping
his wife and daughters out of the rowboat.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery marked the first time this year that the
potentially deadly virus has been found in mosquitoes in New York
City. Earlier this summer, the virus was found in birds and
mosquitoes in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Rockland County announced on Tuesday the discovery of its first
infected mosquitoes and said it would expand its spraying program
to include parts of the Town of Ramapo, near where the mosquitoes
were found.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the virus killed seven people and infected 62 others
in the metropolitan area. In the most serious cases, it can result
in encephalitis, or swelling of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   To staunch a new outbreak this year, the city embarked on a
program of trapping and testing mosquitoes, placing flocks of
sentinel chickens around the city to detect the presence of the
virus early and placing mosquito larvae-eating fish in water
treatment plants.
</P>
<P>
   Much of upper Manhattan was to be sprayed on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   On Long Island, the Suffolk County Department of Public Works
planned to continue mosquito spraying Tuesday night in the Fire
Island community of Point O' Woods. Spraying was also scheduled
Wednesday for Ocean Bay Park, Summer Club and Davis Park, also on
Fire Island.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, spraying was to be done starting at 8 p.m. over
a two-mile radius covering parts of Stamford, New Canaan and
Darien.

<HEADLINE> Oil Cos. Sue Gov't for Blocked Gas  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three oil companies have filed suit in federal
court accusing the government of creating regulatory roadblocks
that prevent them from developing gas reserves on leases purchased
nearly 20 years ago in the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, said the
government has failed to provide ''timely and fair review'' of the
development plans and seeks compensation for the lease purchases,
exploratory costs and other expenses associated with the project.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed by production subsidiaries of Chevron Corp.,
Conoco Inc., and Murphy Oil Corp., which are involved in the
natural gas development project 25 miles off the Florida coast.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists and the state of Florida have strongly opposed
the development of the leases, purchased by the three companies in
the early 1980s for $10.5 million. The companies have sunk three
exploratory wells at an estimated cost of $125 million.
</P>
<P>
   After Florida took action to block the leases, the companies
appealed the matter to the Commerce Department, which is still
considering it.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department said last month it would not make a
decision until after the Environmental Protection Agency approves
environmental permits. But the EPA last year told the companies it
would not resume work on the permits until the Commerce Department
acts, according to Chevron.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit calls this a ''regulatory Catch-22'' that amounts to
a breach of the lease contracts between the government and the
three companies and an unconstitutional taking of property.
</P>
<P>
   ''This lawsuit was brought because the federal government
refused to honor its contractual commitments by creating a
regulatory and administrative blockage that breached the leases,''
Michael Smith, Chevron's associate general counsel, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The offshore leases are part of the Destin Dome 56 Field about
25 miles south of Pensacola, Fla., which contains an estimated 2.6
trillion cubic feet of natural gas, according to the Energy
Department.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays' Rothschild Suspended  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Tampa Bay Devil Rays manager Larry Rothschild
will wait until Wednesday to decide whether he'll appeal a two-game
suspension for bumping an umpire and arguing excessively.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a little more than I thought,'' Rothschild said of the
penalty before Tuesday's game against the Detroit Tigers. ''I need
to think it over before I make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The suspension, announced Tuesday along with a fine, is to start
Wednesday at Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Rothschild's arm struck plate umpire Laz Diaz during a July 18
game. Both benches emptied after Atlanta's Greg Maddux hit Tampa
Bay's Jose Canseco with a pitch in the ninth inning of the Braves'
8-2 win.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco shouted at Diaz as the umpire escorted him toward first
base and Rothschild made contact during an argument over whether
Maddux hit Canseco intentionally.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was wrong in bumping the umpire,'' Rothschild said, but
added that he still thinks Maddux intentionally hit Felix Martinez
in the fifth inning before plunking Canseco.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the manager said, ''the umpire told me he was just
throwing inside, but I have a hard time believing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothschild was ejected.

<HEADLINE> Labor rallies for McGreevey, Democrats  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - More than 200 people rallied inside a hotel
Tuesday for Woodbridge Mayor Jim McGreevey, who had been considered
the Democratic party's likely nominee for governor until U.S. Sen.
Robert Torricelli announced last week he may run.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of primarily labor union members at the Robert Treat
Hotel waved signs supporting McGreevey and other Democratic
candidates for office this year, including Vice President Al Gore
and U.S. Senate candidate Jon Corzine.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a grass-roots Essex rally to muster support and deliver
the message that the citizens of New Jersey want a governor they
can trust,'' McGreevey said after the rally.
</P>
<P>
   McGreevey has been preparing to run for governor in 2001 since
his narrow 1997 loss to Gov. Christie Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli, D-N.J., said last week he would consider running for
governor. Last Friday, 10 prominent Democrats from southern New
Jersey, including Atlantic City Mayor Jim Whelan and retired
Congressman William J. Hughes, said they supported Torricelli.
</P>
<P>
   McGreevey said Tuesday's rally was not a response to
Torricelli's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor's office ought to be more than one person's
political ambition,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Glickman Trusts Meat Inspection  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman expressed
confidence Tuesday in an experimental meat inspection system
despite an appellate court's ruling that it illegally gave too much
responsibility to processors.
</P>
<P>
   ''We certainly don't want to give up on it. We think it has a
great opportunity to improve food safety,'' Glickman said
</P>
<P>
   Under the new system, USDA inspectors are leaving it to plant
employees to do the traditional poke-and-sniff method of inspecting
animal carcasses and are instead doing more testing for microbes
and sampling for fecal contamination.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors union sued to stop the project, and a three-judge
panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
agreed last month that USDA inspectors are required by law to do
hands-on checks of animal carcasses.
</P>
<P>
   USDA officials say that's a waste of their inspectors' time
because harmful microbes can't be detected by sight.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman said the administration had not decided how to respond
to the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact of the matter is that the seeing, smelling, sniffing
and poking system is not the exclusive way that we ought to do food
safety in the future ... You can't catch E. coli, listeria or
salmonella by doing that alone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The union says USDA is allowing the industry to police itself.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman said the department needed to ''do a better job of
communicating'' with its inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Test results from seven poultry plants now using the system
indicated that rates of disease, fecal contamination and salmonella
are down on average, USDA says. Results from nine additional plants
are due later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no way we would take USDA's word for it until we
looked behind the data,'' said Felicia Nestor of the Government
Accountability Project, an advocacy group that supports the union.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 15; Nasdaq Gains 48  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks edged higher Tuesday after some strong
second-quarter earnings reports gave technology issues a boost and
overshadowed investors' latest qualms about inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But there was little conviction in the market, and stocks traded
in a narrow range throughout the session. Analysts predicted the
trend would continue until more detailed economic data is released
later this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 14.85 to 10,699.97.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also rose. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 10.18 at 1,474.47, and the Nasdaq composite index
gained 48.00 at 4,029.57.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, up 0.437 cents at $33.75, and Texas Instruments, up $2.938
at $67.438, beat Wall Street earnings forecasts and gave a boost to
other high-tech stocks. The results helped offset reports of a
still-robust economy that made investors uneasy about inflation and
the possibility of higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Realtors said existing home sales
rose 2.8 percent in June, surprising economists who had expected
sales to drop. Higher housing sales could signal that the U.S.
economy is still surging, which could prompt Federal Reserve
policymakers to raise interest rates again when they meet next
month.
</P>
<P>
   And the Conference Board said Tuesday its Consumer Confidence
Index rose, suggesting that consumers are optimistic about future
economic growth. Most analysts were expecting a decline in the
index.
</P>
<P>
   The reports left investors unsure about the direction of rates.
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony before a House committee
Tuesday offered little new information about which way the central
bank is leaning. Greenspan said economic reports due later this
week will help determine whether the Fed will further tighten
credit.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Greenspan told a Senate panel that inflation appeared
to be under control and he hinted the Fed might leave interest
rates alone for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is still looking for some guidance and not getting
it in terms of reaction to earnings,'' said Barry Hyman, chief
market strategist for Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. ''We are still
looking for some definitive answers on whether the economy is
indeed slowing.''
</P>
<P>
   He said stocks rose well in the weeks before earnings season,
and investors are selling on the largely positive profit reports.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looked like a lackluster session with not much in the way
of any upswing or downswing,'' said Bryan Piskorowski, market
analyst with Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   While consumer confidence and housing numbers could be seen as
inflationary, Piskorowski said traders will pay more attention to
gross domestic product and employment cost data coming out later
this week. ''Once we see those numbers, we will have a clearer idea
where the Fed stands.''
</P>
<P>
   Some tech stocks that got a boost Tuesday were Applied
Materials, up $4 to $84.50, Sun Microsystems, up $8.562 to $109 and
Intel, up $2.875 to $140.875.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceutical stocks also drew investors' attention. Pfizer,
down $4 to $43.50, announced earnings late Monday that beat
projections by a penny, but flat Viagra sales raised some concern
among analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Schering-Plough, maker of allergy pill Claritin, and Pharmacia,
maker of arthritis drug Celebrex, both met forecasts Tuesday.
Shares of Schering-Plough fell $1.953 cents to $43.313 and
Pharmacia rose $3.109 to $55.625.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers had a tough time Tuesday. Kmart fell 0.188 cents to
$6.875 after it said it was closing 72 stores and would miss year
2000 earnings forecasts. Circuit City lost $6.375 to $26.25 after
it announced it was quitting the appliance business to concentrate
on electronics and home-office products.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume came to 1.17
billion shares, up from Monday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 0.08 to 514.33.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.16 percent,
Germany's DAX index gained 0.10 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose
.15 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 0.59 percent.

<HEADLINE> Albright To Make Trip to Asia  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Collapse of the Mideast summit Tuesday put
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright back on schedule for a trip
to Southeast Asia and a historic meeting with her North Korean
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said arrangements for a meeting with Foreign Minister
Paek Nam-Sun were being made and she hoped it could take place. If
it doesn't, she said, it would be because of scheduling problems,
not for lack of intention.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea had agreed to the meeting. It would be the
highest-level U.S. contact since the Korean War split the peninsula
a half-century ago. U.S.-North Korean relations have warmed since
North and South Korean leaders met last month.
</P>
<P>
   Albright may also go to Japan but canceled a planned stopover in
Cambodia. She canceled a trip to the economic summit conference in
Okinawa last weekend to remain at the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations at Camp David, Md.
</P>
<P>
   After stops in Hawaii and Guam, she was expected to arrive in
Bangkok early Friday for a meeting of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations. She also planed meetings with other regional foreign
minister, as well as Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, also at
the ASEAN meetings.
</P>
<P>
   On the North Korean session, she told reporters, ''It's
obviously a preliminary kind of meeting to make very clear our
concerns about missile and nuclear issues and how to have them meet
our concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   A key issue with Paek will be a North Korean proposal that
Russian President Vladimir Putin relayed to President Clinton
during last weekend's G-8 summit in Japan. Putin said North Korea
offered to abandon its missile program if other nations would
provide it with rockets to launch satellites.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials expressed skepticism about such an offer, but
said it needed further clarification and exploration.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Camp David talks collapsed, Albright had intended to
take over from Clinton for a day as mediator between Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Clinton
had planned a day trip to Arkansas even if the talks had continued.

<HEADLINE> State sues federal government over Medicare reimbursements  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) - Connecticut has filed a class action
lawsuit against two federal agencies in a dispute over Medicare
reimbursements for the care of people who receive both state
Medicaid and federal Medicare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Under current policy, the state pays the medical bills of those
patients under the Medicaid program, then seeks reimbursement from
Medicare for some of those costs.
</P>
<P>
   But the state claims the federal government is allowing private
agencies that provide in-home health care to avoid liability if
they do not file for Medicare reimbursements - sticking the state
with the entire bill.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut officials say the policy is forcing the state
Medicaid program to recoup the costs from the patients.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's office and three Medicare beneficiaries
are suing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the
Health Care Financing Administration in U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
   The three patients in the lawsuit are represented by the Center
for Medicare Advocacy in Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   One of the patients, whom officials would not name, will be
responsible for almost $54,000 in Medicaid payments the state
provided for her care because a home health care agency did not
submit Medicare claims, the advocacy group said.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said the lawsuit was
filed as a last resort after months of negotiations with federal
officials failed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The federal government owes the state of Connecticut money for
Medicare reimbursements,'' Blumenthal said. ''State taxpayers and
Medicare beneficiaries should not have to pay for benefits that are
clearly and rightfully covered by Medicare, whose payment is the
responsibility of the federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's office could not say how much money the
state was owed by Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 50,000 people eligible for both programs in
Connecticut, and about 7 million nationally.

<HEADLINE> Clintons travel to Arkansas for Blair memorial  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID A. LIEB
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Cinton helped direct a
memorial service Tuesday for a former professor who was a friend
and adviser to President Clinton through his political career.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Divers Blair died June 26 of lung cancer. She was 61.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't know anyone who tried harder or succeeded more at the
art of living,'' Mrs. Clinton said in the service, held at the
Walton Arts Center near the University of Arkansas campus.
''Somehow, Diane squeezed more out of her too-brief life than any
of us could have done in 300 or 400 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton recalled how Mrs. Blair would write letters to her
addressed to ''Sparkle Plenty'' to lift her spirits, or enclose
vitamins with other notes and sign them, ''Nurse Fuzzy-Wuzzy.''
</P>
<P>
   She also recalled ''incredibly oversized and unattractive
glasses'' that Mrs. Blair wore, her skill at needlepoint and tennis
and cooking, and her love of books and birds. Mrs. Clinton also
introduced a 30-minute-long video with tributes to Mrs. Blair.
</P>
<P>
   The video included quotes from an interview conducted with Mrs.
Blair on May 4 in which she referred to the first lady as ''like a
sister.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also was scheduled to speak, as were former U.S. Sens.
Dale Bumpers and David Pryor, both D-Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton presided over Blair's wedding in 1979 to Jim Blair, now
retired as Tyson Foods Inc.'s general counsel. The Blairs'
relationship with the Clintons drew scrutiny after it was reported
that Jim Blair helped Mrs. Clinton make $100,000 off a $1,000
commodities investment.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Seven glass jars that may have been placed by
opponents of an animal genetics meeting contained enough cyanide to
sicken people, but not enough to kill, the FBI said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Special Agent Paul McCabe said two of three batches of chemicals
in the jars had been tested, and a third round was pending.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the levels (of cyanide) present, it is not a serious health
concern,'' McCabe said. Cyanide can be poisonous and explosive at
higher concentrations.
</P>
<P>
   The jars were found in three sites in downtown Minneapolis on
Monday, a day when police clashed violently with people
demonstrating against the International Society for Animal
Genetics. Seventy-one people were arrested, though no major
injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   The scene outside the downtown hotel hosting the convention was
quiet the day after Monday's clashes. The six-day conference ends
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators did not tie the jars directly to protesters, but
said there was evidence linking them. At a McDonald's Restaurant
where the contents of one jar were poured on the floor, a message
was left referring to the geneticists' conference, McCabe said.
</P>
<P>
   Minneapolis Mayor Sharon Sayles-Belton told WMNN radio there are
two kinds of protesters in town: ''Those who are protesting
legitimately and others who may be quite willing to put the lives
of other people at risk,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A voice mailbox for GrainRAGE, a group opposed to biotechnology
that was organizing some of the protesters, was full Tuesday and
unable to accept a phone message.
</P>
<P>
   About 650 scientists attended the meeting to exchange research
and information in workshops and seminars. ISAG is one of the
world's most prominent groups that shares information on the gene
mapping of livestock and pets, used to enhance their health and
resistance to disease.
</P>
<P>
   Activists say genetic engineering threatens biodiversity,
constitutes ''playing God'' and could pollute delicate ecosystems
or create a society in which corporations and the government
control what kinds of animals and humans are born.

<HEADLINE> Judge blocks Milan's appointment of municipal judge  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - A Camden County Superior Court judge Tuesday
barred Camden's city attorney from assuming the position of
municipal court judge, saying the mayor did not have the authority
to single-handedly give him the job.
</P>
<P>
   Assignment Judge Francis J. Orlando issued a temporary
restraining order preventing John A. Misci Jr. from becoming a
judge until his nomination is approved by City Council and until he
is sworn in by a state Superior Court judge.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Milton Milan on Monday, without notifying Council members
or state officials who are overseeing the city, nominated Misci to
the post of presiding judge, then quietly administered the oath of
office.
</P>
<P>
   This is the latest confrontation between Milan, who faces
federal corruption charges, and several members of the Council,
who've criticized him for overstepping his authority.
</P>
<P>
   Milan appointed Misci, 36, to replace Judge James W. Faison III,
whose three-year term expired Monday. Faison is the son of Council
President Gwendolyn Faison.
</P>
<P>
   But Orlando, who convened a hearing Tuesday because he was
concerned that Misci's appointment was not handled properly, said
City Council still must approve the nomination and a Superior Court
judge, not the mayor, must swear him in.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not want to be faced with the specter of having hundreds
of cases decided and then ultimately decisions perhaps being
questioned as to whether or not the individual was appropriately
appointed,'' Orlando said.
</P>
<P>
   First Assistant City Attorney Marc Riondino said the mayor had
the authority to administer the oath of office to Misci and to make
the appointment, despite the fact that the state is overseeing the
city's finances, hiring and firing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the city's position that the city does not need the
approval of the state for a judicial appointment,'' he said.
''Their supervision is related to finances. There's no financial
impact here.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a long tradition in New Jersey of self-rule,''
Riondino said. ''The mayor is CEO of Camden and he makes the
appointments.''
</P>
<P>
   But several state officials who attended the hearing maintained
that the mayor overstepped his authority.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as we're concerned, the action that the mayor can take
is to nominate Mr. Misci,'' said Deputy Attorney General Daniel P.
Reynolds. ''It doesn't take effect until Council has approved it
and he is administered the oath of office by a Superior Court
judge.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If a municipal attorney was going to be made a municipal
judge, he should at least be familiar with the procedures used for
that appointment,'' said Ulrich ''Al'' Steinberg, director of the
state Division of Local Government Services, which is overseeing
the city's operations.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Gilbert ''Whip'' Wilson said he would oppose Misci's
appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if Mr. Misci is even qualified to hold the
position, especially as chief judge. I'm concerned whether he could
hold the judge's job in Mayberry. I have no confidence in him,''
Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said the Council will vote Thursday on a resolution to
remove Misci and Riondino from their jobs in the city attorney's
office. The resolution questions their handling of a $215 million
deal with a company running the city's water and sewer systems and
their management of personnel, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Riondino said Milan would call a special Council meeting to vote
on Misci's nomination. He did not know when that hearing would be
held.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the city operations, the state is monitoring the
city's police force and the county is overseeing the city
prosecutor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Milan is accused in a federal indictment of fraud, conspiracy to
solicit and accept bribes, wire and mail fraud and conspiracy to
launder money.
</P>
<P>
   Milan allegedly accepted cash bribes, vacations, automobiles and
home improvement work from city vendors or prospective vendors.

<HEADLINE> Jury clears Diallo cop in 1997 case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A federal jury has found that one of the police
officers acquitted in the slaying of Amadou Diallo should not be
held liable for a separate fatal shooting in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Eight jurors deliberated less than two hours in Brooklyn federal
court Tuesday before siding with defendant Kenneth Boss, who had
been named in a $155 million wrongful death lawsuit brought by the
family of Patrick Bailey. Also cleared were another officer, the
city and the Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleged that Bailey was unarmed when Boss shot and
killed him during a 1997 standoff. The plaintiffs claimed a shotgun
found at the scene was not Bailey's.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're really disappointed,'' Charles Barron, a spokesman for
the Bailey family said of the verdict. ''Where do we get justice?''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Brounstein, who represented Boss in the Diallo case,
suggested the plaintiffs had sought to capitalize on the officer's
notoriety, ''and it just didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Boss and three other plainclothes officers were acquitted
earlier this year of second-degree murder in the slaying of Diallo,
a 22-year-old street vendor from Guinea, in West Africa. The
officers, mistakenly thinking Diallo had a gun, fired 41 shots at
him, hitting him 19 times.
</P>
<P>
   The Diallo case sparked civil unrest and allegations that white
officers have abused their authority in other cases, including that
of Bailey, who was black.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes declined to
prosecute Boss in the Bailey shooting, saying ''there is no
credible view of the evidence which would support criminal
charges.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a report by Hynes' office, the incident began when
Bailey, 22, pointed a sawed-off shotgun at another man during a
dispute outside a Halloween party. When uniformed officers arrived
and ordered Bailey to stop, he fled into a house.
</P>
<P>
   Boss chased Bailey into a stairwell, where Bailey turned and
pointed the gun at him, the report said. The officer fired his
pistol three times, striking Bailey in the thigh and buttocks.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey died at a hospital after losing too much blood. Police
recovered the shotgun, which was unloaded and inoperable.

<HEADLINE> Trump Plaza guard: Former colleague slammed victim into door  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - A Trump Plaza Hotel &AMP; Casino security
guard testified Tuesday that she saw a fellow guard attack an
unruly gambler in a security office.
</P>
<P>
   She also told jurors that a superior warned her not to give
police a statement about the actions of guard Mark Petty because it
would send Petty to jail and probably cost her her job.
</P>
<P>
   Petty, 37, of Galloway Township, is charged with aggravated
manslaughter and four counts of witness tampering in the Sept. 8,
1998 death of Hue To, 25, of Plainfield.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say To was ejected from the casino for panhandling
near a poker table. He was taken to the casino's security office,
where witnesses say the burly 240-pound Petty kicked 5-foot-1 inch
To and threw him into a door.
</P>
<P>
   Ida Diaz, 34, of Vineland, who saw part of the confrontation,
testified Tuesday that To was out of control when he was brought
into the security office by a third guard.
</P>
<P>
   Petty went to the other guard's aid, attempting to subdue To,
Diaz said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mark was yelling at the guy and the gentleman was still
mouthing off,'' Diaz said. ''He slammed him into the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty's lawyer, Edwin Jacobs Jr., contends that To's death was a
freak accident. Petty used as much force as he needed to control To
and protect himself and other guards, Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   Petty allegedly persuaded four other guards to lie for him to
cover up the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Waldron, 51, of Egg Harbor Township, an investigator for
Trump Plaza, is charged with witness tampering for allegedly
telling Diaz and three other guards to lie to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Waldron told Diaz that if Diaz gave a statement to police,
''That Mark would be charged with murder and that we'd all be
fired,'' Diaz testified Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Petty faces 10 to 30 years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Barak Tries To Placate Rightists  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREDERICK, Md. (AP) -- Ehud Barak strode into the news
conference, looking every inch the army general he once was, taking
the microphone just as Israel's prime-time news shows were ready to
cut to him live.
</P>
<P>
   His audience: virtually everyone in Israel. His message: that he
had held the line on issues most crucial to his nation's security --
but also that he stands ready to give peace another try.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three leaders at Camp David -- President Clinton,
Palestinian Authority head Yasser Arafat, and Barak -- the Israeli
prime minister had to carry out perhaps the most delicately nuanced
damage control when the 2-week-old summit abruptly fell apart
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Barak arrived at Camp David harried and humbled by right-wing
political opponents contending he was ready to concede far too much
to the Palestinians. His governing coalition fell apart the day
before he left, and he only narrowly survived a no-confidence
motion practically as he boarded his plane to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The summit's failure gives Barak plenty of ammunition to assert
that he had not been willing to give the Palestinians too much. At
the same time, though, the prime minister -- who took power only a
year ago on a peace platform -- had to explain why talks had failed
to a country where most people had hoped for a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Looking straight into the cameras, Barak spoke in Hebrew for
eight minutes without a pause, directly addressing those at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I worked throughout the summit out of an obligation that was
moral and personal ... to do all that was possible to bring an end
to the conflict,'' he said, in a voice that occasionally cracked,
betraying the unrelenting tension of the past 14 days.
</P>
<P>
   As he often does in a crisis, Barak invoked his past as army
chief of staff and Israel's most decorated soldier.
</P>
<P>
   ''My entire life I have fought for the security of Israel, and
during these days I say again, we will not agree to concede on
Israel's essential interests,'' he said, chopping his hand for
emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   That said, he insisted he is not ready to abandon peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''The summit was an essential stepping stone and part of
intensive, far-reaching negotiations to reach a framework for a
final peace deal with the Palestinians,'' Barak said. As for peace
prospects now, ''I see it as my most important responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as he signaled firmness in protecting Israel's interests,
Barak appeared to be preparing his public for the possibility of
future concessions on Jerusalem, the most explosive issue addressed
at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Since winning the eastern part of Jerusalem from Jordan in 1967,
Israel always has insisted it will never share sovereignty over the
city. It was clear, however, that summit discussions envisioned
some form of Palestinian control in the city's Arab neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Barak spoke, without elaborating, of having been ready to
''touch the most sensitive nerve.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came another delicate task: rebuking Arafat for
intransigence at the summit, while reaching out to him anew as a
peace partner.
</P>
<P>
   Barak squarely blamed the Palestinian leader for the talks'
collapse, saying Arafat ''was wary of making the historic decisions
needed ... to end the conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's painful to realize the other side is not ripe for
peace,'' he said pointedly.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak quickly turned to talk of another summit after the two
sides have time to reflect.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he would leave ''no stone unturned'' in the quest for an
agreement, Barak counseled: ''We should not lose hope. The dream of
peace is not dead.''

<HEADLINE> Police say neighbor blackmailed man over frozen mother's remains  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FORT PLAIN, N.Y. (AP) - Officials on Tuesday confirmed the
dismembered body discovered in a chest-type freezer in a duplex
apartment belonged to an 82-year-old woman who shared the home with
her son.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor now charged with extorting approximately $20,000 to
keep quiet about the remains has suggested George McGovern
dismembered his mother Louise to keep her death secret and continue
collecting her benefits. George McGovern died of a heart attack
earlier this month at the age of 54.
</P>
<P>
   The neighbor, Walter Aker, initially told police he found the
remains while securing the McGoverns' belongings. But investigators
found that Aker had known the remains were in the freezer for more
than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Aker has been arraigned on grand larceny charges and has a court
date set for July 31.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Plain is 48 miles northwest of Albany.

<HEADLINE> Billions Added to Education Bill  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans added billions of
dollars Tuesday to legislation financing education, labor and
health programs for next year, at least matching President
Clinton's proposed price tag for the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the measure will not be signed, however, because
it cuts Clinton's requests for hiring teachers, school construction
and other programs. And in the House and Senate, a GOP effort to
complete several other spending bills before Congress breaks Friday
for the political conventions sputtered to a crawl.
</P>
<P>
   With the GOP presidential convention beginning Monday,
Republicans agreed at least to equal $106.2 billion Clinton had
proposed for the education, labor and health legislation. The
package, almost $7 billion higher than an earlier House-passed
version, underlined the GOP's desire to portray itself as a staunch
supporter of popular social programs like aid for schools and thus
to head off Democratic attacks on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this bill is high ground,'' Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.,
who chairs the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that helped
produce the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats complained that while setting aside money for Clinton
proposals for hiring teachers and rebuilding schools, it would let
state and local governments use it for other purposes. It also
would cut Clinton proposals for after-school programs and
health-care coverage for the uninsured and block forthcoming rules
aimed at reducing workplace injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Such items ensure the bill never would be signed, said Rep.
David Obey, D-Wis., top Democrat on the House Appropriations
Committee, as House and Senate lawmakers met to work on a
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ''This meeting is not about putting together a signable bill. It
is about putting together a Republican press release'' by easing
even deeper cuts the House approved in its version of the bill in
June, Obey said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans admitted they are unlikely to produce a signable
measure this week, but they said writing a final congressional
version of the legislation would help the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can make great progress in outlining our position and start
the national debate'' on education and other social issues, Specter
said, adding that Republicans ''can win the debate.''
</P>
<P>
   That stalemate is only one example of how movement on spending
measures has slowed, jeopardizing Republican leaders' hopes for a
productive pre-break week.
</P>
<P>
   Spending bills on energy and water projects, foreign aid and the
departments of Interior, Commerce, Justice, State and Treasury also
were bogged down.
</P>
<P>
   Bipartisan agreement was reached only on a roughly $2 billion
measure financing Congress' operations. Looking for last-minute
achievements, Republican leaders were considering loading it with
unrelated items such as a minimum wage increase and repeal of the 3
percent federal telephone tax.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are obstructionists of the highest order,'' Senate Budget
Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., fumed on the Senate floor
about Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Disputes over issues in the bills included proposed curbs on the
government's agreement with Smith &AMP; Wesson, the arms manufacturer;
whether to limit U.S. aid to groups that lobby for liberalized
abortion laws overseas; and whether to ease U.S. trade sanctions
against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., acknowledged that
Democrats were blocking work on spending bills until the
GOP-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee acts on a backlog of
Clinton judicial nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Slowing work on a president's nominations is routine in the
final months of an administration, although the two parties
disagree over whether this year's delays are worse than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of these judges have been waiting for now more than three
years. We think it's an outrageous demonstration of unfairness, of
insensitivity,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, the delays were caused by internal GOP
squabbles. Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Phil Gramm, R-Texas, are
blocking final passage of next year's Pentagon budget until
Republican leaders erase $6 billion worth of budget gimmicks tucked
into spending measures.

<HEADLINE> NFL Selects All-Decade Team  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Barry Sanders, Jerry Rice, Bruce Matthews, Bruce
Smith and Reggie White were unanimous selections to the NFL
All-Decade team for the 1990s, announced by the league Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who retired following the 1998 season, was the first
running back to rush for 1,500 yards in four straight seasons --
including 2,053 in 1997 when he was the co-MVP of the league. He
won four rushing titles with Detroit (1990, 1994, 1996-97).
</P>
<P>
   Rice led receivers with 860 catches, 12,078 yards receiving and
103 touchdowns for San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews, a guard who played in the last Super Bowl with
Tennessee, started all 160 games for the Oilers in the '90s and was
selected to 10 Pro Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and White were the decade's premier defensive ends. Smith
led the league with 113&AMP;frac12; sacks for Buffalo, two more than White,
who starred for Philadelphia and Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who signed this offseason with Washington, went to four
Super Bowls with the Bills and was the 1990 and 1996 defensive
player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   White, who came out of retirement last week to sign with the
Carolina Panthers, was the 1998 defensive player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   John Elway of Denver is the first-team quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Deion Sanders and Mel Gray are the only players selected at two
positions. Sanders is a first-team cornerback and punt returner,
while Gray made the second team as both a kick and punt returner.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Ronnie Lott, who will be inducted into the Pro Football
Hall of Fame on Saturday, Morten Andersen, Gary Anderson, Sean
Landeta, Rice, White and Smith are making their second appearances
on an All-Decade team. All were chosen for the 1980s team.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen and Anderson are kickers, Landeta a punter.
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith is the other first-team running back and Cris
Carter was chosen as the second receiver. William Roaf and Gary
Zimmerman are the tackles; Randall McDaniel, the other guard;
Dermontti Dawson is the center and Shannon Sharpe was picked at
tight end.
</P>
<P>
   On defense, Cortez Kennedy and John Randle are the tackles;
Kevin Greene, Junior Seau and Derrick Thomas, who died after a
January car accident, were chosen at linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Woodson is the other cornerback; Steve Atwater and LeRoy
Butler are the safeties
</P>
<P>
   Darren Bennett is the first-team punter.
</P>
<P>
   The first-team coach is Bill Parcells, who won one Super Bowl
with the Giants and lost another with New England during the '90s.
Marv Levy is the second-team coach for leading the Bills to four
Super Bowls, despite not winning any.

<HEADLINE> Robber insists on 20 $100 bills from bank teller  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PENNSAUKEN, N.J. (AP) - A bank robber was very particular about
what he wanted from a teller, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The robber told a teller at a PNC Bank branch here Monday
morning that he wanted 20 $100 bills. The teller didn't hear him
right and handed him two $100 bills, said Lt. Earl Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   ''He pushed it back at her and said, 'No, I want this: 20 $100
bills,''' Griffin said.
</P>
<P>
   The teller gave him 18 more $100 bills and the man left the
bank.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never heard of anything like this,'' Griffin said. ''It's
bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen people were in the bank, on Westfield Avenue, when
the robbery occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Police were looking for a black man about 5-foot-8, weighing
between 150 and 180 pounds with short hair, a mustache and an
unshaven chin. The suspect is believed to be between 25 and 32
years old. He was wearing a black hooded sweatshirt, blue jeans and
a black baseball cap with a round gold logo on the front, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   He told the teller that he had a gun in his backpack, but never
showed it, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with information is asked to call Detective Richard Vesci
of the Pennsauken Police Department at 856-488-0080, or the FBI's
Cherry Hill office at 856-795-9556.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A U.S.-funded group said Tuesday it has complied a
dossier with enough evidence to bring Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein
and dozens of his senior aides to trial on war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence has been handed over to the United States and
Kuwait, said Ann Clwyd, a British lawmaker and the chairwoman of
the London-based group Indict.
</P>
<P>
   Indict said it has gathered enough evidence to justify
prosecutions of Hussein and his top aides under the Geneva
Convention or the International Convention against Torture.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations against Hussein's regime include war crimes
during Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, the 1980 invasion of Iran
and aggression against Saudi Arabia in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Other allegations involve genocide directed against Kurdish
Iraqis, use of poisonous gas against Iraqi army defectors, and the
internal repression of political opponents, including the rape and
torture of prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ''People accused of these crimes must stand trial,'' said Clwyd,
a Labor Party lawmaker in the House of Commons. ''There is no
hiding place for them in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The dossier's completion is considered a major step forward in
efforts to establish an international tribunal on Iraq, along the
lines of the tribunals set up by the United Nations for Bosnia and
Rwanda. The United States has taken the lead in pressing for such a
tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   Indict was formed three years ago and received financial backing
from the United States last year as part of a $97 million package
approved by Congress to aid Hussein's opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Among those named in the dossier, which has not been made
public, are Saddam, his two sons and Iraq's deputy prime minister
Tariq Aziz, who is currently in Moscow for talks with the Russian
government, Indict said.
</P>
<P>
   The list of Iraqi officials also includes a so-called B-list of
about 30 less prominent aides, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi officials have consistently denied allegations of war
crimes, which they contend are attempts by their enemies to
undermine the nation's stability.
</P>
<P>
   Clwyd said she is hopeful the latest collection of evidence will
pressure the U.N. Security Council to set up a tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may be a long haul, but nevertheless it is important to
indict them so sometime in the future Hussein can stand trial,''
Clywd said.

<HEADLINE> Conservatives Worry on Gay Rights  </HEADLINE>
By JR ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- A coalition of conservative family groups
said Tuesday that they felt assured that they would be satisfied
with language in the Republican party platform opposing gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   Their comments came after meeting in Washington with Wisconsin
Gov. Tommy Thompson, chairman of the national party platform
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Thompson met with members of the Log Cabin
Republicans in what the group's executive director described as a
sincere signal that the GOP was becoming more inclusive.
</P>
<P>
   But several members of the conservative groups who met with
Thompson Tuesday said they were assured they would be happy with
the party platform's language opposing gays in the military, the
extension of civil rights to cover sexual preference and gay
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is the homosexuals want to neuter the
Republican platform, and I'm not sure that's going to happen,''
said Andrea Laferty, spokeswoman for the Traditional Values
Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The platform committee will gather in Philadelphia later this
week to hammer out details of the party platform before the party's
national convention begins Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Tafel, executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans,
said he lobbied Thompson to remove language in the party platform
he said would alienate gay voters. Tafel allowed that there is
little chance the party rank-and-file would permit these changes,
but was encouraged that Thompson and Bush were willing to meet with
them.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Bush met with members of the gay Republican group
after first saying a meeting was unlikely. Afterward, the
presumptive Republican presidential nominee said he was ''a better
person'' for listening to them, though he opposes much of the
groups' legislative and legal agenda, including gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Donovan of the Family Research Council said Thompson's
meeting with the Log Cabin Republicans wouldn't be troubling to
conservatives unless it was interpreted as a move by the party to
distance itself from its conservative stance on gay issues. Should
that happen, the GOP risks alienating conservative voting blocs
come November, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Definitely, we were encouraged by what we heard today,''
Donovan said. ''But there are no guarantees in politics. We'll be
in Philadelphia to encourage Republicans to stay put on this one.''

<HEADLINE> Bush VP Choice Overshadowed on TV  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- If George W. Bush was hoping for a burst of
publicity with his selection of Dick Cheney as his running mate, he
picked the wrong day.
</P>
<P>
   The filling out of the presumptive Republican presidential
ticket was bumped to the middle of the nightly network newscasts on
Tuesday because of the crash of a Concorde jet outside of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's selection was the third story in ABC and NBC's
newscasts after the Concorde crash and the collapse of the Middle
East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the network evening news reports led with the Concorde
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors about Cheney's selection for the past several days also
served to undercut its appeal as a news story. ABC's ''World News
Tonight'' began its report by saying, ''by the time it was
announced, there was little suspense left.''
</P>
<P>
   The ''CBS Evening News'' made the Cheney selection its second
story of the newscast, but also seemed to indicate a lack of
excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had promised an electrifying choice ... but George Bush
reached back in the past for the tried and true,'' CBS' Bill
Whitaker reported.
</P>
<P>
   Although the top-rated ''NBC Nightly News'' briefly mentioned
the Cheney selection at the beginning of its newscast, it didn't
get to the full story until 6:48 p.m., after half of the newscast
was over.
</P>
<P>
   The NBC newscast made the Cheney story its ''in depth''
selection, with reporter David Gregory saying it represented ''the
coming together of the young blood and the old guard of the
Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, the Concorde story caused the three major
networks to break into their daytime programming.

<HEADLINE> Islamic Man Innocent in Honor Death  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN DIMAURO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- A judge on Tuesday found an Islamic man
innocent of the shooting death of his 21-year-old cousin -- a woman
prosecutors said was slain because she rejected her religious
background.
</P>
<P>
   Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Judge Thomas J. Pokorny said gloves
with gunpowder residue that were found at the scene of the January
1999 shooting had DNA that did not match defendant Yezen Dayem's
DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Dayem, 21, and Musa Saleh, 22, killed their
cousin Methal Dayem on Jan. 8, 1999. They said the two men left her
in a snow-filled street because her independent lifestyle was
contrary to their belief that women should be submissive.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate trial in May, a different judge dismissed the case
against Saleh, saying prosecutors didn't have enough evidence for a
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Honor killing, which exists mostly in Muslim countries, is an
ancient practice sanctioned by culture rather than religion, rooted
in a complex code that allows a man to kill a female relative for
suspected immorality.
</P>
<P>
   Dayem's supporters burst into raucous cheers when the verdict
was announced.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the best day I had in my life,'' he said outside
court, tears streaming down his face.
</P>
<P>
   Methal Dayem's mother, sister and aunt criticized the judicial
system and said Allah would punish Yezen Dayem and his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said during Yezen Dayem's trial that a security
videotape showed a Honda CRV, the type of car used that night by
Yezen Dayem, leaving the scene of the shooting. They also said
cellular phone records showed Yezen Dayem placed a telephone call
about a mile from the scene of the slaying at about the time it
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Wisan Farraj, a jailhouse informant in whom Saleh allegedly
confided, also testified that Saleh disclosed Yezen Dayem as the
killer.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys said that the Honda on the videotape could
have belonged to anyone, that the cellular call could have been
made within 10 miles of the scene and that Farraj was an unreliable
witness.
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict was read, relatives of the victim and the
defendant cursed at each other in a courthouse hallway and on the
outside steps of the building. County sheriff's deputies eventually
separated the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Prosecutor Dan Kasaris said it was unfortunate that
the judge chose not to believe the jailhouse informant. ''The
evidence was there that those guys were there,'' he said. ''We put
them right where she was killed.''

<HEADLINE> Free trigger locks distributed by hospital now said to be defective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A Mercer County hospital that gave away 600
gun trigger locks now says the devices may be unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital representatives joined state and local officials
Tuesday in asking people to return the locks.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital at Hamilton began
distributing the locks in April on the anniversary of the shooting
at Columbine High School in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who wanted a lock was able to get one. Now that ''no
questions asked'' policy is hurting attempts to locate the locks,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want anyone who took advantage of this recent trigger lock
program to immediately stop using the devices and seek a
replacement,'' said Assemblyman Gary Guear, D-Mercer.
</P>
<P>
   Master Lock Co. of Milwaukee voluntarily recalled about 752,000
gun locks Monday in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product
Safety Commission, according to a statement issued by Guear's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the locks apparently can be disassembled without the
key.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton Township Mayor Glen Gilmore said he is trying to get
replacements for the locks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're hoping to have this corrected so promised anonymity can
be maintained and public safety can be assured,'' Gilmore said.
</P>
<P>
   Guear offered the locks from his legislative office while
Gilmore allowed them to be taken from the Hamilton Township
Municipal Building.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital's program was a joint effort with the New Jersey
Hospital Association, according to Guear.

<HEADLINE> Oil Giant Mostly Favors Republicans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Dick Cheney at its helm, Halliburton Co.
and its employees have been generous supporters of the Republican
Party, donation records show.
</P>
<P>
   The oil giant has given more than $1.6 million in campaign
contributions to federal candidates and the political parties since
Jan. 1, 1991, virtually all to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   More than half that money has come since Cheney took over the
company as chief executive officer in 1995, the Center for
Responsive Politics reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   More than 91 percent of the company's donations have gone to the
GOP, according to an analysis by the center, which studies
political donations.
</P>
<P>
   Besides political action committee and individual contributions,
the company also made more than $350,000 in soft money
contributions, which are exempt from federal donation limits.
</P>
<P>
   Since Jan. 1, 1999, when Cheney's running mate George W. Bush
entered the national scene, Halliburton has made $293,663 in
campaign contributions. All but $9,250 went to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The company's employees contributed more than $15,000 to Bush's
presidential campaign and his legal and accounting fund, including
$2,000 from Cheney.

<HEADLINE> Cheney's Wife a Writer, Commentator  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Novelist. Political commentator. Magazine
editor. Head of the National Endowment for the Humanities. Lynne
Cheney has worn many hats, earning a reputation as an outspoken and
occasionally controversial conservative who doesn't shy away from
taking on liberals.
</P>
<P>
   Now she'll reprise another role -- political wife -- as husband
Dick hits the campaign trail as George W. Bush's running mate. It's
a job that the Wyoming native and former homecoming queen last took
on in the late 1970s and 1980s, when Cheney won six consecutive
congressional elections to the House.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has said she enjoys political life, telling one
interviewer ''there's something about politics that people who
haven't been involved don't understand. Politics provides an
overriding sense of doing something important.''
</P>
<P>
   She met her future husband in high school where, she jokes, his
first political campaign involved getting her elected as homecoming
queen.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, 59, is perhaps best known for her sometimes prickly
seven-year stint as chair of the National Endowment for the
Humanities, a federal agency that provides millions of dollars to
support research and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   When she took over in 1986, Cheney butted heads with what she
viewed as a new generation of '60s-style, politically correct
humanities scholars who criticized Western-focused history and
''saw traditional scholarly values ... as tools that white males
have used to manipulate and marginalize the rest of us,'' according
to an opinion piece she wrote in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Her critics accused her of politicizing grants, rejecting
scholars who used nontraditional approaches that would rile
conservative patrons.
</P>
<P>
   She said grant applicants ''wanted to use taxpayer money to
advance their agendas ... I was willing to turn down projects that
had politics as their goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Under her tenure, the endowment financed a well-respected public
television series on the civil war and promoted using libraries,
museums and other institutions as extensions of the traditional
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   She resigned her post when Clinton was elected and joined a
conservative think tank, the American Enterprise Institute, as a
senior fellow.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has authored several nonfiction books about culture,
education and the humanities. She teamed up with her husband on a
1983 book about House speakers, penned two novels, was an editor at
Washingtonian magazine and a commentator on the political talk-show
circuit.
</P>
<P>
   The Cheneys have two grown daughters -- Elizabeth, who lives in
suburban Washington with her husband and two daughters, and Mary, a
1991 graduate of Colorado College.
</P>
<P>
   The two threw their parents a surprise 35th wedding anniversary
party last summer in Wyoming, inviting 100 guests to a rafting trip
down the Snake River. Attendees ranged from high school chums to
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.

<HEADLINE> Ramirez's Agent, Indians Talk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Manny Ramirez's agent came away from talks with
the Indians on Tuesday less confident that the slugger will remain
in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't say we expect an offer, but at the same time we've
discussed parameters from our side, and I think the ball rests in
their court at this moment,'' Jeff Moorad said after talking with
owner Larry Dolan, GM John Hart and assistant GM Mark Shapiro.
</P>
<P>
   Moorad said he hasn't discussed specifics with the Indians.
Dolan has said in the past that they would wait till the offseason
to discuss a new contract.
</P>
<P>
   Moorad, in Toronto to visit Blue Jays outfielder Raul Mondesi,
said no offer has been made, and he doesn't expect one before the
July 31 trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to ignore the rampant speculation about him being on
the verge of being traded,'' Moorad said. ''From that standpoint
it's a little tougher today to be totally optimistic (that he'll
stay with Cleveland), and yet I would say that I'm hopeful that he
stays with the Indians.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering Tuesday, Ramirez is hitting .336 with 20 home runs and
64 RBIs despite missing 6&AMP;frac12; weeks with a strained left hamstring.
Since coming off the DL on July 13, Ramirez is hitting .400 with
seven homers and 17 RBIs in 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the 28 year-old right-fielder became first player
in more than 60 years to top the 160-RBI mark.
</P>
<P>
   If he is traded, Moorad said Ramirez would be reluctant to sign
a long-term deal with his new team.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only contract that could possibly get done between now and
the end of the season is with the Cleveland Indians,'' he said.
''We're not open to negotiating with another team in the short
term.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Moorad later added that it ''would depend on the
team.'' The New York Mets are in the market for an outfielder and
Ramirez grew up New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians entered the day 11 games behind the Chicago White
Sox in the AL Central and 2&AMP;frac12; games in back of Oakland in the
wild-card race.

<HEADLINE> 'Springer' TV Show Guest Found Dead  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) -- A couple who went on ''The Jerry Springer
Show'' to accuse the man's ex-wife of stalking them are suspected
of killing the ex-wife hours after the show aired, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a terrible tragedy. The Sarasota County ... sheriff's
department contacted us and we are cooperating with its
investigation,'' said Linda Shafran, a spokeswoman for the show.
She would not comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Ralf Jurgen Panitz and his wife accused his former wife of
stalking them during the episode called ''Secret Mistresses
Confronted.'' All three appeared on the program, which was taped in
May and aired Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The body of Nancy Campbell-Panitz was found shortly after the
show was broadcast, according to the Sarasota County Sheriff's
Office.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators would not say how the 52-year-old was killed, but
said the death was a homicide and they are searching for Panitz and
his wife, Eleanor Marie Panitz.
</P>
<P>
   The body was found in a home that the three were fighting over.
It was unclear who was living in the house, but both women had
court documents stating they had a right to live there, said
sheriff's spokesman Cpl. Chuck Lesaltato.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of the victim discovered the body and called deputies,
who less than two hours earlier served a restraining order against
the ex-husband and his new wife at the request of Campbell-Panitz,
Lesaltato said.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies also responded to a disturbance at the home about five
miles south of downtown Sarasota earlier Monday. The two women were
fighting over who had a right to the house.
</P>
<P>
   A guest on ''The Jenny Jones Show'' was slain in 1995 after
taping an episode about secret crushes. Last year, the family of
former guest Scott Amedure was awarded $25 million by a Michigan
jury that found that the show and its producer, Warner Bros.,
negligent in his death.
</P>
<P>
   In an episode that was never broadcast, Amedure admitted that he
was attracted to Jonathan Schmitz, who had agreed to appear on the
show to meet his secret admirer. Schmitz, who was convicted of
murdering Amedure last year, had said he expected to meet a female
admirer.

</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   GONESSE, France (AP) -- With its engines in flames, an Air France Concorde
carrying German tourists to New York crashed into a hotel near Paris shortly
after takeoff Tuesday, killing at least 113 people. It was the first fatal crash
for the needle-nosed supersonic aircraft. Air France said one of the plane's
four engines appeared to have failed. France and Britain grounded all other
Concordes. The passengers on flight AF4590 included 96 Germans, two Danes, one
Austrian and one American, as well as nine crew members, the airline said. Four
other people were killed at the small hotel leveled in the crash.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Americans are more optimistic about the economy than they

<HEADLINE> Car accident in parking garage severs man's leg  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A motorist lost control of her BMW Tuesday as
she left a Manhattan parking garage, pinning a contractor so
severely that his leg was severed, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The worker, identified as James P. Lynch, 39, of Newburgh, N.Y.,
was rushed to Bellevue Hospital and listed in critical condition as
he underwent surgery. Lynch works for Felix Industries, a
contractor hired by Con Edison to do sealing work on pipe joints on
West 36th Street, said Con Edison spokesman Joe Petta.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency workers credited Police Officer Jeffrey Stella, 35,
with preventing Lynch from bleeding to death. Stella wrapped his
belt around Lynch's thigh to serve as a tourniquet.
</P>
<P>
   Stella was in the Midtown South Precinct around 1 p.m. when he
heard an officer calling for help over the police radio at 305 W.
36th St., which is directly behind the precinct.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw a man on the floor with his right knee elevated - his
leg was severed,'' Stella said. ''He was screaming that he was in
pain.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He was yelling, 'Hold my hand,''' Stella said. ''He was very
concerned about his family and his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Stella remained with Lynch until an ambulance arrived. The
14-year veteran said he remained cool because he's been in tough
situations like this before. Stella said he was one of the first
officers on the scene when a gunman opened fire in 1997 on the
Empire State Building's 86th floor observation deck. The gunman
killed one person and injured five others, before killing himself.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Industries did not respond to a telephone message for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The motorist was identified as Yen Kao, 56, of Franklin Lakes,
N.J. Police said it was too early to say if Kao would be charged
with any crime.

<HEADLINE> Navy petty officer discharged after posing nude for Playboy  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE ZIEGLER DIZON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) - A former Navy petty officer is bearing the
consequences for baring all in the September issue of Playboy
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Lynne White, 26, said she was discharged from the Navy on
July 9 because she posed for a nude photo spread. She originally
was scheduled to be released from duty on Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt I wasn't doing anything wrong by posing,'' White said
Tuesday. ''I'm not making the Navy look bad by having those
pictures there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Cmdr. Dave Werner, a Navy spokesman in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii,
where White was stationed, said both the Navy and White agreed to
the discharge.
</P>
<P>
   ''As she agreed, it was best that she pursue her career outside
the military,'' Werner said. ''It was in everyone's interests for
her to leave early.''
</P>
<P>
   Werner would not say what role the Playboy photos played in the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   White, a native of Washington, N.J., who had served in the Navy
for eight years, said her trouble began when she submitted a nude
photo that was published in the ''Grapevine'' section of Playboy's
February issue.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the photo nor the caption made reference to White's
service in the Navy, she said. But she said her superiors told her
to ask Playboy not to publish any more of her photos.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, White contacted the magazine and arranged to do a full
pictorial, with an accompanying article and pictures of her in
uniform. After she told her superiors of her decision, she was told
she would be discharged for misconduct under honorable conditions,
she said. She eventually signed a letter stating those terms.
</P>
<P>
   A notation on her discharge bars her from returning to military
service or holding certain government jobs, White said.
</P>
<P>
   She would not disclose how much she was paid for posing nude.
</P>
<P>
   White most recently had served as a naval information systems
technician second class as part of the Commander Submarine Force,
U.S. Pacific Fleet.

<HEADLINE> Keyshawn Johnson at Home With Bucs  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- No one puts more pressure on Keyshawn Johnson
than himself.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of the reasons the Tampa Bay Buccaneers expect to
contend for the Super Bowl this season and he's ready to prove he's
worth the price the team paid to bring him to town.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs traded a pair of first-round picks in this year's draft
to the New York Jets, then signed the two-time Pro Bowl receiver to
a six-year, $52 million contract extension in hopes of injecting
life into a listless passing attack.
</P>
<P>
   Never at a loss for confidence, Johnson thinks he's the man for
the job. Where Alvin Harper and Bert Emanuel failed for Tampa Bay,
he expects to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't put myself in their shoes. ... I'm totally different
from them,'' Johnson said of the other high-priced receivers the
Bucs acquired in recent seasons. ''I can't say what they did wrong
or what they did right. All I know is what I'm going to come in
here and do.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson averaged 76 catches per season and caught 31 touchdown
passes in four years with the Jets, including a career-best 89
receptions for a career-high 1,170 yards and eight TDs last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs, next to last in the NFL in passing last season,
haven't had a 1,000-yard receiver since 1989. Four of the last five
seasons, with Harper and Emanuel lining up as the No. 1 receiver,
the club's reception leader was either a running back or tight end.
</P>
<P>
   None of that matters to Johnson, who says he will produce -- even
though a new system installed by offensive coordinator Les Steckel
will stress establishing the run.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been in run-oriented offenses my entire career. It's not
that big of a deal. If they run the football. They run it,''
Johnson said. ''As long as we win football games, and at the end I
can put the (Super Bowl) ring in somebody's face and say, 'Oh,
well.'''
</P>
<P>
   Joining a team with an inexperienced quarterback doesn't faze
him, either. Second-year pro Shaun King started five regular-season
and two playoff games for the Bucs last season and should be fine,
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Only two receivers in league history, Marvin Harrison and Andre
Rison, have caught more passes in their first four seasons than
Johnson. And there doesn't seem to be any room for complacency in
his game. Johnson was the first player to report for training camp
and is constantly looking for ways to improve his performance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously every receiver should think that he's better than
the next. And that's me. I think that I'm probably the top guy
going. But then there's other guys who think they're the top guy,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I learn from everybody. I look at guys like Randy Moss and
Antonio Freeman. I love to sit down and watch nothing but tape of
Cris Carter and talk to him ... to understand what I need to do
better because I'm pretty sure he watches me, too. I'll ask other
guys around the league when I play them or watch tape on them. I'm
not arrogant enough to not do that.''

<HEADLINE> Surhoff Wants To Stay With Orioles  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- For the second straight day, the New York media
ventured into the Baltimore clubhouse to address trade rumors
involving Orioles who might be headed to the Big Apple.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the rumor du jour was shortstop Mike Bordick going to
the New York Mets. On Tuesday, the writers wanted to talk to left
fielder B.J. Surhoff about the possibility of him being dealt to
the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Surhoff, like Bordick, was unwilling to entertain the
possibility of being traded before the July 31 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't given it an ounce of thought. I don't even know what
you guys are talking about,'' Surhoff said. ''I have control over
certain things, and I don't have control over others. I definitely
don't have control over rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Bordick, Surhoff made it clear that he would prefer to stay
put rather than uproot his family, even it meant playing for a
contender.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the umpteenth-thousandth time, this is where I'd like to
play, this is where I want to play,'' he said. ''If that changes
somehow, then I would have to deal with it. But I hope I don't have
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Syd Thrift, the Orioles' vice president of player personnel, has
been working the phones for weeks. But he said the organization
won't deal away veterans without receiving ample compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can only do what other teams do with me. Depending on the
quality of the prospects, it has to be fair for both parties,''
Thrift said. ''Our goal is to get better.''

<HEADLINE> Rangers Face Life Without Rodriguez  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- When Ivan Rodriguez's right thumb
crash-landed into the barrel of Mo Vaughn's bat, there went the
last bit of hope from an already disastrous season for the Texas
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Losing the reigning AL MVP and the team's only All-Star for the
rest of the season with a broken throwing hand ended any remote
chance of Texas retaining the AL West title it has won the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez underwent a 1-hour, 20-minute operation Tuesday in
Fort Worth by Dr. Bobby Wroten. He inserted three pins into the
base of Rodriguez's thumb to hold three bone fragments.
</P>
<P>
   Wroten said Rodriguez came out of the operation with no
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't anticipate this will have any effect on his career,''
Rangers medical director Dr. John Conway said. ''We anticipate he
will be ready for spring training with no problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers general manager Doug Melvin is getting more than
consolation calls from his counterparts. With Texas 11&AMP;frac12; games out,
contenders are combing Texas' roster in search of players to put
them over the top.
</P>
<P>
   John Wetteland, David Segui and Luis Alicea are the most likely
to leave. All are free agents after this season, meaning the
Rangers could lose them anyway. Dumping them now would bring
something in return and help trim a payroll that's among the
highest.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland, the MVP of the 1996 World Series with the Yankees, is
the most attractive but teams may view him as a rent-a-reliever
because he could wind up re-signing with Texas in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know where this leaves us,'' Melvin said following
Rodriguez's injury Monday night. ''All I know is it is a sad day.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was hurt in the first inning of a 6-5 loss to Anaheim
while throwing to second base on Kevin Stocker's steal attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn had swung and missed and was trying to duck out of the
way, but his bat stayed up and Rodriguez caught it flush with his
follow-through.
</P>
<P>
   ''As soon as it happened, my thumb went numb,'' Rodriguez said.
''There was swelling and I knew it was broken and I'd be out for
the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say the bone should be healed within 10 weeks and
Rodriguez can resume athletic activity in 2-4 months. Unless
something goes wrong, Rodriguez should make a full recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a strong mind,'' Rodriguez said. ''I'll be ready for
spring training.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers will play the next 65 games without Rodriguez,
something that hasn't happened since early in 1991 when he was a
pudgy 19-year-old at Double-A Tulsa. He was called up June 20 that
year and started 81 of Texas' final 102 games.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Rodriguez has blossomed into the best all-around
catcher of his generation and one of the all-time bests. The
Rangers also have improved, going from also-rans to division champs
three of the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez came up with a laser arm and a weak bat. He steadily
improved at the plate while winning eight straight Gold Glove
awards for his performance behind it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, he hit .332 with 35 homers, 25 steals and 113 RBIs, all
career-bests; his 116 runs tied his personal high. In winning the
MVP, he sealed his place in baseball history alongside Johnny
Bench, Yogi Berra and Bill Dickey.
</P>
<P>
   By getting the most votes for this year's All-Star game,
Rodriguez also established himself as one of baseball's most
popular players. And, he was on pace to have even better statistics
than his MVP season.
</P>
<P>
   Batting cleanup, Rodriguez was leading the team in hitting at
.347 with 27 homers and 83 RBIs, all among the top seven in the AL.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was having a strong season, so it's disappointing for it to
end two months before it was supposed to,'' Rodriguez said. ''I'll
just go out and put up better numbers next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's absence leaves Rafael Palmeiro as the biggest threat
in Texas' lineup, even though the first baseman is having a down
year. He's likely to see fewer good pitches without Rodriguez
hitting behind him.
</P>
<P>
   In the field, Bill Haselman will take over as the starter. B.J.
Wazgis, who has never played in the majors, was called up from
Triple-A Oklahoma to be the backup.
</P>
<P>
   If there's any bright spot to losing Rodriguez, it's that he
won't continue beating up his body during a hot summer with little
chance of making the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez had played 91 of 97 games this season and between 144
and 153 the last four years. Those are all high workloads for a
catcher, even for someone 28 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The injury also could make Rodriguez think more seriously about
moving to another position, such as second base.
</P>
<P>
   ''We always take Pudge for granted that he's always going to be
out there,'' Melvin said. ''But you have to realize it can happen
to anybody. You wonder which player your team can least afford to
lose. He falls into that category.''

<HEADLINE> Colombia Talks End Without Accord  </HEADLINE>
By GEIR MOULSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Colombian government and rebel negotiators
concluded two days of negotiations overshadowed by fighting at
home, with no agreement Tuesday on how to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   Because of an outburst of fighting with rightist militias, the
leftist National Liberation Army, or ELN, made clear in the Geneva
talks that it would not make a general release of hostages it has
held for more than a year, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the ELN released one of its five hostages Tuesday,
apparently for humanitarian reasons, the man's wife and the Red
Cross said.
</P>
<P>
   The freed man, electrical engineer Yesid Gomez, had been ill.
''He had to be continually on drugs because he was fainting and had
convulsions,'' said his wife, Gladys Sanchez de Romero. ''It's been
very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomez's release left four hostages still in captivity from the
April 12, 1999 hijacking of an Avianca airliner on a domestic
flight by ELN, Colombia's second-largest leftist guerrilla force.
</P>
<P>
   In the talks that concluded Tuesday, the two sides did not set a
date for further talks but said they wanted to continue.
</P>
<P>
   During the negotiations, the ELN claimed rightist paramilitary
groups had attacked one of its strongholds in the northern San
Lucas mountains in hopes of sabotaging the Geneva talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a consequence of the armed confrontation of recent days in
the south of Bolivar, serious difficulties have arisen to the
process'' between the government and the ELN, the two sides said in
a joint statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   They asked for international help -- particularly from
Switzerland, Norway, France, Cuba and Spain, which attended the
peace talks -- to create the environment for more negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most important outcome is exactly this: that the three
parties agreed that even in such difficult circumstances they are
prepared to continue the peace process,'' the host of the talks,
Switzerland's ambassador to Colombia, Viktor Christen, said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 80 representatives of the government, the ELN, church,
business executives, unionists, opposition political leaders, and
relatives of those kidnapped by the rebels met in a Geneva hotel
starting Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was to discuss creation of a troop-free zone in the
north for the ELN, like one already in place in the south under the
biggest left-wing force, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's conflict began in 1964, making it the longest-running
civil war in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The FARC has been holding separate talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
   The 5,000-member ELN was formed in the 1960s by disgruntled
peasants, leftist priests and radical students. Nearly wiped out in
the 1970s, it rebounded with the help of millions of dollars from
kidnappings and blackmail of foreign oil companies.

<HEADLINE> GOP Critic Faults Census Methods  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA MARTINEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Census Bureau should conduct new head
counts in 15 areas around the country because of ''questionable
behavior,'' a key Republican critic asserted Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Miller of Florida, who heads the House Government
Reform Committee's Census panel, said there was a ''sudden surge''
in the completion of Census forms in areas where resistance was
initially encountered.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had serious doubts before the 2000 census even began that
the bureau did not allow enough time for non-response follow-up
efforts, officially scheduled to last only 10 weeks,'' Miller said
at a news conference on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   He said too many of the completed forms came from areas that
have high rates of ''vacancies'' or deleted addresses in a number
of communities that have been underrepresented in previous Census
counts.
</P>
<P>
   The information, he said, was obtained by members of the Census
subcommittee staff in consultation with the congressional members
of a Census Monitoring Board and two former senior Census Bureau
officials, whom Miller did not identify.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman said the staff members identified more than a
dozen Census offices ''in which data suggests fraud or irregular
procedures.'' Miller said that was disappointing in view of the
roughly $6.5 billion the government has invested in the national
head count.
</P>
<P>
   The panel named these areas as questionable: Florence, Ala.;
west Atlanta; Chicago's far south and near north areas, Marion
County, Ind.; Las Vegas, Rapid City, S.D.; East Los Angeles,
Commerce and Santa Ana, Calif.; Newark, N.J.; the northwest section
of the Queens borough of New York City; northeast New York City;
Newcastle, Pa.; north Philadelphia and Hialeah, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials had acknowledged previously that they are
reviewing some 150,000 households because questions have been
raised about certain enumerating practices. But on Tuesday, they
accused Miller of overstating the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have told the subcommittee not to misrepresent the data
because they are not easily interpretable to the public,'' Census
Director Kenneth Prewitt said in a conference call with reporters.
''But obviously they have not done so.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., in whose district one of the
questioned Census offices operates, said she takes such allegations
''very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   ''While I am concerned about these allegations, I am also
concerned with the way they have been made,'' she said in a
statement. ''To allege that procedures have been violated is one
thing,'' the congresswoman said. ''To make allegations of fraud is
quite another, and after reviewing the documents provided
carefully, I have seen no evidence of widespread fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions about the 15 locations are based on problems the
Bureau has had in South Florida and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the problems they have encountered, the bureau still
believes the count overall has been efficient and thorough.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't believe there's any problem in those 15 (areas) that
requires additional investigation,'' Steve Jost, a spokesman for
the agency, said Tuesday. ''But we continue to monitor our work.''
</P>
<P>
   Jost said about 200,000 census workers are now rechecking about
12 million locations where temporary vacancies, construction work
or other factors could contribute to inaccuracies in the count.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's our normal procedure; we do that every census,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the Census Bureau had ordered a recount of thousands
of city households in Chicago because some workers might have cut
corners to boost the number of completed questionnaires. Similar
problems have cropped up in Hialeah, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The largest recount, to date, is the one taking place in
Florida, where suspected corner-cutting has led Census officials to
go back and review information gathered from more than 71,000
households.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Eulogize Arkansas Friend  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- President Clinton paid tribute Tuesday
to Diane Divers Blair, a dear friend he said he always admired
because she embraced life with vigor and ''lived till the very
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his wife and daughter traveled from Washington for a
memorial service at the University of Arkansas for Blair, a former
political science professor. Blair, 61, died of lung cancer June
26.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was not a woman to let you wallow in self-pity,'' Clinton
said, recalling how Blair invited him to speak to her class shortly
after he lost re-election as governor in 1980, ''to explain how I
got my brains beat out.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt about her as I have rarely felt about any human being,
that she had this peculiar blend,'' Clinton said. ''She was
beautiful and good. She was serious and funny. She was completely
ambitious to do good and be good, but fundamentally selfless.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would often torment her by doing The New York Times'
Sunday crossword puzzle days before she could get a copy of it --
and then sending the answers to her, knowing ''she prided herself
on being too noble'' to peek.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, looking exhausted and sad, told a crowd of 1,100 that
when he first met Blair, he was amazed at ''how much she reminded
me of Hillary.'' He said he found Blair captivating, and knew that
''in some fundamental way, I would belong to her for the rest of my
life. And that's exactly what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Diane Blair lived till the very end. I mean really lived,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he and his wife were holding Blair's hands at her
bedside in their final visit just days before her death. Wiping
tears from his eyes, he repeated her last words to them:
</P>
<P>
   ''She said, 'Before I go, I want to tell you, remember.' Hillary
said, 'Remember what, Diane?' She smiled and said, 'Just
remember.''' Clinton said. ''That's what I say to you. In every
dark and difficult moment in your life ... just remember.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons brought with them a large contingent of friends,
including former Arkansas Sen. Dale Bumpers, longtime Clinton aide
Bruce Lindsey, Clinton's private attorney, David Kendall, the first
lady's close friend Sarah Ehrman, and political scientists Norm
Ornstein, Thomas Mann and Sam Popkin.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton praised Blair as a ''sister and scholar'' who
loved bird-watching, sent quirky greeting cards and treated books
''as seriously as she did her friends.'' She recalled the large,
round eyeglasses that Blair wore -- then put on a pair herself -- as
emblematic of Blair's grand vision in life.
</P>
<P>
   ''How could anyone think of Diane and not think of those
incredible, oversized, really unattractive glasses?'' the first
lady said. ''Still, she always ended up being able to see things,
and help us see things, more clearly than ever. ... In many ways, I
was lucky to have her for the past 25 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The first family's friendship with Blair and her husband, Jim,
dates back to the early 1970s when both Clintons taught at the
university. Clinton, then governor, officiated at the Blairs' 1979
wedding, and Hillary Clinton served as what she described as ''best
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Blair was Hillary Clinton's adviser during a nine-month
period in 1978 and 1979, when she turned a $1,000 investment in the
cattle futures market into nearly $100,000.

<HEADLINE> Concorde Was First Stage of Tour  </HEADLINE>
By COLLEEN BARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- The Concorde flight from Paris to New York was
just the first stage in a world-class luxury tour.
</P>
<P>
   The Germany-based Deilmann Shipping Co. had booked at least 99
passengers killed in the crash near Paris' Charles de Gaulle
airport on a 16-day Caribbean cruise from New York, through the
Panama Canal, to Ecuador aboard the five-star MS Deutschland
passenger ship.
</P>
<P>
   This was a trip to savor. Champagne on the Concorde, traveling
at twice the speed of sound over the Atlantic. Then, a leisurely
cruise on the MS Deutschland ocean liner built two years ago to
evoke the Roaring '20s, featuring crystal chandeliers, an imperial
ballroom and loom chairs in a palm-filled winter garden.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's even a salt-water swimming pool sheltered by a glazed
promenade in case you want to take a dip,'' says the description on
the shipping company's Web site. It boasts a Lido Deck that offers
a view of approaching ports: Norfolk, Va., for a day at the beach,
a tour of the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla., and a
stop in Havana, Cuba, before slipping through the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag for the cruise -- the Concorde flight was extra --
$3,400 for a shared cabin, and $11,065 for a suite with an ocean
view.
</P>
<P>
   From Ecuador, passengers might catch a flight back to Frankfurt.
Or opt to continue on the ship's next leg, 19 days to Tahiti for
$5,500 -- with an option to continue to Sydney, Australia -- arriving
on Sept. 14 -- a day before the opening ceremonies at the Summer
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise was marketed for the wealthy northern European
traveler craving warm summer seas.
</P>
<P>
   Tour operator Peter Deilmann said the cruise, which had a total
of 510 passengers booked, would not be canceled. ''There's no sense
letting the ship lie there,'' he said. ''Life goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   His company had offered Concorde-cruise combinations three times
before, but added, ''there won't be anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Deilmann said he provided a list of the 99 passengers his
company had booked on the Concorde to the Germany Foreign Ministry,
but declined to release any names or hometowns.
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Ministry said the list included 49 men, 47 women and
three children. All were from Germany except for two Danes and an
Austrian. The list was broken down by states, but a spokesman said
no more exact information would be released.
</P>
<P>
   Six couples and a child were from the northern city of
Moenchengladbach, near the Dutch border, where officials
accompanied by grief counselors were working off a travel agency
list to notify relatives, said police spokesman Joachim Jagielski.
</P>
<P>
   Air France said nine crew members and a retired Air France
employee -- an American -- on board were also killed.
</P>
<P>
   In Berlin, 30 people at the Foreign Ministry crisis office were
trying to contact relatives and arrange transportation to the
accident scene.
</P>
<P>
   Deilmann, the tour operator, said he was ''deeply dismayed'' by
the crash and expressed his sympathy to the victims' relatives.
Speaking to reporters at the cruise company's headquarters in the
Baltic port city of Neustadt in Holstein, he said two company
representatives from Germany would join two others in France on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder canceled his evening
appointments to stay on top of developments, and issued his deepest
condolences after speaking with French President Jacques Chirac and
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
</P>
<P>
   ''Germany and France are united in their horror over the
accident, in mourning for the victims and in sympathy for their
families,'' Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor sent his transport minister, Reinhard Klimmt, to
the scene and the German Foreign Ministry has set up a second
crisis center at the German Embassy in Paris, which was helping to
identify the dead.
</P>
<P>
   The entire German Cabinet, headed by Schroeder, will attend an
ecumenical service for the victims of the crash Wednesday in
Hanover at a chapel located on the grounds of the World's Fair. The
Cabinet had been scheduled to hold the last regular meeting before
its summer break at the German pavilion of Expo 2000.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Council Urges Football Waiver  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The NCAA Division I Management Council
recommended a one-time waiver Tuesday that will allow schools to
play in one of four preseason football games in addition to 12
regular-season games in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation will be considered by the Division I board of
directors at its August meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA in 1999 allowed schools to schedule 12 regular-season
games in certain years, starting in 2002, but took away an
exemption for teams participating in the Pigskin Classic, Kickoff
Classic, Black Coaches Association Football Classic and Eddie
Robinson Football Classic.
</P>
<P>
   The council waived that restriction -- for 2002 only -- because
sponsors of those four preseason games showed it would have
affected their ability to fulfill television contracts that were
made before the 1999 legislation was adopted, the NCAA reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As of now, a 12th game will be allowed only in years in which
there are 14 Saturdays in the season. That occurs six times over
the next 20 years -- 2002, 2003, 2008, 2013, 2014 and 2019.
</P>
<P>
   The council also is expected to review proposed legislation
later this year that could eliminate exempted games in other sports
besides football.
</P>
<P>
   The council also:
</P>
<P>
   -- Did not support a recommendation that would have added a 65th
team to the Division I women's tournament bracket, similar to a
format recently approved for the 2001 men's tournament. The
proposal would have set a minimum of 34 at-large selections.
</P>
<P>
   -- Referred to the council's administrative committee a request
from the board of directors to reconsider a proposal to tie the
number of men's basketball scholarships to graduation rates. The
proposal will be considered by the council in October.
</P>
<P>
   -- Heard a subcommittee report on amateurism. A package of
proposals is expected to be presented to the NCAA's
academics/eligibility/compliance cabinet in October.

<HEADLINE> Surgery an Option for McGwire  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID SCOTT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire said Tuesday
he'd consider undergoing surgery before the season ended if it is
the only option left to repair the patella tendon in his ailing
right knee.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an option, but it's like the final straw,'' McGwire said
before the Cardinals game against Arizona. ''I don't want that.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire missed his 15th game with the knee injury Tuesday. He
was leading the majors with 30 home runs when he went on the
disabled list July 7.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, McGwire said he has totally ''shut down'' his knee,
trying to rest it as much as possible. Asked about what kind of
treatment McGwire has received, Cardinals' trainer Barry Weinberg
rattled off a list.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying everything, so we miss nothing,'' Weinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire said he tried a light workout last week when the
Cardinals were in Arizona. The next day, he said, his knee ''felt
like it had gone back to square one.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time I bend my knee, it feels like it's going to tear.
It's not good,'' McGwire said. ''From what I understand about
patella tendinitis, it just doesn't go away.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Cardinals recent 11-game road trip, manager Tony La Russa
had suggested McGwire could be used as an ''ultimate pinch
hitter.'' When that got back to McGwire, he said he chuckled.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being out as long as I've been out now, if I got healthy
tomorrow, it's going to talk me a week or so to get ready,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The injury is similar to the one suffered by St. Louis Rams
place-kicker Jeff Wilkins. Like Wilkins, McGwire said his right
knee hurts the most when he bends over.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins is still building strength in his leg five months after
a bone spur and degenerative tissue were removed from his knee.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's run through my mind, and I don't want to think about it
right now,'' McGwire said. ''We have two months left in the season.
It's not like we finish next week. Two months is a long time.''

<HEADLINE> Braves' Galarraga Says He's OK  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- All-Star first baseman Andres Galarraga, who fell
awkwardly on his left hand while trying to make a catch last
weekend, said Tuesday he has a sprained thumb but no serious
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Galarraga wasn't able to start for the Atlanta Braves,
who began a four-game series with the Florida Marlins at Turner
Field.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing is broken,'' said Galarraga, who underwent X-rays
Monday when the Braves were off. ''If they need me late in the
game, I could probably pinch-hit. It doesn't bother me much when I
bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense is a different matter. Galarraga said it's painful to
use his glove hand because of the badly swollen thumb, which was
injured Saturday against the New York Mets when he fell awkwardly
after leaping for a high throw from third baseman Chipper Jones.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Galarraga joined a long list of injured players
in the Braves clubhouse. Shortstop Walt Weiss (sprained right knee)
and outfielder Reggie Sanders (strained left hamstring) both missed
their fourth straight games.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss had fluid drained from knee on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It feels a lot better,'' said Weiss, plagued by injuries
throughout his three-year tenure with the Braves. ''It's not as
stiff. They got the fluid out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll test the knee on Wednesday and hopes to rejoin the lineup
the following day.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who already has one stint on the DL this season, said
his hamstring is at about 85 percent. He has struggled through a
dismal year with the Braves, batting .191 with five homers and 18
RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Kevin McGlinchy, bothered since late April with a sore
right shoulder, received a bit if good news Monday when an MRI
found no serious damage. He received a cortisone shot to alleviate
the pain and hopes to begin a minor-league rehab assignment within
a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully, this is a new chapter for me,'' said McGlinchy, who
has pitched in only seven games. ''It's been a long year of
traveling and seeing doctors and seeing cities I never thought I'd
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta already has lost second baseman Quilvio Veras, catcher
Eddie Perez and pitchers John Smoltz, Rudy Seanez and Greg
McMichael to season-ending injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Veras, who underwent surgery a week ago to repair a torn
ligament in his right knee, hobbled into the clubhouse Tuesday on
crutches.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is really hard for me,'' Veras said. ''But I guess
everything happens for a reason.''

<HEADLINE> Cheney's Proximity Made Case for VP  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- By all accounts, Laura Bush heard the news
first: That her husband's search for a vice president might end
with the man doing the searching, Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   ''This would really be the best man if he would do it. I wish he
would,'' her husband, GOP nominee George W. Bush, declared as they
joined their advisers for lunch July 3 at the couple's ranch in
Crawford, Texas. What most of them didn't know was that the search
was just about over.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor had just emerged from several hours of
private talks with Cheney in the den. After lunch, Bush stepped out
to the back porch with Cheney, and asked if he would be interested.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar conversation in March at the governor's mansion,
Cheney had demurred. This time he said he'd be willing to speak
with his family and consider serving as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Cautiously, Bush then reported to his wife that ''he might have
the possibility of convincing Secretary Cheney,'' said spokeswoman
Karen Hughes, who also got a hint from her boss later that day.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wasn't the first choice for a long time,'' said Karl Rove,
Bush's chief campaign strategist.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney himself vetted the others, and more details of that
search surfaced Tuesday. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, who had been
among the top guesses among Republican consultants, revealed that
he had taken himself out of the running three weeks ago for
personal reasons. Meanwhile, former education secretary Lamar
Alexander disclosed that he was also on the list after Cheney
quietly sought his background information in May.
</P>
<P>
   Aides described Cheney's July 3 meeting with Bush as pivotal,
but it wasn't until July 12 that Cheney gave Bush a hard yes during
a phone call from Minneapolis, Hughes said. The day before, Cheney
met with some candidates for the job but also had a complete
physical. Doctors had told Cheney, 59, that his three heart attacks
during the 1970s and 1980s and other health problems provided no
medical reason to turn down the job.
</P>
<P>
   On July 15, Cheney met with Bush, 54, in Austin for several
hours and the governor summoned Hughes and other top aides to the
governor's mansion to discuss the ramifications of picking the
leader of the search for the No. 2 spot on the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, campaign manager Joe Allbaugh agreed to head
up an independent review of Cheney's public record. Bush and
Cheney, meanwhile, privately discussed the former defense
secretary's financial interests.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney had already been vetted by the FBI and the Senate Arms
Services Committee in 1989 for his confirmation as Pentagon chief,
Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, meanwhile, called his father and asked whether family
friend Dr. Denton Cooley, would independently verify Cheney's
health. President Bush did so, and Cooley, head of the Texas Heart
Institute, agreed that Cheney was in good health and would be able
to serve as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The decision still wasn't final. Cheney told Bush and his staff
that he still wanted to furnish a list of acceptable candidates for
the job, should Bush change his mind. To that end, Bush and Cheney
on July 18 met secretly with one prospect, former Sen. John
Danforth, in Chicago. But Danforth said Tuesday that he had been
ambivalent about the prospect anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Then, early the next morning, Bush told Cheney that he was the
top choice, and he asked whether it was possible for Cheney to
leave his post as chairman and CEO of Dallas-based Halliburton
Corp. Cheney discussed the prospect with his board of directors
over the following 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Cheney flew to Wyoming without Bush's knowledge to
register to vote there rather than Texas, to avoid any
constitutional conflicts with two residents of the same state
running on the same ticket, Hughes said. The news soon leaked that
Cheney was the top candidate.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:22 a.m. Tuesday morning, Bush offered Cheney a job and
Cheney accepted. Five minutes later, Hughes was awakened by the
news. By 9 a.m., Rove had asked advisers Charlie Black and Haley
Barbour to spread the news to supporters in Washington, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   The news was out: Bush had talked him onto the presidential
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the end, I learned how persuasive he can be,'' Cheney said.

<HEADLINE> Another mosquito virus shows up in tests  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - The state Department of Environmental
Protection began spraying pesticide in lower Fairfield County
Tuesday in an attempt to kill mosquitoes carrying the West
Nile-like strain of the encephalitis virus.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first such spraying in the state this summer, and
followed last weeks discovery of the virus in a batch of mosquitoes
tested in Stamford.
</P>
<P>
   The latest weekly test results released Tuesday showed no
further positive tests of the virus in mosquitoes and birds,
officials said. More than 52,000 mosquitoes have been tested so
far.
</P>
<P>
   The ground level spraying, which began at 8 p.m. Tuesday,
covered a 2-mile area in the Springdale section of Stamford and
parts of Darien and New Canaan.
</P>
<P>
   The spraying, expected to last about six hours, was postponed
Monday due to a forecast of rain.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday, 106 birds have negative test results and 97 are
pending.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut officials said they have documented 15 cases of
another milder encephalitis virus known as Jamestown Canyon. That
virus has been identified in mosquitoes in past years, but never in
humans in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Human infections of Jamestown Canyon have occurred in other
states, typically involving mild flu-like symptoms, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In light of the absence of human cases in Connecticut, it's
not something I can categorize as of great concern,'' said John
Anderson, director of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment
Station in New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Durland Fish, an associate professor at Yale University and an
expert in the field, said the Jamestown Canyon virus is worthy of
further study.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's an important issue that needs to be looked at,''
Fish said.

<HEADLINE> State: Tear six pages out of prison copies of 'Newjack'  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Six pages must be removed from a book
written by a journalist who worked as a guard at Sing Sing before
copies will be allowed into any state prison, officials decreed
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   State Corrections Commissioner Glenn Goord said it is ''my
obligation to draw the proverbial line'' at providing information
in Ted Conover's ''Newjack: Guarding Sing Sing'' to inmates ''that
I reasonably believe could endanger them or staff.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In a few instances, this book crosses that line,'' Goord said.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner said the book is not a security risk when read
by the general public, but could be when consumed by the ''violent
and predatory offenders within our system.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the six pages contain information about the
deployment of chemical agents used to control unruly inmates in
state prisons, the holds guards are taught to subdue prisoners, the
duties of corrections officers during disturbances and descriptions
of security issues inside Sing Sing, prison officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The six pages will be cut out of all copies of the books sent or
given to inmates throughout the state prison system, state
officials said. If prisoners decline to have the pages redacted,
they can have the copies sent back to where they came from at
inmates' expense.
</P>
<P>
   Possession of the six pages will be considered contraband and
subject inmates to disciplinary proceedings, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Conover on Tuesday said he knows ''several complete copies'' of
his book are circulating among prisoners at Sing Sing and other
state prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ''This action subjects inmates who own them to severe
punishment, such as Box time (solitary confinement) of weeks or
months,'' Conover said. ''This seems to be grossly unfair and
unwarranted.''
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials said administrators at Sing Sing advised
Goord's media review committee that the pages be excised from
copies of the book on July 11 and the committee Tuesday made its
recommendation to the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Prison spokesman James Flateau declined to give the numbers of
the pages that will be removed from the book.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to give the inmates a table of contents'' of
sections of the book that worry prison administrators, Flateau
said.
</P>
<P>
   Conover wrote ''Newjack,'' prison slang for a rookie guard,
about his experiences working as a corrections officer a few years
ago. Conover said he resolved to write the book after being denied
entry into the state Corrections Academy in Albany while
researching a story for The New York Times Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reason DOCS (the Department of Correctional Services) is
censoring ''Newjack'' is to reinforce their flagging sense of being
in charge, and because I embarrassed them by getting a job after
they wouldn't let me in,'' Conover said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The book describes the pressures of working in an atmosphere
surrounded by murderers, rapists and other violent offenders.
Conover wrote that he began to experience nightmares after only a
few months at Sing Sing while on a vacation in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I knew then was that even though my body was two thousand
miles away, my mind was still trapped in Sing Sing,'' Conover
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Green, head of Albany's Center for Law and Justice, said
Goord's decision is ''very disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is another action in the growing and disturbing effort to
silence people and dissent, and control not only the body but the
minds of prisoners, volunteers and the public,'' she argued.
</P>
<P>
   Green said she had read most of the book and found no security
information that average inmates would not already know.
</P>
<P>
   Green, whose group advocates for inmates, has found her access
to prisons curtailed after prison officials contended she helped
promote a potential strike by inmates timed to coincide with the
arrival of Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The strike never materialized, though state prison
administrators mobilized the system's SWAT teams to deal with
potential disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Conover said the censoring of his book in prison was a
''self-defeating gesture by some narrow-minded people.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is gratuitous and mean-spirited,'' he said. ''Any inmate
who wants to see these missing pages can have a friend send them
through the mail. Heck, I'll send them through the mail.''

<HEADLINE> Camera Expert Will Not Attend Waco  </HEADLINE>
By MATT SLAGLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- A court-appointed expert who was expected to
testify on whether FBI agents shot at the Branch Davidian compound
will not travel from England to the United States after all, a U.S.
District judge ruled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Walter Smith said he decided against requiring David Oxlee
to come to Texas after Michael Caddell, lead plaintiffs' attorney
in a $675 million wrongful death lawsuit filed by surviving
Davidians and family members, said he would not participate in the
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Caddell said he was out of town and would not
comment on the ruling until he had a chance to read it.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has yet to make a final ruling in the case. He gave
plaintiff co-counsels James Brannon and former attorney general
Ramsey Clark 10 days to tell the court if they would travel to
England to depose Oxlee.
</P>
<P>
   An advisory jury ruled July 14 that the government was not
responsible for the deaths of sect members.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, former Missouri senator John Danforth released
preliminary results of a 10-month investigation into the 1993
catastrophe, blaming the Davidians for their own deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Oxlee was an expert with British firm Vector Data Systems Ltd.,
which examined infrared images taken by an aerial FBI surveillance
camera on the final day of a 51-day standoff between federal agents
and the Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   The siege ended with the deaths of some 80 sect members,
including leader David Koresh, from either gunshots or fire.
</P>
<P>
   A court-ordered field test in March simulated aspects of the
siege using heat-sensing FLIR, or forward-looking infrared,
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Vector concluded the flashes on the 1993 tape were reflections
from sunlight as it struck debris on the complex. But Davidian
lawyers insisted gunfire created the flashes.
</P>
<P>
   Smith barred the issue before the June 19 trial began, saying he
wanted Oxlee to review Vector's finding before admitting it into
court. Oxlee was ill and unable to travel to the United States
until August.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman Thom Mrozek said Tuesday's ruling
reaffirmed the government's stance.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government position is that the judge can rule in favor of
the FBI on this spurious allegation that shots were fired into the
compound on April 19. Both the test conducted by Vector and the
analysis by our expert concluded that no gunshots were fired on
that day,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Governors Unveil Salmon Plan  </HEADLINE>
By DAN GALLAGHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- Four governors on Tuesday unveiled a plan to
help boost the recovery of salmon and steelhead populations in the
Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   But sport fishermen and environmentalists said a vital element
is missing from the document -- support for breaching dams along the
salmon migration route from Idaho to the ocean, on the lower Snake
River.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for improving habitat, attacking predators like
birds and marine animals, limiting commercial and sport fishing,
and refocusing some hatchery production toward naturally spawning
fish.
</P>
<P>
   Also recommended is modifying hydropower operations -- but only
without jeopardizing the region's electric supply.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was released by Govs. Dirk Kempthorne of Idaho,
Montana's Marc Racicot, Oregon's John Kitzhaber and Washington's
Gary Locke. In two days, federal fishery managers are scheduled to
unveil recommendations on how hydropower dams should be operated to
foster fish recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Locke estimated the plan could cost ''hundreds of millions,''
but added Bonneville Power Administration ratepayers already are
chipping in huge sums.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will need a substantially increased commitment from the
federal treasury,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The governors urged state, federal and tribal officials to
accept the plan by January.
</P>
<P>
   Sportsmen groups and environmentalists continued to maintain
that breaching dams remains the best solution. The Columbia River
Intertribal Fish Commission has said it also supports breaching.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Bosse of Idaho Rivers United said environmentalists would
sue the government if plans proceed without addressing the
hydropower system.
</P>
<P>
   But Bruce Lovelin of the Columbia River Alliance industry group
applauded the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our Northwest governors believe salmon recovery can continue
without breaching dams,'' he said. ''This should move the region
and federal officials to a more effective and rational recovery
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials have said a decision to breach the dams
will not be addressed for at least eight years and the soonest the
dams could be removed would be 10 years.

<HEADLINE> Russian Module Links Space Station  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOROLYOV, Russia (AP) -- The international space station linked
up Wednesday with the Russian-made Zvezda control module, the
component that will allow the first crew to live and work on the
long-delayed station.
</P>
<P>
   A large screen at Russia's Mission Control showed the components
coming together, then briefly lost contact with the station. Once
it was clear the linkup had been achieved, scientists at Russia's
Mission Control applauded, shook hands with one another and gave
each other thumbs-up signs.
</P>
<P>
   The first crew is set to arrive at the international space
station in October. But the space laboratory, a massive 16-nation
project headed by the United States, will not be complete for
another five years, after more than 40 space flights.
</P>
<P>
   The docking occurred at 4:45 a.m. Moscow time (8:45 p.m. EDT).
Firing the Zvezda's jets several times over the weekend, space
controllers had brought the module into a stationary orbit and
aligned the rest of the station for a smooth approach.
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesday, technicians performed a final test of the
autopilot systems of the Zvezda and the station, which was to be
lowered onto the Russian module.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the maneuvers have worked and the Zvezda is waiting for
the station,'' said Valery Lyndin, the Mission Control spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Space controllers will not know whether the mechanical locking
system worked correctly until about an hour and a half after the
linkup, officials said. During that period, the station was to pass
out of radio contact with Mission Control in Korolyov, just outside
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after docking, Zvezda's solar arrays will begin tracking
the sun, and within a few days, its computers will take full
control of maintaining the station's orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Although the docking should be a routine procedure, Russia was
taking extra precautions with Zvezda, which means ''star'' in
Russian. If anything goes awry, two Russian cosmonauts are on
standby to go into space to do the job manually.
</P>
<P>
   But that scenario is one Russia desperately wants to avoid. The
manual docking system the cosmonauts would use is the same one used
in a 1997 test aboard the Mir space station, when a cargo ship went
astray and collided with the orbiter, puncturing the hull.
</P>
<P>
   Zvezda's flawless launch on July 12 was a relief for both
Russian and American space officials, who called it a major success
for American-Russian space partnership. Since the launch, the
Zvezda's systems have been tested several times and ground
controllers even performed a simulated docking.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of delays and some $3 billion in cost overruns
because of problems on the Russian side, questions had arisen about
Moscow's reliability as a partner, particularly since the Zvezda
was the first module to be built solely by the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the U.S. Congress are questioning whether to
fund NASA's spending projections on the $60 billion project,
particularly after the failed launches of two Mars missions last
year. But they expressed cautious optimism about the Zvezda launch.
</P>
<P>
   A failed ISS docking would be a major setback for the new
station and could delay work on it for at least two more years, if
not call the entire mission into doubt. The Zvezda is crucial for
the station's immediate future, providing living quarters and
steering controls, as well as adjusting the station's orbit and
distributing electricity.
</P>
<P>
   As the station expands, many of the module's functions will be
taken over by other components, but it will remain the heart of the
Russian segments. Once the ISS is complete, it will weigh about one
million pounds and have six laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has also been criticized for keeping the Mir station in
orbit, though Russian space officials maintain the 14-year-old
station is still useful. The Netherlands-based MirCorp, which runs
Mir, announced earlier this month that the station would be
permanently manned beginning early next year, including visits by
''space tourists.''

<HEADLINE> Injury Slows Gymnast Miller  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- If it was just about how she felt, Shannon
Miller would definitely be on the floor at the U.S. Gymnastic
Championships.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Olympic trials less than a month away and her
training interrupted the last two weeks by an injury, she's not
about to take any risks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously I can push it at this point as far as I want to.
That's good. Now it's just getting in the routines,'' she said
Tuesday after arriving for nationals.
</P>
<P>
   The women's competition begins Thursday and concludes Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Miller suffered a hairline crack in her right leg July 6 while
practicing for a qualifying meet for nationals. As a former
Olympian, she was able to petition for direct entry into nationals.
</P>
<P>
   The top 12 gymnasts from nationals advance to next month's
Olympic trials in Boston. If Miller doesn't compete this week, she
would have to petition for a spot at the Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   The squad for the Sydney Olympics will be chosen by a selection
committee, and the combined scores from nationals and Olympic
trials will help determine who makes the team.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have all the respect in the world for Shannon. But I wish
she could be in the competition,'' said Bela Karolyi, the national
team coordinator and a member of the Olympic selection committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish she could experience the competition so I could have
the chance to make a comparison. How does Shannon Miller look
compared to Vanessa Atler? I need the comparison. I want to see her
performing on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   And he still might, said Steve Nunno, Miller's longtime coach.
Miller, America's most decorated gymnast, gets better with each
day, and Nunno said she could be healthy enough to compete by the
end of the week. She was at training Tuesday night, wearing a wrap
around her right knee.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to leave all the doors open,'' Nunno said. ''We're
trying to push this every day a little bit further. What's most
important to us is to have a full rehabilitation but yet we want to
participate in this meet.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a great event, all the players are here. I think it's
essential that we be a part of it,'' he said. ''If we can, by the
end of the week, participate in any fashion, I think it would be
welcomed by the federation.''
</P>
<P>
   If Miller does compete, she wouldn't do all four events,
probably limiting herself to the uneven bars and balance beam,
Nunno said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can push it as this point as far as I want to,'' Miller
said. ''(But) the last thing I want to do is go in unprepared and
reinjure it. So at this point, I may be ready to do everything by
Saturday, but I haven't trained everything.''
</P>
<P>
   And the last thing they want is for Miller to reinjure herself
and miss trials, Nunno said. They saw what happened to Michael
Johnson and Maurice Greene on Sunday at the Olympic track trials.
</P>
<P>
   Greene and Johnson both pulled up lame in the 200 meters, and
neither will compete in that event in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've seen that movie. And it doesn't have a happy ending,''
Nunno said. ''At the same time, I think it's important Shannon
trains with the girls she's going to compete with. That's why she's
here now or we'd be home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I also think it's important that she show she's a player here
and she's not walking in here with any debilitating injury. I think
this team needs her.''

<HEADLINE> Woman sentenced to house arrest following fire house theft  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. (AP) - An 82-year-old woman who admitted to
stealing $51,572 while deputy treasurer for a volunteer department
has been sentenced to four months of house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was contrite and confessed her role,'' District Attorney
Robert M. Carney said of defendant Dorothy G. Aubrey's punishment.
''Given her age and circumstances, I don't think anyone felt jail
was required.''
</P>
<P>
   The money disappeared from the Rotterdam District 2 Fire
Department when Aubrey took over bookkeeping duties from her
husband, who was ill. She assumed the title of deputy treasurer
when he died in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, police said Aubrey sent much of the money to a
grandson serving in the military.
</P>
<P>
   While under house arrest, Aubrey will be monitored by the
Schenectady County Probation Department, which makes random calls
and visits to the prisoner's home.
</P>
<P>
   Aubrey must also repay the money.

<HEADLINE> Passengers killed in Concorde crash were just beginning a luxury tour </HEADLINE>
By COLLEEN BARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) - The Concorde flight from Paris to New York was
just the first stage in a world-class luxury tour.
</P>
<P>
   The Germany-based Deilmann Shipping Co. had booked at least 99
passengers killed in the crash near Paris' Charles de Gaulle
airport on a 16-day Caribbean cruise from New York, through the
Panama Canal, to Ecuador aboard the five-star MS Deutschland
passenger ship.
</P>
<P>
   This was a trip to savor. Champagne on the Concorde, traveling
at twice the speed of sound over the Atlantic. Then, a leisurely
cruise on the MS Deutschland ocean liner built two years ago to
evoke the Roaring '20s, featuring crystal chandeliers, an imperial
ballroom and loom chairs in a palm-filled winter garden.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's even a salt-water swimming pool sheltered by a glazed
promenade in case you want to take a dip,'' says the description on
the shipping company's Web site. It boasts a Lido Deck that offers
a view of approaching ports: Norfolk, Va., for a day at the beach,
a tour of the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla., and a
stop in Havana, Cuba, before slipping through the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag for the cruise - the Concorde flight was extra -
$3,400 for a shared cabin, and $11,065 for a suite with an ocean
view.
</P>
<P>
   From Ecuador, passengers might catch a flight back to Frankfurt.
Or opt to continue on the ship's next leg, 19 days to Tahiti for
$5,500 - with an option to continue to Sydney, Australia - arriving
on Sept. 14 - a day before the opening ceremonies at the Summer
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise was marketed for the wealthy northern European
traveler craving warm summer seas.
</P>
<P>
   Tour operator Peter Deilmann said the cruise, which had a total
of 510 passengers booked, would not be canceled. ''There's no sense
letting the ship lie there,'' he said. ''Life goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   His company had offered Concorde-cruise combinations three times
before, but added, ''there won't be anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Deilmann said he provided a list of the 99 passengers his
company had booked on the Concorde to the Germany Foreign Ministry,
but declined to release any names or hometowns.
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Ministry said the list included 49 men, 47 women and
three children. All were from Germany except for two Danes and an
Austrian. The list was broken down by states, but a spokesman said
no more exact information would be released.
</P>
<P>
   Six couples and a child were from the northern city of
Moenchengladbach, near the Dutch border, where officials
accompanied by grief counselors were working off a travel agency
list to notify relatives, said police spokesman Joachim Jagielski.
</P>
<P>
   Air France said nine crew members and a retired Air France
employee - an American - on board were also killed.
</P>
<P>
   In Berlin, 30 people at the Foreign Ministry crisis office were
trying to contact relatives and arrange transportation to the
accident scene.
</P>
<P>
   Deilmann, the tour operator, said he was ''deeply dismayed'' by
the crash and expressed his sympathy to the victims' relatives.
Speaking to reporters at the cruise company's headquarters in the
Baltic port city of Neustadt in Holstein, he said two company
representatives from Germany would join two others in France on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder canceled his evening
appointments to stay on top of developments, and issued his deepest
condolences after speaking with French President Jacques Chirac and
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
</P>
<P>
   ''Germany and France are united in their horror over the
accident, in mourning for the victims and in sympathy for their
families,'' Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor sent his transport minister, Reinhard Klimmt, to
the scene and the German Foreign Ministry has set up a second
crisis center at the German Embassy in Paris, which was helping to
identify the dead.
</P>
<P>
   The entire German Cabinet, headed by Schroeder, will attend an
ecumenical service for the victims of the crash Wednesday in
Hanover at a chapel located on the grounds of the World's Fair. The
Cabinet had been scheduled to hold the last regular meeting before
its summer break at the German pavilion of Expo 2000.

<HEADLINE> Four witnesses testify at inquiry in death of Connecticut artist  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROAD TOWN, British Virgin Islands (AP) - Four witnesses
testified Tuesday at an inquiry to determine whether four Americans
should stand trial in the slaying of a Connecticut artist.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing at the Eastern Caribbean High Court is to continue
this week, with a forensic expert expected to give results of DNA
tests on Friday, trial sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Such inquiries are not open to the public and defense lawyers
said they were barred from revealing details of testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The drowned body of artist Lois Livingston McMillen of
Middlebury, Conn., was discovered by a roadside Jan. 15. She had
been staying at her family's vacation home on Tortola in the
British Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects are Michael Spicer, 36, a law student from
Washington, D.C., and a longtime neighbor of the McMillen's on
Tortola, and his house guests: Evan George, 22, a construction
worker from Washington; investment banker William Labrador, 36, of
Southampton, N.Y.; and Alexander Benedetto, 34, who works for a
book publisher in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   All deny the charges and deny being with McMillen the night she
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   They have been jailed since their arrests soon after the body
was found. If convicted, they could be sentenced to life in prison.

<HEADLINE> Black Leaders Push To Restore Vote  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional black leaders are pushing to
restore the federal government's authority to veto changes in state
and local election districts, saying a Supreme Court ruling leaves
districts vulnerable to discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling ''just doesn't make any sense,'' said Rep. Mel Watt,
D-N.C., author of a measure addressing the issue to be introduced
Wednesday. ''It means . . . that it would be more difficult to get
additional minority districts.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., chairman of the Congressional
Black Caucus, ''This legislation is basically to clear up the
legislative intent'' of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court in January ruled that the government cannot
reject proposed changes in election systems -- even if they are
discriminatory -- so long as the changes leave minorities no worse
off than they were before.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling which stems from a Louisiana case applies to the 1965
federal Voting Rights Act's requirement that all or part of 16
states get government or court clearance before implementing new
election districts, for example, or switching to an at-large voting
plan.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the court that
such government clearance has ''limited meaning'' and ''is nothing
more than a determination that the voting change is no more
dilutive than what it replaces.
</P>
<P>
   ''Preclearance under (the law) affirms nothing but the absence
of backsliding,'' Scalia wrote.
</P>
<P>
   After an election change is cleared, Scalia said, it still can
be challenged under another section of the Voting Rights Act that
prohibits any voting practice that would dilute minority voters'
clout.
</P>
<P>
   But Watt said the ruling could be used to prevent additional
minority districts -- and the government would have little recourse.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he said, if a jurisdiction with a minority
district increases in minority representation after the census, the
federal government could not force that area to develop a new
minority district to reflect the new numbers.

<HEADLINE> Moynihan asks Lazio to have TV ad withdrawn  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Claiming a new television advertisement
linking him to Senate candidate Rick Lazio is misleading, Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan on Tuesday demanded the Long Island
congressman have it withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not believe you would wish to be associated with this
species of soft money fakery,'' wrote Moynihan, who is backing
fellow Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton in the U.S. Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not our ad,'' Lazio campaign spokesman Dan McLagan said.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a TV ad unveiled Monday by the moderate Republican
Leadership Council that uses the words of President Clinton to link
Lazio and Moynihan, a Democrat whose retirement at the end of this
year has prompted the campaign between Republican Lazio and the
first lady.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-second spot relies on footage of the president thanking
Moynihan, Lazio and others at a December ceremony in Washington for
their work on legislation to help disabled Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''There follows a composite photograph of the two of us,
although we have never, to my belief, been photographed together,''
Moynihan wrote in his letter to Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan noted he wasn't even at the event, ''but I was at that
moment meeting with the editorial board of (the Long Island
newspaper) Newsday in Melville, Long Island.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd pass along Senator Moynihan's letter to the RLC if I knew
their phone number,'' Lazio aide McLagan said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, RLC officials had defended the ad, the second of
which has used the president's own words to boost Lazio's
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Her husband said it first ... We're following his lead,'' said
Mark Miller, executive director of the RLC. Miller said the group
expects to spend $1 million by Labor Day on such advertising.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Miller said Moynihan was writing to the wrong
person.
</P>
<P>
   ''Respectfully, Moynihan can write Lazio all he wants, but he
has nothing to do with this ad,'' the RLC official said. ''If
there's anything misleading in this ad, I don't know what he's
talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the split-screen composite shot of Lazio and
Moynihan, Miller said, ''I didn't ask either of them for
permission. They're public figures who worked on an important bill
and I highlighted them both in a complimentary way.''

<HEADLINE> Ecuador 0, Colombia 0, Tie  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Colombia gained a scoreless tie at Ecuador in a World
Cup
qualifier on Tuesday night, a day before Brazil and Argentina meet
in a key matchup.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Colombia (2-1-3) moved into third place with nine points
following the game at Quito, trailing Argentina (5-0) and Uruguay
(3-1-1).
</P>
<P>
   Paraguay (3-2) is fourth, followed by Brazil (2-1-2), Ecuador
(2-3-1) and Peru, Chile and Bolivia (1-1-3), all tied for seventh.
Venezuela (1-4) is last.
</P>
<P>
   The top four nations qualify for the 32-nation field at the 2002
World Cup, and the fifth-place team meets the Oceania champion in a
playoff for another berth.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's game at Sao Paulo will mark the first-ever meeting
between Argentina in a qualifier. Before the 1998 tournament, South
American qualifying was split into groups, and Brazil qualified
automatically for the last World Cup as defending champion.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a good test for our team, and for Argentina, too,''
said Rivaldo, FIFA's player of the year. ''If Brazil wins this one,
everyone will forget what happened, because beating Argentina has a
special taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Argentina felt the same.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is beautiful to play against Brazil because there is so
much prestige at stake,'' Javier Zanetti said. ''It is the game the
Argentines most want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Cafu, Brazil's captain, will miss the game because of a one-game
suspension for his ejection against Paraguay last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody talks about Argentina, but they did the same at the
pre-Olympic tournament and we won,'' Brazil coach Wanderley
Luxemburgo said. ''They have to respect Brazilian soccer.''

<HEADLINE> Mariners' Rodriguez Starts  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- All-Star shortstop Alex Rodriguez was back in the
Seattle Mariners' starting lineup Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I put him in there,'' manager Lou Piniella said. ''He's ready
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh, I know that lineup,'' second baseman Mark McLemore said
with a smile. ''New player.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella put Rodriguez into the lineup after taking a long look
at him take batting and fielding practice before the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners were 9-5 without Rodriguez and went into Tuesday
night's game with Oakland with a five-game lead over the Athletics
and Anaheim in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Guillen, who replaced Rodriguez at shortstop when he was
sidelined with a sprained right knee and a concussion, was moved to
third base. He was seventh in the batting order.
</P>
<P>
   David Bell, who has been playing third base for Seattle, was
given the night off.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who will be 25 on Thursday, is one of baseball's top
players. He was hitting .345 with 84 runs scored, 24 home runs and
78 RBIs in 84 games. He was supposed to start in the All-Star game
in Atlanta two weeks ago, but had to miss the game because of his
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   He came off the disabled list Monday night, but did not play in
the game, a 6-4 victory by Seattle over the A's.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was hurt when he attempted to break up a double play
against the Los Angeles Dodgers July 7 and was hit in the head by
shortstop Alex Cora's knee. He twisted his knee as he fell to the
infield.

<HEADLINE> Judge rules against PETA in fiberglass cow caper  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Despite meaty First Amendment issues, a judge
ruled Tuesday it was OK for sponsors of a citywide bovine sculpture
exhibit to reject designs by an animal rights group.
</P>
<P>
   Among the artsy fiberglass cows suggested by the People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals was a heifer claiming that eating meat
causes impotence.
</P>
<P>
   But in a written ruling, Judge Victor Marrero denied PETA's
request to force CowParade organizers and city officials to add an
extra cow to the 500 on show between June 15 and Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real losers in this situation are the animals. Our cow was
supposed to let people know that eating meat was a health hazard
and promotes cruelty to animals,'' said Bruce Friedrich, a PETA
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   He promised an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   One of PETA's doomed designs divided the cow into sections
resembling a butcher shop chart showing which cuts of meat came
from which part of the cow. Each of the nine panels had an
anti-meat message. Three were rejected, including:
</P>
<P>
   -''Cattle are castrated and dehorned without anesthesia.''
</P>
<P>
   -''A lot of times the man skinning the cow finds out an animal
is still conscious.''
</P>
<P>
   -''Eating meat causes impotence because it blocks the arteries
to all vital organs, including the penis - Dr. Dean Ornish, Medical
Adviser to President Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Among four other designs nixed were a caricature of Monica
Lewinsky, which was turned away as a ''gratuitous personal
attack;'' and a cow with a rubber ''stamp of approval,'' which was
considered a political poke at Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 1,200 designs were accepted by the CowParade committee,
including one from PETA. It's a cow covered with imitation leather
products including boots, belts, jackets and a soccer ball and the
message ''buy fake for the COW'S sake.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Marrero said PETA raised important First Amendment issues
in its request to join the exhibit of life-size fiberglass cow
sculptures, but he also said the CowParade committee was within its
rights to reject some designs. The judge said he reached his
conclusion because the guidelines regarding designs were spelled
out to each applicant.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ruled that restrictions on content were reasonable and
do ''not burden speech any more than necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Marrero said PETA would be free to seek a city permit to protest
or to deliver its messages ''using every available means of
communication, even in front of every one of the more than 500 cows
sponsored in the exhibit and even if the content of its message may
offend the sensibilities of some or all members of the public.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge said the city would face strict First Amendment
scrutiny if it rejected a permit request by PETA.

<HEADLINE> Storms Strike Minnesota  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRANITE FALLS, Minn. (AP) -- High winds and possibly several
tornadoes hit this southwestern Minnesota town Tuesday night,
injuring some people and doing significant damage to buildings.
</P>
<P>
   KSTP-TV and KARE-TV reported one person was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Snowplows were clearing roads so emergency vehicles could get to
the injured, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A rescue command post was set up at the technical college in
town, said City Manager Bill Lavin, who could not confirm the
fatality nor the number of injured.
</P>
<P>
   He said he ''very definitely'' saw a tornado, both on the ground
and then go back into the clouds. He said he heard ''the typical
train sound and the popping of the ear drums as it went over
head.''
</P>
<P>
   Rescue vehicles from towns in a 40-mile radius were dispatched
to Granite Falls, a town of about 3,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service issued a tornado warning at 6:17
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   One witness, Deborah Krepela, said she was standing outside of
the restaurant she runs and saw a tornado pass through the middle
of town. It hit homes, and ''debris was flying everywhere,'' she
said.

<HEADLINE> Fox Wants To Overhaul Mexico Police  </HEADLINE>
By NIKO PRICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Aides to President-elect Vicente Fox are
planning a top-to-bottom overhaul of Mexico's corrupt police
forces, perhaps even creating a new, ''universal'' police that
would enforce both federal and state laws.
</P>
<P>
   Even before he won a stunning victory July 2 that ended 71 years
of single-party rule, Fox had pledged to separate the police from
politics, and investigators from prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   His proposal includes removing federal police from the powerful
Interior Secretariat and dissolving the federal attorney general's
office. Police duties would go to a new Public Security Secretariat
and its prosecutorial arm would be a new, separate agency.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's top public security adviser, Francisco Molina, outlined
those plans in local newspaper interviews published Tuesday, saying
the transition team is considering a complete overhaul of Mexico's
policing structure.
</P>
<P>
   ''The current regime's anti-crime politics have been erratic,
reactive, characterized by repression as a working style,'' he told
the newspaper El Universal.
</P>
<P>
   He told El Universal that he wanted to stop using soldiers to
fight drugs, saying drug smuggling is not a national security
problem, but rather a crime problem to be dealt with by police.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the newspaper Reforma, Molina said one
proposal is to create a ''universal'' police force capable of
enforcing all laws, both state and federal, to eliminate confusion
about jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Fox spokeswoman Martha Sahagun told The Associated Press on
Tuesday that he didn't intend to dissolve state police forces, but
that the proposal on the table is to replace a force that Fox's
main presidential challenger, Francisco Labastida, created early
last year when he was interior secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is referring to the Federal Preventative Police, which
Labastida invented and which has never done any good,'' Sahagun
said.
</P>
<P>
   She also stressed that proposals being drafted haven't yet been
presented to Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Molina said such a proposal would have to be put to governors,
state assemblies and state political leaders for consideration. It
would appear to require both federal and state constitutional
amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Molina, a senator for Fox's National Action Party and the former
director of the National Institute for Fighting Drugs, said the
changes were needed to end the corruption that has pervaded current
police forces.

<HEADLINE> Albanians, Serbs Seek Tolerance  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A group of Kosovo Albanians and Serbs met for
three days at a retreat outside Washington and agreed on the need
to promote tolerance and condemn violence in their deeply divided
homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian Bishop Artemije Radosavljevic called the document agreed
to by the parties the first positive declaration reached by Serb
and Albanian communities in 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   The July 21-23 conclave was organized the State Department and
the U.S. Institute of Peace, a government-backed think tank.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time that Kosovo leaders directly discussed
their divisions and on how to overcome them. There were 25 Kosovo
Albanians and 14 Kosovo Serbs represented at the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The province remains painfully divided more than a year after
the U.S.-led air war over Yugoslavia ended, and after the arrival
of the United Nations and the NATO-led peacekeeping force. Their
efforts to forge a united Kosovo have made little headway.
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador John Menzies, director of the State Department Office
of Kosovo Implementation, told a news conference Tuesday the
participants showed tremendous courage by their attendance at the
event.
</P>
<P>
   ''Perhaps the most difficult decision in a peace process is the
choice to meet the other, and to work together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this meeting, the participants crossed that threshold. The
event featured a productive, useful and yet emotional and difficult
dialogue among the participants.''
</P>
<P>
   The parties agreed to launch a new initiative -- a ''Campaign
Against Violence.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a joint declaration, it will include efforts to
promote tolerance, condemn violence, prevent negative exploitation
of ethnic issues and enable ''the physical integration and
political participation by all.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign ''will include a Day Against Violence on a date set
by the Kosovo Transitional Council,'' the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
   It added that Kosovo leaders from the two main ethnic groups
will visit local communities throughout the province to promote the
campaign and seek to convince people that the time for
reintegration has come.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also cited the need for democratic development of
the province and a for a free news media.
</P>
<P>
   All agreed that the media ''can and should work together to
prevent violence and promote coexistence,'' the declaration said.

<HEADLINE> Blast Tears Through Kansas Building  </HEADLINE>
By CARL MANNING
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN, Kan. (AP) -- A natural gas explosion tore through a
downtown apartment building Tuesday, engulfing the building in fire
and cutting electricity to a large part of the area.
</P>
<P>
   All of the building's 21 residents were accounted for,
authorities said. One suffered a minor injury and was treated at
the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard a noise; it sounded like a sonic boom,'' said Jeremy
Alldredge, who has lived in the building for about three months.
''I looked out the window and saw smoke, gathered up a few things
and went outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoke hung over the city immediately after the blast and was
visible for several miles. At least two vehicles were smashed by
falling bricks as the building's front side collapsed into the
street.
</P>
<P>
   Fire was contained to the apartment building, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke was visible for several miles as the building continued to
burn at least two hours after the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a big explosion, and it shook my bed, and jumped my bed
up,'' said Doris Shorter, who lives in a neighboring building. ''I
looked and I saw the whole building just coming down on the cars.
It smashed them like pancakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan, in the northeastern part of the state, has a
population of about 42,000 and is home to Kansas State University.

<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Barney Keep, who spent 35 years as KEX's
morning-drive gab king, died Saturday of complications of
Alzheimer's disease. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Keep was known for making listeners laugh, but also wince and
squirm with his acerbic brand of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Keep was a fixture in front of the microphone every weekday
morning between 1944 and 1979, when he did his last show before a
packed house at Portland Civic Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   He did his first show in 1944 at KEX, and nothing and nobody
were safe for the next 35 years -- not even his sponsors.

</P>
<P>
   FARMINGTON, Conn. (AP) -- Olcott Damon Smith, the former chairman
of Aetna Life &AMP; Casualty Co. credited with helping the insurer gain
an international foothold, died Monday. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   He served as Aetna's chairman from 1963 to 1972. At that time,
the company began to broaden its insurance operations outside the
United States and moved into financial services.
</P>
<P>
   Under his guidance, Aetna entered the field of mutual funds,
real estate development and commercial finance, and became one of
the first insurers to list its stock on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also was a retired partner at the Hartford law firm, Day
Berry &AMP; Howard where he specialized in representing utility
companies with mergers and rate requests.
Fate Thomas:
</P>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Former Davidson County Sheriff Fate
Thomas, a popular and influential power-broker who served four
years in jail for abusing his authority, died Tuesday following
heart bypass surgery. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and six others were indicted in 1990 on 54 counts of
abusing power, including a charge that the sheriff's department
paid for the spareribs, pork shoulders and chicken used in Thomas'
campaign barbecues. Another charge was that Thomas and others
pocketed money allegedly paid to non-existent department employees.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas pleaded in 1990 guilty to theft, mail fraud and tax
conspiracy. He was sentenced to five years in prison and fined
$80,150.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas owned a Nashville barbecue restaurant when he made his
first run for office, losing a 1954 race for the state Legislature.
He was elected sheriff in 1972 and served 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   He built support for his favorite candidates -- and political
allies for himself -- by organizing barbecues and other
fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the state's most prominent politicians, including former
Govs. Ned McWherter and Lamar Alexander, contributed to a fund to
help Thomas retire a tax debt after he got out of prison.

<HEADLINE> Grenade Injures 18 in Philippines  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- A grenade exploded outside a busy
coffee shop in Jolo in the southern Philippines early Tuesday,
injuring at least 18 people, one critically, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second grenade attack in two days in Jolo, the
capital of an island where the extremist Muslim Abu Sayyaf group is
holding about 30 hostages, about half of them foreigners, in jungle
hide-outs.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said an unidentified man threw the grenade at the
coffee shop, which is near a crowded market.
</P>
<P>
   ''Someone shouted 'grenade' and everyone began running,'' said
one of the wounded, Evelyn Dinsing. ''Then it exploded.''
</P>
<P>
   No suspects were immediately identified by police.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a suspected Abu Sayyaf rebel riding a motorcycle
threw a grenade at Jolo's Roman Catholic Cathedral and sped away. A
driver working for a nearby Catholic school was injured by
shrapnel.
</P>
<P>
   On June 2, a grenade blast near the church caused no injuries
and little damage.
</P>
<P>
   In May, seven people were killed and dozens of others were
wounded when three grenades exploded inside the local market.
</P>
<P>
   Jolo, capital of Sulu province, is about 590 miles south of
Manila.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Rico Marks 48th Anniversary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BARCELONETA, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Thousands converged on this
coastal town to celebrate 48 years since Puerto Rico was declared a
U.S. ''commonwealth'' on Wednesday -- a date also marking 102 years
since invading U.S. troops wrested the Caribbean island from Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The commemoration comes at a time of growing foment over Puerto
Rico's unusual ties to the United States -- a debate marked by
growing nationalism among these Spanish speakers and a bitter
dispute with the U.S. Navy over its bombing range on outlying
Vieques Island.
</P>
<P>
   As revelers waved Puerto Rican and U.S. flags, danced to salsa
music and downed soft drinks in the blazing heat, opposition
gubernatorial candidate Sila Calderon pledged that if victorious in
November she would repel any move to make Puerto Rico the 51st U.S.
state.
</P>
<P>
   But her loudest cheers came when she championed Vieques, where
the accidental bombing death of a civilian guard last year
unleashed a storm of protest laced with anti-Americanism. ''We are
united with Vieques and will continue to be firm!'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In San Juan, pro-statehood Gov. Pedro Rossello held a more
modest ceremony emphasizing the creation of the Puerto Rican
constitution as part of the 1952 deal with the United States
establishing commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
   Under the unusual arrangement, the 4 million Puerto Ricans are
U.S. citizens who can serve in the army and receive billions of
dollars from the federal government. But they do not pay federal
taxes, do not have a voting U.S. Congress member and cannot vote
for president.
</P>
<P>
   A series of nonbinding referendums on upgrading the ties to full
statehood -- the last in 1998 -- have proven inconclusive and deeply
divisive. A small minority of Puerto Ricans supports full
independence.

<HEADLINE> Russia Craft Links to Space Station  </HEADLINE>
By NICK WADHAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOROLYOV, Russia (AP) -- Russian scientists linked the
international space station Wednesday with its Russian-made control
module, a key component that will allow the first crew to live and
work on the long-delayed station.
</P>
<P>
   A large screen at Russia's Mission Control showed the components
coming together, then briefly lost contact with the station. Once
it was clear the linkup had been achieved, the scientists
applauded, shook hands and gave each other thumbs-up signs.
</P>
<P>
   With the linkup to the Zvezda control module, the station is
ready for its first crew, due to arrive in October. But the space
laboratory, a massive 16-nation project headed by the United
States, will not be complete for another five years, after more
than 40 space flights.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the Russian Aerospace Agency, Yuri Koptev, was
exultant. He told his American counterpart Daniel Goldin over a
speakerphone that the docking was ''more proof that we can work
together.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to say that all of us here are in a great mood,''
Koptev told the NASA chief. ''We know that it was our cooperation
that brought about this great event. We count on our plans this
year and over the next seven years also working out in the same
way.''
</P>
<P>
   After two years of delays and some $3 billion in cost overruns
because of problems on the Russian side, questions had arisen about
Moscow's reliability as a partner, particularly since the Zvezda
was the first module to be built solely by the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-ton cylindrical Zvezda -- which means ''star'' in Russian
-- is crucial for the station's immediate future, providing living
quarters and steering controls and distributing electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The docking occurred at 4:45 a.m. Moscow time (8:45 p.m. EDT).
Space controllers will not know whether the mechanical locking
system worked correctly for an hour and a half while the station
passes out of radio contact with Mission Control in Korolyov, just
out of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after docking, Zvezda's solar arrays will begin tracking
the sun, and within a few days, its computers will take full
control of maintaining the station's orbit.
</P>
<P>
   After Zvezda's flawless July 12 launch, Russia was taking extra
precautions with Zvezda's linkup, with two Russian cosmonauts are
on standby to go into space to do the job manually if the docking
went awry.
</P>
<P>
   But that scenario was one Russia desperately wanted to avoid.
The manual docking system the cosmonauts would use is the same one
used in a 1997 test aboard the Mir space station, when a cargo ship
went astray and collided with the orbiter, puncturing the hull.
</P>
<P>
   Space controllers fired Zvezda's jets several times over the
weekend to bring it into a stationary order and align it with the
rest of the station -- currently made of two other modules -- for a
smooth approach.
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesday, technicians performed a final test of the
autopilot systems of the Zvezda and the station, before beginning
to maneuver the station toward the new piece.
</P>
<P>
   A failed ISS docking would be a major setback for the new
station and could delay work on it for at least two more years, if
not call the entire mission into doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the U.S. Congress are questioning whether to
fund NASA's spending projections on the $60 billion project,
particularly after the failed launches of two Mars missions last
year. But they expressed cautious optimism about the Zvezda launch.
</P>
<P>
   The station is now made up of the Zarya module, built by Russia
with U.S. funds and launched in November 1998, and the NASA-built
Unity connecting chamber, launched in December 1998. The next major
piece to be added is the U.S.-built Destiny science module, the
center of the station's research activity, due to be launched in
January.
</P>
<P>
   As the station expands, many of the module's functions will be
taken over by other components, but it will remain the heart of the
Russian segments. Once the ISS is complete, it will weigh about one
million pounds and have six laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has also been criticized for keeping the Mir station in
orbit, though Russian space officials maintain the 14-year-old
station is still useful. The Netherlands-based MirCorp, which runs
Mir, announced earlier this month that the station would be
permanently manned beginning early next year, including visits by
''space tourists.''

<HEADLINE> Poll: Gore Leads Among Blacks  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican George W. Bush is working to appeal
to blacks and Hispanics, but both groups lean heavily toward
Democrat Al Gore in the presidential race, says a new poll.
</P>
<P>
   An ABC News-Washington Post poll released Tuesday finds that the
vice president is backed by eight of 10 blacks and six of 10
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was supported by 12 percent of blacks and 35 percent of
Hispanics surveyed. But Bush is supported by 54 percent of whites
in the poll, compared with 39 percent for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advantage among these groups is aided by their preference
for more government services.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics and blacks said they favored a larger government with
many services, while two-thirds of whites favored smaller
government with fewer services. The approach to smaller government
is a more Republican point of view.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was 24 points behind Gore among Hispanics, compared with a
36-point deficit for President Bush in 1992 and a 51-point deficit
for Bob Dole in 1996. Other recent polls have given Gore a 13 to 20
point lead among Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Bush got almost half of the Hispanic vote in Texas in his 1998
landslide re-election as governor, speaks Spanish and has a nephew
of Mexican descent who campaigns for him.
</P>
<P>
   While Hispanics only made up 5 percent of the voter turnout in
1998, they can make more difference in key states like Florida,
Texas and California.
</P>
<P>
   Four of five blacks identified themselves as Democratic, while
just over half of Hispanics said they were Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The most important issues for Hispanics were health care,
education, moral standards and Social Security. Blacks were most
likely to pick health care, education, Social Security and the
economy.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> 13 individuals, six companies charged in roofing industry schemes  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A Manhattan grand jury has indicted 13 people
and six companies on charges of bribery, money laundering and other
schemes related to roofing work on schools and other publicly owned
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   One of two indictments unsealed Tuesday also charges eight
people and five companies with enterprise corruption - New York's
anti-racketeering law - and the second charges six people and two
companies with various counts.
</P>
<P>
   The first indictment alleges a group of defendants called ''the
Delancey Group,'' paid union officials to let contractors use
nonunion roofers on union projects.
</P>
<P>
   The payments bought labor peace and non-enforcement of union
work rules, and they let contractors save money. District Attorney
Robert Morgenthau said union roofers got $42 an hour and benefits,
and nonunion workers got $18.50.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau said corrupt officials of Local 8 of the United Union
of Roofers, Waterproofers and Allied Workers ''accepted tens of
thousands of dollars in bribes to allow crooked contractors use
nonunion labor'' to work on public schools in all five boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   They also took bribes to let contractors use nonunion workers at
LaGuardia Airport in Queens and at the Merrill Lynch Teleport in
Staten Island, he said. The bribes were about 10 percent of a job's
cost, which ranged from about $50,000 to $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Local 8 for comment were not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Bornstein, vice president of the city's School Construction
Authority (SCA) said inspections of the schools and other
facilities so far have raised no concerns about safety.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Daniel Castleman, chief of
Morgenthau's Investigations Bureau, said there was never any issue
of shoddy work.
</P>
<P>
   The Delancey Group allegedly laundered its money at Central
Cleaners, a dry cleaning store in Passaic that was owned by Joseph
Delancey, a nonunion contractor. In 1999, the cleaners laundered $1
million, Morgenthau said.
</P>
<P>
   He said large checks, written by contractors in on the bribery
scheme, were deposited into a Central Cleaners account and Delancey
would withdraw cash and buy money orders for bribe payments.
</P>
<P>
   A second indictment alleges that Anthony Caggiano, owner of a
union roofing and waterproofing contractor, Princeton Restoration
Corp., created a phony supply company to launder money for bribes
and cash payrolls.
</P>
<P>
   In the five months ending October 1998, the phony company
cleaned 47 checks worth $332,000, Morgenthau said.
</P>
<P>
   Enterprise corruption is punishable by up to 25 years in prison.
The bribery charges are punishable by up to seven years, and the
fraud charges carry a four-year penalty.

<HEADLINE> Coffee, Rheumatoid Arthritis Linked  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A new study raises the possibility that people who
drink a lot of coffee might be more likely to develop the
debilitating immune system disease rheumatoid arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   The Finnish study, published this week in the British Medical
Association journal Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, found that
people who drank more than three cups a day had twice the chance of
getting the disease as those who drank less.
</P>
<P>
   While the study does not prove drinking coffee causes rheumatoid
arthritis, it is the first to produce evidence of a possible link.
Some experts said it was worth investigating further, while others
questioned whether the findings could be true.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists do not know what causes rheumatoid arthritis, which
afflicts about 1 percent of people, including more than 2 million
Americans, and is incurable. But recent studies have raised
suspicions about smoking and obesity.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the type of arthritis common in the elderly because
of the wear-and-tear of aging. Rheumatoid arthritis occurs when the
immune system goes awry and attacks the joints, causing severe
inflammation, pain and stiffness.
</P>
<P>
   The new study followed the coffee drinking habits of 19,000
Finnish people over 15 years. None had rheumatoid arthritis when
the study began in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   By 1989, 0.5 percent of those who drank more than three cups of
coffee developed rheumatoid arthritis. About 0.2 percent of the
people who drank three cups of coffee a day or less got the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   The study hypothesized that some unidentified ingredient in
coffee may trigger the production of rheumatoid factor, an antibody
that can be detected in the blood years before the onset of
arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Finns are heavy coffee drinkers, there weren't
enough nondrinkers to make a comparison that might show how
important a role coffee drinking might be, said one of the study's
authors, Dr. Kimmo Aho, a professor of immunology at the National
Public Health Institute in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. David Isenberg, director of the Center for Rheumatology
at University College, London University, said he was skeptical of
the study's conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Finland has a high rate of coffee drinking, why doesn't it
have a higher prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis than other
countries?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 1 percent of Finns get the disease -- a similar rate to
other nationalities.
</P>
<P>
   Isenberg also said he was suspicious of the findings because the
study did not adjust the results to eliminate the influence of
other factors that may have played a role in the development of the
disease
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a chance that you will find something that randomly
correlates -- which means it might be a fluke,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Bacon, professor of rheumatology at the University of
Birmingham in England, said the findings were worthy of further
study.
</P>
<P>
   ''You want to know what's going on in other countries to see if
there really is an effect or if there is something else at work
related both to coffee drinking and rheumatoid arthritis, or if it
has something to do with the way they drink coffee in Finland,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Aho said it was impossible to tell whether one type of coffee
could be worse than another, but that the effect might be linked to
the way the Finns prepared the coffee.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that boiled coffee was popular in Scandinavia until
filtered coffee became dominant in the 1980s. Instant coffee is not
drunk by many people there, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boiled coffee, which is made by boiling coffee grounds in a pot
then leaving them on low heat all day, gets more concentrated as
the day wears on.
</P>
<P>
   Aho said he believed that if the effect is real, it may be
because the coffee was boiled. He said he suspected espresso coffee
may produce a similar effect because it also is concentrated.

<HEADLINE> IRS Recognizes Coalition Was Exempt  </HEADLINE>
By SONJA BARISIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the
Internal Revenue Service to refund taxes paid by the Christian
Coalition for 1990 after the IRS conceded the organization of
religious conservatives was tax-exempt for that year.
</P>
<P>
   The order ended a lawsuit alleging that the IRS unfairly denied
the coalition's application for tax-exempt status because the
agency disagreed with the politics of the group, founded by
religious broadcaster Pat Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything we asked for in the complaint we got today,'' said
Jay Sekulow, chief counsel of the American Center for Law and
Justice, which represented the Chesapeake-based coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The case was never about the amount of the tax -- $169.26 -- but
about forcing the IRS to acknowledge the coalition's tax exemption,
Sekulow said. He said the government's concession over 1990 should
prevent the IRS from seeking taxes from the coalition after that
year as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the government to deny tax exemption for any other year
would be disingenuous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Charles Miller, a spokesman for the Justice Department
that represented the IRS in the case, said the ruling ''does not
apply to any other tax year.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Henry Morgan Jr. issued the order during a
30-minute hearing on the government's request to dismiss the
coalition's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition, established in 1989 following Robertson's failed
presidential bid a year earlier, became a major force in Republican
politics in the 1990s by mobilizing conservative voters through
grassroots activities.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of review, the IRS concluded last year that some
of the activities, such as the distribution of voter guides at
churches nationwide, were too partisan for the coalition to have
tax-exempt status.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, the federal court in Washington threw out most of
the charges in a lawsuit by the Federal Election Commission that
challenged the coalition's voter guides and accused the Christian
Coalition of illegally aiding Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition's lawsuit, filed in February, contended that the
coalition's activities provide educational information, are
nonpartisan and promote social welfare.

<HEADLINE> France Jet Crash Kills at Least 113  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA DOLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   GONESSE, France (AP) -- With flames and smoke streaking from its
engines, an Air France Concorde carrying German tourists to New
York for a Caribbean cruise crashed into a hotel outside Paris
shortly after takeoff Tuesday. At least 113 people died.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first fatal crash for the needle-nosed supersonic
aircraft, and all other Concordes -- for 30 years the pride of
French and British aviation for their luxury, safety and speed --
were grounded.
</P>
<P>
   Air France said one of the plane's four engines appeared to have
failed. Some witnesses reported that an engine burst into flame
even before the plane left the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers on flight AF4590, chartered by a German tourist
agency, included 96 Germans, two Danes, one Austrian and one
American, as well as nine crew members, the airline said. The
American was a retired Air France employee, but the company did not
release a name. Four other people were killed at the small hotel
leveled in the crash, the Interior Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   A pall of acrid smoke rose from the blackened wreckage and over
the wheat fields at Gonesse, a small town near Paris' Charles de
Gaulle airport. Firefighters sprayed the rubble with water, and the
twisted metal from the plane -- which was fully fueled for its
trans-Altantic run -- was hardly recognizable as a fuselage.
</P>
<P>
   French legal experts were examining the charred bodies of the
113 victims for identification.
</P>
<P>
   French television showed a dramatic photograph of the disabled
plane flying low over the airport, flames spewing from the engines
on one wing.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde struggled to gain altitude, then banked before
slamming into the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw flames shoot up 40 meters (120 feet) and there was a
huge boom,'' said Samir Hossein, a 15-year-old student from Gonesse
who was playing tennis. ''The pilot tried to yank it up, but it was
too late.''
</P>
<P>
   ''For those who were witnesses, of whom I was one, it seems that
there was a fire in one or more of the engines on takeoff,'' Air
France President Jean-Cyril Spinetta told reporters at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesday, the transportation ministry said the plane's
two flight recorders, which were damaged in the crash, had been
found. Experts said possible causes of engine problems ranged from
birds flying into the air intake to mechanical failure. The plane
was powered by Rolls Royce Olympus 593 engines.
</P>
<P>
   The crash did not appear to be linked to cracks found recently
in both British Airways and Air France Concordes. Air France said
this particular plane, in service since 1980, did not have reported
fissures.
</P>
<P>
   The first Concorde plane flew in 1969. With the crash, there are
now 12 of the distinctive delta-wing jets in the Air France and
British Airways fleets. British Airways canceled its two Tuesday
night Concorde flights from London to New York and New York to
London.
</P>
<P>
   French Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot ordered all
Concorde flights suspended for Wednesday. Air France's Spinetta
said the day would be used to check the rest of the company's
Concordes.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the National Transportation Safety Board said it
would send an investigator to Paris because the Concorde regularly
flies to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The plane that crashed had flown 12,000 hours and had its last
mechanical checkup July 21.
</P>
<P>
   Police said three people on board the flight were under 18 years
old. Five people on the ground were injured, police said. Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin said their condition was ''good from a
medical standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments after takeoff from Charles de Gaulle at 4:44 p.m, the
plane slammed into a parking lot and the 40-room Hotelissimo,
surrounded by farmlands about 9 miles northeast of central Paris. A
larger hotel next door, Relais Bleu, escaped damage.
</P>
<P>
   British businessman Darren Atkins told SKY TV news he was aboard
another aircraft behind the Concorde on the tarmac. ''As it
accelerated down the runway the engine was already smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Before it started to take off the left hand engines were
visibly on fire,'' he said. ''They were burning very heavily. So
much so in fact on the tarmac was some debris that had clearly
fallen off the engine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvie Lucas of Paris, who was at the airport waiting for her
children, also said she saw the plane on fire before it lifted off.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were waiting to hear the explosion because we thought it
was going to fall here (at the airport),'' Lucas told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Frederic Savery, 21, was driving along the highway when he saw
the plane go down. ''It passed 30 meters (60 feet) above us, the
whole back end of the plane was on fire,'' he told The AP. ''We saw
it start to turn, but we didn't hear a noise when it crashed. All
of a sudden, everything was black, we stopped right there and
called the firefighters.''
</P>
<P>
   The passengers had been on a trip meant to savor: champagne on
the Concorde, then a leisurely cruise on the MS Deutschland through
the Panama Canal to Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   Tour operator Peter Deilmann said the cruise, which had a total
of 510 passengers booked, would not be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde, which crosses the Atlantic at 1,350 mph, has been
considered among the world's safest planes. Its only major scare
came in 1979, when a bad landing blew out a plane's tires. The
incident led to a design modification.
</P>
<P>
   The plane is popular with celebrities, world-class athletes and
the rich. It flies above turbulence at nearly 60,000 feet, crossing
the Atlantic in about 3&AMP;frac12; hours, much faster than regular jetliners.
</P>
<P>
   A roundtrip Paris-New York ticket costs $9,000, roughly 25
percent more than first class on a regular jet. A London-New York
roundtrip runs $9,850.
</P>
<P>
   Air France officials have said in the past that their current
fleet was fit to fly safely until 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin, visibly moved, and French Transport Minister Jean-Claude
Gayssot visited the crash scene. ''It's a terrible moment,''
Gayssot said. President Jacques Chirac promised to pay homage
Wednesday to the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential spokeswoman, Agathe Sanson, said Chirac was leaving
the airport at the time of the crash, having just returned from the
G-8 summit in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Condolences poured in from all over, including German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder and President Clinton. ''I wanted to extend the
deepest condolences of the American people to the families of those
who are lost,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Government OK's Pot For Sick People  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The Justice Department will appeal a court
ruling that cleared the way for an Oakland club to distribute
marijuana for medicinal purposes, according to documents filed
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Quinlivan submitted notice of the
appeal of last week's ruling, which could lead to a slew of new
marijuana clubs. Quinlivan declined to comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the federal court ruling, the Oakland Cannabis Buyers'
Cooperative could provide marijuana to people facing imminent harm
from serious medical conditions, and for whom legal alternatives to
marijuana don't work or cause intolerable side effects.
</P>
<P>
   The victory for the club is the latest development in a
years-old conflict between federal narcotics laws and Proposition
215, passed by California voters in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The California initiative allows seriously ill patients to grow
and use marijuana for pain relief, with a doctor's recommendation,
without state penalties. But federal law says marijuana has no
medical purpose and cannot be administered safely under medical
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Initiatives similar to California's have passed in Alaska,
Arizona, Hawaii, Maine, Nevada, Oregon and Washington state.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Judge Releases Brick Suspect  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge on Tuesday ordered the release of a
homeless man charged with attempted murder after he confessed to
bashing a young woman's head with a five-pound chunk of concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal Court Judge John Walsh ordered the release of Bentley
Louis Grant, 35, without bail after a prosecutor told the court
that new evidence shows that Grant might be the wrong man.
</P>
<P>
   A felony complaint filed at Grant's court arraignment said at
least three witnesses had seen him attack Tiffany Goldberg or had
seen him fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Amy Schwartz told the judge that her
office had ''discovered new evidence that raises substantial
questions about Grant's identity as the perpetrator of the crime
against Ms. Goldberg.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz said the investigation into the attack was continuing.
Charges against Grant had not been dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Grant's lawyer, Natasha Lapiner-Giresi, said she believes
surveillance videotapes from several stores exonerate Grant.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe he confessed because they (police) questioned him
for 20 hours and he wanted them to stop,'' Lapiner-Giresi said.
</P>
<P>
   Grant is due back in court Aug. 17 to hear the results of a
psychiatric exam.
</P>
<P>
   Grant was picked up July 19 and charged the next day with
attempted murder for allegedly hitting Goldberg, 25, of Madison,
Wis., in the back of her head with a chunk of concrete on July 9.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg suffered a cracked skull, broken teeth, a black eye and
cuts and bruises after she was hit.

Moynihan, who is backing fellow Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton in the U.S.

issue is a TV ad unveiled yesterday by the moderate Republican Leadership

   ''I guess because I haven't been out there, they want to work me
in slowly,'' Davis said. ''That's why they're the coaches. They
know what's best and I'll just go with the flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, there was no sign of any problem with Davis'
ankle, which was severely sprained in a game in December and slow
to heal during the offseason. Davis showed good lateral movement,
especially when he shoved aside linebacker Eddie Mason during a
blocking drill.
</P>
<P>
   ''He looks full speed to me,'' Turner said. ''We're just going
to add a little bit each day and let him go.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith unexpectedly quit the team after a poor first week of
camp, which followed a quick loss of 20 pounds to get down to a
playing weight of 260. The eighth-year tight end, who was supposed
to be a supplemental blocking and pass-catching weapon behind
starter Stephen Alexander, took part in the morning's light
practice, but wasn't around when the afternoon session began.
</P>
<P>
   ''Irv did a heck of a job to lose the weight, to get into camp,
and I think he may have lost it too fast,'' Turner said. ''He
didn't feel his heart was in it.''
Lions:
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Charlie Batch joined in drills at training camp for
the first time since breaking a bone in his knee.
</P>
<P>
   Batch, who had surgery to repair the bone in early June, joined
quarterbacks for light drills at Saginaw Valley State University.
</P>
<P>
   He worked on his drop-back passing and hitting receivers on
routes. He sat out repetitions with the full team but stayed after
practice to work on his touch passing.
Broncos:
</P>
<P>
   Cyron Brown is out of the NFL for the upcoming season and
apparently out of Denver for good after being suspended for
violating the NFL's substance abuse policy.
</P>
<P>
   The league said Tuesday the 6-foot-5, 275-pound defensive tackle
can apply for reinstatement following the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said he knew for about two weeks
that Brown would be suspended. He declined to elaborate on the
violation.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not coming back here, I will say that,'' Shanahan said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who played at Western Illinois, joined Denver in 1998.
Falcons:
</P>
<P>
   Michael Booker, a former first-round draft pick, missed two more
practices Tuesday after walking out of camp.
</P>
<P>
   After talking with Booker by telephone, Atlanta coach Dan Reeves
said he expects the cornerback on the field Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Booker, the No. 11 pick in the 1997 draft out of Nebraska,
attended a Monday morning practice at Furman University, but was a
no-show for the afternoon workout.
</P>
<P>
   Booker started 10 games for Atlanta the last three seasons,
including six during the team's 1998 NFC championship campaign. He
has six career interceptions and 93 tackles.
Seahawks:
</P>
<P>
   Third-year linebacker DeShone Myles and rookie tight end Rufus
French are both out for the season after tearing anterior cruciate
ligaments in their left knees during workouts -- Myles on Monday and
French on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Myles is a 6-foot-2, 250-pound third-year veteran out of the
University of Nevada-Reno, while French was signed as an undrafted
free agent last year and spent the entire regular season on the
practice squad. In college, the 6-3, 257-pounder finished second on
Mississippi's career receptions list for tight ends with 84.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks signed nine-year veteran George Koonce, who played
for coach Mike Holmgren at Green Bay, as linebacker insurance.
Eagles:
</P>
<P>
   Offensive tackle Jon Runyan missed his third straight day of
practice with a back injury, and it appears unlikely that he will
play in Sunday's preseason opener against Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Charles Johnson returned to practice after missing
two days with a hamstring injury.
Bears:
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Marcus Robinson has a pulled stomach muscle that
could cause him to miss up to a week of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, a former NFL Europe standout, had a breakthrough
season a year ago, catching 84 passes for a team-record 1,400
yards. A Pro Bowl alternate, he was rewarded with a four-year,
$14.4 million deal in the offseason.
Ravens:
</P>
<P>
   Punter Kyle Richardson signed and returned to training camp
after a one-day holdout.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, who set an NFL record last season by putting 39
punts inside the 20-yard line, signed for one year at $385,000.
</P>
<P>
   He is beginning his fourth NFL season and third with the Ravens.
Last season he averaged 42.3 yards per punt.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Patrick Johnson, expected to start this season,
will be out at least six weeks after breaking his right clavicle
while making a catch during practice Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 23, the Raven's second-round draft choice in 1998, will
wear a harness for four weeks before practicing again.
Saints:
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Jeff Blake, who had fluid drained from his left knee
after Saturday's 44-play scrimmage and practiced with a protective
sleeve during Monday's workouts, was limping on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The problem wasn't the knee, however. Blake has an infected
blister on the bottom of his foot. Coach Jim Haslett described it
as painful, but not serious.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Keith Poole missed practice Tuesday with the flu.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Terrorist Legislation  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House on Tuesday approved a measure making
it easier for terrorist victims to collect damages from nations
that foster that terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   American courts have awarded former hostages and families of
terrorist victims multimillion-dollar judgments against Iran and
Cuba, but the administration has so far blocked the freeing of
frozen assets to those winning the suits.
</P>
<P>
   The House legislation, passed by voice, strengthens a 1996 law
allowing a victim to sue a terrorist state by restricting the
president's authority to issue waivers preventing the release of
assets.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatic property would still be protected from claims, but
the commercial property, cash accounts and assets such as rental
money of a country could be used to satisfy court judgments in
terrorism cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today we have moved one step closer to giving these victims
and their families the justice they deserve,'' said Rep. Bill
McCollum, R-Fla., sponsor of the House bill. Identical legislation
sponsored by Sens. Connie Mack, R-Fla., and Frank Lautenberg,
D-N.J., has yet to reach the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   This year a federal court awarded $327 million in damages to the
parents of a Connecticut rabbinical student and a 22-year-old New
Jersey woman who were killed in a bus bombing in Jerusalem linked
to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Former hostage Terry Anderson, who spent seven years in
captivity in Lebanon, also won a $341 million judgment against Iran
this year. A federal judge in Miami has ordered Cuba to pay $187
million to the families of three Americans killed in 1996 when
Cuban military jets shot down two small private planes off the
island's coast. None of those plaintiffs has been able to collect
on the claims.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has voiced its opposition to the measure,
saying countries might retaliate by seizing American property.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the House passed by voice a bill that would set up a
presidential council on terrorism preparedness to coordinate
federal programs that help state and local governments take
anti-terrorism measures.
</P>
<P>
   The council would be responsible for establishing an overall
strategy for terrorism preparedness and making recommendations to
coordinate the president's anti-terrorism budget. The bill, which
now goes to the Senate, is sponsored by Rep. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The terrorist victim bill is H.R. 3485. The terrorism council
bill is H.R. 4210.

<HEADLINE> Mets 5, Expos 0  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE FITZPATRICK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mike Piazza had three hits and two RBIs to back
the stellar pitching of Glendon Rusch as the New York Mets beat the
Montreal Expos 5-0 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza delivered an RBI single in the first inning to give the
Mets the only run they would need. He drove in another run with a
fifth-inning single, and also singled in the third. He finished
3-for-4 as the Mets returned home from an 11-game road trip that
began right after the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal had its four-game winning streak snapped.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch (7-7) gave up three hits in seven scoreless innings for
his first win in five starts since June 27. Dennis Cook and Pat
Mahomes completed the five-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch contributed at the plate, too. He had a sacrifice bunt as
New York took a 2-0 lead in the second, and drew a 10-pitch walk
from Dustin Hermanson (8-8) that ignited a two-run rally in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Two hits and one out later, Rusch scored on Piazza's single, and
Todd Zeile followed with a bases-loaded walk that made it 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Hermanson, who gave up just one run in 8 2-3 innings of a
victory over the Mets last Thursday, allowed four runs, nine hits
and four walks in four innings, matching his shortest start this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch struck out the side in the first and only ran into trouble
in the fifth, when he loaded the bases with no outs on two walks
and a single.
</P>
<P>
   But he escaped unscathed as Jose Vidro grounded into a force
play at the plate, and Geoff Blum hit a soft liner to shortstop
Melvin Mora that turned into an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Mora, who set up Lenny Harris' RBI groundout with a beautiful
bunt single in the second, added a two-out, RBI double off
Guillermo Mota in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Mets manager Bobby Valentine tied Gil Hodges for second on
the club's career list with 339 victories. ... All-Star 2B Edgardo
Alfonzo was back in the Mets lineup after missing a three-game
weekend series at Atlanta with a hip injury. ... Expos RF Vladimir
Guerrero returned to the lineup and went 1-for-4 after missing four
starts with a hip injury. ... Blum, who had homered in three
straight games, went 0-for-4. He flied out to the left-field wall
in the third. ... Montreal RHP Hideki Irabu is scheduled to come
off the DL on Wednesday and make his first start since May 26. He
had surgery on his right knee to remove torn cartilage. It will be
Irabu's first start in New York since being traded by the Yankees
last winter.

<HEADLINE> Bush Names Cheney As Running Mate  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Auditioning the new Republican ticket,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush presented Dick Cheney as his running mate
on Tuesday, praising his father's one-time Pentagon chief as a
seasoned statesman fully ''capable of being president.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush told cheering supporters that, while he initially picked
Cheney to oversee the vice presidential search, ''I gradually
realized that the person who was best qualified ... was working by
my side.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, 59, whose long resume also includes serving as President
Gerald Ford's chief of staff and representing Wyoming in Congress
for six terms, said he initially resisted Bush's overtures.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the end, I learned how persuasive he can be,'' said the
former defense secretary, a top strategist in the 1991 Persian Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said that over time, Bush wore him down.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt a good deal of warmth towards him,'' he said on CNN's
''Larry King Live'' Tuesday, his first interview since he emerged
as Bush's choice. ''It was hard to turn him down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign moved quickly to try to dispel concerns about
Cheney's health, distributing statements from his doctors asserting
he was fit to serve -- despite three minor heart attacks in the
1970s and 1980s, heart surgery and continuing treatment for high
cholesterol and gout.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this time, Mr. Cheney is in excellent health,'' wrote Dr.
Gary Malakoff, director of general internal medicine at George
Washington University Hospital in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''I monitor him closely for his known medical problems. He is up
to the task of the most sensitive public office,'' added Malakoff,
Cheney's primary care physician since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   On CNN, Cheney was upbeat about his health. ''I've always lived
and operated in a fairly intense environment, and I don't have any
problems here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also defended his conservative voting record in Congress,
already being targeted by Democrats. He said he did not necessarily
stand behind every vote cast but said: ''Certainly I do have a
conservative record. But I'm proud of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney is resigning as chief executive officer of Halliburton,
the large energy services and construction company, and plans to
sell his Dallas home.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates will hit the campaign trail on Wednesday for
a visit to Wyoming, which Cheney last week reclaimed as his
official residence for voting purposes. Cheney will also join Bush
for part of an end-of-the week swing that will bring Bush to the
Republican convention that opens on Monday in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't wait for the delegates at our convention next week to
hear from Dick Cheney and I will ask them to confirm this good man
as our party's choice for vice president,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush joked that he hadn't picked Cheney ''because of Wyoming's
three electoral votes. ... I picked him because he is without doubt
capable of being president of the United States and will be a
valuable partner in a Bush administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush made his announcement before a crowd of several hundred
supporters in a room in a sports complex at the University of
Texas. Many waved pom-poms and small American flags and shouted,
''Cheney! Cheney!''
</P>
<P>
   ''I enthusiastically accept the challenge for this reason: I
believe you have the vision and the courage to be a great
president,'' Cheney told Bush while his wife, Lynne, and Bush's
wife, Laura, watched on.
</P>
<P>
   After posing for group photographs, the two candidates mingled
with the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cheney is only five years older than the 54-year-old
Bush, he represents a different political generation -- and brings
with him vast defense and foreign policy experience that the
two-term Texas governor lacks. He also serves as a link with the
1989-93 administration of President Bush, the candidate's father.
</P>
<P>
   Bush placed the call to Cheney from the governor's mansion at
6:22 a.m. local time. By then, Cheney was widely reported as the
leading contender and GOP officials had leaked news of the decision
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's wife answered the phone because he was exercising on
his treadmill, Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   After taking the call, Cheney told his wife, ''Honey, let's sell
the house. I quit my job. We're going back into politics,'' Hughes
recounted.
</P>
<P>
   Bush then made calls to the also-rans, including Sens. John
McCain of Arizona, Chuck Hagel of Nebraska and Bill Frist and Fred
Thompson, both of Tennessee. He also called Gov. Tom Ridge of
Pennsylvania, George Pataki of New York, Frank Keating of Oklahoma
and Christie Whitman of New Jersey, and former Gov. Lamar Alexander
of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Vice President Al Gore, observed Bush's announcement
by declaring, ''there's no question the American people will have a
choice between two very different tickets and visions for the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   During a speech in Washington, D.C., Gore said his own yet-to-be
chosen running mate would share his values and be ''willing to take
on the big polluters, the big drug companies, the HMOs and big
oil.'' Aides said ''big oil'' was a direct reference to Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   When he first named Cheney to head the search team three months
ago, Bush said Cheney told him he wasn't interested in being vice
president. ''But I kept the thought of him joining me in the back
of my mind,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he asked him again on his central Texas ranch over the
July 4th weekend. ''This time he said he was willing to talk with
his family and consider it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cheney continued for three more weeks to sort through
resumes for the vice presidential job -- even though he realized he
might be the one tapped, Bush aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He understood his assignment clearly,'' said Don Evans, a
longtime adviser to Bush. Evans said that Bush and Cheney developed
''great respect for each other'' during the process.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Gen. Colin Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff during the elder Bush's administration, had been speculated
upon as a possible surprise choice.
</P>
<P>
   But Powell, who has consistently said he is not interested in
elective politics, said Tuesday he had made that lack of interest
known to Bush early on -- and that neither Bush nor intermediaries
had sought to persuade him to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was never a candidate. He respected my decision and the
reasons for that decision, and he understood them,'' Powell told
CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, widely believed to be a likely secretary of state in a
Bush administration, praised Cheney for ''great strength of
character,'' both in the Panama invasion and in the Persian Gulf
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Buchanan, a University of Texas political scientist and
longtime Bush watcher, said that Cheney brings ''a lot of gray
sageness'' to the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ''His health is a bit of a minus. And the name is not going to
quicken the pulses of the masses,'' Buchanan said. ''But the most
important thing is that Bush likes him and trusts him.''

<HEADLINE> Judge orders release of brick attack suspect  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A Manhattan judge Tuesday ordered the release of
a homeless man charged with attempted murder after he confessed to
bashing a young woman with a five-pound chunk of concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal Court Judge John Walsh ordered the release of Bentley
Louis Grant, 35, without bail after a prosecutor told the court new
evidence showed Grant might be the wrong man.
</P>
<P>
   Grant is due back in court Aug. 17 to hear the results of a
psychiatric exam.
</P>
<P>
   He was picked up July 19 and charged the next day with attempted
murder for allegedly hitting Tiffany Goldberg, 25, of Madison,
Wis., in the back of her head with a chunk of concrete on July 9.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, who had just left Marble Collegiate Church on Park
Avenue at 29th Street, suffered a cracked skull, broken teeth, a
black eye and cuts and bruises after she was hit.
</P>
<P>
   A felony complaint filed at Grant's court arraignment said at
least three witnesses had seen him attack Goldberg or had seen him
fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   But Assistant District Attorney Amy Schwartz told the judge that
her office had ''discovered new evidence that raises substantial
questions about Grant's identity as the perpetrator of the crime
against Ms. Goldberg.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz said the investigation into the attack was continuing.
Charges against Grant had not been dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani defended the actions of police in the
highly publicized case.
</P>
<P>
   ''The arrest was based on very solid evidence at the time,'' he
told reporters. ''Now there's some evidence to suggest that maybe
he isn't the right person. ... That has to be sorted out by the
district attorney.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz did not say why she was asking for Grant's release
after he confessed to the attack, but Lapiner-Giresi said she
believes surveillance videotapes from several stores exonerate
Grant.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe he confessed because they (police) questioned him
for 20 hours and he wanted them to stop,'' Lapiner-Giresi said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer said she learned that prosecutors had the store
surveillance tapes after she sent her own investigator with a
subpoena to get them.
</P>
<P>
   Lapiner-Giresi said Grant told police that at the time of the
attack, he was in the East 14th Street area visiting in several
stores, including a Virgin record store, a Kentucky Fried Chicken
restaurant and a Burger King.
</P>
<P>
   ''My client had an alibi from the beginning,'' she said. ''If he
was in a record store, he couldn't have been hitting Ms. Goldberg
in the head.''
</P>
<P>
   Lapiner-Giresi also asked Walsh to order the return of Grant's
personal possessions, including a milk crate full of things seized
by police.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, who spoke at a City Hall news conference before
Tuesday's courtroom developments, said she still had a ''sore
head'' and occasional headaches, but had otherwise recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg graduated from Sarah Lawrence College and plans to
study social work this fall at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   She said the attack had not dampened her enthusiasm for the
city.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like being struck by lightning,'' she said. ''We could
all get struck by lightning. ...This has done nothing to change my
opinion of the city. I love New York and have every intention of
staying here for many years to come.''

<HEADLINE> U.N. Proposes Renovation Plan  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations presented a near $1
billion proposal to renovate its 50-year-old headquarters Tuesday
and justified the high price-tag by arguing it would cost U.N.
governments just as much to let the buildings fall into further
decay.
</P>
<P>
   Undersecretary-General for Management Joseph Connor unveiled the
''Capital Master Plan,'' which recommends a six-year renovation
that includes options to acquire new office space or build on top
of the existing, landmark complex on Manhattan's East River.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations compound was completed in 1952 but has since
fallen into disrepair, with a leaky roof, rusty plumbing and high
electromagnetic field readings.
</P>
<P>
   An overhaul would not only give the buildings 21st century
wiring and efficient heating and cooling systems, but would also
bring them into compliance with current fire safety and
environmental standards.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look at the ceilings. There are no sprinklers. And by the way,
behind it is asbestos,'' Connor told a press conference in
announcing the proposed renovations.
</P>
<P>
   ''This building is architecturally very distinctive. It's been
extremely functional. But it was built to 1950s standards. And we
violate all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Connor faces an uphill battle in getting the United Nations
membership to sign off on the pricey renovations, which he
estimates will require some commercial, interest-generating loans
that could drive the $964 million pricetag to about dlrs 1.61
billion.
</P>
<P>
   But Connor argued Tuesday that the U.N. governments would have
to spend that much or more over 25 years -- about $1.64 billion -- if
the organization did nothing to overhaul the building and merely
replaced equipment as it wore out and continued to pay high energy
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the end of 25 years, it doesn't matter what we do. We will
have charged the member states exactly the same amount of money,''
Connor said. ''The difference is that we get a substantially
refurbished complex under the Capital Master Plan and we get a
building in dire need of repairs if we don't.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and other wealthy U.N. member states are
expected to be asked to pay a significant chunk of the renovation
bill.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, when The Associated Press first
reported the details of the renovation plan, the deputy U.S.
ambassador in charge of U.N. management, Donald Hays, said
Washington wanted to do the ''right thing'' for the United Nations.
But he stressed that Congress and the incoming administration
needed to take a hard look at the proposals before committing to
any one of them.

<HEADLINE> UPN To Take New Name in 2001  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The UPN television network plans to
change its name to the Paramount Network.
</P>
<P>
   The changed moniker will provide a closer association with the
Paramount entertainment brand, network officials said. The change
goes into effect Jan. 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   UPN -- United Paramount Network -- started in 1995 as a venture
between Viacom Inc.'s Paramount Television Group and Chris-Craft
Industries Inc.'s TV station unit.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Chris-Craft agreed to sell its half-interest in the
network to Viacom for $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The UPN name had represented Chris-Craft subsidiary United
Stations and Paramount, said Dean Valentine, UPN president and
chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're no longer a part of the network, so it seemed to make
sense for the name to reflect that,'' Valentine said Tuesday. ''A
lot of our affiliates thought there was tremendous equity in the
Paramount name .... We think it more accurately reflects who we
are.''
</P>
<P>
   UPN has enjoyed a ratings revival with its World Wrestling
Federation shows, boosting average viewership from about 2 million
homes last season to about 2.7 million this season.

<HEADLINE> Oil Slick Again Stains Rio Bay  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- A large oil slick spread over
Rio's postcard-famous Guanabara Bay on Tuesday, the third oil spill
there this year.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists said it probably was diesel fuel, lighter and
less harmful than the crude oil that had spilled earlier in the
year. Samples were taken to government laboratories to determine
the type of oil and help investigators trace the spill's source.
</P>
<P>
   The slick was broken up in patches across an area of more than
20 square miles, environmentalists said. It washed up on beaches
within the bay and stretched out into the open sea.
</P>
<P>
   Rio's most famous beaches, Copacabana and Ipanema, were not
immediately threatened by the oil, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   In January, a broken underwater pipeline at the Reduc refinery,
owned by federal oil giant Petrobras, spewed at least 340,000
gallons of crude into the bay. The oil washed over protected
mangrove swamps, which ecologists said would take at least a decade
to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, another spill was traced to a Petrobras barge that
washed its tanks and dumped the water into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   In southern Brazil, more than 1 million gallons spilled from
burst pipeline at a Petrobras refinery. Much of it washed into the
Iguacu River, and the cleanup continues.

<HEADLINE> Cheney Heart Attack Changed His Life  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dick Cheney suffered three heart attacks and
had major cardiac surgery before he was 50, but his doctor says
he's now ''in excellent health.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gary Malakoff, director of internal medicine at George
Washington University Hospital, said Tuesday that in addition to
the heart problems, Cheney has had skin cancer, surgery on his
right knee to repair a football injury and episodes of gout.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's running mate also is allergic to pomegranates.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this time, Mr. Cheney is in excellent health,'' said a
letter from Malakoff, who has been Cheney's personal doctor since
1995. ''His vigorous lifestyle and exercise tolerance are
excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney agreed that his health is good.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have given up smoking. I exercise regularly; try to watch
what I eat. I do all those things a prudent man would do,'' he said
Tuesday on CNN's ''Larry King Live.'' He said he's benefited from
medication to lower his cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd remind my friends out there that, after I underwent the
bypass surgery, I then took on the assignment of secretary of
defense, supervised the Gulf War. I can't think of a more stressful
situation than that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Malakoff said Cheney, now 59, has ''a long history of elevated
cholesterol,'' a blood fat that has been linked to heart disease.
''This has been vigorously and successfully treated with
medication,'' said the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Malakoff said Cheney was treated for skin cancer, a common
condition among people who spend time in the sun. Cheney is an avid
fisherman, hunter and backpacker. Caught early, skin cancer can be
removed by surgery, laser burning or by freezing.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker later elaborated that Cheney
had ''a small spot under his left eye'' removed and the cancer has
not come back.
</P>
<P>
   ''He continues to be monitored closely for any recurrences,''
said Malakoff in his letter.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor said Cheney has had ''several minor episodes of
gout'' and is closely monitored for this condition. Gout is a
disease in which uric acid salts can accumulate in joints. An acute
case can cause swelling, intense pain and arthritis-like damage to
the joint. There are several drugs to control the condition.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's only allergy listed by Malakoff is to pomegranates, a
type of fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Malakoff said that recent prostate and colon cancer screenings
for Cheney were normal.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney ''takes a long list of medications,'' said Malakoff. ''He
has shown no side effects of any of these medications which would
alter intellectual performance or impair his judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor did not list the medications, but said they were
''monitored closely'' by him and by Dr. Jonathan S. Reiner, a
George Washington University cardiologist.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from Reiner said that cardiac stress tests on Cheney
''have been stable and unchanged for the past several years.'' A
recent echocardiogram shows some ''dysfunction'' in one heart
chamber, but Reiner called this ''consistent with the history and
distribution'' of the heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clinically, Mr. Cheney continues to lead an asymptomatic (free
of symptoms) and extraordinarily vigorous lifestyle,'' Reiner wrote
in a letter released by the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Heart problems surfaced for Cheney when he was only 37 and
running hard for Congress from Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   ''You become very much aware of your own mortality,'' Cheney
would later say. ''It leads you to question what you're doing and
why you're doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidelined from the campaign for six weeks, Cheney wrote a letter
to the Republicans of Wyoming, promising to end his
three-pack-a-day cigarette habit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since the attack,'' Cheney said years later, ''I exercise, I
jog, play tennis, watch my diet and weight -- and I haven't had a
cigarette since they rolled me into that emergency room.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Cheney had a second heart attack, followed three years
later by a third, all described as ''mild.'' In 1988, he had a
quadruple cardiac bypass.
</P>
<P>
   Following the surgery, Cheney said: ''There is no reason not to
expect 15 to 20 trouble-free years.''
</P>
<P>
   His history of heart attacks means that Cheney is statistically
''at a much higher risk than the average 59-year-old who has never
had heart disease,'' said Dr. Roger S. Blumenthal, director of
preventative cardiology at Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   But Blumenthal said that with a good diet, exercise and
medication, heart patients like Cheney can live long and
vigorously.

<HEADLINE> Twins 4, Red Sox 2  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Joe Mays pitched seven strong innings and David
Ortiz had two hits as the Minnesota Twins won for the fifth time in
six games, beating the Boston Red Sox 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Mays (6-11) struck out seven and allowed two runs on seven hits
and a walk before leaving in the eighth inning. Ortiz went 2-for-3
and drove in an insurance run in the eighth. He is batting .600
(18-for-30) over his last eight games.
</P>
<P>
   After Nomar Garciaparra singled off Hector Carrasco to lead off
the ninth, Eddie Guardado got the last three outs for his sixth
save.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins had lost the first seven meetings of the year with
Boston before winning the first two games of the three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Martinez (8-6) allowed five hits and four walks, striking
out three in 5 1-3 innings. He gave up all three of his runs in the
first inning, when he walked three consecutive batters to score one
run before Corey Koskie drove in two more.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, state political leaders worked out a deal to help
finance a ballpark to replace Fenway Park, the oldest ballpark in
baseball. The deal, which still needs to be approved by the
Legislature and the governor, includes a $5 parking surcharge, a 5
percent ticket tax and a 15 percent tax on luxury boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez had won consecutive outings to snap a streak in which
he won just once in six starts over a month.
</P>
<P>
   But he gave up a double to Jay Canizaro with one out in the
first, then walked Matt Lawton, Ron Coomer and Ortiz to score the
first Minnesota run. Koskie singled off the Green Monster to make
it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Daubach singled and scored in the fifth to make it 3-1,
and Jeff Frye doubled and scored on Troy O'Leary's single to cut
the deficit to one run. But Lawton led off the eighth with a
double, moved to third on Coomer's groundout and scored on a single
by Ortiz to make it 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   In his only other start at Fenway this year, Mays went 1 1-3
innings and allowed seven earned runs -- an ERA of 47.25.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez has lasted past seven innings just once in 20 starts.
Red Sox pitchers didn't walk any batters in either of the previous
two games.
</P>
<P>
Notes: New Hall of Famer Carlton Fisk was at the game, as was
actor Danny DeVito. ... The crowd of 33,668 was Boston's 26th
consecutive sellout. ... The Twins have hit 80 homers through
Monday, fewest in the majors by 18. ... Pedro Martinez was named AL
co-player of the week. He went 2-0 with 27 strikeouts and an ERA of
0.53 for the period from July 17-23. ... OF Carl Everett apologized
to Boston fans for the on-field emotional eruption that resulted in
his 10-game suspension. ''I apologize most importantly for not
being on the field during this 10-game period.'' ... Boston
designated infielder Sean Berry for assignment and activated OF
Trot Nixon from the disabled list.

<HEADLINE> Tigers 6, Devil Rays 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Deivi Cruz, batting cleanup for the first time in
his career, hit a two-run triple in the first inning that started
the Detroit Tigers toward a 6-4 win over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays
on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz was Detroit's No. 4 batter because Juan Gonzalez and Tony
Clark are on the disabled list and Dean Palmer rested an ailing
shoulder. Bobby Higginson, 0-for-4 as the fourth hitter in Tuesday
night's 4-2 loss to the Devil Rays, moved back to the third slot.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Blair (7-2) survived six innings to win for the sixth
time in seven decisions since he moved into the rotation June 6. He
gave up three runs and eight hits.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Jones pitched the ninth for his AL-leading 28th save in 29
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Trachsel (6-10) allowed four runs and seven hits in 4 2-3
innings. He has lost his last five starts and is winless since June
27.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays, 2-5 on a 12-game road trip, have lost eight of
their last 11 and 16 of 23.
</P>
<P>
   The win was just the Tigers' second in five games with Tampa Bay
in Comerica Park.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz tripled off the left-field wall, giving Detroit a 2-0 lead
after Rich Becker doubled and Higginson walked in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay got one back in the second when Jose Canseco doubled
and scored on Steve Cox's long single off the right-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Morris scored on Luis Polonia's grounder in the home half
after he singled and moved to third on a double from Damion Easley.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Halter hit a two-out RBI single to make it 4-1 in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Williams singled in the fifth to drive home Miguel Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Cox's bases-loaded forceout got the Rays within one in the
sixth. Fred McGriff tried to score on John Flaherty's fly to medium
center but was thrown out at the plate by center fielder Juan
Encarnacion.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer drew a pinch-walk to lead off the seventh before Wendell
McGee's hit-and-run single moved him to third and he scored on
Higginson's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco drove in Tampa Bay's fourth run with an RBI single in
the top of the eighth. The Tigers answered with a Easley homer in
the bottom of the inning.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Devil Rays LF Greg Vaughn was OK after sliding head-first
into the wall trying for a running catch of Cruz's triple. ...
Trachsel's first career appearance against Detroit leaves Oakland
as the only major league team he's never faced. ... The Tigers are
38-15 when scoring four or more runs and have won 20 of their last
24 games. ... Blair's seven wins lead the Tigers.

<HEADLINE> Officer Discharged for Posing Nude  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE ZIEGLER DIZON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A former Navy petty officer is bearing the
consequences for baring all in the September issue of Playboy
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Lynne White, 26, said she was discharged from the Navy on
July 9 because she posed for a nude photo spread. She originally
was scheduled to be released from duty on Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt I wasn't doing anything wrong by posing,'' White said
Tuesday. ''I'm not making the Navy look bad by having those
pictures there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Cmdr. Dave Werner, a Navy spokesman in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii,
where White was stationed, said both the Navy and White agreed to
the discharge.
</P>
<P>
   ''As she agreed, it was best that she pursue her career outside
the military,'' Werner said. ''It was in everyone's interests for
her to leave early.''
</P>
<P>
   Werner would not say what role the Playboy photos played in the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   White, a native of Washington, N.J., who had served in the Navy
for eight years, said her trouble began when she submitted a nude
photo that was published in the ''Grapevine'' section of Playboy's
February issue.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the photo nor the caption made reference to White's
service in the Navy, she said. But she said her superiors told her
to ask Playboy not to publish any more of her photos.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, White contacted the magazine and arranged to do a full
pictorial, with an accompanying article and pictures of her in
uniform. After she told her superiors of her decision, she was told
she would be discharged for misconduct under honorable conditions,
she said. She eventually signed a letter stating those terms.
</P>
<P>
   White most recently had served as a naval information systems
technician second class as part of the Commander Submarine Force,
U.S. Pacific Fleet.

<HEADLINE> Former porn star's extradition hearing set for March 2001  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) - An extradition hearing for
former X-rated film star Kathryn Gannon, wanted in the United
States on insider trading charges, will take place in March.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon, 31, appeared briefly in a Vancouver court Tuesday as her
lawyers told Justice Patrick Dohm that March would be the earliest
time they would be available.
</P>
<P>
   Dohm scheduled a five-day hearing to begin March 12.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon was charged in December along with James McDermott Jr.,
the former chief executive officer at Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, a
New York investment bank that specialized in bank mergers.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott was convicted in April of securities fraud for giving
Gannon inside information, prompting her to allegedly buy six
stocks illegally. She was accused of then giving the information to
a third defendant, Anthony Pomponio, who also was convicted in the
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Both men were having extramarital affairs with Gannon at the
time, lawyers in the case have said.
</P>
<P>
   Pomponio and Gannon allegedly made $170,000 in illegal profits.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon, a Canadian citizen, was arrested by the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police commercial crimes section in compliance with an
extradition request from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, she could face up to 10 years in prison on the
most serious insider trading charges.

<HEADLINE> House OK's 2-Strikes Sex Law  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- People convicted of a sex crime against a
child would get mandatory life sentences after a second such
conviction under a measure approved by the House Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, dubbed ''Two Strikes, You're Out,'' passed by a voice
vote.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of repeat child molesters is ''extraordinarily high,''
said Rep. Mark Green, R-Wis., the sponsor. ''I make no bones about
this legislation: This bill is not about rehabilitation, I openly
admit it. This bill is not even about deterrence. It is about
removing bad people from society.''
</P>
<P>
   Green successfully crafted a similar measure in 1997 as a member
of Wisconsin's state Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, if an offender convicted of any previous sex
crime against a child -- whether in state or federal jurisdiction --
then commits a second sex crime falling under federal jurisdiction,
the new legislation would apply.
</P>
<P>
   The law is based on statistics indicating that pedophiles are
four times more likely than other criminals to recommit their
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Federal sex crimes include crimes such as transporting a minor
across state lines for illegal sexual purposes, some kidnappings
and sexual assault or molestation occurring on federal lands.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Scott, D-Va., voiced opposition to the bill, citing
concerns that a 19-year-old convicted twice of statuatory rape for
having consensual sex with a 15-year-old could face the same life
sentence as a two-time violent rapist.
</P>
<P>
   The bill has the support of Marc Klaas, whose 12-year-old
daughter Polly was kidnapped and murdered in 1993 by a repeat sex
offender. The case led to California's three-strikes sentencing law
for repeat felons.
</P>
<P>
   That law, which targets both violent and nonviolent offenders,
mandates sentences of 25 years to life for three-time offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is not a documented case of a pedophile or a psychopath
ever having been cured,'' Klaas told lawmakers at a May hearing.
''The sad reality is that they re-offend over and over again until
they are removed from society once and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has not yet taken action on the measure.
</P>

<HEADLINE> UN formally proposes renovation plan, says it would cost more to do nothing </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The United Nations presented a $964
million proposal to renovate its 50-year-old headquarters Tuesday
and justified the high price-tag by arguing it would cost U.N.
governments just as much to let the buildings fall into further
decay.
</P>
<P>
   Undersecretary-General for Management Joseph Connor unveiled the
''Capital Master Plan,'' which recommends a six-year renovation
that includes options to acquire new office space or build on top
of the existing, landmark complex on Manhattan's East River.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations compound - featuring the distinctive
glass-encased office tower and curved General Assembly hall - was
completed in 1952 but has since fallen into disrepair, with a leaky
roof, rusty plumbing and high electromagnetic field readings.
</P>
<P>
   An overhaul would not only give the buildings 21st century
wiring and efficient heating and cooling systems, but would also
bring them into compliance with current fire safety and
environmental standards.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look at the ceilings. There are no sprinklers. And by the way,
behind it is asbestos,'' Connor said during a news conference
announcing the proposed renovations.
</P>
<P>
   ''This building is architecturally very distinctive. It's been
extremely functional. But it was built to 1950s standards. And we
violate all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Connor faces an uphill battle in getting the United Nations
membership to sign off on the pricey renovations, which he
estimates will require some commercial, interest-generating loans
that could drive the $964 million pricetag to about $1.61 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But Connor argued Tuesday that the U.N. governments would have
to spend that much or more over 25 years - about $1.64 billion - if
the organization did nothing to overhaul the building and merely
replaced equipment as it wore out and continued to pay high energy
prices.

   ''At the end of 25 years, it doesn't matter what we do. We will
have charged the member states exactly the same amount of money,''
Connor said. ''The difference is that we get a substantially
refurbished complex under the Capital Master Plan and we get a
building in dire need of repairs if we don't.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and other wealthy U.N. member states are
expected to be asked to pay a significant chunk of the renovation
bill, probably through interest-free loans.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, when The Associated Press first
reported the details of the renovation plan, the deputy U.S.
ambassador in charge of U.N. management, Donald Hays, said
Washington wanted to do the ''right thing'' for the United Nations.
But he stressed that Congress and the incoming administration
needed to take a hard look at the proposals before committing to
any one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Connor plans to present a formal report to the General Assembly
in the next few weeks outlining the proposal. He has urged they
endorse the six-year renovation plan in principle and authorize $8
million for a detailed schematic plan of the renovation.
</P>
<P>
   Construction could begin as soon as 2002, he said.

<HEADLINE> Air France Concorde crashes, more than 100 people dead  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA DOLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   GONESSE, France (AP) - With flames and smoke streaking from its
engines, an Air France Concorde carrying German tourists to New
York for a Caribbean cruise crashed into a hotel outside Paris
shortly after takeoff Tuesday. At least 113 people died.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first fatal crash for the needle-nosed supersonic
aircraft, and all other Concordes - for 30 years the pride of
French and British aviation for their luxury, safety and speed -
were grounded.
</P>
<P>
   Air France said one of the plane's four engines appeared to have
failed. Some witnesses reported that an engine burst into flame
even before the plane left the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers on flight AF4590, chartered by a German tourist
agency, included 96 Germans, two Danes, one Austrian and one
American, as well as nine crew members, the airline said. The
American was a retired Air France employee, but the company did not
release a name. Four other people were killed at the small hotel
leveled in the crash, the Interior Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   A pall of acrid smoke rose from the blackened wreckage and over
the wheat fields at Gonesse, a small town near Paris' Charles de
Gaulle airport. Firefighters sprayed the rubble with water, and the
twisted metal from the plane - which was fully fueled for its
trans-Altantic run - was hardly recognizable as a fuselage.
</P>
<P>
   French legal experts were examining the charred bodies of the
113 victims for identification.
</P>
<P>
   French television showed a dramatic photograph of the disabled
plane flying low over the airport, flames spewing from the engines
on one wing.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde struggled to gain altitude, then banked before
slamming into the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw flames shoot up 40 meters (120 feet) and there was a
huge boom,'' said Samir Hossein, a 15-year-old student from Gonesse
who was playing tennis. ''The pilot tried to yank it up, but it was
too late.''
</P>
<P>
   ''For those who were witnesses, of whom I was one, it seems that
there was a fire in one or more of the engines on takeoff,'' Air
France President Jean-Cyril Spinetta told reporters at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesday, the transportation ministry said the plane's
two flight recorders, which were damaged in the crash, had been
found. Experts said possible causes of engine problems ranged from
birds flying into the air intake to mechanical failure. The plane
was powered by Rolls Royce Olympus 593 engines.
</P>
<P>
   The crash did not appear to be linked to cracks found recently
in both British Airways and Air France Concordes. Air France said
this particular plane, in service since 1980, did not have reported
fissures.
</P>
<P>
   The first Concorde plane flew in 1969. With the crash, there are
now 12 of the distinctive delta-wing jets in the Air France and
British Airways fleets. British Airways canceled its two Tuesday
night Concorde flights from London to New York and New York to
London.
</P>
<P>
   French Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot ordered all
Concorde flights suspended for Wednesday. Air France's Spinetta
said the day would be used to check the rest of the company's
Concordes.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the National Transportation Safety Board said it
would send an investigator to Paris because the Concorde regularly
flies to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The plane that crashed had flown 12,000 hours and had its last
mechanical checkup July 21.
</P>
<P>
   Police said three people on board the flight were under 18 years
old. Five people on the ground were injured, police said. Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin said their condition was ''good from a
medical standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments after takeoff from Charles de Gaulle at 4:44 p.m, the
plane slammed into a parking lot and the 40-room Hotelissimo,
surrounded by farmlands about 9 miles northeast of central Paris. A
larger hotel next door, Relais Bleu, escaped damage.
</P>
<P>
   British businessman Darren Atkins told SKY TV news he was aboard
another aircraft behind the Concorde on the tarmac. ''As it
accelerated down the runway the engine was already smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Before it started to take off the left hand engines were
visibly on fire,'' he said. ''They were burning very heavily. So
much so in fact on the tarmac was some debris that had clearly
fallen off the engine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvie Lucas of Paris, who was at the airport waiting for her
children, also said she saw the plane on fire before it lifted off.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were waiting to hear the explosion because we thought it
was going to fall here (at the airport),'' Lucas told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Frederic Savery, 21, was driving along the highway when he saw
the plane go down. ''It passed 30 meters (60 feet) above us, the
whole back end of the plane was on fire,'' he told The AP. ''We saw
it start to turn, but we didn't hear a noise when it crashed. All
of a sudden, everything was black, we stopped right there and
called the firefighters.''
</P>
<P>
   The passengers had been on a trip meant to savor: champagne on
the Concorde, then a leisurely cruise on the MS Deutschland through
the Panama Canal to Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   Tour operator Peter Deilmann said the cruise, which had a total
of 510 passengers booked, would not be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde, which crosses the Atlantic at 1,350 mph, has been
considered among the world's safest planes. Its only major scare
came in 1979, when a bad landing blew out a plane's tires. The
incident led to a design modification.
</P>
<P>
   The plane is popular with celebrities, world-class athletes and
the rich. It flies above turbulence at nearly 60,000 feet, crossing
the Atlantic in about 3&AMP;frac12; hours, much faster than regular jetliners.
</P>
<P>
   A roundtrip Paris-New York ticket costs $9,000, roughly 25
percent more than first class on a regular jet. A London-New York
roundtrip runs $9,850.
</P>
<P>
   Air France officials have said in the past that their current
fleet was fit to fly safely until 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin, visibly moved, and French Transport Minister Jean-Claude
Gayssot visited the crash scene. ''It's a terrible moment,''
Gayssot said. President Jacques Chirac promised to pay homage
Wednesday to the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential spokeswoman, Agathe Sanson, said Chirac was leaving
the airport at the time of the crash, having just returned from the
G-8 summit in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Condolences poured in from all over, including German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder and President Clinton. ''I wanted to extend the
deepest condolences of the American people to the families of those
who are lost,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Polls: Chavez To Win Re-Election  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WARREN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Hugo Chavez has a 21-point
lead in a survey released Tuesday over his nearest challenger going
into this weekend's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Consultores 21 survey of 1,500 eligible voters,
Chavez has 54 percent support compared to 33 percent for former
Zulia state Gov. Francisco Arias Cardenas, who helped Chavez stage
a failed 1992 coup but who has since broken away from the
president.
</P>
<P>
   The poll conducted this month had a margin of error of about 3
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Chavez took office only 17 months ago, elections
have been called for this Sunday because of a new constitution
Chavez pushed through last year that requires public offices to be
''re-legitimized'' through new balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez took office promising a ''social revolution'' to lift the
poor. Yet despite a surge in the international price of oil,
Venezuela's main export, the economy shrank by seven percent last
year and grew by 0.3 percent in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment is estimated at between 15 percent and 20 percent,
and violent crime is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, most Venezuelan voters are sticking with Chavez
largely because they want to give him more time to fulfill his
promises, the pollsters said.
</P>
<P>
   Support for Chavez should enable his leftist Fifth Republic
Movement to capture a simple majority of a new, 165-member
unicameral legislature. However, it remains unclear if Chavez will
get the two-thirds majority that he would need to rule virtually
unopposed.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential race is sharply polarized among class lines,
the pollsters said, with most wealthy Venezuelans supporting Arias
Cardenas and most of the poor with Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 percent of Venezuelans are considered either poor or
lower middle class.
</P>
<P>
   The balloting was originally set for May 28, but were postponed
because of computer glitches in the system used to tally votes. The
projected election results have hardly varied since then.

<HEADLINE> UPN Taking on New Name in 2001  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The UPN television network plans to
change its name to the Paramount Network.
</P>
<P>
   The changed moniker will provide a closer association with the
Paramount entertainment brand, network officials said. The change
goes into effect Jan. 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   UPN -- United Paramount Network -- started in 1995 as a venture
between Viacom Inc.'s Paramount Television Group and Chris-Craft
Industries Inc.'s TV station unit.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Chris-Craft agreed to sell its half-interest in the
network to Viacom for $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The UPN name had represented Chris-Craft subsidiary United
Stations and Paramount, said Dean Valentine, UPN president and
chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're no longer a part of the network, so it seemed to make
sense for the name to reflect that,'' Valentine said Tuesday. ''A
lot of our affiliates thought there was tremendous equity in the
Paramount name .... We think it more accurately reflects who we
are.''
</P>
<P>
   UPN has enjoyed a ratings revival with its World Wrestling
Federation shows, boosting average viewership from about 2 million
homes last season to about 2.7 million this season.
