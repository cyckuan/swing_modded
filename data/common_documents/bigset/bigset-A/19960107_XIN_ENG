<HEADLINE> Greek Opposition Party to Table Censure Motion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Greece's main opposition party,
the New Democracy Party (ND), is to table a censure motion against
the government Monday, claiming Prime Minister Andreas
Papandreou's extended incapacity had left the country virtually
ungoverned.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the decision today, ND leader Miltiades Evert noted
that the long illness and inability of the prime minister to carry
out his duties has created great dangers.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou was hospitalized on November 20 with pneumonia. He
has since suffered lung and kidney failure and no quick recovery
is expected.
</P>
<P>
The censure motion is expected to enjoy support by another
major opposition party "Political Spring", although it is unlikely
to shake the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), which
has a 19-seat majority in the 300-member parliament.
</P>
<P>
PASOK Executive Bureau decided last week to convene a central
committee meeting on January 20 to find a final solution to the
political problem created by the prolonged illness of Papandreou.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Expects Unprecedented Challenges To ANC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Ye Xingzeng)
</P>
<P>
Johannesburg, January 7 (Xinhua)-- The year 1996 is expected
to witness South Africa's ruling party facing unprecedented
challenges as the African National Congress (ANC) fights to
repair the damage apartheid has wrecked on the country.
</P>
<P>
The warning bell was rung by South African President Nelson
Mandela at the party's 84th anniversary celebrations at the
impoverished mining township of Khutsong outside Carletonville,
Gauteng Province.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said during the second year of post-apartheid era, the
South African society was victim to the "unacceptably high levels
of crime".
</P>
<P>
He promised the government would be committed to improving
living and working conditions for the police which are expected
to launch a massive war against crime in the country.
</P>
<P>
The ANC, now the largest black political party of the country,
was established in Bloemfontein on January 8, 1912.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote speech, Mandela said violence was part of South
Africa's heritage and was driven by a variety of causes, the most
obvious being unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The ANC-led Government of National Unity would have to ensure
a decisive victory for the genuinely democratic forces of the
country in the same way it did in the national, provincial and
local elections, said the President.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the living conditions of the people, especially
the overwhelming majority blacks, Mandela pointed out millions of
jobless, landless and homeless people fell victims of poverty,
with no access to education, health and self-advancement.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the President urged the public and the private
sectors to make their contributions as the situation would not
correct itself.
</P>
<P>
On the building of a "new and winning nation", Mandela said
progress in the reconstruction and development could not be
measured solely in terms of the volume of material benefits, but
must be judged also by the overall quality of life as well as the
health of society as a whole.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, the illegitimacy of the apartheid system and
the lawlessness and moral bankruptcy of white minority rule have
created a crisis of ethics.
</P>
<P>
Mandela called for the continued efforts to heal the wounds
of the past to ensure national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
"It is in this context that we must continue the struggle to
give life to what we said in the freedom charter -- that South
Africa belongs to all who live in it, black and white, and that
no government can justly claim authority unless it is based on
the will of the people as a whole," said the President.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, true reconciliation did not consist in merely
forgetting the past. It did not rest with black forgiveness,
sensitivity to white fears and tolerance of an unjust status quo,
on one hand, and white gratitude and appreciation underlined by a
tenacious clinging to exclusive privilege, on the other.
</P>
<P>
While reiterating the ANC's commitment to the national
reconciliation, Mandela also appealed to the National Party and
the Inkatha Freedom Party to make contributions to the creation
of a truly democratic, non-racial and non-sexist society.
</P>
<P>
"Vengeance is not our goal, the building of a new nation at
peace with itself because it is reconciled with its past, is our
objective," added the President.

<HEADLINE> PNA Appoints Committee to Investigate the Death of Ayyash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) today appointed a special committee to
investigate the murder of Hamas activist Yihye Ayyash, known as
"The Engineer", in Beit Lahiya north of Gaza City Friday.
</P>
<P>
At least five Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have been
arrested on suspicion of involvement in the killing of Ayyash,
and three of them were from south of the strip.
</P>
<P>
Ayyash, the object of an intense manhunt by the Israeli
Security Service (GSS), was blown up by a booby-trapped mobile
phone while talking on the phone to his father who wanted to know
how he was keeping.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media said that it appears the explosive device was
operated by remote control as he was talking into the phone.
</P>
<P>
Ayyash, got his nickname because of his bomb-making skills,
had been accused by Israel for masterminding a series of suicide
bombing attacks, which resulted in more than 50 deaths and 300
wounded.
</P>
<P>
Hamas blamed that the GSS was behind the assassination and
declared that the Islamic fundamentalist organization will seek
revenge attacks on Israeli targets.
</P>
<P>
One Hamas source said that Ayyash was given the mobile phone
by Usameh Hamad, a Hamas activist trusted by Ayyash, and Usameh
got the phone from his uncle Kamal Hamad, who has reportedly fled
to Israel following the incident.
</P>
<P>
The investigation of PNA's special committee, headed by
Mohammed Dahlan, chief of the Palestinian Preventive Security in
Gaza, is now centering on the question of how and when the mobile
phone was refitted, a Palestinian source said.
</P>
<P>
While Israel did not take responsibility for Ayyash's
assassination, an order was given Friday following news of his
death barring Israelis from entering any of the Palestinian
self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Since midnight Saturday night, the Israeli army has imposed a
closure on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, as part of
heightened security measures to prevent revenge attacks.

<HEADLINE> US Defense Secretary Arrives in Amman for Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of Defense William
Perry arrived here today for talks on Jordan's military needs,
including a long-sought military aid package to modernize
Jordan's forces.
</P>
<P>
During his meetings with King Hussein and senior Jordanian
officials, the Pentagon chief is also expected to put final
touches on U.S. military assistance to Jordan of a squadron of
prestigious F-16 fighter-bombers.
</P>
<P>
Western military experts said the ongoing negotiations, which
include a series of visits by U.S. military leaders to the
Kingdom, would not meet Jordan's initial hopes for a range of new
weaponry, the local press reported.
</P>
<P>
However, it is reported that Washington has agreed in
principle to provide Jordan with the single-engine F-16s, of
which the number is not immediately known but is estimated at
between 12 and 16.
</P>
<P>
The planes, along with other parts of a military package to
modernize a fighting force that had fallen on hard times, are
expected to be in use in the Kingdom this year, the press said.
</P>
<P>
A separate 100 million-U.S. dollar package now before
U.S. Congress would be focused on more mundane needs such as
extra trucks, spare parts, upgrades of existing weapons and
training.
</P>
<P>
Sources said Jordan is likely to get from Washington upgrades
of their present M-60 U.S.-made tanks rather than its requested
M1-A1 main battle tanks.
</P>
<P>
It is said that Jordan's requests for replacements for their
current model of Hawk missiles have been put aside.
</P>
<P>
Perry, who arrived here from Saudi Arabia, is currently on his
Middle East tour that already took him to Oman and will also
include Israel.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Ayyash Dies For Palestinian Cause </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 7 (Xinhua) -- PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat
said today that Yihye Ayyash, a legendary activist of the Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas), known as "the Engineer," died for the
Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a gathering of some 4,000 in the West Bank town of
Dura, Arafat, in his first public comment on the assassination of
of Ayyash, praised him as a martyr and a hero, who died for the
Palestinian cause. Ayyash was killed by a booby-trapped mobile
phone in Gaza Friday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat held Israel responsible for the assassination, saying
that Israel should not operate inside the autonomy area. Such a
move damaged the Palestinian security and violated the spirit of
reconciliation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The PLO leader flew to the West Bank Saturday to receive a
Golden Peace Medal awarded by the Greek Orthodox community in
Bethlehem. On Friday evening, Arafat, accompanied by several of
his top police and intelligence officers, went to the home of
senior Hamas activist Mahmoud Zahar to offer condolences, but
said nothing.
</P>
<P>
However, Arafat's media adviser Nabil Abu Rudeineh said Friday,
"We condemn the incident. We consider it disturbing that such
events take place on Palestinian territory."
</P>
<P>
Ziad Abu Ziad, standing to Palestinian elections as independent
candidate in East Jerusalem, said the killing might push Hamas
back to the path of armed struggle.
</P>
<P>
He said that "this is a provocative act," because it was
carried out at a very sensitive and delicate time when the
Palestinian leadership is trying its best to reach an agreement
on reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
He added that it will also cause an embarrassment for the
Palestinian leadership.

<HEADLINE> British PM Defends Expulsion of Saudi Dissident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
today defended the Government decision to expel a leading Saudi
dissident.
</P>
<P>
Major was quoted by the BBC television as saying that "Muhammed
Masari is an illegal immigrant who has used his hospitality in
this country to wage a campaign to try to bring down the Saudi
Arabian regime."
</P>
<P>
Last week, the British government announced that Masari, a
leader of a group known as the Committee for the Defence of
Legitimate Rights, had been refused to stay in Britain but he had
been offered a safe haven in Dominica.
</P>
<P>
Masari has repeatedly denounced what he calls the corruption
and anti-Islamic practices of the Saudi Royal Family, according to
a local press report.
</P>
<P>
His actions have embarrassed the British government and have
led to strong protests from Saudi Arabian government, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The British Prime Minister said the British government could
not "tolerantly look to one side" if those asylum seekers sought
to "create unsettled relationships with our allies."

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A world record and a lion's
share of gold medals marked a Chinese dominance in the two-day
first leg of this year's World Cup short-course swimming series
which closed here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
With nine out of the 17 gold medals to their credit yesterday,
the Chinese swimmers added five more titles to bring a golden

</P>
<P>
Han Xue, winner of the women's 100 meter breaststroke title
yesterday, set a new world record while taking the 50 meter
breaststroke today. Her time of 31.11 seconds beat the previous
world record of 31.19, set in November of 1992 by Swedish Louise
Karlsson.
</P>
<P>
Han, 15, was disqualified in the 100 meter freestyle heats this
morning, for a second fault start. "I did not do it intendedly,
just out of balance when I prepared the start on the block," she
explained.
</P>
<P>
"I've got to train still harder to win a spot in China's
Olympic team. And for this, I'd first to finish among the top two
in any event I enter at the national trials slated for this
April," she said.
</P>
<P>
Backstroke specialist Jia Yuanyuan, double winner for the 50
and 200 meter events yesterday, became the most successful swimmer
of the Hong Kong meet after taking the 100 meter title today.
</P>
<P>
China's world champion and world record holder Liu Limin won
her second gold Sunday, this time in the women's 50 meters
butterfly. She had took the 100 meters Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Freestyler Jiang Chengji, winner of the men's 50 meter event
yesterday, made it double after winning the 100 meters title today.
</P>
<P>
The eight-session World Cup series moves to Beijing for the
second leg set for Wednesday and Thursday. Chinese swimmers, who
are recovering from their appearance at the short-course world
championships in Brazil, are expected to be in a better shape
there.
</P>
<P>
But Chinese swimmers will skip all the six remaining stops of
the series, slated for European cities. They are obviously
reserving themselves for the Olympic Games this summer in
Atlanta.

WASHINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin said today that the government will not risk
defaulting on its obligations through mid-February.
</P>
<P>
But Rubin, on NBC's "Meet the Press" program, again urged U.S.
Congress to lift the 4.9 trillion dollars debt limit.
</P>
<P>
Republicans in the Congress have tried to use the need for an
increase in the debt ceiling as a lever in budget talks with
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
They have been frustrated as Rubin has found ways, approved by
the Justice Department, to keep borrowing money nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
Rubin reiterated that the Treasury will have to consider
additional extraordinary financial maneuvers to avoid default in
mid-February unless Congress raises the debt ceiling.

CHENGDU, January 7 (Xinhua) -- China's largest pig-raising
province of Sichuan is expected to export 2.9 million pigs to

<HEADLINE> Heilongjiang to Develop Grasslands, Water Surface </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Heilongjiang Province, a major
grain producer in China, has decided to develop grasslands and
water surface over the next few years, according to Provincial
Governor Tian Fengshan.
</P>
<P>
The province has a total of 4.33 million ha of grasslands and
666,700 ha of water surface, which have been deteriorating because
of mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
To solve such problems as low productivity of grasslands and
water surface and the waste of such resources, the province plans
to introduce a household contractual system to arouse the farmers'
initiative in developing such resources, Tian said.
</P>
<P>
The governor said that all grasslands and water surface yet to
be developed will be contracted to farmers over the next two or
three years.
</P>
<P>
By introducing the responsibility system, the province will be
able to turn livestock breeding and fishery into pillar industries
in rural areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang will have improved half of deteriorated grasslands
by the end of this century and all of such grasslands by the year
2010, he said, adding that grass output will be raised to 3,000 kg
per hectare.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2005 the annual output of fish and other aquatic
products in Helongjiang is expected to reach 500,000 tons, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kertai Township in the province's Durbet Mongolian Autonomous
County, which has contracted grasslands to farmers since 1985, has
spent one million yuan upgrading 2,600 ha of grasslands. As a
result, the per-capita income of local farmers rose to 1,050 yuan
in 1995 from less than 300 yuan in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Tonghe County, which developed 1,300 ha of water surface in
1995, netted in last year a total of 4,000 tons of fish valued at
20 million yuan.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan-Iran Border to Be Electrically Wired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistan-Iran border is to
be sealed off with electric wire to stem drug trafficking, said
Director General of Pakistan's Anti-Narcotics Force Major General
Salahuddin Tirmizi today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the drug destroying ceremony held in Attock, a town
northwest of Islamabad, he said the United Nations Drug Control
Program has provided the equipment for the electric wiring.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he called for the electric wiring of Pakistan-Afghan
border as well because "Afghanistan is the biggest poppy grower in
the world."
</P>
<P>
Tirmizi said Pakistan is making its best effort to curb the
drug menace as drug has become a source of great concern for
Pakistan. The number of drug addicts in the country increases by 7
percent annually.
</P>
<P>
He said some 4.4 tons of heroin and 172 tons of opium have been
confiscated in Pakistan till last September.
</P>
<P>
He said a comprehensive legislation -- Control of Narcotics
Substance Ordinance -- has been enacted covering all aspects of
drug production and trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said for the first time proceeds of drug
trafficking had been seized and assets of some 21 big drug barons
amounting to 4.9 billion rupees (143 million US dollars) had been
frozen.
</P>
<P>
He said six of the 16 alleged drug barons have been extradited
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
He said two of these alleged drug barons are at large while the
rest are facing trial in the courts.
</P>
<P>
Most of the drug barons, he said, have fled Pakistan. "Now it
is bad time for the drug barons in Pakistan," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the total area under poppy cultivation has reduced to
9,000 acres now compared with 15,000 acres in 1994 and 18,000
acres in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Tirmizi said Pakistan fully cooperates with friendly countries
in controlling drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has signed memoranda of understanding with the United
Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan to check drug trade, he
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A project for helicopters
shuttling between Haikou, capital of the island province of
Hainan, and Hai'an County of South China's Guangdong Province, has
been launched, according to an official with the Transportation
Bureau of Hainan Province.
</P>
<P>
The project is undertaken by the Gebei Huatian Helicopter Co,
Ltd with a total investment of 220 million yuan (26.51 million US
dollars) and is scheduled to be put into use by June next year.
</P>
<P>
It will take helicopters about ten minutes to cover the 18
sea miles between the two places, he said.
</P>
<P>
The first-phase construction of the project includes a
130,000-sq m helicopter base in Hai'an and a 13,000-sq m heli-pad
in Haikou with a combined investment of 40 million yuan (4.82
million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the project will improve the
transportation of the Qiongzhou Straits separating Hainan and the
mainland and promote the development of Hainan's tourism
industry.

<HEADLINE> British Home Secretary Torches Drug Cache </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British Home
Secretary Michael Howard set fire on a cache of narcotics today
and appreciated Pakistan's efforts to curb drug production and
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
"I pay tribute to the government of Pakistan for taking actions
to curb this trade which destroys lives of countless people in
your country and mine," he said on the occasion held in Attock, a
town northwest of Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Some 205 tons of hashish and 159 kilograms of heroin seized
over the last few years by the Attock police and customs were
burnt on the occasion, said the Associated Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Howard spoke highly of Pakistan's Anti-Narcotics Task force for
the dauntless efforts to stem the drug production and trade.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "much more needs to be done to make real
improvement."
</P>
<P>
He said there is a need for coordinated efforts by different
countries to check the drug menace, "as no country can control it
in isolation."
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan and Britain enjoy good relations. "There are
many links between this place and my country of which some are
very good."
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "worst of these links is trade in drugs which
comes through Pakistan to the United Kingdom."
</P>
<P>
"We have to work together for the sake of humanity," he said,
adding, "we can't succeed without your cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Howard arrived in Pakistan on Saturday for a three-day visit.

<HEADLINE> Trade Between Chinese Mainland, Taiwan Sees Steady Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Trade between the two sides of
the Taiwan Straits showed steady growth in 1995, with total
business volume estimated at 18 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
During the first ten months of 1995, trade between the Chinese
mainland and Taiwan increased by 15.7 percent over the same period
of the previous year. Observers here have predicted that the
volume of trade between the two sides of the Straits could reach
20 billion U.S. dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
They said that the China's efforts to gear its economic and trade
policies to international practices and the reduction of tariff
it launched recently has helped lay a solid foundation for the
substantial growth in trade across the Straits.
</P>
<P>
The observers expect to see a new investment boom from large
Taiwan enterprises this year.
</P>
<P>
They said that businesses from both the mainland and Taiwan have
become more aware of the importance and necessity of promoting
trade between the two sides.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Crown Prince Meets with US Defense Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabian Crown Prince
Abdullah iben Abdul-Aziz, brother of King Fahd iben Abdul-Aziz,
today met with visiting U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry,
according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Perry, who arrived in Riyadh on Saturday
after ending his visit to Oman, delivered a letter from
U.S. President Bill Clinton for King Fahd to the crown prince, who
is now in charge of the administration of the kingdom during his
brother's illness.
</P>
<P>
But the official Saudi Arabian news agency did not reveal any
detail of the letter.
</P>
<P>
It was Perry's third visit to Saudi Arabia in 15 months, but
the first since a car bomb ripped a military building in Riyadh on
November 13, 1995, killing five Americans and a Filipino.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, Perry met with Saudi Arabian Defense Minister
Prince Sultan iben Abdul-Aziz.
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. official from the U.S. Central command said that
Perry had recently approved a new "contingency plan" for
defending the Gulf, the local media reported.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials travelling with Perry said that there were now
13,000 U.S. troops in the Gulf region, including sailors and airmen
on U.S. warships.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Muscat on Saturday, Perry met Sultan Qaboos
of Oman, discussing with him how to bolster Oman's armed forces as
part of U.S. efforts to thwart potential threats. It was his first
visit to Oman.
</P>
<P>
Perry will also visit Jordan and Israel in his three-day Middle
East tour.

<HEADLINE> August First Stops Beijing's Winning Streak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions the August
First snapped the Beijing Shougang's eight-game winning streak on
Sunday with 100-69 home win here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The August First, led by Li Nan's 26 points, built a 47-30
half-time lead en route to take their ninth straight win in as
many outings, including fifth home triumph.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Shougang lost their starting 2.10-meter power forward
Bateer, who was suffering a stomach problem, and played flu-hit
2.15-meter center Shan Tao only 20-minute on the floor while
trailed as many as 34 points in the second half in the unexpected
one-sided game.
</P>
<P>
Shan scored 10 points on 8-for-20 field shoots and 2-for-4 free
throws for Beijing, which cut the margin to 27 points at 69-96
with 1:15 left. The Beijing Shougang also had its fifth straight
road winning streak came to an end.
</P>
<P>
With the win, the August First became one of two squads to
remain unbeaten in the 12-team league this season in the past nine
rounds.
</P>
<P>
"We lost the game but I am satisfied with the performance of
our substitutes, and also satisfied with our outside offence,"
said Yuan Chao, head coach of the Beijing Shougang.
</P>
<P>
"Shan hit flu and Bateer is staying at the hospital for the
stomach problem, so this was a difficult game for us without both
of our starting centers."
</P>
<P>
In other games on Sunday, Liaoning outshot the Nanjing Army
99-85 in Hehei to score its ninth straight victory after a 48-47
lead in the first half.
</P>
<P>
Ling Xiaolong hit 32 points for the Nanjing Army to lead the
scoring rankings in the ninth round.
</P>
<P>
The dismay continued to link with the winless Vanguard as the
police team lost to the Jinan Army 83-86 in Qingdao, its ninth
consecutive defeat.
</P>
<P>
The Vanguard, third place finisher last season, was as far as
18-point behind when they trailed 30-48 at haftime on the road
game.
</P>
<P>
In Tieling, Liaoning Province, the visiting Guangdong Hongyuan
overcome the Shenyang Army 92-88 to keep fourth place with 7-2
record.
</P>
<P>
In Jinan, Shangdong beat the Air Force 83-78 after staying
ahead 48-42 at the interval. Shangdong placed fifth with 5-4,
followed by the Shenyang Army and Zhejiang Zhongxin club in 4-5.
</P>
<P>
Zhen Wu scored 21 points including three 3-pointers to key his
Zhejiang team over Jiangsu 71-70 in Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
Xu Wei hit game-high 23 points and Hu Weidong added 16,
including three 3-pointers. Hu also grabbed 16 rebounds for
Jiangsu, who was outscored 36-42 in the first half and won only
one game so far.

<P>
WENZHOU, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Wenzhou City, a coast city in
east China's Zhejiang Province, has injected over 12 billion yuan
(1.45 billion US dollars) in its some 180 infrastructure projects
over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The investment has enabled this city to complete five highway
bridges, upgrade several highways and build an expressway.
</P>
<P>
Port construction of the city has also benefitted a great deal
from the development, with a major port upgraded and two new ones
built, which has remarkably increased the handling capacity of the
city.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the city has each year completed a
110,000-voltage and a 220,000-voltage and two 35,000-voltage power
transmission projects.
</P>
<P>
The boom of infrastructure construction has also added to the
city 560,000 lines of program-controlled telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
In the aspect of air transport, a new terminal building and a
an international joint check-up hall has helped the Wenzhou
Airport rank the 21th in terms of passenger flow among the 119
operational airports in the country.
</P>
<P>
Track-laying of the first railway of Wenzhou, linking the city
with Jinhua City, also in Zhejiang Province, began in December

<HEADLINE> Science Helps Boost Production in Shengli Oilfield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Shengli Oilfield, the country's
second largest in east China's Shandong Province, produced over 30
million tons of crude in 1995, maintaining its output at this
level for the ninth consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
The application of advanced science and technology accounts for
the stable production in this oilfield, according to local source.
</P>
<P>
The Shengli Oilfield has achieved 578 important scientific and
technological research results and won eight national scientific
research prizes over the past five years. Of those, some 42 are up
to the world's advanced levels.
</P>
<P>
The source said that new crude extracting methods have boosted
the annual output of thick oil and low-permeated oil to nearly
eight million tons.
</P>
<P>
With upgraded technology, offshore oil exploration has also
born fruit. The shallow Bohai Bay area in its vicinity has become
the "second battlefield" for Shengli Oilfield, which turned out
540,000 tons of offshore oil in 1995, said the source.

<HEADLINE> hke010718-- Pak Economy Shows Upward Trend: Government Consultant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The major policy reforms
initiated by the Pakistani government have improved the
performance of the country's economy, said the government's
consultant for investment Awais Jawaid Bangash today.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued here, he said Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) has increased to 4.7 percent in 1994-95 from 2.3
percent in 1992-93.
</P>
<P>
He said that the growth rate would have been higher if there
were no curl virus that hit the cotton crop, backbone of the
national economy, and the continued violence in the country's
economic center of Karachi, which claimed 1,800 lives in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Referring to investment, he said it increased at a rate of 16.7
percent in 1994-95 but it would have been far higher if there were
no disturbances in Karachi.
</P>
<P>
The investment declined as a proportion of GDP from 19.1
percent in 1992-93 to 17.6 percent in 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
But the national savings, on the other hand, he said, increased
from 13.7 percent to 15.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Exports, which had stagnated for the last three years, went up
by 17.1 per cent during the past year thanks to an increase in the
value of the country's exports, he said.
</P>
<P>
Imports also increased, mainly due to short supply of essential
products and the increase in machinery and equipment imports.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, due to a sharp increase in exports, balance of
payments deficit was contained to 2.4 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The government has made a concerted move to lower the fiscal
deficit by controlling the public expenditures and mobilizing
additional resources, he said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, fiscal deficit declined from 7.9 percent of GDP in
1992-93 to 5.6 percent of GDP in 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
Bangash explained that the target for the current year is a 5.0
percent growth of GDP and the primary deficit will be reduced to
zero.
</P>
<P>
He said the growth of money supply has also slowed.
</P>
<P>
Money supply grew at a rate of 16.6 percent in 1994-95 compared
with the growth of 18.0 percent in 1992-93.
</P>
<P>
However, in recent years inflation has shown a rising trend.
The inflation rate rose from 9.3 per cent in 1992-93 to 11.2 in
1993-94 and 12.9 in 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
Despite slow growth of money supply, the increase in inflation
may be attributed to supply shortages, increase in prices of some
essential products and changes in the tax structure.
</P>
<P>
The government's consultant said that the foreign exchange
reserves staged a fine recovery from the low of 1.11 US billion
dollars at the end of November, 1995 to 1.53 billion dollars as of
December 20, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The encouraging aspect was the rise of 127 million dollars in
the private foreign exchange accounts over a period of only 19
days in December, 1995.
</P>
<P>
This recovery in absolute terms amounted to 420 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The expert said the recovery in foreign exchange reserves is
undoubtedly very reassuring.

<P>
LONDON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major today has vowed to win the next general election although
his ruling Conservative Party's majority at the Parliament
neared vanishing point, local press reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC television interview, the prime minister said
that his party has survived the past five hard years, one of the
hardest peacetime periods any government had ever faced.
</P>
<P>
Major noted that it would be folly to throw away existing party
policies. The Labour Party, the main opposition party, knew
nothing about how they would achieve what they wish to.
</P>
<P>
It would be reckless to replace the present government with one
lack of experience and the British electorate does not like
parties that squabble with themselves, he added.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Conservative Party suffered a surprise attack
when Emma Nicholson, a prominent Conservative MP decided to join
the Liberal Democratic Party.

<HEADLINE> Sam Sung Expanses Businesses in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Sam Sung Group of the Republic
of Korea had established 11 joint ventures and 26 sales offices in
China by the end of 1995, with a total investment of about 350
million US dollars, according to Yong Chung, president of the
company's China Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The company signed contracts with Chinese partners for two
joint ventures last month. By the end of this year, it is expected
to invest additional four million dollars in China, the president
said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that most of the ventures are making profits, Yong
said Sam Sung plans to increase its total investment in China to
four billion dollars and bring to more than 30 the number of its
joint-ventures with Chinese partners by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
China boasts a huge potential market, skilled workers and
abundant resources. "That is why we are here," Yong said.
</P>
<P>
The company started exploring Chinese market in 1970s. In 1979,
it made the first trade deal between China and ROK by importing
coal via Hong Kong. After years of efforts, the company has
employed about 11,000 Chinese workers in its joint venture with
Chinese firms.
</P>
<P>
As part of its global strategy, Sam Sung has 130 Korean
employees here learning Chinese language, history and arts.
</P>
<P>
The group's Beijing Headquarters Building, which is being under
construction here with an investment of 150 million US dollars, is
scheduled to be completed in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Air Pollution Poses Threat to Health in Bangkok </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Dust-borne fungi and bacteria in
Bangkok's air are threatening the health of residents, especially
children and the elderly, the Bangkok Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
At least 14 fungi and 16 types of bacteria have been founded in
dust particles in the air and in vehicles, which might cause
respiratory, digestive and skin diseases, even brain disorders.
</P>
<P>
About 70 babies born in cars every day during the traffic jam
and their mothers are also prone to air-borne infection,
researchers from Mahidol University were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Particle matter was three to five times above the accepted
standard in the city, they said, calling for related government
agencies to take an urgent action to fight air pollution.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Pollution Control Department this year
will implement a government plan to reduce dust pollution through
improving fuel quality, engine and emission standards, and road
sweeping.
</P>
<P>
Other government agencies also will take measures to monitor
diesel and motorcycle exhaust and construction sites, which are
the main sources of air pollution.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Urges Congress to Work Fast on VAT Amendments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today urged both houses of congress to work fast on amendments to
the special value-added tax (VAT) law, particularly those that
"have provisions which we should exempt from vat."
</P>
<P>
The president said that leaders of both houses of congress
agreed to "act early on the proposed amendments as soon as
congress is convened on January 22, 1996."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president warned entrepreneurs and business
operators against taking advantage of the confusion over the VAT
law by unjustifiably raising the costs of their goods and
services.
</P>
<P>
"There are a few unscrupulous businessmen and operators who are
mulcting the public and taking advantage of the situation," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his order to the Department of Finance and the
Bureau of Internal Revenue to intensify the public information
campaign on the VAT, saying the VAT law "is not intended to punish
the poor."
</P>
<P>
He said the office of the president and the government
departments concerned will study possible amendments to the VAT
law.
</P>
<P>
Among the provisions the chief executive cited for possible
exemption from VAT are textbooks, publishing cooperatives, house
rentals and all other goods and services that benefit the general
public.

FUZHOU, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Liu Bilan, a woman living in the
countryside of east China's Fujian Province, has carved figures of
prominent statesmen and stateswomen on slabs of stone.
</P>
<P>
During the Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Israel on High Alert after Death of Hamas Activist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Israel went on high alert
following the death of Hamas activist Yehia Ayyash, known as "the
Engineer," in Gaza Friday, as Hamas threatened to launch revenge
attacks on Israeli targets.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army sealed off the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
indefinitely as of midnight Saturday, as part of heightened
security measures taken to prevent revenge attacks.
</P>
<P>
Ayyash, object of an intense manhunt by the Israeli General
Security Service (GSS), was blown up by a booby-trapped mobile
phone Friday in Beit Haliya on the outskirts of the Jabalya
refugee camp north of Gaza City.
</P>
<P>
The Hamas activist, 30, got his nickname for his bomb-making
skills as he had studied chemical engineering. He had been accused
by Israel of masterminding a series of suicide bombing attacks,
which resulted in the killing of 67 people and the wounding of 300
others.
</P>
<P>
He had been a fugitive since 1992, suspected of several other
attacks, and was believed to have been hiding in the Gaza Strip
since the start of Palestinian autonomy in May 1994.
</P>
<P>
Capturing Ayyash has been a top priority for the GSS, but he
had managed to escape GSS arrest at the last minute at least on
two occasions.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli reports, Ayyash met his end at his
current hideaway in Beit Lahiya, when a mobile phone exploded,
blasting away half of his head and scattering his brain.
</P>
<P>
It appears the explosive device was operated by remote control
as he was speaking into the phone, a similar device in a
conventional telephone killed a Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO) operative in Rome 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The son of Ayyash's landlord, identified as Ikrimeh Hamad, was
suspected of planting the phone, but it was not clear whether he
had fled or been arrested.
</P>
<P>
Ayyash's death was first announced by Israel Radio Friday
afternoon and was later confirmed by the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
Hamas blamed that the GSS was behind the incident and Izzadin
Kassam, Hamas' armed wing, declared that they will launch revenge
attacks on Israeli targets.
</P>
<P>
On Friday evening, PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, accompanied by
several of his top police and intelligence officers, went to the
home of senior Hamas activist Mahmoud Zahar in Gaza and offered
condolences.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Palestinians attended Ayyash's funeral in
Gaza Saturday, and his body was taken in a procession from the
Palestine Mosque to the Shajaiya Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
Gunmen of Izzadin Kassam fired in the air despite a general ban
on the public display of firearms except by security personnel,
and two people were reportedly injured by the gunfire.
</P>
<P>
Many Palestinian policemen were in the funeral procession,
including Gaza police chief Ghazi Jabali, who was vilified by
Hamas after a confrontation with police outside the Palestinian
Mosque in November 1994, which left 12 Hamas supporters dead.
</P>
<P>
Jabali described the assassination as "a clear violation of
the peace accord." Hamas had committed itself in the practice to
the peace process for the past four months, but Israel did not
respect that, he added.
</P>
<P>
Several senior PNA officials were also in the
procession. Arafat left for Bethlehem during the funeral to attend
the Greek Orthodox Christmas celebrations and received a peace
award.
</P>
<P>
Hamas declared a three-day commercial strike all across the
Palestinian autonomous areas and PLO's mainstream Fatah joined
in. In Jenin, Ramallah, Nablus and Hebron, Hamas staged a mass
procession Saturday in which others joined.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, in Ayyash's home village of Rafat near
Kalkilya, there was symbolic funeral as villagers could not
attend the funeral in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
However, the Israeli army permitted Ayyash's parents and wife
to go to Gaza along with his three-year-old and six-year-old sons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli officials expressed satisfaction with
Ayyash's death. Foreign Minister Ehud Barak told Israel Television
that he is confident the elimination of Ayyash will save many
lives in the long term.
</P>
<P>
In a relative development, an order was issued Friday following
news of Ayyash's death, barring Israelis from entering any of the
Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media said that the closure imposed on the West Bank
and Gaza would last at least until Wednesday, but might remain in
effect until after the Palestinian Council elections on January 20.
</P>
<P>
Israeli analysts said that the incident came just 15 days away
from the first Palestinian elections and would hurt Arafat and the
Fatah movement in the elections as the opposition would point out
that Israel was able to act in the heart of the Palestinian
autonomous areas.
</P>
<P>
It could also lead to an absolute boycott by Hamas of the
elections and jeopardize the reconciliation process between the
fundamentalist organization and the PNA.

<P>
MANILA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Export earnings of the Philippine
garments and textiles reached 2.88 billion US dollars last year,
up 12.5 percent from 2.56 billion dollars posted in 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to the Garments and Textile Export Board, the rise
was due to the 14.7 percent increase in the country's exports to
quota countries from 1.98 billion dollars in 1994 to 2.28 billion
dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Exports to quota countries accounted for 79 percent of the
total sales of the country's garments and textiles.
</P>
<P>
Exports to the US, which went up 17.3 percent from 1.53 billion
dollars to 1.79 billion dollars, accounted for 62 percent of the
total export earnings from quota countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, exports to non-quota countries increased 4.57
percent from 570.98 million dollars to 597.08 million dollars last
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Ravi Engineering
Limited was formally handed over to a Singapore company here today
by the Pakistan's Privatization Commission.
</P>
<P>
The sale agreement was signed by Petrosin Products Pte. Ltd.,
Singapore and the Privatization Commission on December 21, 1995,
said the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP).
</P>
<P>
Ravi Engineering Ltd. was established in 1965 and was
nationalized in 1972. It was auctioned on June 5, 1995 under the
government's privatization policy, and is now a subsidiary fully
owned by Petrosin Products Pte., Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Ravi Engineering is one of the pioneers in the country's
mechanical engineering industry and is well-equipped to carry out
heavy and light mechanical fabrication jobs.
</P>
<P>
The company has been going through heavy losses due to low
efficiency, low production, excessive labor and loss of market.
</P>
<P>
Its current clientele include a number of best known companies
in the country, such as Oil and Gas Development Corporation,
Pakistan Oil Field Limited and Ittehad Chemicals.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore company plans to introduce state-of-the-art
technology to make the unit more viable and up to international
standards, said APP.

<P>
HOHHOT, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Horqin Nature Reserve in
Inner Mongolia reflecting a perfect natural landscape of the
Horqin grassland has become a national-level reserve.
</P>
<P>
The reserve is the second natural reserve in the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous region for the protection of natural environment. The
first is the Dalai Nur Lake Nature Reserve in Hulun Buir League
(prefecture).
</P>
<P>
Under protection in the Horqin reserve are rare birds, such as
cranes and storks, as well as their habitat of marshlands,
according to Wu Jianguo, head of the Nature Protection Division of
the Regional Environment Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Lying in eastern Inner Mongolia, the 1,300 sq km reserve was
established in May 1986 as a county-level natural reserve. In
1994 it became a regional-level reserve with the approval by the
autonomous regional government.
</P>
<P>
The reserve has more than 450 species of seed plants. It is
home to about 200 species of rare birds, seven of which are under
special protection, such as red-crested cranes, white cranes,
black cranes and golden eagles.
</P>
<P>
It is rich in water and marshland resources, and has more than
40 lakes with a total water surface of 1,800 ha, and 45,000 ha of
marshlands, according to experts.

MANILA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The fourth round of talks between
the Philippine government and the Moro National Liberation Front
(MNLF) will resume in Jakarta next month to discuss the issues on
autonomy for Muslim Mindanao, government officials said today.
</P>
<P>
The government-MNLF panels held their talks in Jakarta from
November 26 to December 1, 1995 with the signing of an interim
agreement on 123 separate issues on which two sides had reached a
consensus.
</P>
<P>
But five major issues remain unresolved, and these are: the
timing of a plebiscite to set up the proposed autonomous
government; the geographic scope of autonomy; the number of MNLF
soldiers to be integrated into the armed forces and the national
police; revenue-sharing in the proposed autonomous area, and
establishment of a regional security force.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF has been asking the government to implement the 1976
Tripoli agreement which grants autonomy for 16 provinces and 10
major cities in Mindanao.

<P>
SINGAPORE, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's national athletics
coach Kerry Hill from New Zealand was sacked because he failed to
earn the respect of his trainees, it was reported here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
His three-year contract was put to an end by the Singapore
Amateur Athletics Association (SAAA) 16 months before its expiry
date.
</P>
<P>
Hill now had only two trainees while several other notable
athletes were not on good terms with the coach.
</P>
<P>
Hill, who arrived in Singapore in 1994 as head coach for a
monthly salary of 8,570 U.S. dollars, was reportedly involved in a
series of controversial incidents last year.
</P>
<P>
Singapore won only one gold in the track and field events at
the recent Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Chiangmai, Thailand,
failing to achieve their four-gold target.
</P>
<P>
SAAA president Loh Lin Kok said the termination did not mean
that Hill had done something wrong, adding that it's because
Singapore athletes have not embarked on a right track for
progress.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK Economy Mixed Performance In 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's economy showed a
mixed performance in 1995, with a slowdown in growth which is
forecast to be around five percent in real terms, an industrial
and business seminar was told.
</P>
<P>
Ip Yeuk Lam, who chaired the seminar organized by the Hong Kong
Chinese Chamber of Commerce, reviewed Hong Kong's economic
panorama in 1995 in an opening speech on Friday.
</P>
<P>
External trade and tourism were two bright spots in the whole
picture, Ip said.
</P>
<P>
Trade, especially entrepot trade, continued to be the main
engine to push Hong Kong's economy forward. The territory's total
exports in 1995 are projected to increase by 14 percent, and
entrepot trade, by 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent re-exports came from or went to China.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong set a new record in December 1995, when for the first
time the territory greeted its 10 millionth visitor in the year,
showing strong growth momentum in tourism.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is expected to outstrip the apparel and textile
industry in the next two years to become Hong Kong's biggest hard
currency earner.
</P>
<P>
Ip also mentioned the New Airport at Chek Lap Kok and a number
of related large infrastructure projects, which he said have had a
positive effect on the territory's economy.
</P>
<P>
However, sluggish consumer demand, rising unemployment and high
inflation remained the cause for concern in 1995, said Ip. The
inflation rate in 1995 is forecast to be 8.5 percent, while the
jobless rate climbed up to 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the first 10 months of 1995, deposits in local banks
increased by 16 percent over the previous corresponding period,
showing that consumers exercised greater prudence in spending.
</P>
<P>
Ip was, however, optimistic about Hong Kong's economy, which he
said has "a solid foundation" -- the territory's foreign exchange
reserves rank seventh in the world and its exports the fifth.
</P>
<P>
Looking forward to 1996, Ip said that the opening market in
China will continue to stimulate Hong Kong's economy.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Overseas Construction Orders to Hit Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 7 (Xinhua) -- South Korea is expected to get a
total of 10.8 billion U.S. dollars worth of overseas construction
orders this year, up 26.9 percent from last year, the Ministry of
Construction and Transportation said here today.
</P>
<P>
The projected figure breaks down to 9.1 billion U.S. dollars
in the West and Southeast Asian region, 933 million U.S. dollars
in the Middle East and the rest in other regions, according to
the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The figure, if really attained, will hit a new record high in
overseas construction orders in 13 years after South Korean
builders managed to sign contracts totaling some 10 billion
U.S. dollars in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Last year, South Korea construction firms received overseas
orders worth 8.51 billion U.S. dollars, 13.9 percent more than
the previous year's 7.47 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
A ministry official said the increase owed itself partially to
a boom in the overall construction market, spurred by the apparent
end of a global economic recession.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that construction technology of South Korean
companies is also gaining ground, which, along with the
competitiveness of their bids, also contributed to the increase in
their overseas construction orders.

<HEADLINE> Israel Takes Pains to Reduce National Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Treasury has
announced a controversial plan to increase the consumer price of
gasoline by 15 percent and cut the budget by 1.3 billion shekels
(some 419 million U.S. dollars), in an attempt to reduce the
national deficit, reported Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by Fiance Minister Avraham Shohat
here Saturday night. He said the Treasury's measures will be
discussed at today's cabinet meeting and are likely to be approved
and he has already secured Prime Minister Shimon Peres' support
for the plan.
</P>
<P>
The cuts, totaling roughly 0.75 percent of the national
budget, will be the biggest at the Education Ministry amounting to
 120 million dollars. And the rest of the ministries' budgets
will also be cut.
</P>
<P>
Reductions include 71 million dollars at the Housing and
Construction Ministry, 32.25 million dollars the Defense Ministry,
20.6 million dollars at the Ministry of Internal Security, and
17.4 million dollars at the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Explaining his decisions, Shohat said the growth this year in
the balance-of-payments deficit amounted to 3.5 percent of the
GDP, as opposed to the originally planned 2.75 percent, warranted
"corrective measures" to return the budget to its original course.
</P>
<P>
Shohat attributed the increase in the deficit to the
government's failure to foresee unexpected expenditures last year,
which stemmed from the restructuring of the health care industry,
the implementation of the Israeli-Palestinian Oslo 2 agreements,
and increased allocations for pensions.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Cosmetics companies in
Malaysia were today urged to do more research and development work
to help improve the quality of their products.
</P>
<P>
A total of 33 projects for producing cosmetics and toiletries
had been approved by the authorities since 1994, Malaysian
Minister of International Trade and Industry Rafidah Aziz told the
press today.
</P>
<P>
The total investment in the projects amounted to 314.4 million
Malaysian ringgit (about 125.76 million U.S. dollars), she said
when opening a new cosmetics shopping complex here. Of the total,
235.6 million ringgit, or 75 percent, came from foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
But She said most of the companies involved in the production
of cosmetics and toiletries only did the blending and mixing here,
and there was little or no research and development work.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah advised them, especially the local companies to go into
research and development work so as to improve the quality of
their products.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Refuses To Take Some IMF Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
refused to implement wholesale International Monetary Fund (IMF)
recommendations on reducing the budget deficit as some of these
measures have negative repercussions to the country.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe in a
interview with the Sunday Mail, the country's largest sunday
newspaper. He said that there were several differences between
the government and the IMF which dated back to 1980.
</P>
<P>
he said that some of these differences included the pace of
retrenchment, reduction of expenditure on education, health,
defense, among others.
</P>
<P>
In 1980 when the present government took over it negotiated
with members of the IMF and other donor organizations and a
program was worked out which ran for two to three years before it
went sour because the IMF and donor organizations were insisting
on reducing expenditure at that stage, he said.
</P>
<P>
''We said how could we do it. We have emerged from a very
difficult situation where people were displaced, they were
refugees. schools had been closed, bridges broken down... and it
was not possible for us to reduce expenditure.''
</P>
<P>
Mugabe also queried the thinking of reducing the budget
deficit by retrenching, ''true we all agree that where a civil
service is too large it must be reduced. When we say to them
what happens, these people will be going to the streets, how will
they manage with their domestic problems, some of which have been
intensified by retrenchment. They must keep their children in
school, pay hospital fees etcetera.''

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Eritrea Makes Progress In Transport (By Chen Cailin) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- In the year 1995, Eritrea,
as a new nation in the world community, made remarkable progress
in its transport.
</P>
<P>
Eritrean transport network was damaged or destroyed during the
30 years of war. Many roads in the country were closed and Port
Massawa was badly damaged by bombing raid. After their
independence, the Eritrean people put their stress on
rehabilitation and reconstruction of the devastated transport
network as they know that repair of transport network is
necessary for the revival of national economy and the building of
a new nation.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from the country, sea transport made big
progress in 1995. During the last quarter of the year, the ports
of Assab and Massawa accommodated 729 ships, over 2.5 million
tons of goods and about 10,000 passengers. In both ports, over
two million tons of goods were transited. besides, five ships,
three tugboats and three boats were repaired at a cost of 250,000
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Ministry of Transport has signed agreements
with the World Bank and the German Technical Cooperation on the
rehabilitation of the port facilities in Assab and Massawa. There
are also plans to enlarge and modernize the port of Massawa.
</P>
<P>
The railway rehabilitation program also made progress in the
past year. The 306-kilometer long railway from Port Massawa to
Asmara, capital of the nation, which was constructed by the
Italians and has been out of use for the last 20 years, is being
repaired. A segment over 40 kilometers long has already been
completed. Starting from Port Massawa, trains, wagons and diesel
locomotives are ready to give the required services.
</P>
<P>
As for the land transport, the Ministry of Transport paid
attention both to road repairing and distributing transport
services in the country. Last year, 250 large, 427 medium-sized
and 313 small buses with a total of 900,000 seats in 119
transport lines were registered in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the civil aviation also made progress last
year. The first phase of the construction work being undertaken
at the Asmara terminal is nearing completion, with the lighting
system being installed and up-to-date meteorological technology
being tested.
</P>
<P>
1995 has registered an increase in flight activities, with
commercial flights showing 5 percent and non-commercial flights
about 70 percent increase over the previous year. The number of
passengers increased by one percent and cargo by 24 percent.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes Balanced Budget Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
signed Saturday a bill to reopen all federal government after
submitting a balanced budget plan at budget talks with Congress.
</P>
<P>
"This plan will show that you can balance the budget in seven
years and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and environment,
and provide tax relief to working families," Clinton told
reporters in his Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
Republicans criticized the president's budget proposal as
containing too much spending and actually increasing taxes, rather
than reducing them. But Democrats said the measure could eliminate
federal deficits with gentler reductions in important social
programs than Republicans want.
</P>
<P>
The Congressional Budget Office had certified that the proposal
would eliminate federal deficits by 2002.
</P>
<P>
The two sides, however, have yet to seek a deal for balancing
the budget in seven years by paring savings from Medicare,
Medicaid and other social programs, plus cutting taxes. Further
negotiations were scheduled to be held on Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
House Budget Chairman John Kasich and Senate Budget Committee
Chairman Pete Domenici said Clinton's proposal would spend 400
billion to 500 billion dollars more than Republicans have proposed
through 2002.
</P>
<P>
According to Democrats, the Clinton plan would cut taxes over
seven years by 87 billion dollars, well below the Republicans'
proposed 240 billion dollars. It would extract savings of 102 billion
dollars from Medicare and 52 billion dollars from Medicaid, about
half of what Republicans want, plus an additional 295 billion dollars
from other domestic programs -- about 75 percent of the Republican's
proposal.
</P>
<P>
Clinton signed legislation early Saturday to restore the wages
and jobs of 760,000 federal workers who had been caught in the
21-day federal shutdown. But that measure and a companion bill he
signed Saturday reopened only some of the programs in the scores of
departments and agencies that had been affected by the shutdown.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of another measure Congress approved Friday,
Clinton's endorsement of a balanced-budget proposal will let all
other affected programs resume functioning through January 26.

dozens were injured after a suspension bridge in southeast
Bulgaria collapsed throwing 200 people into an icy river.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Pivotals suffered a setback
on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) market last week on bull
liquidation coupled with absence of institutional buying.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here today said that the trading for the new
year started on a hopeful note and several scrips improved during
the earlier part of the week.
</P>
<P>
Share prices, however, turned weak thereafter on selling
pressure and lack of speculative buying. the volume of business
was below normal and the outlook appeared subdued for the coming
week.
</P>
<P>
The BSE sensitive index retracted from the week's best level of
3,131.37 to 3,041.82, but recovered slightly to finish at 3,048.86
with the net loss of 61.63 points compared to the pre-Christmas
level of 3,110.49. The national index lost 31.79 points to
1,398.96 from the previous level of 1,430.75.
</P>
<P>
The trading sentiment was affected mainly because of heavy
selling pressure by both domestic and foreign financial
institutions and institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
Marketmen attributed the dull start of the year 1996 to various
factors including the ongoing liquidity crunch, weakening of the
rupee value against the US dollar and the forthcoming
parliamentary elections.

BUCHAREST, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Romanian customs have seized
4.5 kilograms of heroin worth 550,000 U.S. dollars in their first
major haul of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The heroin was found in a Turkish tourist's luggage when he
arrived in Giurgiu, a port city 70 kilometers south of Bucharest
and a major transport hub between Bulgaria, Turkey and other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Romania is becoming a key staging post for European
drug-traffickers who have taken advantage of Bulgaria's
geographical location and weak security, the Romanian media
reports.
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, drugs from the Middle East, Asia and
Latin-America are being smuggled to other European countries via
Romania.
</P>
<P>
Last year more than 5,000 kilograms of drugs were nabbed at
various ports. The police seized 794 kilograms of marijuana from a
lone trafficker on October 30.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of native drug users has mushroomed as
global drug traffickers infiltrate Romania. Despite the negligible
300 addicts on police records, the number is expected to grow
significantly.
</P>
<P>
To combat the "drug invasion," Romania has set up an anti-drug
directorate and strengthened cooperation with other European
countries.

<HEADLINE> Colombia To Step Up Anti Drugs Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Colombian police have unveiled
an ambitious new year anti-drugs campaign which will call on the
army, navy and airforce for help.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to step up their fight, police plan to capture some
3,000 drug traffickers and destroy most of the 36,000 remaining
hectares of land growing coca, opium poppy and marihuana plants
this year.
</P>
<P>
They also aim to confiscate 50 tons of cocaine, dismantle 600
laboratories, confiscate 3,500 tons of solid and 1.5 million
gallons of liquid substances used in processing raw materials into
processed drugs.
</P>
<P>
Police will also target the traffickers' transport and
distribution networks - they plan to ground 100 aircraft,
immobilize 500 vehicles, confiscate 600 weapons and destroy 200
secret airstrips, on top of the 80 aircraft and 99 airports
destroyed last year.
</P>
<P>
Antidrug Police Director Col. Leonardo Gallego said Friday that
they destroyed 30,476 hectares cultivating coca, opium poppy and
marihuana plants last year, and this year they plan to eliminate
most of the 36,000 remaining hectares.
</P>
<P>
"The target of the combat is to invalidate at least 35,000
hectares for drug plants cultivation," said Gallego, adding that
they will enlist the support of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force,
the Security Administrative Department, and the General Prosecutor
and the General Attorney offices.
</P>
<P>
The antidrug director said that there are some 25,000 hectares
cultivated with coca plant, 5,000 hectares with opium poppy, and
6000 hectares with marihuana in the country.
</P>
<P>
On February 8 last year Colombian President Ernesto Samper
Pizano set a two-year deadline to eradicate all illicit plants
cultivation.
</P>
<P>
Gallego believed the 1996 targets of the all-embracing
anti-drugs strategy are achievable.
</P>
<P>
"Together with the destruction of cultivation must intensify
control operations and get rid of drug trafficking organizations,
processing installations, drug shipments, and all the means
involved in drug trafficking," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian government has allocated 10 billion pesos (about
10 million U.S. dollars) for a program to encourage farmers to
substitute drug cultivation with legitimate plants. Some 8,000 of
the country's 32,000 farmers growing drugs have applied to the
program so far.

BRASILIA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's world champion soccer
team will be granted U.S. visas today so they can take part in the
10-nation Golden Cup Tournament in California, despite the partial
shutdown of the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian team will travel tomorrow to Los Angeles,
California after being permitted to enter the United States, said
Marco Antonio Teixeira, general secretary of the Brazilian Football
Confederation.
</P>
<P>
U.S. diplomatic representatives worldwide have only been
granting visas "for humanitarian reasons" since December 17, 1995,
due to the partial shutdown of the U.S. government caused by a
dispute between the U.S. President and Congress over a balanced
budget.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian confederation had threatened to withdraw its team
from the Golden Cup Tournament if its players were not granted
visas for the American nations tournament, held from January 10 to
21 in three California cities.

<HEADLINE> Guatemala to Elect New President on Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Nearly four million
Guatemalans will go to the polls on Sunday in a second round of
presidential elections to replace outgoing President Ramiro de
Leon Carpio.
</P>
<P>
Heading polls with a six percent margin is the candidate of the
pro-business National Advancement Party(PAN), Arzu, a businessman
whose main campaign pledge is to attack corruption.
</P>
<P>
He has a five to eight point advantage over his only rival,
Portillo of the Guatemalan Republican Front(FRG), who promised to
be tough on crime and violence if he wins on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In the first round of elections last November, Arzu had
36.5 percent of the vote while Portillo obtained 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
Since neither had the 50 percent-plus-one absolute
majority needed to win, a second round is necessary.
</P>
<P>
The election is being held against a backdrop of violence. Two
members of a left-wing coalition, the New Guatemala Democratic
Front, were murdered in the western province of Totonicopan, party
leaders said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Common crime is a major worry in Guatemala, where there is a
daily average of two kidnappings, 13 car thefts and eight killings.
</P>
<P>
Supreme Electoral Court (TSE) President Mario Guerra Roldan said
everything is ready for the 3.7 million Guatemalans to vote in the
6,348 booths installed in the 330 municipalities of the 21
departments of the country.
</P>
<P>
Guerra Roldan said the TSE will guarantee the transparency of
the ballot, and added that voting will be witnessed by 200
international observers, including 60 from the Organization of
American States (OAS) and 46 from the European Union (EU).

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Investment from the European
Union (EU) is moving ahead steadily, today's "China Daily"
reported in its Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
During the first six months of last year, EU business people
signed investment contracts involving a total pledged EU
investment of 2.6 billion US dollars, said officials of the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation, adding that
the figure rose by 13 percent compared with the same period of
1994.
</P>
<P>
The upward trend is eye-catching since it differed from the
29.5 percent slide in overall contracted overseas investment into
China during the first half of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The actual inflow of EU capital also posted a gain. It jumped
by 35 percent over the same period of 1994 to top 700 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
This zeal is expected to be maintained in the coming years
since many EU-based big names have announced ambitious schedules
to expand their business in China, officials said.

<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The National Police have
promised to give special protection to Honduran President Carlos
Roberto Reina's family and relatives, after one of his nephews was
kidnapped and tortured.
</P>
<P>
Mauricio Reina was kidnapped and tortured Wednesday, January 3,
by an unidentified gang in San Pedro Sula, the country's main
industrial city. The criminals then fled in a stolen vehicle.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to give special protection to all members of the
family of President Reina at whatever level is necessary," said
Col. Andres Urtecho, regional head of the National Police,
referring to Wednesday's incident.
</P>
<P>
The president's nephew, who works at a state institution, said
he was tortured by three men, two of them dressed in traffic
police uniforms, near San Pedro Sula.
</P>
<P>
"I had a telephone call from a man who identified himself as
the chauffeur of San Pedro Sula's Mayor Luis Bustmante, saying
that the official was inviting me to a meeting in a house in the
suburbs of the city," said Mauricio Reina.
</P>
<P>
Two men, supposedly traffic policemen with badges identifying
them as Chacon and Caceres, got into the car he was traveling in.
</P>
<P>
"Everything looked normal, but after advancing some 600 feet,
Caceres hit me in the face with his hand. The traffic agents
detained the vehicle and a white car approached, from which a
third man got out," he said.
</P>
<P>
The men slashed his shirt and trousers. Then lit cigarettes
which they extinguished on his knees. They also forced him to
drink water from a can containing excrement and injected him with
an unknown liquid in his knee and toe.
</P>
<P>
After torturing Reina, the criminals abandoned him and fled in
the white car. enditem

<P>
CARACAS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan army has broken
up a Colombian guerrilla group opposed to the Colombian government
and allegedly involved in drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The 19-man group, said to belong to the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia (FARC), the country's oldest and most active
guerrilla group, was captured in the southern state of Apure,
bordering Colombia, on December 30, the local daily newspaper El
Universal reported.
</P>
<P>
Eleven are being held by the Venezuelan military authorities,
charged with subversion and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The arrests followed a three-month investigation on reports of
extortions committed by Colombina left-wing guerrillas operating
across the border in Venezuela. The suspected guerrillas were
allegedly raising "revolutionary tax" from local farmers and
businessmen, a Defense Ministry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Colombia and Venezuela pledged last November to intensify their
common fight against violence, guerrilla and drug trafficking and
mark their 2,200km border with signposts.
</P>
<P>
In a separate incident, Venezuelan Defense Minister Moises
Orozco admitted a Venezuelan army patrol mistakenly entered
Colombian territory but blamed the incursion on border demarcation
problems.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Back-to-Work Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Saturday that budget negotiations with the Republican-led
U.S. Congress have reached "decision time".
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio address, Clinton appealed to Republicans to
join him in reaching a balanced-budget deal that reflects
"national unity" instead of partisan conflict.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the budget debate had dominated politics in
Washington for a long time "and now it is decision time, time to
move beyond arguments and come to conclusions."
</P>
<P>
Clinton and House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich and
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, along with leaders of the
Democratic minority in Congress, are to meet on Saturday, Sunday
morning, and Monday.
</P>
<P>
Early today Clinton signed legislation to restore the jobs and
pay of three-quarters of a million government workers while he and
Congress negotiate how to balance the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
All 280,000 furloughed federal workers will return to their
jobs under the measure that cleared Congress on Friday. Those
employees, and 480,000 others who have worked without pay since
the shutdown began on December 16, will receive full current and
retroactive wages.
</P>
<P>
But the measure provides pay for the affected workers only
through January 26, when a new shutdown would begin if there's no
agreement by then on a balanced budget in seven years.
</P>
<P>
The House and Senate also passed a companion bill that would
restore many government services shut down three weeks ago when
legal spending authority for them lapsed. But the White House said
Congress did not send it for Clinton's signature immediately.
</P>
<P>
That measure would cover such programs as meals for senior
citizens, aid to welfare recipients and veterans benefits.
National parks, museums and passport offices also would reopen,
with most of the programs funded through September 30, the end of
this fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Congress also passed a third bill, that would fully reopen the
government through January 26, provided the president submitted a
balanced budget plan with estimates certified by the Congressional
Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
That bill also was not sent to Clinton immediately, the White
House said.

<P>
MAPUTO, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Landmines kill an average of 40
people and maim scores of others in Mozambique each month, the
chief of the national landmine clearance commission, Osorio
Mateus, has said.
</P>
<P>
The toll might be much higher considering the fact that
figures from the remote areas could not be collected timely and
effectively, Radio Mozambique today quoted Mateus as saying.
</P>
<P>
The commission has removed more than 10 thousand landmines
across Mozambique since it was set up months ago, Mateus said.
</P>
<P>
The commission is mainly in charge of clearing mines laid on
the roads. It has demined 5,800 kilometers of roads so far.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations estimates, a total of two
million landmines have been planted across the country in the
past three decades.
</P>
<P>
Mateus called for the international community to give more
financial assistance to his commission in landmine clearance in
the country.

Government officials were quoted as saying that Britain, which

countries's defense force's capabilities.
</P>
<P>
These included the authorization of a "situation center", to be
constructed inside the former bank building that houses the WEU.
From it, the WEU will conduct peace-keeping, humanitarian,
evacuation and other operations on behalf of the European Union.

Michael Portillo, the defense secretary, declared last year
that british soldiers must not die for Brussels, but he and

They signed up to a document at the Madrid meeting on November,
which stresses the need to develop a "European security and
defense identity".

With a timeframe aimed at all-party talks by the end of
February, the two governments needed to act decisively and
purposefully, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the international commission in charge of arms
decommissioning had adopted an urgent and energetic approach in
examining the arms issue. The two governments had a clear duty to
adopt a similar approach to the other track, the preparation for
all-party talks, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said no party should have a veto over the start of all-party
talks, as such a veto denied the rest of parties the right to
engage in a democratic negotiations process aimed at resolving the
conflict in Ireland permanently.
</P>
<P>
But the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) reiterated its firm
opposition to British government contact with Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
The DUP secretary Nigel Dodds said in a statement on Friday
that even if the present series of killings were to be halted, "it
remains wrong for the British government to be maintaining links
and conferring legitimacy upon Sinn Fein-IRA".

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Committee of Under-
Secretaries of the Labor and Social Affairs Ministries of the six
Gulf Arab countries today held its 17th meeting in Manama, the
capital of Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting is organized by the executive bureau of the
Council of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Labor Ministers.
</P>
<P>
To arrange for the growing ranks of local job-seekers was high
on the agenda of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
All of the GCC states, namely, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain,
Qatar, Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), have registered
modest economic growth but big population increases in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
Total GCC population, including foreign residents, will rise
to 39.4 million by the year 2010 from some 26 million at present.
</P>
<P>
Expatriate manpower accounts for 90 percent of the
workforce in the UAE, 83 percent in Qatar, 82 percent in
Kuwait, 69 percent in Saudi Arabia and some 60 percent
in Bahrain and Oman.
</P>
<P>
The GCC countries have been discussing and making policies
to settle their growing labor force, hoping "the process of
nationalization of the workforce in the region must be given
added impetus without losing economic efficiency."

<P>
HONG KONG, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A relaxed Chinese swimming
team won nine out of the 17 gold medals on offer on the opening
day of the two-day first leg of the World Cup short-course
swimming series here today.
</P>
<P>
They also collected five silver and three bronze medals to
bring to a top-ranked total of 17 medals.
</P>
<P>
World champions and world record holders Le Jingyi and Liu
Limin had been expected by local media of a big show. They won a
title each, in their speciality events of women's 200 meters
freestyle and 100m butterfly.
</P>
<P>
It was their less known teammate Jia Yuanyuan who burst into
limelight tonight, with triumphant races for the women's 50 and
200 meters backstroke.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yiwu, China's first world champion in men's swimming,
outswam others in the 200 meters breaststroke.

The four-member Japanese team fielded all its arsenal today and
took six medals, three of them gold.

<P>
"I've not yet fully recovered from a flu I'd got last October.
I almost had not taken any medicine, to guard against mistaking
any banned substances," said Liu Limin.
</P>
<P>
"As for the Olympic Games, my nearest goal is to win over
opponents from inside my country, many of them, at the national
trials set for April," she said.
</P>
<P>
"If qualified for the Atlanta Games, I'd take both butterfly
events," she added.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong leg finishes tomorrow, with another 17 events
set. The series moves northward to Beijing for the second leg
slated for January 10-11. All the other stops of the eight-leg

scientific technology, painting, calligraphy, hairdressing to
enrich old people's daily lives, as well as ethics, psychology and
health care courses to keep them in a good mood.

The local government pay much attention to developing the
training for retired people, and put an investment in facilities
construction in the training schools.

while another 56,161 are studying in schools.
</P>

over 100 paintings and articles on the local journals and
magazines.
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, Dai Zhaoyuan, another member in the school, has
made an effort to learn drawing the traditional Chinese painting,
and some of his paintings have been on display in the Museum of
Chinese History and the Chinese Art Gallery. Li now is teaching
technique of the traditional Chinese painting at a college.

<HEADLINE> Five Iranians Sentenced to Death for Spying for U.S., Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Court has
sentenced five Iranians to death on charges of spying for the
U.S. and Iraq, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Persian daily Kayhan reported that the sentences were to be
carried out in forthcoming days. However, it gave no detail on
when they were arrested.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the sentences have been the severest
for those accused of espionage in the country in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Three of the five men sentenced to death for spying for the
U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) are identified as Kazem
Afkhami Moqaddam Tabrizi, Jalil Showqi Khatibi and Mohammad Mehdi
 Abbas-Zadeh Darban.
</P>
<P>
According to the daily, the three were charged with having
direct contact with, and recruiting for, the CIA. Their cases
have been under investigation since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The supreme court also ruled that before their execution the
three have to return the money, which they had received directly
from the CIA, to the Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
Moqaddam Tabrizi is to return 11,360 dollars, Showqi Khatibi
11,000 dollars and Abbas-Zadeh Darban 7,000 dollars plus 1,000
German marks.
</P>
<P>
The remaining two are charged with working for the Iraqi
government. They are identified as Sohrab Hosseini and Ali
Madad-Karami.
</P>
<P>
Both are charged with taking part in "armed attacks against
the military and economic facilities in Iran and plundering of
the public treasury."
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the announcement of the court
ruling can be interpreted as a signal that the Iranian
regime is taking tough measures to suppress any dangerous
elements inside the country in a bid to thwart any spying
activities backed by Washington.
</P>
<P>
Friday, Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, a hard-line clergy and member
of the powerful Guardians Council, even called for a purge of
Westernized professors and administrators who criticize religious
ideals in their lectures at universities.
</P>
<P>
"There are people in charge at some universities who talk to
American dailies and who speak negatively about the Imam
Khomeini," he said.
</P>
<P>
Externally, the Iranian government has received an assurance
from its neighbor Turkey to keep away any militant threat from
opposition groups to the Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
Ahmet Mdhat Balkan, Turkish Ambassador to Tehran, said that
Turkey's policy towards the Islamic Republic of Iran is strategic
and unchangeable.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here said that the Iranian government is getting
worried about the U.S. support to these anti-government groups in
Turkey as the White House has approved a 20 million-dollar
covert-operation to destabilize the Iranian regime.
</P>
<P>
There are about one million Iranian nationals residing in
Turkey at present. Some of them are carrying out anti-government
activities.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the approval of the 20 million dollars
covert-action by the Clinton administration, the Iranian
government dispatched its envoy to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Alaeddin Boroujerdi, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for Asia-
Pacific Affairs, paid a two-day visit to Ankara with a
special message from Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani to
his Turkish counterpart Suleyman Demirel.
</P>
<P>
On December 23, Demirel told the Iranian deputy foreign
minister that other countries should know that Tehran and Ankara
enjoy very good relations within the framework of mutual
interests and that Turkey would not permit any agent to weaken
such ties.
</P>
<P>
He assured the Iranian official that anti-Iranian elements
would not be allowed to pursue their activities on Turkish soil
and this decision would continue as a permanent policy.

Seasoning Juice
</P>
<P>
A new kind of seasoning juice made from the leftover of fan
shells has been developed by the Shandong Academy of Sciences in
eastern China. The juice is reported to be effective to dispel
fatigue and keep one fit.
</P>
<P>
Fan shell raising has become an important way for getting rich
in the coastal part of the province. But fan shell meat is what
people want most while the other parts of the shells are usually
thrown away and cause serious environmental pollution.

In the course of combating illegal production and selling of
pirated audio and video products and other illegal electronic

local officials to be highly responsible for an environment free

<HEADLINE> Livestock Farming a Major Industry in Anhui </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Livestock farming has grown into a
major industry in east China's Anhui Province in the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics by the provincial agricultural department show that
the province produced 1.9 million tons of meat in 1995, up 60
percent from that of 1990.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the province has in stock seven
million heads of cattles, 15.9 million pigs and 5.8 million sheep,
which makes it a major animal raiser in China.
</P>
<P>
Observers here attribute the prosperity of animal farming to
government support, the expansion of the area of feed crops, the
promotion of improved breeds and new technologies, and the
setting-up of service networks.
</P>
<P>
As a result, animal farming has brought about a remarkable rise
in farmers' cash income. In Fuyang Prefecture, animal farming has
produced a 280-yuan hike in farmer's average income.
</P>
<P>
And in Fuyang, Liu'an, Ludong and other areas where regional
division of labor has taken the shape, animal farming is already a
major part of the local economy.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Chief Negotiator Hails Maryland Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Syria's chief negotiator, Walid
al-Muallem, has described the recent round of Syrian-Israeli peace
talks which ended Friday night in Maryland near Washington as
"good and fruitful."
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with the Syrian Arab News Agency after
the talks, al-Muallem said it is possible for the two sides to
make essential progress over the major issues in the talks despite
some difficulties and differences.
</P>
<P>
He said the recent round of talks dealt with Israel's
withdrawal from the Golan Heights and its return to the June 4,
1967 borders, the normalization of relations between the two
countries, the security arrangements, and the timetable for
implementation.
</P>
<P>
The talks highlighted the role of Syria as the key for
establishing a just and permanent peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The Maryland talks constituted the basis for the talks which
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will conduct during his
coming shuttle visit to Syria and Israel, he said.
</P>
<P>
Christopher will start a visit to the region on January 10.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Christopher's participation in Friday's talks,
al-Muallem said that such a participation was an indicator of the
U.S. keenness on establishing a just, permanent and comprehensive
peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria agreed to try again on January 22 to lay the
groundwork for a settlement ending nearly a half-century of
enmity.

<HEADLINE> Henan Sees Quick Growth in Taiwanese Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Henan Province in Central
China, one of China's leading agricultural bases, launched 142
Taiwan-funded enterprises with a total investment of 162.53
million US dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Local economists noted that the investment has shown an
increasing trend of concentrating in large and medium-size
projects. Among the 12 Taiwan-funded enterprises approved in
Luoyang city last year, three registered an investment of more
than 10 million dollars each.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the investment in agriculture witnessed a
unprecedented expansion in 1995, with a food processing plant
involving a joint investment of 500 million yuan from the province
and a Taiwan businessman, starting construction last August.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A great amount of bio-diversity is
providing a broad range of subjects for biological species
research in the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Biologists with the Tibet Ecological Research Institute have
been working hard to study the region's ecological conditions and
make use of highland biological resources, wild plant resources in
particular.
</P>
<P>
Xu Fengxiang, a professor at Nanjing Forestry University in
Jiangsu Province, founded the institute in 1985. Over the past ten
years, she had set foot in 18 major forestry zones in Tibet, and
covered 120,000 km doing field research.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Xu attended an international conference on protecting
the earth. She talked with participants about the mountainous
vegetation of Tibet, provoking widespread interest.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, biologists with the institute and other
research organizations in the region have undertaken 32 regional
key research projects and one national key project. Seventeen
topics and 250 academic papers have won regional awards for
scientific and technological discoveries.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, scientists have been thinking about tapping
the region's rich biological resources for practical uses. A
number of nutrients have been developed and proved popular with
consumers.
</P>
<P>
"Tibet is a treasure house of traditional Chinese medicine,"
botanist Ni Zhicheng says. So far, more than 300 kinds of
medicines made from animals, plants, and minerals are in use, many
of which have proven to be effective in keeping fit physically or
in treating difficult diseases such as cancer.

<HEADLINE> China's Five-Year Plan a Boost to HK Economy, Expert Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese economy, which is
targeted for sustained and fast growth in the Ninth Five-Year Plan
period (1996-2000), will continue to be a main engine for Hong
Kong's development, says an economic researcher here.
</P>
<P>
However, the shift of focus in investment policies mapped out
by the Chinese government for the coming five years will pose a
challenge for Hong Kong investors, who want to tap the potentially
huge market in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Wang Changyao, general manager of the Economic Research
Department of the Hong Kong-Macao Regional Office under the Bank
of China, previewed the impact of China's Ninth Five-Year Plan on
Hong Kong investors in a recent speech.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an annual seminar organized by the Chinese General
Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, which is usually held at the
beginning of the year, Wang said that the new Five-Year Plan will
provide more opportunities for Hong Kong businessmen. He cited two
bright spots as trade and tourism.
</P>
<P>
As China's main entrepot, Hong Kong will play an increasingly
important role for the expansion of the China's foreign trade. In
1994, the territory's re-exports to and from China increased to
868.7 billion HK dollars (111.4 billion US dollars), making up a
whopping 90 percent of the total re-exports in Hong Kong. Wang
estimated that entrepot trade with China brought in gross profits
of 150 billion HK dollars (19.2 billion US dollars) for Hong Kong
that year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, China's imports and exports are
expected to reach between 1,700 and 2,000 billion US dollars,
indicating more business for Hong Kong, said Wang. Moreover, he
added, an opening market in China will import more Hong Kong-made
products.
</P>
<P>
China is Hong Kong's largest source of tourists, from where
come 20 percent of the total visitors to the territory. The
arrivals will be on the rise as personal incomes steadily go up in
China.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Wang cautioned that Hong Kong businessmen
have to face quite a few challenges as China adjusts its
investment focus in the Ninth Five-Year Plan.
</P>
<P>
Starting from 1996, China plans to inject more funds into
long-term infrastructure projects, including agriculture, water
conservancy, energy, transport and telecommunications, where Hong
Kong investors do not have advantage. Their advantages in
properties will not be given a full display as projects alike will
be restricted.
</P>
<P>
The situation is more or less the same in manufacturing
fields. Over the past few years, Hong Kong businessmen moved their
labor-intensive workshops to China to gain profits from cheap
labor and rent. Now the Chinese government will support
capital-intensive and technologically advanced industries, such as
machinery, electronics, petrol-chemicals, automobile and building
materials. Wang said that some investors in the territory may
encounter difficulties with technological upgrading.
</P>
<P>
But he advised they seize the moment as China is determined to
speed up the development and opening-up in the central and western
regions, where there are abundant natural resources. Hong Kong
investors can also play a role in the restructuring of State-owned
enterprises, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> China to Open Its Pharmaceutical Market Still Wider </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Foreign-funded firms in China's
pharmaceutical industry had increased to 1,500 by the end of last
year, said Zheng Xiaoyu, director of the State Pharmaceutical
Administration.
</P>
<P>
He said that the country's pharmaceutical market has opened
wider to the foreign investors, with a contractual overseas
investment of 1.5 billion US Dollars, and one billion US Dollars
was actually put to use during the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Three-fourths of the top 20 world-famous pharmaceutical plants
have invested in China, and the sales volume of the products of
foreign-funded plants had amounted to 13 percent of the country's
total sales volume, according to the director.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has further lowered the import tarrifs
of pharmaceuticals and canceled some import formalities, such as
in the field of import licence. It is now taking administrative
actions to protect the patented foreign medicines.
</P>
<P>
At present, the country has formulated or revised 277 national
and professional standards for pharmaceutical products. So far,
some 50 percent of these pharmaceuticals have reached the
standards of the pharmacopoeia of the developed countries, such as
the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Fortyfive chemical material pharmaceutical plants have
passed the American FDA inspection and assessments.
</P>
<P>
China has begun to work on "the Policy of the Utilization of
Foreign Funds in Pharmaceutical Industry", so as to shift the
focus of the opening-up policy to optimizing the trade's structure
and improving efficiency.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, total output values of the pharmaceutical industry was
expected to top 100 billion yuan, and total sales volume to reach
75 billion yuan, with income from its exports amounting to three
billion US dollars, 2.6 times the figure for 1990.
</P>
<P>
The country was expected to produce 9,000 tons of penicillin
last year, or over 30 percent of the world's output, more than any
other country.
</P>
<P>
China has decided to become the world's leading producer of
pharmaceuticals and medical apparatuses and instruments in the
first half of the next century.

<HEADLINE> Arable Land under Protection in Hunan Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Loss of arable farmland to
non-agricultural purposes has been averted in central China's
Hunan province, thanks to enhanced efforts by the local government.
</P>
<P>
Hunan, known as one of the major bread baskets in the country,
produced a total of 26.5 billion kg of food grains last year and
its rice production ranks the first in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the province has been suffering from a loss of
farmland over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government promulgated special regulations last
April concerning the protection of its 3.2 million ha of arable
land from being diverted, left idle or wasted.
</P>
<P>
To reinforce the efforts, the provincial government has also
retrieved the land requisition power of development zones in
Changsha, Yueyang, Zhuzhou, Xiangtan and Hengyang, in a bid to
stave off rampant occupation of farmland.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local governments at various levels have taken a
series of incentives to encourage farmers to transform wasteland
and barren hill slopes.
</P>
<P>
In Huaihua county, southwest of the province alone, some 360
brick kilns brought some damages to the arable land and local
farmers reclaimed and leveled more than 10 ha of land and sown
them to rice crops during the past five years.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report On Malaysia's CPO, Tin And Rubber Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian markets ended
this week mixed with crude palm oil (CPO) and tin prices sharply
lower and the rubber market closing higher.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian crude palm oil physical market ended sharply
lower in this holiday-shortened week, largely due to technical
selling activities on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Buying interest was strictly limited due to the current
unattractive price levels and the absence of fresh export news.
Pakistan's cancellation of an order to buy 3,000 tons of refined,
bleached and deodorized palm oil even worsened the sentiment.
</P>
<P>
Volume this week was thin. January South was offered 60
Malaysian Ringgit (about 24 US dollars) lower from the previous
Friday's close at 1,300 Ringgit (about 520 dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
The Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) closed the first week of
1996 sharply easier. The price on the KLTM dropped by 50 sen to
15.73 Ringgit (about 6.29 dollars) per kg from 16.23 Ringgit
(about 6.49 dollars) per kg the previous week.
</P>
<P>
Volume narrowed to 233 tons from 676 tons with interest mainly
from local buyers.
</P>
<P>
This week also saw an absence of the regular European and
Japanese buyers on Friday as they felt that the KLTM was expensive
in view of its higher premium against the London Metal Exchange
(LME).
</P>
<P>
The premium between the KLTM and the LME on Friday widened to
70 dollars per ton from 50 dollars previously.
</P>
<P>
However, the rubber market closed sharply higher this week as
it was aided by a surge in regional and Japanese markets, and
Chinese and European markets as well.
</P>
<P>
The price for February International RSS1 jumped 18 sen to 414
sen (about 1.65 dollars) per kg while the SMR20 surged 7.5 sen to
419 sen (about 1.67 dollars) per kg.
</P>
<P>
The market was firm partly due to the traders' concern over
tight supplies in key growing areas in Malaysia and Southern
Thailand. Most sellers were bullish over near-term prices and were
quoting higher prices due to expectations of limited supply in
February.

KUALA LUMPUR, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian foreign minister
Abdullah Badawi told the press here today that Malaysia would send
a senior diplomat as an observer to the Palestinian poll on
January 20.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah Badawi said he had named Abdul Majid Mohamad, former

representative to the poll, the first of its kind for Palestinians
who now administer their own affairs under self-rule deals signed

</P>
<P>
The Malaysian foreign minister said Malaysia was invited to
send an observer to the poll because of the country's strong
support for the Palestinians in the past.
</P>
<P>
"To us, the coming election is important because it will steer
the country to self-rule through the formation of a democratic
government elected by the Palestinians themselves," he said.
</P>

He believed that the coming election would provide strong
support to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's leadership.

<P>
XI'AN, January 6 (Xinhua) -- China will increase its
appropriations on agro-science researches this year in an effort
to further develop the sector in the 1996-2000 period, said a
central government official.
</P>
<P>
Li Xiaolin, deputy director of the State Science and Technology
Commission's Agricultural Science and Technology Department, made

research findings on the comprehensive control of soil erosion and
agriculture development in the northwestern Loess highlands.
</P>
<P>
While continuing to implement the agro-science projects which
were launched in the 1991-1995 period, greater emphasis will be
placed on three major projects in the sector during the 1996-2000
period, Li said.
</P>
<P>
These projects cover the research findings on how to increase
rice, corn, wheat and soybean yields, and how to introduce fine
strains of cereals, cotton, vegetable and oil- and sugar-bearing
corps and the large-scale pig, chicken and cattle raising.
</P>
<P>
Per-capita research funds for Chinese agro-science technicians,
is expected to rise from some 2,000 yuan in the 1991-1995 period to
5,000-10,000 yuan in the 1996-2000 period, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The State Science and Technology Commission plans to earmark
additional 30-40 million yuan to the agro-science research fund,
he said.
</P>
<P>
These funds will be allotted to institutes through bidding, Li
said, explaining that this allocation is aimed to ensure that the
funds can go to those research units with bigger and better
capacities.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Inflation in 1995 short of target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' annual inflation
rate of 8.1 percent for 1995 has fallen short of its target of 7.5
percent, but some officials and experts said it was still stable.
</P>
<P>
Philippine National Economic and Development Authority Director
General Cielito Habito said in a telephone interview that since
the month-on-month rate did not move much, this showed that
inflation was relatively stable.
</P>
<P>
The country's inflation for December stood at 10.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any reason to readjust our inflation target this
year since we foresee a further decline in consumer prices," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that rice prices are already on a downtrend,
contributing largely to the slowdown of inflation in December
1995.
</P>
<P>
Philippine central bank Governor Singson said in his yearend
report that the December inflation rate reflected the continued
stability in consumer prices.
</P>
<P>
Singson also pointed out that the double-digit inflation was
primarily seasonal and could be traced to higher prices of fruits,
vegetables and meat resulting from the Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
The price movements remained under control, he said, noting
that monetary aggregates have been kept well below the ceilings of
the government's economic program supported by the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
The 10.9 percent inflation rate in December represented a
slight slowdown from the 11 percent in November, experts noted.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the year-on-year rate of 8.1 percent was lower
than the nine percent posted in 1994.

owns the mines, will form a partnership with the amc.
</P>
<P>
The source disclosed that the amc, which will control 51
percent of the venture, is expected to go into operation in July
this year.
</P>
<P>
The amc's money will go toward the development of
infrastructure, buying and installation of a generator as well as
machinery, said the source.
</P>
<P>
It is said that a three year study carried out by American
geologist Nelson Schaffer determined that the gold deposits at
Kyakiddu could be mined for at least 8 years.
</P>
<P>
The study also showed that each ton of soil in the area can
yield 500 grams of gold.
</P>
<P>
Kyakiddu mines occupy an area of nearly 10 kilometers.

<HEADLINE> Henan Attach Importance to Environment Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan Province
plans to shut down all its paper mills whose annual output is less
than 5,000 tons before the end of June this year, a senior
provincial official said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Provincial Governor Zhang Honghua described the move as
complying with the State Council's plan which schedules to clear
Huaihe River by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The plan has been cited as one of the major projects in the
province during the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
Henan Province, which is located on the upper reaches of the
Huaihe River, discharged approximately one billion tons of sewages
and waste water into the river in 1993. Only less than one percent
of such discharge from the township-run enterprises has reached
the standards set by the state.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government treated 73 polluters in 1995,
reducing the amount of the chemical oxygen discharged by some
50,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhang noted that small paper mills still constitute a
major source of pollution.
</P>
<P>
Henan, China's largest paper producer, has registered 1,600
paper plants, which produce some one seventh of the total national
paper output. Yet, some 1,000 of these mills that turn out 30
percent of Henan's total paper output, only produce less than
5,000 tons of paper a year.
</P>
<P>
Zhang noted that his provincial government is resolute to shut
down all the small paper mills. "Those local officials who failed
to shut them down under their administration will be held
responsible," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also asked local governments to pay attention to the
problems arising therefrom and ensure local people's livelihood.
</P>
<P>
Zhumadian Prefecture, which is comparatively less developed,
registers more than 80 small paper mills. A leading official of
the prefecture said his administration will implement the
provincial government's relevant order and do their utmost to cope
with pollution problem.

<HEADLINE> Thai Army Commander Supports Suppression of Khun Sa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Thai Army Commander-in-Chief
Gen. Pramon Parasin has voiced Thailand's support for the Myanmar
government's crackdown on drug kingpin Khun Sa.
</P>
<P>
"We support the Myanmar government's suppression of Khun Sa,
who is a big drug criminal," Pramon told reporters Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We regard the surrender of Khun Sa and his Mong Tai Army as an
internal affair (of Myanmar)," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Khun Sa would not be allowed to enter or be given haven in
Thailand because he is considered an international criminal," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The Thai military has been ordered not to offer him any direct
or indirect aid. Those found of helping him will face harsh
punishment," Pramon said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Khun Sa, whose whereabouts have been
leaving media guessing during the last few days, is still in his
Ho Mong headquarters in east Myanmar, about 30 kilometers from the
Thai border.
</P>
<P>
Pramon said the suppression has already affected Thailand, with
about 300 Myanmar people, mostly women and children, having fled
across the border into the Mae Ai district, north Thailand.
</P>
<P>
A Thai news agency report said that 10 F-16 jet fighters had
already arrived at the Chiang Mai airport, north Thailand, and
more Thai troops had been moved to the border near the Doi Lang
mountain, which, claimed by both Myanmar and Thailand, was taken
over by Myanmar troops from Khun Sa's Mong Tai army earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, three schools in the Mae Ai district on the border
were ordered closed Friday for fear that possible fighting between
the Mong Tai army and Myanmar government troops could spill over
into the area.
</P>
<P>
An intelligence official at the Thai supreme command said Thai
and Myanmar officials were holding a meeting to try to resolve the
issue of the disputed territory of 31 square kilometers at Doi
Lang.

ADDIS ABABA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian government
has planned to launch 400 million US dollars' construction
projects in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Minister of Works and Urban Development
Haile Asegide at a meeting organized by the Ethiopian Contractors
Association here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the projects will cover transport, energy
and social sectors, but did not give further details of these
projects.
</P>
<P>
He said the huge projects are not entirely dependent on local
contractors because their capacity is far less than the actual
need.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are being exerted to enlarge the existing workforce
and improve it, he said, adding that foreign contractors will
also be invited.

KUALA LUMPUR, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Share prices on the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange ended its first week of the new year amid

<HEADLINE> Preferential Policy Attracting More Chinese Scholars from Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has developed
preferential policies to encourage overseas Chinese students to
return to set up companies.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's economy has seen rapid growth during the period of
the reforms and opening-up, and since 1992, more than 250 students
have returned home to set up companies after completing advanced
studies abroad.
</P>
<P>
Feng Kunfan, who got a doctor's degree in Japan, came back to
Shanghai in 1995. She set up a company here last June to introduce
technology from Japan for plant research, and has had good
economic results.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the Shanghai Service Center for
Returning Chinese Students, the number of overseas Chinese
students who settled in Shanghai was 3.6 times in 1994 what it was
in 1992, and 49 percent greater in the first six months of 1995
than during the same period in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Some of these students now are in charge of major scientific
research projects, while others have set up companies to attract
foreign investment or to promote international exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has held many activities in cities worldwide,
including London, Paris, and Bonn, to attract overseas Chinese
students. Some 419 out of the 712 students who attended the
meetings in these places have expressed a desire to return home to
work.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 175 who have decided to settle in Shanghai, those
with doctor's degrees account for 46.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Back-to-Work Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
signed a bill early today immediately restoring the jobs and wages
of hundreds of thousands of federal workers furloughed in the
21-day partial government shutdown.
</P>
<P>
The bill was passed by Congress on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich
said the president might over the weekend unveil a seven-year
balanced budget of his own using Congressional Budget Office
calculations. That would meet a long-time Republican demand.
</P>
<P>
"I think they're serious," Dole told reporters after he and
Gingrich returned from an evening negotiating session with the
president at the White House.
</P>
<P>
The Senate sent Clinton legislation that would return
280,000civil servants to their jobs and reimburse them for lost
salaries, plus pay 480,000 others who have had to work without
wages since the government shutdown beginning December 16. They
would be paid through January 26. Earlier in the day House
Republicans joined Democrats in approving the bill.
</P>
<P>
The measure would provide funds for about a dozen federal
agencies that were running out of money.
</P>
<P>
Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle supported the measure
although he said "we're still leaving unfunded many major
programs..."
</P>
<P>
The House and Senate approved a second bill that would reopen
all of the programs run by the scores of departments and agencies
affected by the shutdown, if Clinton submits a balanced budget as
scored by the Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Congress approved a third measure financing about
20 other programs for the rest of the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The budget talks between the two sides still face big
differences over tax cuts and savings from Medicare, Medicaid and
other social programs.
</P>
<P>
White House press secretary Mike McCurry described Friday
evening's meeting at the White House as "very productive."
</P>
<P>
The negotiators are expected to work through the weekend with
additional meetings set for Saturday, Sunday and Monday.

WARSAW, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The National Bank of Poland
announced today it was cutting down two key interest rates on
loans in an effort to curb inflation and promote sustained
economic growths.
</P>
<P>
The bank cut the rediscount rate on promissory note loans from
26.67 percent to 24.4 percent, and the Lombard rate from 28
percent to 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the depreciation rate of the Polish currency, the
zloty, fell from 1.2 percent to 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bank President Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz told reporters that the
latest cuts were the result of a significant fall in inflation
rate last year, which she estimated had dropped to 22.5 percent
from 32 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Grzegorz Kolodko had predicted last December
that the inflation rate would be stabilized at 22.2 percent by the
end of last year.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Opposition Tables Non-Confidence Motion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian Opposition today asked
the parliament to take a vote of non-confidence in the government,
which was accused of failing to guarantee the domestic supply of
grain and flour.
</P>
<P>
The non-confidence motion was mounted by Chairman of the Union
of Democratic Forces of Bulgaria (UDFB) Ivan Kostov and Chairman
of the parliamentary Group of the UDFB Iodan Sokolov. And 76
parliament members from the UDFB, the People's Union and the
Movement for Rights and Freedoms signed on the motion.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the National Assembly Blagovest Sendov said that
the parliament would debate on the non-confidence motion, the
second since September 1995.
</P>
<P>
The opposition held the socialist government headed by Prime
Minister Zhan Videnov responsible for the serious shortage of
grain in the country due to its "irresponsible" policies.
</P>
<P>
Since the Bulgarian government lifted quotas on grain export in
June 1995, the home market has suffered from acute shortages of
grain and flour and the prices for bread have been rising.
</P>
<P>
Recently, some Socialists have demanded the resignation of the
Agriculture and Food Industry Minister Vasil Chichibaba.
</P>
<P>
Some Bulgarian experts said the country's agriculture could
have fed a population of three to four Bulgarias.
</P>
<P>
However, Bulgaria's grain yield has been dropping year by year
since 1990s. Last year, its grain yield was slightly above six
million tons, the lowest since 1985.
</P>
<P>
Since the government liberalized exports of grain last year,
the total amount of exported grain has far exceeded the
anticipated level, reports said.

BUDAPEST, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The first toll-charging
expressway of Hungary that costs 37 billion forint (about 264.29
million U.S dollars) was formally opened to traffic today, the
local press reported.
</P>
<P>
The completion of the 42-kilometer-long Highway M1, which
connects the city of Gyor and the city of Hgyeshalom near the
border of Austria, upgrades the entire road traffic from Hungary's
capital Budapest to Austria's capital Vienna into an expressway
service.
</P>
<P>
But the new road, jointly funded by Hungarian and foreign
investors, will be the most expensive highway in Europe, as every
car is required to pay a toll of 900 forint (about 6.43
U.S. dollars) for each passage.
</P>
<P>
A management company of the road said it takes 15 years to
recover all the investment despite an estimated annual revenue of
4.5 billion to 5 billion forint (321.14 to 357.14 million U.S.
dollars) from the income of tolls.

<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian Attorney-General
Jose Antonio Sossa announced that he will go to Mexico next week
to request the extradition of bank officials charged with
corruption and embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
Sossa said the Office of the Presidency has authorized his trip
to Mexico, where Rafael Arosemena, former chief executive officer
of the National Bank of Panama (BNP) has been living since 1990
when the Manuel Antonio Noriega regime was toppled by U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
Arosemena was charged in Panama with the crimes of corrupting
public officials, conspiring to commit a crime, and embezzlement
of 21 million U.S. dollars of the bank when he was the chief of
the BNP.
</P>
<P>
An arrest warrant against Arosemena has been issued by the
Panamanian Attorney-General Office, which has also ordered the
arrest of six other former BNP officials.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Economics, Population Top Development Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The environment, population and
development constitute three important themes on China's agenda of
sustainable human development (SHD).
</P>
<P>
SHD has been proposed by the United Nations Development Program
as its new working agenda, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent report from the State Environmental
Protection Agency, due to the deterioration of ecological
conditions in China, especially desertification, the area of
arable land has been shrinking and now accounts for only 10
percent of the nation's entire land area.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, only 20 percent of industrial waste and five percent
of domestic refuse are currently being treated. Others are piled
around cities.
</P>
<P>
Population is the second theme of the agenda, as well as the
largest challenge to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
China has 180 million illiterate people. The illiteracy rate is
not much higher than the world average but leaves China behind
many developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Without the development reform introduced over the last 20
years. China would be in a dire situation.
</P>
<P>
As sociologist Lei Jieqiong noted, whether China's huge
population is a burden or resource depends on people's character
and level of education.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the income gap between the poor and the rich has
been increasingly widening in the world. And the Chinese
government has noticed this trend and is poised to come to the
poor's aid.
</P>
<P>
If China's opening-up and reform go smoothly, eradicating
poverty could be reached by the end of this century.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua Denies Kidnapers' Entry into Territory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Nicaraguan Army dismissed
today the report that an armed gang of kidnapers, who abducted two
European women in Costa Rica on Monday, had entered Nicaraguan
territory.
</P>
<P>
No tracks or evidence of the presence of the abductors were
found after the Nicaraguan National Army made a careful search of
a wide strip of land in the border area, said Army spokesman
Captain Milton Sandoval.
</P>
<P>
Sandoval noted that the kidnapers, by suggesting that they
would enter Nicaraguan territory, could have left false clues to
throw off manhunt of the Costa Rican authorities.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua's government delegate in the bordering department of
Rio San Juan also said there is concrete information that the
kidnapers are still in Costa Rican territory between the San
Carlos and the Sarapiqui rivers.
</P>
<P>
German tourist Nicole Fleutchaus and Swiss guide Regia Sigfried
were kidnaped by a self-named armed group of "Viviana Gallardo
Commando" from a hotel in Northern Costa Rica, some 20 kilometers
south of the Costa Rican-Nicaraguan border.
</P>
<P>
The armed men were demanding a ransom of one million dollars
and one million colons, the release from jail of members of the so
called "Commando de la Muerte," labor stability, and an 18 percent
increase of the salaries of Costa Rican workers.

<P>
BRUSSELS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Commission of the European
Union has called for measures to reduce the amount of carbon
dioxide produced by motor vehicles in EU member states to protect
environment and promote economic development.
</P>
<P>
The amount of carbon dioxide discharged by public transport
facilities in the European Union (EU) will by 2000 be 20 percent
higher than in 1990 if EU does not take effective measures to curb
this trend, said a report of the commission.

The carbon dioxide produced by private cars in EU member
nations now accounts for 12 percent of EU's total, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
The commission called on all EU member nations, automobile
departments and individuals to make "positive efforts" to
implement the strategy of cutting the level of carbon dioxide
emission.
</P>
<P>
It urged EU automobile departments and auto importers to reach
an agreement on encouraging the production of energy-saving cars
and cars that discharge less carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
The commission has set up a working group for promoting the
design, manufacture and marketing of energy-saving cars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it asked EU member states to use more public
transport facilities and non-engine-driven vehicles so as to
reduce the amount of carbon dioxide and fuel consumption.

<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Polish President Aleksander
Kwasniewski today appointed Stanislaw Dobrzanski from the Polish
Peasant Party as new defense minister.
</P>
<P>
Dobrzanski, 47, replaced Zbigniew Okonski who quit after former
President Lech Walesa failed in last November's election.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski said he selected Dobrzanski, a history bachelor
from the University of Lublin, upon suggestion by Prime Minister
Jozef Oleksy.
</P>
<P>
Dobrzanski told reporters following his appointment that a key
issue for Poland is to join NATO and that he would work to improve
the army's equipment and make Poland's defense law adaptable to
western standards.
</P>
<P>
He also said he would consider reducing the size of the
military forces.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that one of the major tasks for the defense
ministry is to support the development of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
"A powerful defense depends on the prosperity of the national
economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dobrzanski has previously worked as the deputy director of the
National Library, a department head in the Ministry of Culture and
the director of a branch office of a small bank.
</P>
<P>
Since November 1993, Dobrzanski had been secretary of the
Defense Committee in the government of former Prime Minister
Waldemar Pawlak.

Last Friday, Kwasniewski appointed economist Dariusz Rosati as
foreign minister and Jerzy Konieczny, a former security chief, as

BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Trade volume between China and
Myanmar in 1995 was expected to see big growth as bilateral
commerce in the first 10 months surpassed the full-year figure in
1994, according to "China Daily" today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese customs statistics suggest that during January-October
1995, Sino-Myanmar trade reached 569 million US dollars, 57
million US dollars more than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
China and Myanmar share more than 2,000 kilometers of border,
which has made border trade between southwestern China's Yunnan
Province and Myanmar a dominant force in bilateral commerce.
</P>
<P>
Wu Zhengping, a deputy division chief at the Asian affairs
Department of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (Moftec) said that China's bulk exports to Myanmar
include technology and equipment for energy, transportation,
telecommunication and building materials.
</P>
<P>
The official said that companies in the two countries are
negotiating the possibility of co-operation on several other
large-scale projects including a cement plant, a hydroelectric
power station and an international airport near Yangon, Myanmar's
capital. No agreements have been reached yet.
</P>

<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- More than 20,000 people and
units involved in producing or selling fake or substandard
medicines were penalized last year while some 221 "underground"
pharmaceutical plants were dismantled across China.
</P>
<P>
Today's "China Daily" quoted officials for the State
Pharmaceutical Administration (SPA) as saying that Chinese
government is set to take tougher action in regulating the
pharmaceutical market this year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, some 70 local pharmaceutical markets were closed
with another 30 suspended for restructuring, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Also last year, pharmaceutical administrative departments at
all levels, with the help of local police, uncovered 445 cases of
producing and selling fake and substandard medicines. Some 84
suspects involved in the cases were detained by police.
</P>
<P>
The SPA action were taken in response to the State Council's
instruction, issued in late 1994, on tightening up supervision
over pharmaceutical products.
</P>
<P>
Yet the situation is still severe and more must be done to
protect public health, said the SPA report.

<HEADLINE> Food Hygiene Tops Agenda of Ministry's Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Residents in all parts of China
can soon expect to directly report hygiene problems to local
health administrative departments and inquire about food knowledge
from health experts, the "China Daily" reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The English-language newspaper quoted sources from the Ministry
of Health as saying that the ministry has asked all local health
departments to make public the address and telephone number of
food hygiene inspection offices in each locality to listen to
public complaints and answer questions.
</P>
<P>
The action is aimed at encouraging people to take up the role
of social supervisor over food hygiene and to spread related
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
It is also meant to further improve food quality throughout the
country and better protect the health of the public.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the ministry suggest that the country has seen
great progress in the food industry in the past decades.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1993, there were over 55,000 enterprises
manufacturing food products, with staff of more than 4.2
million. There are also more than 230,000 township and village
food processing units with employees of 2.79 million.
</P>
<P>
Last year, around 82 percent of food products marketed in the
country reached the national standard for food hygiene, a rise of
21 percentage point compared with 1982.
</P>
<P>
Yet food hygiene remains a big problem that poses a threat to
public health, according to an official from the ministry.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Russian Defense Minister
Pavel Grachev said here today that Russia opposed NATO's eastward
expansion but expected it to expand to the west.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference jointly held by U.S. Defense Minister
William Perry and Ukrainian Defense Minister Valery Shmarov,
Grachev said that NATO could not seek the role of leadership in
securing peace in Europe or even in the world although it could
solve some problems in parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that a new mechanism be established under which
NATO states could join Russia and Ukraine in tackling safety
issues.
</P>
<P>
Grachev said Russia has never been isolated and would always
have allies.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "Moscow is protecting the safety of its
friends and itself."
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Shmarov said that Ukraine would
not change its stance over NATO's eastward expansion and stand for
Ukraine's entry into the alliance on a gradual basis.
</P>
<P>
He said relations between Ukraine and Russia would be important
to the security on the European continent.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Perry said the United States hoped that Russia
and Ukraine would continue their cooperation on the basis of
friendship and partnership, no matter whether NATO takes in new
members or not.
</P>
<P>
He said that NATO's main task was to stabilize the situation in
Bosnia under the Dayton peace accord and that it would cooperate
with both Russia and Ukraine in this field.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Destruct Missile Launching Silo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine today successfully
destructed an underground missile launching silo in Pervomaisk,
south of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian Defense Minister Valery Shmarov, visiting
U.S. Defense Minister William Perry and Russian Defense Minister
Pavel Grachev watched the demolition process.
</P>
<P>
Shmarov described the destruction of the silo as an important
political event.
</P>
<P>
The work of dismantling underground rocket launching silos came
in compliance with the first stage of the Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty (Start-1) approved by the Ukraine Parliament in 1993 and a
declaration signed in January 1994 by Ukrainian, U.S. and Russian
Presidents.
</P>
<P>
The silo destructed today had been used to launch SS-19
intercontinental ballistic missiles. Ukraine has a total of 130
SS-19 missiles, each capable of carrying six nuclear warheads. 90
percent of them are deployed in Pervomaisk and 40 in Khmelinitsky.
</P>
<P>
Under the international accords, Ukraine will have to destruct
36 percent of the silos by 1999 and five silos have been planned
for destruction this year.
</P>
<P>
Shmarov said the remaining 64 percent of the silos would be
converted to civilian use.
</P>
<P>
He denied U.S. allegations that Ukraine would destruct all its
130 silos by November 1998.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Ukraine would strictly abide by the Start-1 in
destructing the rocket launching facilities.
</P>
<P>
An Ukrainian officer said that the mass destruction of the
silos and missiles would start after preparations are completed
this year.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with a decision to get rid of its nuclear weapons
including 176 missiles, Ukraine has neutralized more than 90
percent of the missiles and sent dozens of nuclear warheads to
Russia for destruction under a 1994 accord in exchange for about
one billion U.S. dollars in fuel for Ukraine's nuclear power
stations.

<P>
VIENNA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Muslim-Croat federation
and Bosnian Serbs agreed today on the establishment of military
liaison missions, representing a major progress in the
confidence-building talks.
</P>
<P>
Military missions, to be set up in 10 days, would be based in
Sarajevo for 30 days before being moved to Serb headquarters, said
Istvan Gyarmati, a representative of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) mediating the Vienna talks.
</P>
<P>
The two sides had also provided the OSCE with sensitive
military information, such as the number and location of heavy
weapons and sites of arms factories.
</P>
<P>
A separate round of talks on arms control, mediated by
Norwegian Ambassador to OSCE Wigleik Eide, was also opened today
after a day's delay owing to protests of Bosnian government
officials against the name "Republika Rrpska" on a Serb name-plate
at the conference table.
</P>
<P>
They insisted that the name implied the recognition of the
Bosnian Serbs as a separate state, not as part of
Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
Both talks were adjourned until next Wednesday because of the
Orthodox Church's Christmas holiday at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton peace treaty, an agreement on disarmament must
be reached by June 6 this year.

BUENOS AIRES, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Carlos
Menem on Friday praised soccer super star Diego Maradona's
sincerity and bravery in publicly confessing his drugs problem in
a magazine interview earlier this week.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old player has joined in a government campaign
called Sun without Drugs, to make sport clean of drugs.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, he admitted how he had suffered from drug since
1982.
</P>
<P>
Menem said he hoped and believed that Maradona's account of the
dangers of drugs would show youngsters there is nothing worse
"than entering the world which Diego entered."

<HEADLINE> Horse Row for Olympics Solved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The International Equestrian
Federation agreed Friday to an extensive quarantine proposal by
Georgia officials, ensuring top horses can compete at this year's
Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
United States authorities are concerned that piroplasmosis, a
tick-carried blood disease, not be transmitted to U.S. equine
stables.
</P>
<P>
The federation transmitted a facsimile letter to the Georgia
Department of Agriculure offices Friday, the deadline day
officials had set for hearing a response or imposing a ban on
infected horses.
</P>
<P>
"Now that a final decision has been made, we must focus all our
energy on the proper implementation of the safeguards," Georgia
Department of Agriculture commissioner Tommy Irvin said.
</P>
<P>
Irvin's conditions for allowing piroplasmosis-positive horses
into the Olympic city include banning such animals from competing
in the three-day event, a restriction which drew the ire of top
riders at a tuneup event last year.
</P>
<P>
Horses will be kept at a quarantine area near the Atlanta
airport and transported only to the competition and training
venue, the new Georgia International Horse Park.
</P>
<P>
Such animals will be kept isolated at the venue and away from
vegetation, meaning no grazing. Their stay in the United States
and at competition sites would be kept to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
Should any horse violate the quarantine, it could be removed
from any competition at any time.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also forces the expense of the quarantine to be
paid by Olympic officials, tightening an already thin Games
budget.

<HEADLINE> Lumber Exports Earn Chile Over $2 Billion in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Chilean lumber exports from
January to November in 1995 surpassed 2.16 billion dollars, a 52
percent increase over the same period of 1994, reported today by
the National Forestry Corporation (Conaf).
</P>
<P>
The value of all of 1995 shipments was a little over 2.35
billion dollars, an unprecedented figure that reflects the
favorable situation in international prices and the steady
increase in the volumes, said Conaf in its report. November
returns were estimated at 200.5 million dollars. Conaf expects the
sector to reach the 2.35 billion dollar mark.
</P>
<P>
Forestry products sales abroad are one of the four main lines
of exports of this South American country, whose chief market is
Asia, accounting for 42 percent of its total lumber exports.
</P>
<P>
The other foreign markets for Chilean forestry products are
Europe, with 27 percent; Latin America, with 17 percent; the
United States and Canada with 9.4 percent, and the remainder
distributed among other countries in the Middle East, Africa and
Oceania.

GENEVA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The International Equestrian
Federation told U.S. farm officials on Friday that 23 horses
infected with a tick-borne virus were so far listed as possible
entries in the Atlanta Olympics, an FEI official said.
</P>
<P>
The state of Georgia has threatened to ban horses carrying the
virus, piroplasmosis, which is relatively rare in the United
States. Officials are worried the infection could spread to local
horses because the Games are being held in the summer when tick
populations are at their peak.
</P>
<P>
But Georgian farm officials said last month that some infected
horses, which include potential medal winners from Europe, could
compete under a waiver if the FEI accepted a series of stringent
conditions by a Friday deadline.

"neutral" Rybkin, who won his Duma seat in a single-mandate
constituency, will be equally acceptable to powerful communist and
nationalist factions as well as to pro-government and liberal
forces.
</P>
<P>
Factions will rather try to realize their ambitions in a clash
for the chairs of speaker's deputies and heads of key
parliamentary committees, Shakhrai believes.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that at least until mid-April 1996, the Duma will
let the government do its work in tranquillity. But tensions will
grow and the political situation "will become more active" right
after April 15, the deadline for registration of candidates
running for presidency in the scheduled June elections.
</P>
<P>
Shakharai offered to leave his post in cabinet several days
after he won a Duma seat in Decmeber, and President Boris Yeltsin
accepted his resignation earlier today.

<HEADLINE> US Establishes Trade Agreement Enforcement Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Trade Representative
Mickey Kantor today announced the establishment of a special
office for monitoring and enforcing the country's foreign trade
agreements.
</P>
<P>
The latest action followed statements by President Clinton's
nomination of Stuart Eizenstat earlier this week for the
Under-secretary at the Commerce Department and that the department
would beef up enforcement of laws to stop the import of subsidized
goods and goods "dumped" at below cost.
</P>
<P>
Kantor told a press conference held at the Center for National
Policy that the enforcement unit to be set up in his office would
assure that all the accords the United States was a party to were
monitored and enforced.
</P>
<P>
He cited accords with Japan, China, Europe and Canada, adding
"These agreements have contributed to an unprecedented export boom
and helped to create hundreds of thousands of high-paying jobs for
American workers."
</P>
<P>
"As we have said time and again, the most important part of our
job is what happens after we sign an agreement," he said. "So
today, I want to emphasize the importance of enforcement in the
context of the president's overall trade policy."
</P>
<P>
Kantor specifically cited monitoring agreements to protect U.S.
intellectual property rights overseas and to open closed foreign
government procurements.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade chief negotiator said that in the past three
years the administration had signed more than 180 trade
agreements, including the Uruguay Round to lower trade barriers
worldwide, the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and
Canada, and market-opening accords with Europe, Japan and China.
</P>
<P>
These accords were already yielding substantial benefits, but
it was essential that the administration vigorously monitor and
enforce them, Kantor said.
</P>
<P>
Stuart Eizenstat, the nominee for Under Secretary of Commerce,
told reporters on Wednesday that there was an erosion of support
for free trade but it could be bolstered by stopping goods from
being sold illegally in the United States.
</P>
<P>
If confirmed by the Senate for the nomination, Eizenstat will
head the Commerce Department's lead trade unit, guiding trade
policy development, export promotion, investment policy,
commerical relations, business advocacy and import laws and
agreements.
</P>
<P>
Eizenstat, currently U.S. representative to the European Union,
served as chief domestic plocy adviser and director of the White
House Domestic Policy staff during the Carter administration and
as a policy adviser under the Johnson administration.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Press Urges US to Continue Efforts to Boost Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Syrian newspapers today
urged the U.S. to continue its role to push forward the Middle
East peace process, describing the role as "very important and
effective."
</P>
<P>
The newspapers pointed out that participation of U.S. Secretary
of State Warren Christopher in the Maryland talks between Israel
and Syria was aimed at giving impetus to the peace march in the
region before Christopher's coming visit to the Middle East, which
is due around next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Christopher Thursday attended for several hours the second
session of the second round of Syrian-Israeli talks in the Wye
River conference center, Maryland, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Christopher's participation in the talks is a clear indicator
that the U.S. Administration will introduce the peace process to a
more effective phase, the Syrian newspapers noted.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian media praised the U.S. role in restoring the
Syrian-Israeli peace talks, pointing out that Syria has accepted
the peace formula which U.S. President Bill Clinton's
Administration worked out to end the state of tension in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Administration believes that the formula is the true
path leading to a peaceful settlement as it is based on
international legitimacy and relevant U.N. resolutions, the Syrian
media said.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that the U.S. efforts will reach climax during
Christopher's forthcoming tour in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here expect a breakthrough at the end of
the current round of talks today as the U.S. officials who are
concerned with the peace process voiced optimism over the
possibility of reaching a declaration of principles between Syria
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, two days ago, diplomatic sources here didn't expect a
breakthrough at the end of the second round of Maryland talks
because of the wide gap between the attitudes of the two
sides. They pinned their hopes on Christopher's coming shuttle
diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
The Maryland talks are currently proceeding amidst an
atmosphere of optimism despite Syria's insistence that peace
should be just, comprehensive and honorable and that it will
never yield a single inch of its territories to Israel.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Israel did not clearly state its intention
to withdraw from the Syrian territory of Golan Heights and return
to the border lines of June 4, 1967.
</P>
<P>
Syria asks the U.S. to put pressure on Israel to comply with
the international legitimacy.

minister Emanuele Scammacca held talks here today with Greek
Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and alternate foreign minister
George Romeos as part of a fact-finding mission to Cyprus, Greece
and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press after the talks, Scammacca said Cyprus
"is in a difficult position and we wish to help strengthen the
peace processes".
</P>
<P>
Soon after taking up EU presidency which started from the

Scammacca's fact-finding mission began in Nicosia on Thursday

within the framework of the U.N. resolutions and in cooperation
with other countries, to find a solution to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Romeos said that "final proposals" by EU could be formulated

<HEADLINE> Italian Official Makes Fact Finding Mission on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Italian Under-Secretary for
Foreign Affairs, Emanuele Scammacca, said here today that the
interest Europe is showing for the Cyprus problem is aimed at
ending the division of the island.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking on his departure from Cyprus after a short
visit during which he had separate meetings with President Glafcos
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Scammacca will travel to Greece for talks with Greek Foreign
Minister Karolos Papoulias and then complete his fact finding
mission with meetings in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The Italian official said he has gathered all facts he needed
regarding the Cyprus problem and will put them forward to his
country's Foreign Minister Susanna Agnielli.
</P>
<P>
"All the questions we have put have been answered in a very
frank, complete and detailed way," he said, but declined to
elabrate.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he sees there is ground for a European initiative on
the Cyprus problem, Scammacca said he believed "such evaluations
must be left to the 15 foreign ministers of the European Union
(EU), gathering in Brussels at the end of this month".
</P>
<P>
The official added that Agnielli, in her capacity as the
president of the EU Council of Ministers, "will be reporting
precisely on the facts and on the impressions we are gathering
these days."
</P>
<P>
He expressed certainty that the Italian Foreign Minister will
make the EU foreign ministers "even more attentive to the problem
of Cyprus" and that "she will talk in a very warm way," informing
them about the situation prevailing on the island.
</P>
<P>
Scammacca arrived on the island Thursday on a "fact finding
mission." The official said upon his arrival that Italy, taking
over the EU rotating presidency on January 1, 1996, would take the
question of Cyprus as the most important duty during six months of
presidency.
</P>
<P>
The year 1995 witnessed a stalemate in the peace talks between
the two communities on this East Mediterranean island, which was
divided in 1974 when Turkish troops invaded it following a
short-lived Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
The EU's initiative is part of the international community's
peace efforts to bring the two communities' leaders to a direct
negotiation table as a step toward a peaceful solution to the
Cyprus problem.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Scrap Government-Issued Savings Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 5 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's
government-issued savings bonds would be phased out during 1996,
Finance Minister Chris Liebenberg announced here today.
</P>
<P>
In the recently released government gazette, Liebenberg said
while the issuing of bonds made a contribution toward
government's total borrowing requirement, the administration of
the bonds was too expensive.
</P>
<P>
"It has now become uneconomical for the state to continue
financing by means of this instrument," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the government had been trying to limit its
interest burden and had been unable to offer "competitive
interest rates" on the bonds.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, bonds have roused little interest in recent
years, as individual investors have been able to earn higher
rates of interest through commercial savings institutions," he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, Liebenberg stressed that the phasing out of the bonds
would involve the suspending of indefinite period national
defense bonds and indefinite period exchequer bonds from February
1, the redemption of bonds and cancelling of interest payments.
</P>
<P>
The redemption of indefinite period national defense and
senior citizen savings bonds would come into effect on July 15,
while indefinite period exchequer bonds would be scrapped on
August 31, added the minister.

<HEADLINE> Top Hamas Activist Killed in Gaza Strip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Hamas activist Yehia Ayyash,
known as "the Engineer," was killed today on the outskirts of the
Jabalya refugee camp north of Gaza city in an alleged bomb
explosion, Israeli media reports said.
</P>
<P>
However, local residents did not report hearing such an
explosion.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has confirmed the death of Ayyash. The Islamic
fundamentalist organization charged that the Israeli General
Security Services (GSS) were behind the incident, and threatened
to seek revenge attacks on Israeli targets.
</P>
<P>
The GSS so far has not confirmed whether it was under the
attack.
</P>
<P>
Loudspeakers at mosques at various locations in the Gaza Strip
also blamed PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat for the incident, and
declared a three-day general strike in the strip.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian security services have been on high alert and fear
street protests by Islamic fundamentalists, while the Israeli
security forces have also been on alert in case of Hamas
attacks.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old Ayyash was initially from the West Bank
village of Rafat, and graduated from the Bir Zeit University near
Ramallah where he studied chemistry.
</P>
<P>
Ayyash was considered a bomb expert, and was accused by Israel
of masterminding a series of suicide bombing attacks, which
killed at least 70 Israelis and wounded over 300 others.
</P>
<P>
He had been a fugitive since 1992, and was believed to have
been hiding in the Gaza Strip since the start of Palestinian
autonomy in May 1994.
</P>
<P>
Capturing Ayyash has been a top priority of the GSS, but he
managed to escape GSS arrest at the last minute at least on two
occasions.
</P>
<P>
The incident came just 15 days away from the first Palestinian
elections due to be held on January 20.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Analysts said that the incident would hurt Arafat and
the Fatah movement, the mainstream of the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO), in the elections as the opposition would
point out that Israel was able to act in the heart of the
Palestinian autonomy.
</P>
<P>
It could also lead to an absolute boycott by Hamas of the
Palestinian elections and jeopardize the reconciliation process
between Hamas and the Palestinian National Authority.

<HEADLINE> Cabinet Crisis Hits Lithuania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 5 (Xinhua) -- A government crisis hit Lithuania
today after Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys and Defense Minister
Linas Linkevicius rendered resignation, according to reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers offered to step down because of their
conflicts with Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius over a sweeping
banking crisis in the Baltic state.
</P>
<P>
Linkevicius said he differs with the policy of the prime
minister, who has been criticized in the country for "salvaging"
his deposit from a crisis-hit bank.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister described the situation in the former
Soviet republic as "a political and moral crisis."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gylys said he was resigning because he "always stood
for a democratic development of the state in which laws are
dominating for everybody."
</P>
<P>
There is nothing of the kind in Lithuania so far, he added.
</P>
<P>
Both ministers are members of the ruling Lithuanian Democratic
Labour Party headed by Prime Minister Slezevicius.
</P>
<P>
Their resignations have not been approved yet by President
Algirdas Brazauskas.
</P>
<P>
The banking crisis which hit four major banks in the country
occurred at the end of 1995. The center of the crisis has been the
Lithuanian Joint-Stock Innovation Bank (LAIB) whose operations
have been suspended.
</P>
<P>
Slezevicius had rushed to LAIB two days before it was suspended
to recover his personal 135,000 lit (about 33,750 U.S. dollars)
deposit, triggering a public row.
</P>
<P>
Opposition factions in the Sejm, or parliament, have pressed
for his resignation, which was opposed by President Brazauskas.
</P>
<P>
Describing the prime minister's move as "undoubtedly
objectionable from the moral point of view," the president noted,
"If the premier and the entire government resign now, who will
work on the settlement of the banking crisis in the country?"
</P>
<P>
He said that the main task now is to save the money of
factories and businesses, and of over 65,000 Lithuanians who have
placed their deposits with the four major commercial banks hit by
the financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Harare Police Declare War on Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Police in Harare have declared
war against criminals, road traffic offenders, corrupt police
officers and instigators of violence and civil disobedience,
saying they will be more aggressive this year to reduce the
ever-increasing crime rate in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Senior assistant Commissioner for Harare province Solomon
Sithole told journalists today that his office was putting in
place various measures to curb crime in the province.
</P>
<P>
Some of the measures being put in place included educational
programs for the public on crime awareness, intensifying
operations of the neighborhood watch committees and other
ancillary units, and retraining police officers on the use of
firearms, investigation procedures and crime management.
</P>
<P>
Turning to legal and illegal demonstrations, he said, stern
legal action would be taken against people who deliberately
instigated others to become riotous, violent and destructive or
engage in any form of civil disobedience or illegal activity.
</P>
<P>
during the latter half of 1995, a total of 1,537 robberies
were committed in Harare, of which 69 were armed. On rape cases,
there had been a decrease last year, from 574 in 1994 to 525 in
1995, he said.
</P>
<P>
The officer stressed that police would deal severely with
cases of police corruption, bribery, illegal arrests and
detentions and all other incidents involving the harassment and
unfair treatment of the public by the police.

<HEADLINE> New York Maintenance Workers on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Janitors, elevator operators, building repair workers and
other maintenance workers formed picket lines outside buildings
in midtown and lower Manhattan including the World Trade Center
and the Empire State Building for several days of strikes.
</P>
<P>
The strike started when talks between unions and management
broke off over pay arrangement. The workers demanded a pay
increase of 3.8 percent annually over the next three years. But
the management has only offered a 2-percent hike under conditions
that the increase would be based on the cutting of the salaries of
new workers.
</P>
<P>
The negotiators for the building owners and managers said that
the real estate industry needs a lower starting salary to help
restore its financial health. They complained that the industry
was suffering a 30 percent vacancy rate and the costs to operate
the buildings were going higher while the prices the owners can
charge to lease empty space were falling.
</P>
<P>
However, the union workers fear that building owners, striving
to cut costs, will replace current building management companies
with new companies with lower starting salary, and the current
workers may lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
As there was no schedule for new negotiations, some union
officials said that the strike will last at least until Monday.

<HEADLINE> Probe Into Kwazulu/natal Violence Controversial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 5 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's new
multi-party commission to investigate recent violence in the
Kwazulu/Natal Province today met with opposition from some
political groups.
</P>
<P>
The commission was set up on Thursday following an upsurge of
political violence in Kwazulu/natal over the past few weeks,
highlighted by the Christmas massacre at Shobashobane near Port
Shepstone, where 20 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
"It was aimed at bringing stability to the country's most
violent area," said Kwazulu/natal Premier Frank Mdlalose while
announcing the formation of the commission.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the announcement, both the African National
Congress (ANC) and the South African Communist Party (SACP)
considered the commission as a veiled attempt to deflect
attention away from the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) which was
accused of initiating the violence.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here today, ANC safety and security
spokesman Bheki Cele said the Kwazulu/natal Executive Council had
never agreed on the formation of the commission.
</P>
<P>
He said the ANC would back all efforts in the province aimed
at getting down to the roots of political killings, but it
refused the idea of forming a multi-party commission that "would
cost millions of taxpayers' money."
</P>
<P>
In a separate statement, the SACP said the commission is
meanless unless it is focused on specific incidents.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the widespread criticism, however, the IFP
welcomed the commission as an important step toward a "common
understanding" about the causes of violence.

HONG KONG, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Officers of Hong Kong's
Organized Crime and Triad Bureau (OCTB) smashed a loansharking
syndicate involving 1,000 victims and 100 million HK dollars
(12.82 million US dollars) in debts.
</P>
<P>
A government release said today that OCTB officers launched
investigations several months ago into a bogus detective agency
allegedly involved in loansharking activities, and on Wednesday
night they raided the agency and three other targeted locations to

Police believed the syndicate had given loans ranging from a
few thousand HK dollars to over a million HK dollars to about
1,000 people at an excessive interest rate of 80 percent per
annum. The amount of debts totaled 100 million HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under the local Money Lenders Ordinance, the arrested are
liable to a maximum fine of five million HK dollars (0.64 million

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The local Newspaper Society
called for all Chinese-language newspapers to stop their price
war, fearing that more papers will fold this year.
</P>
<P>
The society launched a special committee last night to persuade
publishers to adopt a uniform price for local Chinese-language
publications.
</P>
<P>
It estimated that the price war which broke out on December 9
has left 590 people unemployed and caused losses of 110 million HK
dollars (14.1 million US dollars) in revenue for the newspaper
owners who cut their cover prices.
</P>
<P>
"Now after three weeks, we consider it will be extremely
dangerous to allow the situation to deteriorate," said Yip
Lai-lai, executive officer of the society.
</P>
<P>
So far four Chinese-language newspapers have been sidelined,
including TV Daily News, Express News, United Daily News, and the
Huanan Jingji Journal. Three magazines have also been forced to
close.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the society said they are trying to lobby and
convince all newspapers to adopt a recommended price.

<P>
MOSCOW, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
signed a decree today to remove Andrei Kozyrev from his post as
Russian foreign minister, the presidential press service reported.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made in connection with Kozyrev's election to
the State Duma (lower house of parliament) in December.
</P>
<P>
According to a Russian law, a government official elected to
the parliament should not keep his government portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last October, Yeltsin expressed readiness to remove
Kozyrev, 44, sack him as the top diplomat.
</P>
<P>
However, Yeltsin did not name in the decree Kozyrev's
successor, the press service added.
</P>
<P>
Kozyrev was born in Brussels, Belgium, on March 27, 1951, the
son of a diplomat. He joined the Soviet Foreign Ministry in 1974
but left it to become Russian foreign minister in October 1990.
</P>
<P>
A fluent English-speaker, he hit the limelight after the Soviet
Union collapsed in December 1991 and Russia took its place on the
world stage.

<HEADLINE> Sarajevo Airlift to Formally End Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The longest-running airlift in
history, the Sarajevo airlift, is expected to officially end early
next week after peace appears to take root in Bosnia, a spokesman
for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) announced
today.
</P>
<P>
"The tentative plan now is that a final plane will fly into
Sarajevo around midday on January 9 and some sort of ceremony will
be arranged for the end of the airlift," said Ron Redmon.
</P>
<P>
The Sarajevo airlift, beginning on July 3, 1992, exceeds the
462-day Berlin airlift from 1948 to 1949.
</P>
<P>
According to UNHCR, which runs the airlift operation, a total
of 160,677 tons of humanitarian aid have been flown into Sarajevo
aboard 12,951 fights by January 4, 1996, including 144,827 tons of
food and 15,850 tons of medicine, equipment and other humanitarian
supplies.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 nations have participated in the airlift. Five nations
-- Canada, France, Germany, Britain and United States -- flew
regularly.
</P>
<P>
A number of international humanitarian agencies, including the
International Committee of the Red Cross, is involved as well.
</P>
<P>
Redmond said during more than three years of the Bosnian war,
the airlift was almost the sole link between Sarajevo and the
outside world, delivering more than 85 percent of all aid reaching
the city.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the aid delivery, the airlift has helped
evacuate more than 1,100 patients from Bosnia. It has also carried
thousands of journalists into the city throughout the war, the
worst conflict in Europe since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR revealed that there have been more than 260 security
incidents during the airlift. The worst single incident was the
downing of an Italian Air Force cargo plane by a surface-to-air
missile on September 3, 1992, killing all four crewmen aboard.
</P>
<P>
The expertise gained from the Sarajevo airlift enabled it to
quickly mount a massive airlift for Rwandan refugees in Goma,
Zaire, in the summer of 1994, concluded the UNHCR.

<HEADLINE> Nine-Year-Old Girl Wins Lawsuit in Hangzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 4 (Xinhua) -- A nine-year-old girl in
Hangzhou, capital of east China's Zhejiang province, yesterday won
a lawsuit in a case where she claimed that her reputation had been
damaged.
</P>
<P>
The girl, Mao Xingyi, is a third-grade student in Hangzhou. The
defendant, a neighbor of hers, is a 31-year-old cadre with the
city.
</P>
<P>
According to the complaint Mao's lawyer filed, the defendant
stopped her at the school gate, blocking her path, on June 21,
1994, grabbing her umbrella, and calling her a thief, saying that
she had stolen a wallet in public.
</P>
<P>
Mao said that she fell ill the next day and was afraid to go to
school. As a result of that, her school performance declined.
</P>
<P>
Having sought the help of a lawyer, Mao filed an appeal with
the court, asking that the defendant apologize and pay her 10,000
yuan in compensation for psychological suffering.
</P>
<P>
An investigation showed that Mao and the defendant are
neighbours living in the same building, and that their two
families had previously quarrelled because one of them had built a
balcony, on June 20, 1994. As a result, the next morning, the
defendant stopped Mao in the manner described in the complaint.
</P>
<P>
The court found in Mao's favor, saying that the defendant's
action has infringed on Mao's rights by damaging her reputation.
According to the verdict, the defendant, an adult, has to
apologize to the young girl in 15 days in written form and pay 300
yuan in compensation for psychological damage.
</P>
<P>
Mao's lawyer says that Mao may be the youngest plaintiff ever
in the city.

The government tightly applied the regulations of the forestry

The Forestry Ministry gave no promise to the timber concession
companies that if they are found of violating the regulations, the

<P>
Five suspects, three Lebanese and two Palestinians, were
arrested by the Lebanese security forces last month. They
admitted that they were the perpetrators of the killing of Sheikh
Halabi.
</P>
<P>
The security forces are still chasing a main suspect named
Ahmed Abdul Karim Al-Saadi, best-known as "Abu Mohjen," who is
the head of the Palestinian extremist group Esbat Al-Ansar.
</P>
<P>
Abu Mohjen is believed hiding in Ain Al-Hilweh, the largest
Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon, which is under a siege of
the Lebanese Army since this week.
</P>
<P>
The military forces have been authorized by the government to
break into the camp, which is located near the south Lebanese port
city of Saida, in case that the wanted fugitive refuses to
surrender.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said that more than 150 army troops have been
sent to reinforce the tight siege around Ain Al-Hilweh, and
check-points have been set up at the four entrances of the camp.
</P>
<P>
As the stand-off continues, President Elias Hrawi disclosed
that he "will not compromise on the question of security," and
that Abu Mohjen must be brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
The president added that "the issue will come to a conclusion
quickly because the country's credibility is at stake."
</P>
<P>
He said the security forces "have a right to enter any area in
Lebanon to enforce the law, and it is in the interest of the camp's
residents to hand over Abu Mohjen to the authorities."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Lebanon Warns of Severing Diplomatic Relations with Sudan (part I) (by Shao Jie) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon warned today that it
will sever diplomatic relations with Sudan if that country is
proved to be involved in the murder of a Lebanese Moslem religious
leader in the Lebanese capital in August 1995.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the local Arabic-language magazine
Al-Afkar issued today, Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz
announced that his country will cut diplomatic ties with Sudan if
the current investigations prove that Sudan was involved in the
August assassination of Sheikh Nizar Halabi, head of the
pro-Syrian Sunni Islamic group Al Ahbash.
</P>
<P>
However, the foreign minister expressed hope that things will
not go that far, adding that the case is still under
investigations "at a higher level."
</P>
<P>
A crisis has loomed in the relations between Lebanon and
Sudan. Earlier this week, the Lebanese government turned down a
Sudanese appeal to put an end to what the Sudanese Embassy here
described as "a press campaign launched by Lebanese newspapers
against its country."
</P>
<P>
Lebanon severed diplomatic relations with Iraq in April, 1994,
after a leading Iraqi dissident was shot dead in his residence in
Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese authorities accused the Iraqi Embassy in Beirut
was directedly involved in the murder.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources in the Foreign Ministry said the Sudanese
Embassy in Beirut submitted to the Foreign Ministry a protest
earlier this week, accusing some Lebanese newspapers of launching
the campaign against Sudan based on "fabricated reports."
</P>
<P>
It denied the charges made by some local papers that Sudan was
behind the killing of Sheikh Halabi, and that it had been training
Lebanese youth for terrorism purposes.
</P>
<P>
But the Lebanese Foreign Ministry replied that the press in
this country is "free," and the Lebanese authorities could not
interfere in press agencies and to press them to stop a campaign.
</P>
<P>
Halabi was shot down in front of his residence in Sunni
neighborhood in central Beirut on August 31, 1995 by three gunmen.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese Interior Minister Bakri Hassan Salih denied in Tunis
that his country sponsored the training of those who have been
detained by the Lebanese security forces for their alleged
involvement in the assassination.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Paris-based Arabic-language daily
Al-Hayat published today, Salih denied any link of Sudan with the
case of Halabi. He is currently in Tunis attending the 13th
conference of Arab Interior Ministers.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Change Building Tenants on the Bund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Three work units with offices
in buildings that line the Bund of China's largest metropolis,
have decided to move out.
</P>
<P>
The move comes in response to a drive by the municipal
government to lease all buildings on the Bund to domestic and
foreign financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
It has been learned that tenants of more than 10 buildings
along the street lining the Bund will end their tenancy this year,
thereby increasing the speed at which it will be turned into a
financial center in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
Of a total of 240 buildings in the Bund area which can be
leased to other companies or units, 24 are on the street,
including four that were rented out recently to Hong Kong's Park
View Company, China's Everbright Bank, Shanghai's AJ Trust &AMP;
Investment Corp., and the branch company of China Merchants
Commercial Bank.
</P>
<P>
In order to help re-arrange the tenants, the local government
set up the Shanghai Bund Buildings Function Transformation Corp.,
Ltd. in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Many well-known international banks, insurance companies,
multinationals, and foundations from England, the United States,
and Japan have shown great interest in investing in the Bund
area.

<P>
JAKARTA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
taken a move to overcome a telecommunications cable scarcity by
licensing two companies to produce telephone cables.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Indonesian Cable Manufacturers in a
statement today welcomed the government's move to allow PT Telkom
and PT Indosat, the two partially state-owned companies, to
produce telephone cables.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1995, the Ministry of Tourism, Post and
Telecommunications approved a decision by the two companies to
invest in a planned fiber-optic cable factory.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has been experiencing a cable scarcity for two years.
</P>
<P>
Domestic demand for telephone cables will significantly jump in
the near future. In addition, PT Indosat's plan to carry out
telecommunications projects overseas such as in Cambodia will
drastically increase the needs.
</P>
<P>
However, local cable manufacturers are yet to meet domestic
demand for telephone cables.

<P>
LUSAKA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Home Affairs Minister
Chitalu Sampa today urged police officers to avoid being partisan
in the execution of duties during elections as this may
compromise their profession.
</P>
<P>
Sampa noted as Zambia is preparing for the presidential and
general elections later this year, police officers should ensure
that they are not partisan while on duty.

The minister made the call at a pass-out parade of about 265
police and immigration officers at the Zambia police training
college in Lusaka's suburbs.
</P>
<P>
Sampa warned the new police officers to be on the look out for
political criminals who are threatening to cause civil
disobedience if the government does not fulfill certain
obligations.
</P>
<P>
The government is committed to protecting its citizens, he
said, adding that the police officers come across such criminals
during the execution of duties, they should arrest the culprits.
</P>
<P>
He also re-assured the nation that his ministry has the
capacity to control violence in the country to enhance economic
development.
</P>
<P>
At the same occasion, Inspector-General of Police Francis
Ndhlovu said the Zambian police is preparing adequately for the
forthcoming general and presidential elections by training more
police officers.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that about 12,000 qualified police officers will
have graduated by the time of the elections to help maintain
peace and order in the country.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Advocates Tight World Grain Supplies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The world must get used to tight
grain supplies following more than 20 years of surplus production,
according to Gene Moos, U.S. under secretary for agriculture.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the Oxford Farming Conference in Britain on
Thursday, Moos said that "We are moving from an era of surplus
production in the U.S. and western Europe to meet the demands of
the growing population around the world and we need to adjust our
thinking accordingly."
</P>
<P>
He said that tight supplies in the world market will bring
difficulties for developing countries which import a large number
of their food due to their fast growing population.
</P>
<P>
Politicians must readjust policies that would provide food
assurance for large importers such as China and other Asian
countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Moos's views are not shared by the European Union
(EU), the world's second largest grain exporter.
</P>
<P>
Franz Fischler, the EU agriculture commissioner, told the
conference that the situation on the world cereals market could be
completely different in the next marketing year.
</P>
<P>
"It is dangerous to change all the rules on the basis of an
untypical harvest result," he argued.
</P>
<P>
He also defended EU's imposition of tax on wheat exports in a
bid to curb shipments, saying that the tax would be limited and

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Meets with Participants at Conference on Auditing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today
met with participants at a national conference on auditing and
urged audit departments at all levels to enforce fiscal discipline
more and help maintain economic order.
</P>
<P>
Li said that auditing has seen great achievements in the past
year, the Auditing Law has taken effect, the quality of auditors
has been improving, and auditors have saved the government losses
worth 15 billion yuan. He extended greetings to those working in
auditing on behalf of the CPC (the Communist Party of China)
Central Committee and the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that auditing is playing a bigger role in
maintaining economic order, and in promoting the construction of
honest and clean government and the healthy development of the
nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
The Central Government has resolved this year to improve the
economic order, tighten fiscal discipline, and take a tougher
stand on economic crimes such as tax evasion, smuggling, false
accounts and so forth. Li said that the new situation is placing
greater demands on audit departments.
</P>
<P>
As the overseer of all state-owned assets, audit departments
must enforce the auditing law strictly and strengthen supervision
of revenues and spending, especially that of government at their
own level, Li explained.
</P>
<P>
The premier urged audit departments to draft rules and
regulations for enforcing the auditing law quickly, so that their
work will be done in strict accordance with the law and will be
codified as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
Li said that problems spotted in auditing must be treated
seriously and that those caught breaking the rules must be
punished in accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that improving auditors' quality is critical to
the success of auditing work. They already have a good foundation
and a good image in society, thanks to their efforts over the past
several years. But, there is still a lot that needs to be done to
improve the quality politically and professionally in order to do
a better job, Li said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia-Iran Companies Urged to Exploit Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran today expressed its
hope that Malaysian businessmen could collaborate with Iranians to
explore and exploit potential markets in the third countries.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Commerce Minister Yahya Al-Eshagh said here today that
businessmen from the two countries could work together and make
efforts to set up joint ventures in the third countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting with Malaysian Minister of International
Trade and Industries Rafidah Aziz, the visiting Iranian minister
said Malaysia could also use Iran as a gateway to penetrate the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) which has a population of
about 300 million.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Iran could make Malaysia as its gateway to tap the
Southeast Asian market, he added.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that currently there were on-going negotiations
between Malaysian and Iranian parties on projects like aluminum
production, telecommunications, automotive spare parts and
construction materials.
</P>
<P>
Al-Eshagh said that in the field of transportation, Iran had
made vast investment and that Iranians could now carry goods
through any parts of the CIS and the Caucasian countries and vice
versa.
</P>
<P>
He said that similarly Malaysian and Iranian companies could
also set up joint ventures in transporting goods and merchandise
to the CIS and Caucasian states.
</P>
<P>
He also said the trade volume between the two countries could
be increased. Iran could import papers, tyres, tubes and
electronics goods from Malaysia while export cement, fresh fruits,
construction materials, consumer goods and its engineers to
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Iran is Malaysia's fifth largest trading partner in West Asia
after the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Jordan
last year, with total trade amounted to 273 million Malaysian
Ringgit (about 109 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Al-Eshagh arrived here on Tuesday with a 10-member delegation
for a three-day official visit.

LONDON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Most European Union nations would
be ready for the European Monetary Union (EMU) and the adoption of
the single currency by 1999, EU Commission President Jacques
Santer said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Santer said in a BBC radio interview that some seven to nine
member nations would be ready to go ahead in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
Any attempt to push back the timetable for the EMU is
unacceptable, he said.
</P>
<P>
Although it is up to the British government to decide if it
wants to join the single currency at the time or not, Britain
cannot hold up the introduction of the single currency, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ways must be found in 1996 to form closer relations among
member nations, Santer stressed.
</P>
<P>
On the Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC), Santer confirmed
that the conference will extend the system of qualified majority
voting to areas where now certain individual countries have vetoes.
</P>
<P>
The IGC will also make big reforms in many areas, such as the
common foreign and security policies, he said.

BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- China has seen progress in the
use of foreign loans over the past 17 years and these loans have
been used for more than 10,000 projects.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from an authoritive source show that by the end of
June 1995, China's foreign debt stood at 105 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Since 1979, when the country adopted its reform and opening up
policy, China has had steady cooperation with a number of
international financial institutions such as the World Bank and
the Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
It has also set up bilateral loan relations with more than 20
developed countries, including Japan, France and Germany during
the 17 years.
</P>
<P>
To make good use of every single dollar of foreign loans, the
country has used 79 percent of the money for basic industries such
as transport, energy, and raw materials.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, China has spared no effort at introducing
managment techniques from abroad, as well as financial services
and efficient methods.
</P>
<P>
Its good economic returns and on-time repayment of debt have
helped China maintain a good reputation in the international
financial community, the source noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Japanese opposition leader Ichiro
Ozawa today called for immediate general elections, saying that
Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama's decision to resign was designed
to favor Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) President Ryutaro
Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
Ozawa, who heads the largest opposition Shinshinto (New
Frontier Party) and aims at becoming prime minister himself, told
a news conference that "Murayama's decision does not do anything
to solve problems as such."
</P>
<P>
Murayama, who became prime minister in June 1994, announced his
resignation earlier today but said he wants to maintain the
current framework of the ruling coalition, consisting of
Murayama's Social Democratic Party (SDP), Hashimoto's LDP, and New
Party Sakigake.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, also deputy prime minister and trade minister, is
expected to succeed Murayama next Thursday when an extra Diet
session is held to name a new premier.
</P>
<P>
Ozawa denounced the ruling coalition's move to pick Hashimoto
as Murayama's successor, saying, "it's not good to pass around the
government leadership among the three coalition parties without
holding elections."
</P>
<P>
Murayama today formally announced his resignation as prime
minister to make way for a new government under the current
three-party coalition, but ruled out calling snap general
elections.
</P>
<P>
His pending resignation marks the end of the first coalition
government headed by a prime minister from the SDP since the first
Socialist cabinet was formed in 1946.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Steps up Fight Against Drug Dealing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has intensified a campaign against drug dealing in the country,
with the help of the Netherlands, United Kingdom and South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Police sources confirmed here today that investigations have
been carried out by a join task force comprising both the
Tanzanian police and foreign experts.
</P>
<P>
The investigations were guided by British and South African
intelligence reports on heroin and mandrake trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The experts suspected a neighboring country was using some
clearing forwarding companies to do the illegal dealing of drugs.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said drug dealers were transporting cargoes of
mandrake from Asia and sending them to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
They have also been transporting heroine from India and
Thailand, and smuggled it via Tanzania to Europe, North America
and Canada.

<HEADLINE> Britain Plans to Change Way of Check Clearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The British government is
planning to change its way of check clearing in a move which could
speed up the current process and save British banks millions of
pounds a year.
</P>
<P>
A Financial Times report said today that shifting to the new
system, under which the detail of checks can be read and
transmitted electronically, would bring Britain into line with
most other European Union countries.
</P>
<P>
The report added that under the new system, banks would no
longer have to return checks to individual branches where they are
drawn, therefore, significant amounts of paperwork would be saved.
</P>
<P>
At present, when processing checks, millions of pieces of paper
-- up to 10 million checks are processed each day -- will be moved
from the clearing centers to the branches.

<HEADLINE> Singapore-U.S. Biotech Joint Venture  to Help Cotton Farmers in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 5 (Xinhua) -- A Singapore consortium has
teamed up with a U.S. biotechnology firm to help Chinese cotton
farmers fighting against insect infestation, which has been the
cause of poor harvests, the partners announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The partnership aims to help the farmers through the latest
seed-processing techniques, they said at a press briefing
organized by the Economic Development Board of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
AgroGen Private (PTE) Ltd of Singapore and D&AMP;M International of
the United States will form a 25-million-U.S.-dollar venture to
invest in China.
</P>
<P>
AgroGen will hold 20 percent and D&AMP;M 80 percent of the
Singapore-based partnership company, named D and PL China Pte Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture will produce and market cotton-planting seeds
in China through the supply of seed processing and genetic
engineering technologies in cotton-growing Chinese provinces such
as Shandong, Henan and Hebei.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of improved cotton seed would help Chinese
farmers whose cotton crops have in recent years suffered insect
infestation that has been blamed for declining yields, they said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Troops to Be Trained in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Japanese soldiers will be invited
for training in Britain in an effort to overcome Tokyo's
long-standing aversion to deploying its troops overseas, the
Independent newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the topics British Defense Secretary Michael
Portillo will discuss with his Japanese counterpart Seishiro Eto
during his four-day visit to Tokyo beginning Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting diplomatic sources, the newspaper said that the
training program, financed by Tokyo, will begin later this year
and will draw on British expertise in internal security and
peacekeeping operations acquired in Northern Ireland and the
former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
British officials regard the program as a useful step towards
Japanese participation in multinational military operations, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Portillo will express Britain's support to
Japan's aspirations to join the U.N. Security Council on the
understanding that Japan gradually assumes a greater peacekeeping
role in the world, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
He will also discuss with Eto and Foreign Minister Yohei Kono
Asia's regional security and the possibility to increase British
arms sales to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Portillo is the first British defense minister ever to visit
Japan since 1973.

<HEADLINE> Nine-Year-Old Girl Wins Lawsuit in Hangzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 5 (Xinhua) -- A nine-year-old girl in
Hangzhou, capital of east China's Zhejiang province, yesterday won
a lawsuit in a case where she claimed that her reputation had been
damaged.
</P>
<P>
The girl, Mao Xingyi, is a third-grade student in a Hangzhou
primary school. The defendant, a neighbor of hers, is a
31-year-old cadre with the city.
</P>
<P>
According to the complaint Mao's lawyer filed, the defendant
stopped her at the school gate, blocking her path, on June 21,
1994, grabbing her umbrella, and calling her a thief, saying that
she had stolen a wallet in public.
</P>
<P>
Mao said that she fell ill the next day and was afraid to go to
school. As a result of that, her school performance declined.
</P>
<P>
Having sought the help of a lawyer, Mao filed an appeal with
the court, asking that the defendant apologize and pay her 10,000
yuan in compensation for psychological suffering.
</P>
<P>
An investigation showed that Mao and the defendant are
neighbours living in the same building, and that their two
families had previously quarrelled because one of them had built a
balcony, on June 20, 1994. As a result, the next morning, the
defendant stopped Mao in the manner described in the complaint.
</P>
<P>
The court found in Mao's favor, saying that the defendant's
action has infringed on Mao's rights by damaging her reputation.
According to the verdict, the defendant, an adult, has to
apologize to the young girl in 15 days in written form and pay 300
yuan in compensation for psychological damage.
</P>
<P>
Mao's lawyer says that Mao may be the youngest plaintiff ever
in the city.

<HEADLINE> Airbus to Increase Its Share of China Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Europe's Airbus Industrie
predicts that Chinese airlines will acquire some 1,320 passenger
planes over the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The company's goal is to get half of this market, according to
Lei Yi, vice-president of the sales department of its China branch.
</P>
<P>
One of the world's three largest civil aircraft manufacturers,
Airbus has sold 35 passenger planes to China, 25 of which are in
use.
</P>
<P>
Airbus has spared no effort in competing with Boeing, the
world's largest manufacturer in this field, to increase its share
of China's aircraft market.
</P>
<P>
"Although the cost of an Airbus is higher than that of a
Boeing, the key point is not the cost but the profits that the
airliner will bring in," Lei said.
</P>
<P>
Compared with Boeing, one Airbus only needs two pilots, and its
weight is less than that of a Boeing, reducing the aircraft's fuel
consumption.
</P>
<P>
Airbus also uses computers to monitor all systems in the
aircraft, helping reduce maintenance by a big margin. Pilots who
learn to operate one type of Airbus can handle other types easily
owing to common characteristics.
</P>
<P>
In order to meet China's demand, Airbus has helped the country
train many senior managers in various fields, including how to
select airplanes and arrange air routes.A 50 million US dollar
training center, funded by Airbus, the first of its kind in Asia,
is under construction in Beijing now.
</P>
<P>
The Airbus consortium was co-operatively set up 26 years ago by
France, Germany, England and Spain, with headquarters in Toulouse
in France.

BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- China will computerize its
system of licensing controls for exports of textile goods by using
an advanced AS/400 system made by IBM.
</P>
<P>
The system will also improve the checking of licensing of
quotas, which was started officially this month by China's
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) and US
customs.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC's computer center and IBM signed an agreement here today
for the high-speed data-processing system, which is valued at five
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The MOFTEC computer center has developed a system linking
China's 41 licensing offices for textile exports with the main
processor of the center, and for electric data checks with the US,
Canada and Germany.
</P>
<P>
The electric data check can help export licenses of textile
goods issued by China's local customs offices to be registered
with the trade control system of the three countries without
delay.

<HEADLINE> UNON Not Meaning Merger Of UNEP, HABITAT: Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Office at
Nairobi (UNON) is merely a merger of administrative functions of
the United Nations Center for Human Settlements (Habitat) and the
United Nations Environment Program (UNEP).
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of UNON does not mean the merger of UNEP
and Habitat," said a press release of the U.N. Information Center
to Xinhua here today.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. statement corrected an earlier report by the Kenyan
newspaper "Daily Nation" which said the UNEP and the Habitat has
merged to form a new organization of UNON.
</P>
<P>
The UNON began its function on January 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to note that the two United Nations
agencies... will continue to function as two distinct and
separate agencies," said the U.N. statement.
</P>
<P>
"The merger of the administrative units was initiated by the
Secretary-General of the United Nations in 1993, in order to
streamline administrative operations and strengthen the U.N.
presence in Nairobi," it said.
</P>
<P>
"The administrative reform will contribute to a more efficient
use of scarce resources and more coherent management in both
entities," it added.
</P>
<P>
The merger of the administrative functions of the U.N.
agencies reflected the world body's resolve to cut its personnel
amid increasing financial difficulties it is facing due to the
delay of membership payment by some countries.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Minister Reports Attempted Attack on Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Minister of Internal
Security Moshe Shahal reported to the police Thursday night that
there was an attempt to break into his home and attack him, Israel
Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Shahal said he could not reveal
additional details at this time, and the police and the General
Security Service (GSS) are investigating the incident.
</P>
<P>
The report added that a group of supporters of Uzi Meshulam, a
jailed Jewish religious extremist, rioted Thursday night near
Shahal's residence in Haifa.
</P>
<P>
They distributed leaflets attacking the minister. It appeared
that they might have attempted to enter Shahal's home, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The police have imposed a blackout on the investigation of the
incident.
</P>
<P>
Following the assassination of the late Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin in last November, the police and the GSS has tightened
security measures to protect Prime Minister Shimon Peres and other
cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
The GSS has warned that another political assassination could
occur in Israel, carried out by an individual or a small group
numbering two or three persons.
</P>
<P>
Rabin was assassinated by Yigal Amir, a Jewish religious
extremist against the peace process, on November 4 in Tel Aviv
after a massive peace rally.
</P>
<P>
The trial of the assassin opened on December 19, but was
adjourned until January 23 to enable defense lawyers to review
the evidence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the GSS said that they would further tighten the
security measures.

<HEADLINE> SIMEX Reaches New Record Volume in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Annual trading volume at the
Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX) rose to hit a
new record in 1995, mirroring continued world confidence in the
exchange, SIMEX said today.
</P>
<P>
It said that a total of 24,251,339 contracts were traded in
1995 compared with the 24,060,274 contracts in 1994, growing one
percent.
</P>
<P>
The moderation of growth rate was due to 1995 being a turbulent
year for the global derivatives industry, resulting in a worldwide
decline in trading volumes, it explained, with an obvious
reference to the Barings and Daiwa cases.
</P>
<P>
However, it added, "In a year where the major international
futures exchanges experienced negative growth, SIMEX's positive
growth, albeit marginal, is a strong demonstration of the
international trading community's continued confidence in the
financial strength and integrity of the Exchange, and demand for
the Exchange's range of futures and options contracts".

<HEADLINE> Sarajevo Crucial to Success of Peace Accord, Says Bildt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 6 (Xinhua) -- High Representative for Bosnia
Carl Bildt said today the transfer of Sarajevo's Serb districts to
government control was crucial to the success of the entire
Bosnian peace mission.
</P>
<P>
Bildt told a press conference in Sarajevo that "it is very
obvious that implementation here in Sarajevo is difficult,
critical and crucial to the entire peace process."
</P>
<P>
Under the Bosnia peace agreement signed last month in Paris,
five Serb districts in Sarajevo will be handed over to the Muslim
government control by March 19.
</P>
<P>
Bildt said he had held intensive talks with local Serb
representatives in Sarajevo, and found the majority of the Serb
population feared for the future.
</P>
<P>
The high representative also criticized the Muslim government
for not making enough efforts to allay the worries of the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the statements coming out of this side (Bosnian
Muslim) have not been designed to alleviate those fears," Tanjug
news agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic has said the Serb
civilians can remain in Sarajevo but those who had committed
crimes during the war must be put on trial.
</P>
<P>
There are about 120,000 Serbs in the affected sectors. On
December 12, just two days before the peace agreement was signed
in Paris, the Sarajevo Serbs held a referendum with an
overwhelming majority voting against the handover.
</P>
<P>
Bildt also said a joint civilian commission had been set up
with representatives from both sides and from the NATO
implementation force to discuss all issues relating to the
transfer of authority in the Serb districts.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, hundreds of Serbs from the affected sectors
have fled their homes to other Serb areas to avoid possible
retaliation by the Muslims. A mass exodus is highly expected if
the Serb security in Sarajevo is not guaranteed by NATO-led
implementation force or the international community.

<HEADLINE> Sarajevo Serbs Demand Local Autonomy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A senior Bosnian Serb official
today demanded a political solution to the Sarajevo problem by
granting Sarajevo Serbs autonomy under Muslim control.
</P>
<P>
Parliament Speaker of the Serb Republic Momcilo Krajisnik told
the Serb news agency SRNA that the Serbs demanded their own police
and justice institutions in the Serb sectors of Sarajevo which
will be reverted to the control of the Muslim-Croat federation by
March 19 under the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
"Only in this way can the Serbs remain in Sarajevo," he added.
</P>
<P>
The NATO commander in Bosnia, Admiral Leighton Smith, turned
down a request by Krajisnik a few days earlier to delay the
transfer of Serb-held Sarajevo sectors to government control,
arguing "he is not authorized to change the timing of the transfer
of land under the peace agreement."
</P>
<P>
The Serb official said the Serbs would no longer ask for the
postponement of the transfer of the land but insisted on autonomy
in these affected districts.
</P>
<P>
"It is rather hypocritical of the international community to
call on Serbs to remain in Sarajevo while at the same time not to
make any political efforts to this end," he said.
</P>
<P>
SRNA said a committee for the peace accord implementation
decided at a meeting in Serb sector of Sarajevo Vogosca today to
demand the autonomy in Serb sectors. The Serbs has also sent a
letter to High representative Carl Bildt, asking for information
about the future organization in the capital city by January 10.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, hundreds of Serbs from the affected sectors
have fled their homes to other Serb areas to avoid possible
retaliation by the Muslims. A mass exodus is highly expected if
the Serb security in Sarajevo is not guaranteed by NATO-led
implementation force or the international community.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Concerned Over Armed Clashes In Northwest Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) has expressed its concern over the recent
hostilities in northwest Liberia, according to a report reaching
here today.
</P>
<P>
On December 28 last year, fighters of the ULIMO-J began
attacking troops of the west African peacekeeping force known as
ECOMOG in Tubmanburg, some 60 kilometers northwest of capital
Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
"What has occurred in the area around Tubmanburg is extremely
disturbing because it is potentially destabilizing the peace
process," ECOWAS spokesman and Ghana's Deputy Foreign Minister
Mohamed Chambas told newsmen in Monrovia on Friday.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG was sent to Liberia in 1990 by ECOWAS to try to halt
the civil war, which broke out in late 1989.
</P>
<P>
It is currently deploying soldiers throughout Liberia to
disarm some 60,000 fighters of the country's armed factions under
a peace accord signed in Nigeria last August.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG on Monday said it had regained control of Tubmanburg
after dislodging the ULIMO militiamen who attacked the
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the elements who are currently on a
confrontational path with ECOMOG will see that ECOMOG is here for
peace and not to fight any Liberian," Chambas said.
</P>
<P>
He urged those "elements" to give ECOWAS "maximum cooperation
so that we can put back the peace process on the right path to
allow this country to return to normalcy".

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Politicians Urged Not To Derail Transition Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian politicians have been
advised not to derail the transition-to-civil-rule program of the
present military administration through reckless politicking.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Information and Culture Minister, Dr. Walter
Ofonagoro, gave the advice today in Enugu, southern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Ofonagoro said that the negotiation of the transition program
with the head of state, as proposed by some Nigerian politicians,
was unnecessary since some of them participated in the drafting
of the transition program.
</P>
<P>
He described as untrue the media reports which quoted him as
saying that government would not dialogue with politicians,
explaining that government would only hold talks with registered
political parties and associations with identifiable
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
"Those self-styled politicians who want to negotiate the
transition program with government, which parties are they from
and whose interest do they represent?" the minister asked.
</P>
<P>
He expressed dismay at the attitude of a section of the
Nigerian press to publish falsehood about the goings-on in the
country, to serve as resource materials for the western press
which "is bent on tearing the nation apart".

<HEADLINE> Donor Countries to Consider Granding Aid to Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Donor countries will meet in Paris
Tuesday to consider granting the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) 500 million U.S. dollars in aid this year, local media
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The official Middle East News Agency (MENA) quoted well-placed
Palestinian sources as saying that the sum will be paid in total
this year, contrary to previous years when the paid amounts were
much less than pledged.
</P>
<P>
The donor countries' meeting was scheduled to be held in
September in Washington, but the European countries objected to
the convocation in the U.S. capital and demanded it be held in an
European capital.
</P>
<P>
The reason is that the European Union extend the major share of
the assistance to the PNA, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, Saudi arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Qatar
and Oman will take part in the meeting together with the U.S.,
Japan and more than 30 European states.
</P>
<P>
PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat will head the PNA delegation to the
Paris meeting, on the sidelines of which he will meet with French
Foreign Minister Herve De Charette.
</P>
<P>
France pledged 77.5 million francs (about 38.7 million dollars)
in aid to the Palestinians during the year in adition to
its share in other financing pledges by the donor countries, MENA
said.
