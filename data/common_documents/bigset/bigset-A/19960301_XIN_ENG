<HEADLINE> Clinton, TV Executives Discuss Program Violence Ratings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Television executives in
the United States Thursday assured President Bill Clinton they'll
devise a system to warn viewers about violence and sex in
programs.
</P>
<P>
Opening a White House meeting with TV and entertainment
industry leaders, Clinton said, "I'm excited about what I think we
can achieve here today for our children, our families and our
future."
</P>
<P>
At the meeting some 30 leading executives pledged support for a
ratings system.
</P>
<P>
Hillary Rodham Clinton and Vice President Al Gore took part in
the discussions.
</P>
<P>
"We are here to discuss how we can best fulfill our common
responsibilities in two ways: First how we can give parents more
control over what their children see on television. and second how
we can improve children's programming," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also was expected to discuss with the TV executives his
interest in requiring stations to air at least three hours a week
of educational programs for children.
</P>
<P>
Though the TV executives envision a system along the lines of
the one used for movies, they are a long way from agreement on
whether cartoons and news magazines should be rated and how to
rate soap operas.
</P>
<P>
The hard work in resolving these issues, developing ratings
symbols and criteria, comes over the next six months, executives
say. News and sports programs won't be rated.
</P>
<P>
The TV industry wants to have a ratings system in place by
January. The system would cover both broadcast and cable
programming.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Georgia Republican, who met with
the TV executives Thursday morning, said, "Frankly, there is a lot
of stuff on television today that is destructive to society and
shouldn't be on there."
</P>
<P>
An overhauled telecommunications law urges the TV industry to
rate programs, and requires that new TV sets be equipped with the
v-chip. With a remote-control-like device, a person can block such
programs from appearing on the TV screen. Without the ratings, the
v-chip is useless.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, if the industry doesn't create its own ratings
system in a year, then a government-appointed panel of industry
executives would.
</P>
<P>
However, there are people who consider ratings and the v-chip
not enough. Sen. Joseph Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, former
Education Secretary William Bennett, and eight religious groups,
including the Christian Coalition, are calling for broadcast and
cable networks to adopt "higher programming standards" and program
a "family viewing hour" during prime time.
</P>
<P>
The Center for Media Education urges TV stations to air more
educational shows and wants broadcast and cable networks to rate
cartoons and other children's programs, too.

JOHANNESBURG, March 1 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today held a 90-minute talk with King of Swaziland
Mswati III at the King's Lozitha Palace near Swaziland's Capital

Mandela is reported to have been closely monitoring
Swaziland's political situation, especially popular demand for
political reform and introduction of a multi-party system.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The British Aerospace (BAe) is
pushing for the establishment of a pan-European military aircraft
company to counter the fierce competition from the Americans.
</P>
<P>
Dick Evans, BAe chief executive, expressed here today the
urgent desire of massive consolidation of the Continent's arms
industry, saying BAe is willing to inject its wing manufacturing
business into the Airbus to create a company able to raise funds
on its own account.
</P>
<P>
He also urged his air industry partners in Germany, France,
Sweden and other European countries to make contributions to such
a project.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that such a company, to manage the design,
development and production of warplanes for all European
countries, would lead to great efficiency improvements and cost
savings.
</P>
<P>
European countries are now working at three different kinds of
fighter planes including the Rafale of France, the JAS39 Gripen of
Sweden and the jointly developed Eurofighter.
</P>
<P>
Duplications of costs and small production runs have left the
European planes over-priced in comparison to rival planes build by
American companies, according to air industry experts.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto said here today that despite changes of leadership in
Japan, the country's policy of developing friendly relations with
China has never changed.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto made the statement during talks with Chinese Premier
Li Peng. Both leaders are in Bangkok for the first Asia-Europe
Meeting (ASEM) which opened today.
</P>
<P>
"We should assume the historical responsibility of further
enhancing confidence and cooperation between Japan and China,"
Hashimoto said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of chemical weapons left over in China by Japanese
aggressor troops during the wartime, Hashimoto said the Japanese
government now attaches great importance to this issue and will
send an official delegation to China as soon as possible for
consultations with the Chinese government on finding a solution to
the problem.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto also reiterated that his government will stick to the
One-China policy and will limit Japan's relations with Taiwan
within the level of non-governmental contacts.
</P>
<P>
At the talks, Chinese Premier Li Peng expressed appreciation
for Hashimoto's statements.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government is ready to join hands with the
new Japanese government led by Hashimoto in further promoting the
development of Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
To maintain long-term, stable and friendly relations between
China and Japan will not only be in keeping with the interests of
the Chinese and Japanese peoples, but will also benefit the peace
and development in the whole of the Asia-Pacific region, Li said.

<P>
ATHENS, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Gerassimos
Arsenis held talks here today with NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana on the recent Greek-Turkish standoff in the Aegean, NATO
enlargement, the situation in Bosnia and Greece's cooperation with
the alliance.
</P>
<P>
Arsenis said after the meeting he had briefed Solana on the
recent crisis in the Aegean. "I imagine that more visits by Solana
to Greece will follow so that he will formulate his own opinion on
the issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
Solana, who arrived here Thursday for a two-day visit, told the
press that he and Arsenis had discussed the NATO force in Bosnia,
which "is a very big effort on the part of a coalition of NATO
member countries and non-members for peace in Bosnia."
</P>
<P>
He also thanked the Greek government on behalf of NATO for its
participation in the force, adding, "We analyzed the ways in which
the operation is developing, the future, and its prospects."
</P>
<P>
Turning to NATO enlargement, Solana said that the alliance was
contemplating this issue and would be doing so in the coming
years, while 1996 would be the year in which "the alliance will
enter into dialogue with those countries that desire dialogue with
us."
</P>
<P>
Solana said NATO shared Greece's views concerning allied
relations with Russia. In the coming weeks, he said, he would
visit Moscow to brief the Russian government on the thoughts he
had exchanged with Arsenis.
</P>
<P>
On relations between Greece and Turkey, Solana said, "The
constructive way is the only way to confront all the problems." It
was in that spirit that he would face all problems as NATO
secretary general, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Britian's university
vice-chancellors have angrily reacted to the government decision
that they face budget cuts of up to 4.5 percent in cash terms next
year.
</P>
<P>
The Association of University Teachers described the funding
cut announced by the government Thursday as "butchery."
</P>
<P>
The association also warned that the government decision could
eventually lead to more than 10,000 job losses as many
universities were their towns' biggest employers.
</P>
<P>
The association's general secretary David Triesman said that
there was not doubt that the quality of the learning experience
for students in higher education was sliding downhill.
</P>
<P>
Professor Gareth Roberts, chairman of the Committee of
Vice-Chancellors and Principals, said that if further funding cuts
were made, some universities might not survive by next summer when
the results of the government inquiry could be implemented.
</P>
<P>
According to reports today, the Higher Education Funding
Council, a government institution, appeared to support the
position of the vice-chancellors and the Association of University
Teachers.
</P>
<P>
The council's chief executive Professor Brian Fender said that
services would be affected if the squeeze on universities
continued, after the announcement of an overall budget cut of 5
percent to 144 higher education institutions this year.
</P>
<P>
Britain's higher education funding has been cut by 28 percent
over the last six years, when student numbers have risen by 45
percent, reported the Morning Star newspaper today.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien expressed Thursday his country's strong objections to
provisions in proposed U.S. legislation that could hurt Canadian
firms doing business in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
In his telephone call to U.S. President Bill Clinton, Chretien
said that his country would "consider the proposed law improper
U.S. interference in the affairs of businesses operating outside
the United States."
</P>
<P>
The anti-Cuba bill being pushed through the U.S. Congress could
put legal obstacles in the way for Canadian and other foreign
companies operating in Cuba. Once passed, the bill could have an
immediate impact on Canadian companies with interests in Cuban
mines and beach resorts, according to today's Globe and Mail
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Canadian Trade Minister Arthur Eggleton said the
proposed U.S. bill was "objectionable" and Canada was "very
disappointed in this action that they've taken, which impacts
Canadians and other countries."
</P>
<P>
Eggleton said he would raise the issue in talks Sunday and
Monday with U.S. government officials in Washington. The U.S. was
"overreacting" following the downing of two U.S. aircraft by Cuba
Saturday, he added.
</P>
<P>
Canada is particular concerned about a section of the proposed
law that would allow Cuban-born Americans to sue foreign companies
in U.S. courts if the companies are found to be "exploiting
property expropriated from those citizens by the Cuban
government."
</P>
<P>
It also objects to a provision that would deny entry visas into
the United States for individuals "trafficking" in "confiscated
property" located in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"It is not right for them to take this kind of action" against
those doing "lawful business" in Cuba and the United States,
Eggleton said. The denial of visas to Canadians would "violate"
the North American free-trade agreement, he added.
</P>
<P>
Canada had yet to receive the final legal text of the bill and
would decide on its options once the text was known, Eggleton
said.

<HEADLINE> Dublin Assured New IRA Statement on Ulster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Irish government said today
that it believed that the Irish Republican Army (IRA) could issue
another statement on the Northern Ireland peace process in the
next few days, according to reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
The Irish government said it had received assurance from the
IRA that its statement issued Thursday refusing to restore its
cease-fire was not the official response to the Anglo-Irish joint
communique which sets June 10 as the date for all-party
negotiations on the future of Ulster.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams had talks with the
IRA's leaders to discuss the possibility to revive the truce, and
leader of the Social Democratic and Labor Party John Hume, who had
played an important role in urging the IRA to announce cease-fire
in 1994, also took part in the talks.
</P>
<P>
The IRA's army council indicated that the Anglo-Irish
communique did not go far enough for an immediate cessation of
violence
</P>
<P>
It also accused the British government of placing preconditions
on all-party negotiations.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major angrily described the initial
response as "pathetic" and "a sick joke."
</P>
<P>
He said the IRA's political wing Sinn Fein would be excluded
from the planned all-party talks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Sinn Fein leaders held a meeting to discuss
their next moves.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Irish Prime Minister John Bruton and his British
counterpart, John Major, both of whom are attending the Euro-Asian
economic summit in Bangkok, were reported to have been discussing
how to restore the damaged Ulster peace process.
</P>
<P>
Bruton has put the onus firmly back on Sinn Fein for reviving
the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Bruton stressed that the conditions put forth by Sinn Fein had
been met and it was now up to them to persuade the IRA.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia Electoral Commission
today extended the voter registration period for another two
weeks due to public demand.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here, the commission's public liaison
officer Joe Sikazwe said the extension which would start from
March 2 would end on March 15.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1.68 million people had registered as voters by
February 9, representing 37 percent of the eligible voters in the
country, Sikazwe said.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to all eligible Zambians to take advantage of the
extension to register.
</P>
<P>
The registration, which started on december 12 last year,
has been extended three times due to low turn-out.
</P>
<P>
It is one of preparatory measures for the general elections
to be held late this year.

<HEADLINE> More Commitment On AIDS Urged In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 1 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwean deputy minister today
urged more government commitments to the prevention and
management of the incurable AIDS epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a civil service workshop on national code of
practice on AIDS and employment in Harare, Alois Mangwende,
Deputy Minister for Public Service, Labor and Social Welfare,
said, ''one key step towards prevention and management of the
impact of AIDS at the work-place is to develop a code of
practice.''
</P>
<P>
The government, employers and workers in Zimbabwe have
recognized that AIDS has posed a serious challenge to production,
income and industrial relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The one-day workshop's objective was to discuss the draft on
the national code of practice on AIDS and employment, which aims
at ensuring that employers and employees with Hiv and AIDS are
not discriminated against.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, like most other countries, does not have laws
specifically covering employment-related aids issues.
</P>
<P>
An estimated one million Zimbabweans are infected with Hiv in
a country of about 10.5 million people. About 300 people are said
to die of AIDS every week. enditem

<HEADLINE> (Repeat with some changes according to PTI) hke030149 -- India's CBI to Act Independently in Hawala Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Supreme Court today
directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) not to take any
instructions from any authority personally interested in or likely
to be affected by the outcome of investigations into the sensitive
hawala bribery case.
</P>
<P>
According to the Press Trust of India (PTI), the court made the
direction on an application drawing the court's attention to news
reports that Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao had personally
cleared the names of those people who had been charged at a
meeting with CBI Director Vijaya Rama Rao on January 2, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The apex court ordered the CBI not to take any instructions or
furnish any particulars to any authority personally interested in
or likely to be affected by the outcome of the investigations into
any accusations in the hawala case.
</P>
<P>
The court made it clear that this direction will apply even in
relation to any authority who exercised administrative control
over the CBI without any exception.
</P>
<P>
It said it was passing this direction in order to eliminate any
"impression of bias and also to avoid possible erosion of
credibility of the ongoing investigations in the case and any
reasonable impression of lack of fairness and objectivity in the
probe."
</P>
<P>
The hawala case is an 18-million-U.S.-dollar bribery scandal in
which some leading Indian politicians were accused of receiving
money from illegal foreign exchange dealers (hawala dealers).

<HEADLINE> Soft Drink War Expected to Intensify in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The soft drink war in Indonesia is
expected to intensify this year, with Coca Cola and Pepsi Cola
competing to attract as many drinkers of soda as possible.
</P>
<P>
Coca cola and Pepsi are two leading soft drink manufacturers in
the United States which have penetrated into foreign countries all
over the world.
</P>
<P>
After spending a lot of time last year on research on
understanding the needs of consumers, Pepsi considers 1996 as its
true beginning, according to sources from the Indonesian Soft
Drinks Manufacturers Association here today.
</P>
<P>
Coca cola, however, seems undisturbed with the challenge,
saying that it is always ready to compete as competition is part
of its business life.
</P>
<P>
Coca Cola products have been available in Indonesia for more
than 64 years. And the presence of Pepsi Cola in Indonesia has
been on and off since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Pt Pepsi Cola Indobeverages, the Pepsi company in Indonesia,
invested some 17 million US dollars in two bottling plants in
Semarang, Central Java, and in Cikampek, West Java.
</P>
<P>
Pepsi will increase the capacity of its two bottling plants to
624 million bottles in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Coca Cola, on the other hand, has 11 bottling plants in 11
cities across the country, with a combined capacity of 7,300
bottles and 1,050 cans per minute.
</P>
<P>
Coca Cola has invested more than 200 million US dollars in
Indonesia to support its production facilities, including bottling
facilities, wastewater treatment, distribution systems and
marketing equipment.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Coca Cola sold 4.07 million bottles per day, up from
3.5 million bottles per day in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Coca Cola leads the carbonated soft drink market
with a 85 percent share of sales, compared to Pepsi's less than 10
percent share.
</P>
<P>
They focus on expanding the market as there is tremendous
potential in the soft drink market in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Carbonated beverage consumption in Indonesia is still very low,
compared to consumption in neighboring countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Turkey's two
Center-right parties today came together again to remove obstacles
remained on the way toward a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Following a three-hour meeting with Motherland Party (ANAP)
leader Mesut Yilmaz, True Path Party (DYP) chairwoman and
caretaker Prime Minister Tansu Ciller told a press conference
that their talks have made important headway concerning the
framework of the coalition, divvying up ministries and the
rotating premiership.
</P>
<P>
"We have reached agreement on all issues except some hitches
which we worked on a little more," said Ciller.
</P>
<P>
Mesut Yilmaz, in his turn, said that the "hitches" were some
very detailed issues. "I hope we can deal with them by Sunday,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed to meet again Sunday and their aides
would continue their negotiations on the coalition program and
other detailed issues at weekend.
</P>
<P>
ANAP and DYP, two conservative parties in Turkey, have agreed
to form a coalition government Wednesday after two months of
contacts and disputes.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders and political rivals, Ciller and Yilmaz, faced
with mounting pressure from the center-right wing, in the end
compromised on a system of rotating premiership.
</P>
<P>
Ciller said that she would do whatever she could to prevent
the Islamic Welfare Party (RP), which appeared on top in the
December 24 election but failed to win a simple majority in the
parliament, from coming to power.

JOHANNESBURG, March 1 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today paid a one-day "secret" visit to Swaziland
for talks with King Mswati III on the kingdom's political
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Mandela arrived at Swaziland's Matsapa Airport, 40 kilometres
from the capital Mbabane, at mid-day and was met by the king at a
low key ceremony, the South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the two leaders would discuss the conflict
between the king, who is an executive monarch, and Swaziland's
pro-democracy trade union federation.
</P>
<P>
The president is expected to hold a press briefing on his
meeting with the king on his return to Pretoria later today.
</P>
<P>
In January, an eight-day nationwide strike was called by the
Swazi trade unions to demand the lifting of the ban on political
organisations. The strike brought the kingdom's commercial
twin-cities of Mbabane and Manzini to a complete standstill.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland is the only southern African country in which
political activities are banned by a royal decree in 1973.
</P>
<P>
South Africa maintains contact with Swaziland on many levels
and is willing to assist a democratic transition if asked to do
so, according to the South African Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland is a small land-locked country surrounded by South
Africa and Mozambique.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 1 (Xinhua)-- A total of 127 state-owned
companies in Zambia have been sold to private investors since the
privatization program began three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Debating the privatizatin amendment bill of 1996 at parliament
this morning, Acting Commerce, Trade and Industry Minister Alfeyo
Hambayi said that of the total companies sold, 17 were bought by
Zambian individuals and 20 were sold through a scheme of
management buy-outs.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, management and employees are entitled to buy
all shares of a state-owned company on favorable terms.
</P>
<P>
The process of privatizing state-owned companies had generally
been successful and great strides had been made to empower
zambians economically, Hambayi noted.
</P>
<P>
The amendment bill provides for penalties for any breach of
oath of secrecy which was not provided for in the existing
privatization act.
</P>
<P>
It also empowers the privatization agnecy to appoint a
receiver for a state-owned company facing legal action from

<HEADLINE> Spokesman: Cyprus' Sovereignty not Negotiable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government has
reiterated its position that the sovereignty of the state of
Cyprus is one and indivisible and cannot be negotiated.
</P>
<P>
The position was expressed by government spokesman Yiannakis
Cassoulides today while commenting on U.S. President Bill
Clinton's statement that "the international identity of the state
(Cyprus), its sovereignty, and security issues such as
demilitarization, are among the key matters to be negotiated."
</P>
<P>
Clinton expressed this position in a response to a letter by
Philip Christopher, president of the International Coordinating
Committee - Justice for Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman considered "positive" Clinton's position
on one international identity and sovereignty of the state of
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He said he could not stop the U.S. president from considering
the issues which the Turkish side raises as mattes of negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides pointed out that the Greek Cypriot side is willing
to discuss the powers and functions of the federal government and
federal cantons.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Clinton's statement that the serious pursuit of
peace "demands from all involved the courage to make
compromises," the spokesman said the compromises already made by
the Greek Cypriot side place it in a position to have certain
demands in future negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since Turkish military intervention in
1974. The U.N.-sponsored peace talks aimed at reuniting the
island under a bizonal and bicommunal federal state have so far
achieved no tangible results for the past 21 years.

<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to undertake
affordable housing projects in 88 cities this year, 27 more than
last year, said a senior government official here today.
</P>
<P>
Li Tieying, head of the Housing System Reform Office under the
State Council, said that China plans to invest 12.55 billion yuan
(about 1.5 billion US dollars) in building houses covering a
combined floor space of 14 million square meters for the projects
this year.
</P>
<P>
Li, also a Politburo member of the Chinese Communist Party
Central Committee and a state councilor, was speaking at a
national telephone conference on the undertaking of the projects
here today.
</P>
<P>
China officially started such housing projects in 1995, aiming
at reforming the housing system and providing moderately-priced
houses for low and medium-income citizens.
</P>
<P>
Last year construction of such affordable houses covering 15.69
million square meters started, two million more than planned.
</P>
<P>
Among them, 8.18 million square meters have been completed,
providing new apartments for 620,000 needy households.
</P>
<P>
"Governments at all levels should exert themselves in
implementing these projects so as to promote the reform of the
housing system and speed up housing construction," Li said.
</P>
<P>
The senior official urged the 88 cities to set up mortgage
systems for individuals to purchase houses, work out property
management methods and guarantee the supply of affordable houses
to low and medium-income households.
</P>
<P>
He also called for sufficient funds to be properly allocated
for the projects and attention to the construction quality.

<TEXT>
<P>
He stressed that it is a matter of urgency, and of overall and
far-reaching importance to strengthen ideological and political
construction in the leading groups and make leading officials
ideologically and politically better qualified.
</P>
<P>
The ideology of the whole Party, leading officials in
particular, must be further unified on the basis of the basic
theory and the basic line of the Party, Hu said. He called on them
to keep sober minds, be united and work hard to achieve the lofty
goals set by the central authorities for the Ninth Five-year Plan
(1996-2000) and the early period of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Underlining the importance of heeding politics, Hu, who is also
president of the Party School, said that leading officials,
especially senior leaders, must always uphold a correct political
orientation and unswervingly advance along the road of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Hu also called on senior officials to take the
lead in observing Party discipline and be firm in the fight

<HEADLINE> China Marks Dong Biwu's 110th Birth Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin, general secretary of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, today called
on the whole nation to learn from Dong Biwu, one of the earliest
leaders of the CPC and one of the founders of the People's
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the call at a meeting sponsored by the Party
Literature Research Center of the CPC and the Supreme People's
Court at the Great Hall of the People, in memory of the 110th
anniversary of the birth of Dong Biwu, which falls March 5.
</P>
<P>
A large pictorial album containing 360 pictures of Dong and
reproductions of a dozen of his calligraphic works was published
today nationwide. Some of the pictures were published for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
In a 2,700-word speech, Jiang, who is also the Chinese
president, recalled Dong's more than 60 years of political life,
hailing him as "an excellent proletarian revolutionary, Marxist
statesman and legal scholar".
</P>
<P>
Dong took part in the Revolution of 1911, the Chinese bourgeois
democratic revolution led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, which overthrew the
Qing Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Under the influence of the Russian October Revolution (1917)
and China's May 4th Movement of 1919, Dong completed his
fundamental transformation from a radical democrat to a communist,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Dong was firm in revolution, loyal to the CPC and people, and
earnestly studied Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong thought. "His
firm belief in Marxism and his enthusiasm for study are examples
for all of our comrades to follow," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the period of the democratic revolution, Dong was in charge
of political and legal work in revolutionary base areas and did a
great deal of work for education.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of New China in 1949, Dong served as
vice-premier, and president of the Supreme People's Court,
vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, vice-president and acting president of
China and a Politburo member of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 people, including senior Party and state leaders
Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji and Hu Jintao, also attended
today's meeting.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cyprus Leader Admits Missing Greek Cypriots Murdered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash admitted today for the first time that all Greek
Cypriots, listed as missing since the 1974 Turkish invasion, have
been murdered by members of Turkish Cypriot paramilitary
organizations.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement in an interview with a Greek Cypriot
private television network "Sigma TV," to be aired tonight,
extracts of which were reported in the local press today.
</P>
<P>
Denktash said the murders were carried out by the Turkish
Cypriots who had lost their family members in the past.
</P>
<P>
He explained that as the Turkish army advanced, during the
invasion, Greek Cypriots were being detained and handed over to
guerrilla fighters.
</P>
<P>
The detainees were killed instead of being led to a police
station or an army detention camp, Denktash said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,619 persons are listed as missing since the
Turkish invasion but so far not a single case has been resolved.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides said about 120 of
the missing are considered to be dead, following a thorough
examination of their files.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Denktash's statement, government spokesman
Yiannakis Cassoulides described it as "an interesting admission,
made for the first time," and questioned the responsibility the
Turkish Cypriot leader and the commander of the Turkish army have
on this matter.
</P>
<P>
He said "Denktash' statement that prisoners of war were
executed in cold blood violates the Geneva Convention on the
treatment of prisoners of war."
</P>
<P>
The question of bringing Denktash to justice on the issue of
the missing, following his admission, "remains open," he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that Turkish troops, who arrested
prisoners of war, have the responsibility, arising from the
Geneva Convention, to hand them over safe and sound to the
international red cross at the end of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides reiterated the government's demand that the fate
of each person listed as missing should be ascertained and
evidence about his or her whereabouts should be provided.

HARARE, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's water dams are over
half full with the overall situation of water supply yet to be
improved in the current rainy season.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's department of water development sources said today

Municipalities like the capital Harare and the second largest
city Bulawayo have announced that they would maintain water
rationing, which was imposed last year because of the short

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Urges Prominence to Boosting  Economic Cooperation (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng, in a
keynote speech to the first Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) here today,
called for prominence to promoting economic growth and cooperation
in exploring ways to create a new Asia-Europe partnership.
</P>
<P>
The ASEM, intended to establish a new partnership between Asia
and Europe based on the promotion of cooperation in economic,
political and other fields, opened here today with the
participation of top leaders from 25 Asian and European countries.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Li said that given the increasingly important
role of economic factors in international relations today, all
countries are giving priority to promoting the growth of their
national economies.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, in discussing Asia-Europe cooperation, "we should
give prominence to economic issues which serve as an important
basis for the Asia-Europe partnership," the Chinese premier said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng then expounded the following measures
which he proposed priority should be given in order to "see the
reaching of consensus on a wide range of issues related with
economic cooperation during the current ASEM":
</P>
<P>
-- "To make common efforts in countering trade protectionism,
eliminating trade discrimination, opposing the imposition of trade
sanctions, and promoting trade development:
</P>
<P>
"In this sense, the WTO should become a genuinely universal,
open and complete world trade body. Without the participation of
China which has one-fifth of the world's total population, the WTO
would be incomplete.
</P>
<P>
-- "To give new impetus to mutual investment:
</P>
<P>
"The growing economy in Asian countries has provided a huge
market for external investment. In particular, investment in the
construction of infrastructure facilities enjoys a broad prospect.
</P>
<P>
"However, European investment in Asia has by far been less than
that from other regions. I suggest that an ad hoc expert group be
set up to study the current status of investment between Asia and
Europe, and its perspective, work out measures to be taken, and
submit a report on the study.
</P>
<P>
-- "To enhance technical exchanges and cooperation:
</P>
<P>
"In promoting technical cooperation and technology transfer,
priority should be given to advanced agricultural technology,
environmental protection technology and technical transformation
and renovation of enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"I would also propose to set up an ad hoc expert group to study
this issue specifically and recommend actions to be taken.
</P>
<P>
-- "To promote cooperation among small and medium-sized
enterprises while continuing to intensify cooperation among big
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
-- "And, to lay emphasis on the development of human resources:
</P>
<P>
"Efforts in this regard may include assistance to
poverty-stricken areas in mastering the technological know-how
needed for production and development, and the promotion of
cooperation in conducting educational exchanges and occupational
training."
</P>
<P>
Li Peng also said that Asia and Europe should expand and
increase political dialogue in the interest of better mutual
understanding and trust.
</P>
<P>
"We on our part would like to see progress in EU integration
and to see EU remain independent and demonstrate openness," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier also gave an account of China's efforts to
restructure the economy in recent years and voiced the Chinese
government's determination to continue the policy of reform and
opening to the outside world.

<HEADLINE> Sea Level off Shanghai Rises Fastest: Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have found
that the relative sea level off this, China's largest metropolis,
will be 53 cm higher in the year 2050 than it is today.
</P>
<P>
A study project by the Shanghai Observatory of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences shows that the relative sea level here will
rise by 29 cm, 42 cm and 53 cm in the years 2010, 2030 and
2050, respectively, as compared with that of today.
</P>
<P>
Major factors behind the rise of the sea level are the increase
of sea water and land subsidence caused by economic construction
and development projects and the dissolving of ice and snow at the
north and south poles, according to Prof. Zheng
Dawei, leader of the study project.
</P>
<P>
The findings were made after two years' research by using new
space observatory techniques, including Topex and Very Long Base
Line (VLBL), and through analyzing the data from 1,500 tidal
monitoring stations all over the world, Professor Zheng Dawei said.
</P>
<P>
Their study also found that the crust of the Sheshan VLBL
station of the Shanghai Observatory sinks one mm every year, and
the annual rise of the global sea level in 1993-1994 was 2.9
mm and that of the East China Sea, 3.9 mm annually.
</P>
<P>
The rise of the sea level will lead to more frequent and more
intensive oceanic disasters and other calamities, Zheng predicted.
</P>
<P>
At present, a large group of local scientists is working to
study the effects of the rise of the sea level on the city and
find out ways to deal with its adverse effects, said Zheng.

<HEADLINE> Siege of Sarajevo Officially Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serbs' four-year
siege of Sarajevo has officially ended after Muslim-Croat police
entered a second Serb-held Sarajevo suburb, a spokesman for
international High Representative Carl Bildt said today.
</P>
<P>
"The siege of Sarajevo is officially over...the world will
neither forget what was done to Sarajevo nor the heroic resistance
of its citizens," Colum Murphy said in a statement marking the
fourth anniversary of Bosnia's Independence Day.
</P>
<P>
Muslim-Croat police Thursday entered Ilijas, the second of the
five Serb-held Sarajevo suburbs due to revert to Muslim-Croat
control under the terms of the Dayton peace accord. Ilijas's
handover officially marked the end of siege because a main land
route linking Sarajevo with the outside world runs through the
area.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serb forces began their siege of the Bosnian capital in
April, 1992, at the beginning of the brutal ethnic war which was
finally ended last November.
</P>
<P>
"Terrible and great things happened in this city over the last
few years. What the international community gave to the city
was vital. But what the city gave to the world was even greater,"
Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
During the prolonged Serb siege, more than 10,000 Sarajevans
were killed and 50,000, mainly Muslims, were injured.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Urges New Concepts on Asia-Europe  Partnership (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng, in a
keynote speech at the first Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) here today,
called for new concepts on establishing a new partnership between
Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
The ASEM, a historic initiative intended to establish a new
inter-regional partnership based on promoting cooperation in
economic, political and other fields, opened here today with the
participation of leaders from 25 Asian and European countries.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the Chinese premier said that the creation of a
new Asia-Europe partnership requires the formulation of new
concepts and new methods.
</P>
<P>
"Reviewing the historical experience and looking into the
future, I believe that a new partnership between Asia and Europe
should be of the following features," he said.
</P>
<P>
Following are part of the speech which deals with the five
features.
</P>
<P>
"Firstly, to respect one another and treat one another as
equals:
</P>
<P>
"Fundamentally different from the unequal relations in the
colonial years or the confrontational ones in the Cold War era,
the new partnership that we are to build should be based on the
principles for peaceful co-existence.
</P>
<P>
"Asian and European countries, large or small, rich or poor,
strong or weak, are all equal members of the international
community with equal sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"The internal affairs of any country can only be managed by its
own people and no country should be allowed to capitalize on its
own power to encroach upon other countries' sovereignty and
interfere in their internal affairs under any pretext.
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, to seek common ground while reserving differences
and draw upon one another's experience:
</P>
<P>
"Asia and Europe have different cultural traditions, religious
beliefs and customs and are at different stages of economic and
social development.
</P>
<P>
"Their disparity has come about as a product of history and
will continue to exist for a long time to come.
</P>
<P>
"It is therefore not advisable to identify Europe with Asia or
vice versa.
</P>
<P>
"Even countries within Asia or Europe differ from one another,
and their differences reflect the very diversity of the world. No
nation should think itself head and shoulders above others or
impose upon them its social system, values, development model or
way of life.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, each nation has its own strong and weak points and
ought to learn from one another to make up for its deficiencies,
for that is the only way to facilitate common development and
progress.
</P>
<P>
"Thirdly, to enhance mutual understanding and trust:
</P>
<P>
"Owing to historical and practical reasons, it is inevitable
that countries in Asia and Europe have different views or even get
into disputes with one another.
</P>
<P>
"What is important is how to handle differences when they
arise. The best way is to increase contacts, treat one another
with every sincerity, conduct consultations on an equal footing,
enhance common understanding, dispel misgivings, expand common
ground and build up confidence, instead of making unwarranted
accusations, imposing one's own views on others.
</P>
<P>
"Fourthly, to seek mutual benefit and mutual complementarity:
</P>
<P>
"All countries in these two continents have their own strong
points and advantages. The industrial revolution once drastically
changed the world economy and the outlook of society.
</P>
<P>
"Today, Europe is one of the economically developed,
scientifically and technologically advanced and financially strong
regions in the world. Whereas the Asian peoples are known for
their diligence and industry.
</P>
<P>
"Many Asian countries and regions have, for more than a decade,
maintained a vigorous and dynamic economic development.
</P>
<P>
"The rise of Asia has added new vitality to world economy and
opened a huge market for international trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
"If Asian and European countries can join hands and complement
one another with their respective advantages, they will not only
be able to bring benefits to their own peoples in new areas, but
also to meet any challenge in the world.
</P>
<P>
"And fifthly, to look into the future and work for common
development:
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation between Asia and Europe holds out a broad
prospect. One should not only keep in mind one's immediate
interests, but also and, more importantly, have one's eyes on the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
"To build a new partnership between the two continents is by no
means an expediency. It is in the shared interests of both Asia
and Europe to keep with the spirit of the times, seize the
historical opportunity and translate potential opportunities into
reality.
</P>
<P>
"To achieve that will prove to the world that countries with
different cultural traditions and at different development levels
can treat one another as equals and conduct mutually beneficial
cooperation, each shinning its own splendor in a diverse world,
but thriving together."

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Airlines to Face Tough Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's domestic airlines will
face tough competition from foreign airlines, which the government
has invited to increase operation in the country in anticipation
of growing tourism by 2005, the Indonesian National Air Carriers
Association said in a release today.
</P>
<P>
The release cited the low rate of on-time schedules and aging
fleets as two major weak points of the domestic airlines.
</P>
<P>
Overseas airlines generally use new aircraft while many of them
have successfully controlled the rate of delayed and canceled
flights, said the release.
</P>
<P>
Several foreign airlines, including Australia's Ansett,
Holland's KLM, British Airways, Germany's Lufthansa, Japan
Airlines and Hong Kong's Dragon Air, have been invited to serve
more destinations in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia now has six scheduled domestic airlines -- Sempati
Air, Garuda Indonesia, Merpati Nusantara Airlines, Mandala
Airlines, Bouraq Airlines and Dirgantara Air Service.
</P>
<P>
Garuda, the country's only flag carrier, serves 35
international destinations and operates 60 aircraft. Three Boeing
747-400s are the newest members of Garuda's fleet.
</P>
<P>
Domestic airlines have financial difficulties in procuring new
aircraft, said the release.
</P>
<P>
The government has agreed to permit all the scheduled domestic
airlines, except Dirgantara, to fly international routes in 1998.
The overseas routes opened to the domestic airlines include
countries in Europe, Africa, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific
region.

<HEADLINE> "Science, Technology Needed to Improve Rural Economy" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- In order to improve the rural
economy on a large scale more efforts are needed to apply science
and technology to agriculture.
</P>
<P>
This call was made by State Councillor Song Jian at a symposium
on the "Spark Programme" and the large-scale rural economy here
today.
</P>
<P>
One of the nation's science and technology drives, the "Spark
Programme" was launched ten years ago, aiming to enliven the rural
economy.
</P>
<P>
By 1994 the programme had completed 58,000 projects in a dozen
fields, covering 85 percent of China's cities and counties, and
helped train 20 million professionals for agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
More emphasis should be placed on developing regional pillar
industries and large-scale projects in the rural areas, as well as
support for various technical associations, urged Song Jian.
</P>
<P>
Strengthening technical co-operation with foreign countries is
considered important in tackling technical problems in order to
provide technical services for agricultural production.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Seeks Funds for Repatriation of Liberian Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is appealing for 60 million
U.S. dollars Friday for the voluntary repatriation of up to 739,000
Liberian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. humanitarian agency needs 39 million dollars this year
and 21 million in the first half of 1997 to cover the cost of
transportation, food, tents and other necessities for the
return of the Liberian refugees, who fled their homes after
civil war broke out in December, 1989.
</P>
<P>
The agency's appeal has been prompted by the return of large
numbers of refugees following the signing of a peace agreement
last August in the tiny west African country of 2.5 million people.
</P>
<P>
It says a growing influx of refugees, about 30,000 of whom have
returned since August, would cause chaos without adequate funding.
</P>
<P>
Liberian authorities said the refugees have returned
spontaneously from border areas of Cote d'Ivoire and Guinea,
mostly within the past two months.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR said that lack of funds and sporadic fighting in Liberia
have prevented it from helping the repatriation of some 739,000
refugees - 410,000 from Guinea, 305,800 from Cote d'Ivoire, 15,000
from Ghana and the rest from Nigeria and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
About 150,000 people were killed and one million made homeless
during the six-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that organized repatriation of refugees would
also depend on the deployment of West African peacekeepers
throughout Liberia, disarmament and demobilization of troops, and
the central government taking back control of the country.

<HEADLINE> HK Shipping Industry Expects Good Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will continue to keep
its position as a world shipping center despite challenges from
other ports in the Asia-Pacific Region, said Li Yinfei, General
Manager of the China Merchants Holdings( Hong Kong) Co.Ltd, here
today.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed his confidence here today that Hong Kong's
shipping industry, backed by its good performance over the past
year, will have a bright future.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in a luncheon speech to mark the fourth
anniversary of the starting of shipment pages in the Ta Kung Pao,
a local Chinese newspaper with a history of 94 years.
</P>
<P>
Li, whose company has a fleet of vessels with a total tonnage
of four million, said competitions are keen in the Far East
region, where the shipping industry is most vibrant.
</P>
<P>
A number of ports, including four leading container terminals
in the world -- Hong Kong, Singapore, Kaohsiong and Kobe are vying
 for the position as an international or a regional shipping hub,
Li told the Hong Kong business circles.
</P>
<P>
Newly emerging stars such as Shanghai and those on the Pearl
River Delta in South China are also contenders from behind.
</P>
<P>
The general manager brushed aside the worry that Shanghai will
become a potential competitor with Hong Kong. "The fast economic
growth in China will make a big cake for shipping industry, which
can not be swallowed by one port no matter how large it is," Li
said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Shanghai will take the East China as its
heartland, while Hong Kong will continue to be a pivotal harbor
backed by the South China area, where many small and medium-sized
ports play a supplementary role.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of competitions from Singapore, Li reviewed the
performance of both Hong Kong and the state city.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong handled more than 10 million Twenty
Foot-Equivalent-Unit (TEU) containers during the January-October
period of 1995, up 14 percent from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Singapore, though growing at the same rate of 14 percent,
handled 9.81 million TEU containers in the first 10 months of
1995.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the year, Hong Kong is likely to handle 12.6 million
 containers, making it the world No. 1 container terminal for the
fourth time; while Singapore's figure for the year is estimated to
 be 11.8 million, 800,000 fewer than Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The territory currently is capable of handling about one 10th
of the total containers in the world.
</P>
<P>
As shown by statistics, Li said that Hong Kong's position as a
world shipping hub remains unchanged. The seaborne capacity of the
 port reached 94.74 million tonnage in the first three quarters of
 1995, registering an increase of 15.7 percent over the previous
corresponding period. The total handling capacity, with the inland
 river throughput added, is expected to hit 160 million tonnage
last year.
</P>
<P>
The transshipment capacity also saw a fast growth rate of 16
percent in the first nine months of 1995, to nearly 25 million
tonnage.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Sets up Special Team to Curb Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
established a special monitoring team to curb the sharp growth in
imports.
</P>
<P>
The team, headed by Coordinating Minister for Economy and
Finance Saleh Afiff, would closely monitor the spending of
government and state-owned companies on imports.
</P>
<P>
Emil said Thursday that the government has spent trillions of
rupiah in the past few years importing construction materials for
office building projects. And state-owned companies also spent a
large amount of money on imports.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the team also reflects the government's
desire to tackle the country's growing current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance Mar'ie Mohammed earlier estimated that the
current account deficit would rise to 7.9 billion US dollars in
the current fiscal year from an estimated 3.49 billion US dollars
in the previous year due to the higher growth in imports than
exports.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Indonesia's imports grew 32.4 percent
during the January-September period of last year with imports of
consumer goods rising 70.9 percent.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Seeks 353 Million Dollars for Bosnian Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has appealed for 353 million
U.S. dollars for its 1996 operation in ex-Yugoslavia, focusing on
the return of more than 800,000 refugees and internally displaced
persons (IDPs).
</P>
<P>
The money is part of an 823-million-dollar appeal launched by 11
agencies through the 1996 U.N. Consolidated Inter-Agency
Appeal for the region.
</P>
<P>
Programs in Bosnia-Herzegovina will make up nearly 197 million
dollars of UNHCR's 1996 budget. The agency is planning to phase
out emergency assistance for the 2.4 million current
beneficiaries within the republic and to divert funds mainly to
the return and relocation of refugees and IDPs. Just under 110
million dollars is planned for shelter, water and sanitation and
92 million for the provision of domestic items for returnees and
war-affected people.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton peace agreement, UNHCR is responsible for the
return of refugees and IDPs in Bosnia-Herzegovina, an operation
expected to begin in earnest this spring.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 40,000 people have already returned to or been
relocated in Bosnia-Herzegovina since the signing of the peace
accord last December. UNHCR is expecting the return of 830,000
refugees and displaced people in 1996.
</P>
<P>
They would include up to half of the estimated 1 million IDPs,
170,000 Bosnian refugees from neighboring republics, and 200,000
from among the estimated 700,000 Bosnian refugees in some 25 other
countries outside the region, mainly in Europe.
</P>
<P>
According to UNHCR, many of these people will want to return to
villages lacking adequate infrastructure, shelter and employment
opportunities, making it necessary to continue some relief
assistance during the settling-in and reconstruction period.
</P>
<P>
Soren Jessen-Petersen, UNHCR's Sarajevo-based Special Envoy for
the region, said that the agency will place particular importance
on efforts aimed at building confidence among the population.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, there have been problems in places like
Mostar, Bugojno and Sarajevo, where thousands of Serb residents
have recently fled suburbs that are coming under the Bosnian
government control.
</P>
<P>
He noted that UNHCR has set up a presence in all Serb suburbs
and is trying to bolster confidence among those Serbs who remain.
</P>
<P>
"We are extremely concerned about the departure of Serbs from
three suburbs of Sarajevo. UNHCR believes everything possible
should be done to prevent a sudden exodus from the two remaining
Serbs suburbs," Jessen-Petersen was quoted as saying in the press
release.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR meanwhile acknowledges that "a large number of persons
will never return voluntarily to their areas of original
residence, especially where they would be among a small and
vulnerable minority population."
</P>
<P>
It added that details of its operational plan for the refugee
return to Bosnia-Herzegovina will be discussed by governments,
agencies and the parties to the Dayton accord at a March 8 meeting
in Oslo, hosted by the Norwegian government.

<HEADLINE> Britain's Trade Deficit Drops in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Britain's trade deficit narrowed
slightly to 557 million pounds (852 million U.S. dollars) in
December from November's 574 million pounds (878 million US
dollars), in an unexpectedly "encouraging" result.
</P>
<P>
A surprise trade surplus with European Union (EU), the first
since August 1993, contributed to the better-than-expected
figures, the Central Statistical Office (CSO) reported.
</P>
<P>
Britain achieved a trade surplus with the EU of 56 million
pounds (86 million dollars) in December, following a deficit of
118 million pounds (181 million dollars) in November.
</P>
<P>
However, the deficit with non-EU countries widened by a third to
613 million pounds (938 million US dollars) in December from 456
million pounds (698 million US dollars) in November.
</P>
<P>
UK economists say the trade surplus with the EU is encouraging,
but they are concerned that the surplus resulted from falling
imports outpacing shrinking exports, rather than from improved
performance by British firms.
</P>
<P>
The figures pushed Britain's deficit for 1995 to 11.6 billion
pounds (17.7 billion dollars), slightly up from 1994's deficit of
10.8 billion pounds (16.5 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Economists expect the visible deficit to "widen gently" in 1996
as economic growth in Britain's key export markets, such as
American countries, slows down and their appetite for British
goods deteriorates.

<HEADLINE> China's First Civil Aviation Law Takes Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- China's first civil aviation law
took effect today.
</P>
<P>
Publicity activities were held at all the major airports and
ticket centers and even on flights to promote the understanding of
the law by the general public.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the world's fastest-expanding civil aviation
markets. Over 51 million Chinese travelled by air in 1995, more
than doubling the figure for 1990.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the total air freight was 7.1 billion ton/km, the 11th
largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese authorities started to work on the civil aviation
law in early 1980s, to meet the demands of the growing civil
aviation market.
</P>
<P>
The Law was passed on October 30, 1995, at the 16th meeting of
the Standing Committee of the 8th National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zhizhong, head of the Department of Transport Management
of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), said the
civil aviation law matches the international laws, as many of its
provisions are directly taken from the international pacts that
China has signed.
</P>
<P>
CAAC Director Chen Guangyi called the law a milestone in the
civil aviation history of China, saying that it marks the
beginning of a process during which the government's
administration of civil aviation industry will be more scientific
and rely more on legal than administrative measures.
</P>
<P>
Chen said China aims at establishing a complete civil aviation
legal system that not only meets the development of China's
socialist market economy but also conforms with international laws
and practices over the next 15 years.

<HEADLINE> Fujian Police Cracking Down on Taiwan Drug Traffickers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Police in east China's Fujian
Province cracked 19 drug cases in 1995, involving trafficking and
processing by Taiwan residents, police said.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Provincial Public Security Department said
that police arrested 38 Taiwan drug traffickers, and confiscated
700 kg of "ice", a kind of heroin derivative, and three kg of
heroin.
</P>
<P>
In January 1995, police discovered that drug traffickers from
Taiwan had set up a large underground "ice" lab in Fuzhou, capital
of the province.
</P>
<P>
Following further investigations, police officers raided five
"ice" labs in Fuzhou, Fuqing and Minhou cities in June 1995,
confiscating five kg of "ice".
</P>
<P>
Police have also tightened control over shipping sailing in
coastal areas, and inspections at airports has been stepped up.
</P>
<P>
Last year police captured four Taiwan boats carrying "ice."
</P>
<P>
Wu Naisheng, a drug-trafficker from Taiwan, was arrested in
Fuzhou's Yixu Airport last July, for attempting to smuggle 150 g
of heroin out of China.
</P>
<P>
His arrest led to the smashing of a drug trafficking gang, and
the confiscation of over 1,400 g of heroin.

<HEADLINE> HK Public Backs Ban on Tobacco Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Majority of the public support
the Hong Kong government's plan to ban tobacco advertising,
according to an opinion survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey, sponsored by the Health and Welfare Branch, came as
 the branch is drafting legislation which proposes a ban on direct
 and indirect advertising of tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
Principal Assistant Secretary Derek Gould for Health and
Welfare said the results were very gratifying.
</P>
<P>
The survey results, released by the Hong Kong Council on
Smoking and Health (COSH) Thursday, showed that 50 percent
supported a ban on all forms of tobacco advertisements, while 70
percent would support the introduction of a tobacco levy to fund
sports and cultural activities rather than have advertising.
</P>
<P>
According to international cancer prevention experts, tobacco
advertising has been influencing the young. The smoking rates of
Hong Kong youth are believed to be on the rise, with more young
people being initiated into smoking.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found little public support for some of the
arguments put forward by the tobacco industry against a ban on
advertising. Of those contacted by telephone in the survey, 48
percent said a ban would not infringe on freedom of speech and 57
percent thought it would not interfere with the free flow of
information.
</P>
<P>
Professor Anthony Hedley of Department of Community Medicine of
the University of Hong Kong, who supervised the phone survey of
1,100 Chinese-speaking respondents, said a majority support the
government proposals.
</P>
<P>
Between 70 and 74 percent of those asked thought tobacco
advertisements had led young people into being curious about
smoking or encouraged them to have a try.
</P>
<P>
But the tobacco industry thinks the other way. "Advertising
does not increase cigarette consumption," said Robert Fletcher,
chairman of the Tobacco Institute, in a statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, in many countries where tobacco advertising has been
severely restricted or banned, consumption has actually
increased," he added.

<HEADLINE> China to Ban State Enterprises from Futures Speculation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- China will ban state enterprises
from futures speculation in a bid to standardize the regulation of
China's fledgling futures market.
</P>
<P>
Wholly or partly state-owned enterprises and administrative
units will only be allowed to get involved in futures hedging
activities relevant to their production and operation, says a
notice jointly released today by the Securities Committee under
the State Council and the China Securities Regulatory Commission.
</P>
<P>
"They are forbidden from getting involved in either
speculations or market manipulation," says the notice.
</P>
<P>
China's futures market have been standardised in the past two
years, but some problems, such as excessive speculations and
market manipulation, still stem healthy growth in the market.
</P>
<P>
The state enterprises and administrative units should provide
documents approved by futures administrations, or board of
directors to futures exchanges, or brokerages, before taking
hedging positions.
</P>
<P>
"Futures exchanges should not accept those state firms and
administrative units without relevant documents, and futures
brokerages should not trade for them either," says the notice.
</P>
<P>
The futures exchanges and brokerages face fines, or a forced
suspension of operations if the China Securities Regulatory
Commission (CSRC), China's securities and futures watchdog, finds
they have acted against the notice.
</P>
<P>
CSRC will investigate and affix responsibilities of leading
officials with state firms, and administrative units which conduct
futures trading without proper approval, or get involved in
futures speculation.
</P>
<P>
The notice stipulates that all financial institutions are
forbidden from conducting commodities futures trading, whether for
themselves or for their clients.
</P>
<P>
Those financial institutions trading on their own books are
required to clear their positions within 40 trading days after
March 4. Those acting as futures agents should not accept new
clients after March 4, and should clear all positions for their
clients, or transfer the positions to other futures brokerages
within 40 trading days after March 4.
</P>
<P>
After clearing all their futures positions, those institutions
should be deprived of their memberships in the futures brokerages.
</P>
<P>
The notice points out that no financial institutions can offer
letters of guarantee for futures trading, and loans and funds
raised are forbidden from being used in futures trading.
</P>
<P>
Financial institutions are urged to improve supervision to
prevent loans from flowing into futures markets, and no futures
brokerages will be allowed to trade on their own books.
</P>
<P>
"Those futures brokerages trading on their own books should
clear all the positions they build for themselves within 40
trading days after March 4," says the notice.
</P>
<P>
CSRC will punish the brokerages who continue to trade on their
own books.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Aims to Eliminate Illiteracy by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has set a plan to basically
eliminate illiteracy in the country and offer universal primary
education to all children by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The National Anti-Illiteracy Commission announced the plan at a
meeting earlier this week, local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The plan said efforts should be made to ensure pre-school
education for all children under five, eliminate illiteracy among
adults aged between 15 and 35 and reduce illiteracy among over 35s.
</P>
<P>
The commission said progress in education had been made over
the last few years, with nearly 1.8 million school dropouts
persuaded to return to school and over 600,000 adults given
literacy courses in the 1991-95 period.
</P>
<P>
But the country still faces a major illiteracy problem.
</P>
<P>
Of the 53 provinces and municipalities, only 14 have met the
country's standards on illiteracy elimination and universal
primary education.

LONDON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Malcolm
Rifkind promised Thursday that the forthcoming White Paper on
Britain's stance on the future of the European Union (EU) will not

</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of the all-party European Movement,
Rifkind said the White Paper, due to be published on March 11,
would put forward specific proposals on improving EU institutions
for discussion at the Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC) in
Turin, Italy on March 29.
</P>
<P>
He said the Paper, which is "mature and temperate, not bland,"
would be a constructive contribution to the IGC conference and a
serious analysis not "hostile to the EU."
</P>
<P>
Britain's wants to bring up proposed changes to the qualified
majority voting system which would limit the rights of veto of
individual EU member states, the secretary said.
</P>
<P>
The Eurosceptics of the ruling Conservative Party have been
demanding the British government veto any extension of qualified
majority voting.
</P>
<P>
The British government decided early this year to publish a
White Paper highlighting the country's views on the IGC conference
which will review the Maastricht Treaty aimed at forging closer
European political and economic integration.

<HEADLINE> Opinion Poll Shows Australian Election Close Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Labor Party and
the Liberal-National Coalition are expected to engage in a close
contest on the day of federal election tomorrow, as indicated by a
public opinion poll today.
</P>
<P>
The Morgan Poll, conducted on the eve of the election, showed
that Labor and the Coalition were running neck by neck in their
supporting rates.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll result released tonight, voters were
evenly divided between the two major political groups, with 50
percent of them supporting each side respectively.
</P>
<P>
But Labor was still behind the Coalition in marginal seats, or
seats that could fall easily into the hands of the rival party.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of voters who have yet to take sides decreased
dramatically on the eve of the election. The poll showed that
only 4 percent of voters were still uncommitted, comparing with
the 11 percent two days ago.
</P>
<P>
This means that the uncertainty of the election's outcome has
been greatly reduced.
</P>
<P>
Poll organizer Gary Morgan predicted that the Coalition would
narrowly win the election.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the contest would be very close tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, Labor is sure to lose seats in New South
Wales and Queensland states, while it may not be able to gain
enough seats in Victoria to offset the losses.
</P>
<P>
Very close contests will be likely in marginal seats in
Victoria, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Now a lot's happened today, so things can always change, we
believe the Liberal-Nation party's set to win but only by a small
majority," he said on a local TV station.

<HEADLINE> Israel Rejects Negotiations With Hamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel today rejected
negotiations with the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement
Hamas, after the group offered Israel a conditional cease-fire
Thursday night, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister Ehud Barak said today that there is no
room for negotiations with "terrorist cells inside the area
controlled by the Palestinian National Authority."
</P>
<P>
"This would in fact exempt the PNA from its main
responsibility in its agreement with Israel," Barak added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres said in
Jerusalem today that Israel will continue to wage a bitter war
against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Peres made remarks at a ceremony to unveil the tombstone of
late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated by a
Jewish extremist on November 4 last year.
</P>
<P>
Hamas and its military wing Izzedine al-Qassam issued a
statement Thursday night, offering Israel a cease-fire in return
for the release of its prisoners, a halt to "organized terrorism
against Hamas and its Qassam Brigades" and "an end to aggression
against Palestinian civilians."
</P>
<P>
The five-point proposal also contained a threat that if Israel
did not respond by 7:00 p.m. local time a week from today, "Qassam
Brigades will be free to take any military action against anyone
in the Jewish state."
</P>
<P>
"We warn the Zionist entity and the General Security Service
against committing terrorist acts," Hamas added in a leaflet issue
in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media pointed out that statement is notable for being
signed by both Hamas and Izzedine Qassam, indicating that they
have reached agreement on goals and strategy.
</P>
<P>
Hamas described its offer as "a golden opportunity for the
Israeli government to rid civilians from both sides of the fear of
war and bloody conflict."
</P>
<P>
Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a senior adviser to PNA President Yasser
Arafat, described the leaflet as "a very important political
statement."
</P>
<P>
He said in Gaza last night that the Hamas proposal "offered the
Israeli government a truce," adding that the dialogue held between
the PNA and Hamas in Cairo had helped.
</P>
<P>
Hamas's proposal came after Israel sealed off the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip, and pressed the PNA to crack down on the
infrastructures of Hamas and Islamic Jihad military wings,
following two suicide bombing attacks Sunday in Jerusalem and
Ashkelon, which left 25 dead and 84 wounded.
</P>
<P>
Hamas had issued a leaflet after the attacks to claim
responsibility for the suicide bombings, saying they were to mark
the second anniversary of Machpela massacre, when a Jewish
extremist shot and killed more than 30 Palestinian
worshipers.

An environment conducive to hi-tech development has been
created preliminarily throughout the country, as a result of the
stepped-up reform of the scientific and technological managerial
system, the introduction of a managerial system compatible with a
market economy, the improvement of a socialized service system and
the introduction of a modern enterprise system.
</P>
<P>
The official said, "Hi-tech development zones are becoming
centers for promoting the growth of high-tech industries,

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China Applies Hi-Tech Findings to Production (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- China has scored great successes
in implementing the "Torch Plan" designed to apply high technology
research findings to production, according to the State Science
and Technology Commission.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Torch Plan Office of the commission said
that during the 1991-95 period, China launched 1,756 Torch Plan
projects at the national level and 4,200 Torch Plan projects at
the local level.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the country earned 181 billion yuan in increased
industrial output value, generated 37.3 billion yuan in profits
and taxes, and exported goods worth 3.35 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The official said that in 1995 alone, Torch Plan projects
scored 84 billion yuan in increased industrial output value,
generated 15.5 billion yuan in profits and taxes, and earned 1.3
billion dollars from exports.
</P>
<P>
The Torch Plan projects began to be undertaken in 110 hi-tech
development zones throughout China in 1988, the official said,
adding that they involve a whole range of areas such as new
materials, biological technology, electronics information, the
integration of machinery and electronics, new energy, energy
conservation and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
He described the establishment of hi-tech development zones as
a "major measure" to implement the Torch Plan.

LAGOS, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and Sudan have jointly
expressed the need to strengthen the Organization of African
Unity's existing organs to deal with conflicts, the local
newspaper Third Eye Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese leader, Lt. General Ahmed El-Bashir, and his
Nigerian counterpart, General Sani Abacha, exchanged views on
bilateral, regional and international issues yesterday in
Nigerian capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
They reaffirmed the need for a concerted action by African

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's inflation rate
has dropped from 29.6 percent in December 1995 to 26.6 percent in
January 1996, a monthly economic Review issued by the Bank of
Tanzania said today.
</P>
<P>
The inflation fall largely resulted from changes in
prices of food items, brought by an improvement in food supply
due to favorable weather conditions during the 1994/95 crop
season.
</P>
<P>
"The January 1996 inflation rate represents an improvement of
8.3 percentage points compared with inflation rate of 34.9
percent recorded in January 1995", the review said.
</P>
<P>
However, there is small increase in prices of water, fuel and
power group items which recorded an increase of 3 percent in
January when compared to an increase of 31.5 percent recorded in
December 1995.
</P>
<P>
Rent is also recorded to have an increase of 2.2 percent
during the month.

<HEADLINE> Bribery-tainted Indian Politicians Get Bail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Almost all the ten Indian
politicians against whom the special court dealing with the 18
million dollar bribery case issued non-bailable warrants Friday
were granted bail by either the court itself or the Delhi High
Court today, the Press Trust of India (PTI) said.
</P>
<P>
Major opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) President L.K.
Advani got an anticipatory bail from the Delhi High Court Friday.
All India Indira Congress leader Arjun Singh and three former
cabinet ministers were also granted bail today.
</P>
<P>
The ten politicians were charged in January by the Central
Bureau of Investigation (CBI) of allegedly receiving money from
illegal foreign exchange traders.
</P>
<P>
The special court took cognizance of the charge sheets against
them Friday and set in motion the trial of these politicians by
issuing warrants to them.
</P>
<P>
According to PTI, BJP President Advani today was released on
bail by the special court after he furnished a bail bond of 5,000
rupees (about 137 US dollars) with a surety of the same amount.
</P>
<P>
Advani, who presented himself before the court along with other
senior leaders of the party, also submitted an application seeking
exemption from personal appearance in the court on hearing dates.
</P>
<P>
In his order, Special Judge V.B. Gupta said Advani was being
exempted from personal appearance on the next date of hearing on
March 12 for the time being.

MANILA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The seven-member Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will promote pioneer projects
through a regional industrial cooperation scheme.
</P>
<P>
Laticia Ibay, a senior official of the Board of Investments of
the Philippines, said today that the grouping would like to
include such projects under the ASEAN industrial cooperation
scheme (AICO) though they do not meet the minimum 30 percent
national equity requirements.
</P>
<P>
A waiver has also been proposed for ongoing projects under the
ASEAN industrial joint venture and the brand-to-brand
complementation scheme.
</P>
<P>
Senior ASEAN officials are expected to formally adopt the
proposed waivers at a meeting in Jakarta on March 1-2, Ibay said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Under the AICO, approved by ASEAN leaders during last
December's summit in Bangkok, participants will be given
non-tariff incentives and may import their raw materials and
capital equipment with duties ranging from zero to five percent.
</P>
<P>
The AICO covers cooperative arrangements involving firms from
at least two ASEAN countries and with at least 30 percent national
equity requirements.
</P>

percent up from 134.66 million dollars posted a year ago.

Due to the good quality and reliable furniture products, they

<HEADLINE> Israeli Company Signs Satellite Deal with US Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel Aircraft Industry (IAI)
has formed a joint venture with a U.S. firm with the aim of
operating a commercial imagery satellite by the end of 1997,
Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The move, following two years of negotiations, comes after the
Israeli Defense Ministry set guidelines for IAI to enter the
commercial satellite imagery market.
</P>
<P>
IAI's partner is Core Software Technology of Pasadena,
California, the operator of North American Image Net, which
provides information services and products, including satellite
and aerial imagery, computer and demographic data.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted IAI executives as saying that they will
finance the program on their own, and both the IAI and Core will
now seek partners to manufacture and launch a constellation of
high-resolution remote sensing satellites.
</P>
<P>
They added that the project requires an investment of between
60 million and 80 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Shmuel Alkon, corporate vice president and general manager of
IAI's Electronic Group, said that the IAI has been involved in
space projects for many years and is continually looking for new
opportunities to expand its market.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking for other companies to invest, and we might
even issue a stock to raise money," Alkon added.
</P>
<P>
IAI sources said that the proposal for a partner with Core was
settled last year, and that under the arrangement, IAI would
operate the satellite and Core would distribute the imagery
through its worldwide computer network.
</P>
<P>
The civilian use for the imagery would be in the fields of
mapping, ecology, agriculture and fishing, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the report, Israeli defense officials
had expressed their opposition to the joint venture, doubting
that IAI, a government company, would profit by entering the
commercial imagery market.

<HEADLINE> Daimler-Benz Wishes Expansion in China's Aerospace Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The German-based Daimler-Benz AG
wants to expand its involvement in China's aerospace industry,
Norbert Graeber, with the Beijing representative office of the
giant European company, said in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The company's total turnover in China reached one billion
Deutsche marks last year, accounting for one percent of its
worldwide total.
</P>
<P>
Daimler-Benz Aerospace, one of the major four branches of the
company, started businesses in China years ago, with involvement
in the launching of a communications satellite, and the
"Dongfanghong Three" satellite.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident with our Chinese partners, because we are
quite familiar with the launching technology, and we also have
close friends here", said Graeber.
</P>
<P>
The company hopes for further involvement in the aerospace
industry, just as it has increased its involvement in the
automobile industry, Graeber said. The sale of Mercedes-Benz'
vehicles in China had exceeded 50,000 by last year.
</P>
<P>
In order to realize its sales goal by the year 2000,
estimated at 1.155 million, the giant automobile producer hopes to
maintain a stable growth of their market shares in China.
</P>
<P>
Mercedes-Benz had established about 30 sales offices in the
country's major cities by last year, and two joint ventures in car
and trucks production in Yangzhou and Baotou cities.
</P>
<P>
The Daimler-Benz Industrie (AEG) is in a process of
transformation.
</P>
<P>
The Daimler-Benz Interservice(debis) established six years ago
will also enter China's market soon, Graeber said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Contractors Demand 25,000 More Foreign Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Association of
Contractors and Builders has demanded the government allow
25,000 more foreign construction workers to work here, according
to today's Jerusalem Post.
</P>
<P>
The request comes in response to the Israeli closure on the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which prevents 30,000 Palestinian
construction workers from working in Israel, association
president Mordechai Yona said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The closure was imposed Sunday following two Hamas suicide
bombing attacks in Jerusalem and Ashkelon which killed 22
Israelis and three foreign students.
</P>
<P>
Yona predicted that the closure will be imposed for at least
three months, and therefore he called on Labor and Social Affairs
Minister Ora Namir and Construction and Housing Minister Binyamin
Ben-Eliezer to issue 25,000 permits for foreign laborers to work
here.
</P>
<P>
Currently 73,000 foreigners hold such permits, 50,000 of whom
work in construction.
</P>
<P>
Namir will meet with Prime Minister Shimon Peres at the start
of next week to discuss the request and to determine the most
effective way of ensuring security against future violent
attacks, a government spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
If the government agrees to the contractors' request, it will
signify a turning point in Peres's vision of integrating Israeli
and Palestinian workers.
</P>
<P>
"In general the government prefers a secure situation with the
Palestinians working here instead of foreign workers," said Zvi
Timor, spokesman for the Labor Ministry. "But the issue is one of
security."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, director-general of the Association of Contractors
and Builders Amos Bar-Am said that the lack of Palestinian
workers will cause a loss in output worth 400 million shekels
(some 129 million U.S. dollars) per month.
</P>
<P>
In the last three years, 70,000 Israelis have begun working in
construction, but there are not enough willing to fill the
contractors' needs, said Bar-Am.
</P>
<P>
The construction industry employs 220,000 workers, 146,000 of
whom are Israelis.

KAMPALA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's rebel leader Kony Joseph
was shot and wounded in a fierce battle on Wednesday with the
Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF), according to a report
reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Kony was injured with multiple bullet wounds when his Lord's
Resistance Army (LRA) was fighting against UPDF soldiers at Atiak
Pacilo, 45 miles west of Gulu town, northern Uganda, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
During the five-hour fight, 22 LRA rebels were killed, five
others captured.

On Thursday morning before the rebels moved out of the area,
22 rebels were killed and 60 injured on the spot, while seven
UPDF soldiers were also killed and 21 wounded during the battle.

<P>
MANILA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Congress is rushing
the approval of the proposed anti-bank robbery bill to help put a
stop to the series of bank robberies in Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Jose de Venecia today said that the proposed
bill, which calls for the imposition of the death penalty against
bank robbers, has powerful deterrence against bank robbery.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed Anti Bank Robbery and Protection Act, it is
mandatory for banks to install adequate security devices to
effectively prevent bank robberies and hire security personnel
with some form of police training.
</P>
<P>
It also increases penalties for bank robbery committed by
persons connected with the bank or by former or active police
military officials, and allows the use of high-powered firearms by
bank security and standardized armored vans.

<P>
MACAO, March 1 (Xinhua) -- A dozen universities and colleges on
the Chinese mainland will enroll outstanding Macao students free
of entrance examinations this year following last year's success.
</P>
<P>
The application procedures have started, and Macao students who

<P>
The new form of enrollment received warm response from local
students. A total of 262 students from 16 schools were admitted to
11 key universities on the mainland last year.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Become Garden City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- China's capital city has become
greener thanks to a project of tree and flower growing.
</P>
<P>
The large-scale environmental program around Beijing was
launched by the municipal government as part of the Eighth
Five-Year Plan (1991-1995).
</P>
<P>
Around 132,000 hectares of forestland have been added to the
city in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
With tree-planting along more than 60 roads, and building of 49
new parks, the city's ratio of tree-covered areas has risen to 36
percent from 28 percent in 1990 -- providing 7.08 square meters of
public greenery per head of population in the city - up from a
previous 6.14 sq m.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the capital's ratio of afforested areas is
expected to reach 40 percent, with the ratio hitting 35 percent in
city district areas. The amount of public green areas per head of
population will reach eight square meters, according to the plan
drafted by the municipal greening department.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this goal, the city will this year plant 1.5 million
saplings and a million flowers, and transform one million square
meters of land into grass lawns.

<HEADLINE> China Plans to Green More Barren Hills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Almost a sixth of China will be
covered with a blanket of forests by the end of the century,
Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun announced in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The Vice-Premier, who is also director of the State Greening
Committee, said the country had set a target for forest areas
extending to 15.5 percent of the country by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
It will mean all the mountains and hills in 21 provinces being
covered with trees, said Jiang Chunyun.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the Movement of Voluntary Trees Planting was
launched in 1981, forest coverage rate has risen to 13.9 percent,
and almost all the barren hills and mountains in 12 provinces have
been turned green.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called on the whole of society to take part in the
country's forestation at the Fifteenth Plenary Meeting of the
State Greening Committee today.
</P>
<P>
He said that government organizations as well as individuals
should all make their contributions.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the country's ecological environment is
still badly in need of improvement and protection. The area of
soil erosion has amounted to 38 percent, and the expanse of desert
in China has reached 1,550,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
China will be capable of producing an extra grain output of 9.1
billion kilograms during the next five years through planting
trees under a program of the Ministry of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in the past five years over 12 billion
trees have been planted voluntarily throughout the country,
raising the afforested area to 29 million hectares.

<HEADLINE> Indian Court Secures Bail to Former Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The special court dealing with
the 18 million dollar bribery case in India today granted bail to
former parliament affairs minister V.C. Shukla who resigned over
his alleged involvement in the scandal, the Press Trust of India
said.
</P>
<P>
Special Judge V.B. Gupta asked Shukla to furnish a personal
bond of 10,000 and a surety of an equal amount.
</P>
<P>
The court Thursday issued non-bailable warrants to ten
politicians including Shukla after taking cognizance of charge
sheets filed against them by the Central Bureau of Investigation
(CBI). The politicians had allegedly received money from illegal
foreign exchange dealers.
</P>
<P>
Shukla, who surrendered in the court this morning, moved a bail
application saying the Delhi High Court had granted anticipatory
bail to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) President L.K. Advani
Thursday facing a similar charge.
</P>
<P>
His counsel told the court that since the high court had
cleared the way of granting bail to Advani, there is no reason why
Shukla should not be given the bail.
</P>
<P>
The judge in his bail order said Shukla should not leave the
country without informing the court and should surrender his
passport to the CBI.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the Vietnamese
Communist Party Do Muoi said the country's current major task is
to develop economy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking recently to provincial and municipal leaders on
preparations for the Eighth National Congress of the Communist
Party of Vietnam, Do Muoi called on the party and the people to
seize opportunities to industrialize and modernize the
Southeastern Asian country.
</P>
<P>
The success achieved in the past five years has proved the
correctness of Vietnam's reform policy, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Vietnamese revolution is in a transitional
period toward socialism, adding that the major job for the country
is to lay down a sound material foundation for building socialism.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this, Do Muoi said, Vietnam has to quicken the
industrialization of agriculture, boost the development of the
light industry and carefully monitor the heavy industry.
</P>
<P>
He described infrastructure as the precondition for future
development.
</P>
<P>
The secretary general pointed out that the key factor in
industrialization and modernization is domestic funds. He urged
all the provinces to improve economic efficiency and fight waste
and corruption.
</P>
<P>
Do Muoi emphasized that the construction of the party should be
reinforced and corrupted officials must be cleared out of the
party and state departments.
</P>
<P>
The party leader concluded that the promotion of young
officials and party members should get more attention.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Going back on his earlier
statement, an Indian member of parliament Thursday denied that he
was bribed by Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao for bailing out of
the government in a no-confidence vote in July 1993, the local
press said today.
</P>
<P>
Shailendra Mahato, a former member of a minor party who joined
the Bharatiya Janata Party recently, made the clarification in the
Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament).
</P>
<P>
He said the money deposited by him in a bank was not bribe
money but belonged to the Jharkhand Mkti Morcha (JMM) of which he
was then general secretary.
</P>
<P>
But he insisted that three other JMM members had visited the
prime minister at his residence at that time.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Prime Minister Rao had allegedly paid
money received from illegal foreign exchange dealers (hawala
dealers) to four JMM members to garner their support in the defeat
of the no-confidence motion.
</P>
<P>
But Lok Sabha Speaker Shivraj Patil said Thursday Rao had
denied the charge in a reply to him on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: CPPCC Cares For Western Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- China's top advisory body, the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), sent 12 investigation teams to the country's
central and western areas last year as a way of offering advice
and positive help.
</P>
<P>
The teams involved over 300 CPPCC members, many of them
specialists in various fields.
</P>
<P>
During an inspection in Hotan in northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region, CPPCC National Committee Chairman Li
Ruihuan encouraged local people to dig water wells by raising
funds. He worked with them when he heard drinking water there is
below state required standards.
</P>
<P>
Under the care of Li and the regional government, 3.7 million
people in Xinjiang now have clean drinking water.
</P>
<P>
While visiting Xinjiang and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region last
year, CPPCC vice-chairmen Yang Rudai, Qian Zhengying and Qian
Weichang put forward a number of proposals on the exploitation of
water and land resources, and the construction of state commodity
grain bases.
</P>
<P>
Their proposals have exerted a positive influence on the
development of China's central and western areas, which have rich
energy and other natural resources, but which are relatively
under-developed for lack of funds, technology and inaccessibility.
</P>
<P>
The team heading for east China's Jiangxi Province suggested
the approval of linking three railway lines in some old
revolutionally base areas in Jinggang Mountains with the national
railway network. The scheme later drew attention from relevant
central government departments.
</P>
<P>
Members sent to Guizhou and Sichuan provinces advised local
government officials to pay great attention to problems of
state-owned factories and take positive measures to turn new
research results into production, and increase investment in
science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the CPPCC invited its members in northwest China's
Qinghai Province to visit Shanghai, China's largest industrial
city, and probed the possibility of enhancing bilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
CPPCC members in Hong Kong and Macao have also turned their
attention from the eastern coast to the central and western parts.
</P>
<P>
A delegation from Hong Kong advised Guizhou Province to promote
the progress of science and technology, as well as education, and
attract more overseas investment for local construction after an
extensive survey in the province.
</P>
<P>
Macao members pledged to help economic development in Xinjiang,
especially in the sectors of tourism, telecommunications and
energy.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that supporting the economic growth in central
and western parts of the country will still be a major task for
the CPPCC this year.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Offers Israel Cease-Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Islamic
Resistance Movement Hamas and its armed wing Izzedine al-Qassam
late last night offered Israel a conditional cease-fire, Israel
Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
In return, Hamas asked Israel for the release of its
prisoners, a halt to "organized terrorism against Hamas and its
Qassam brigades" and "an end to aggression against Palestinian
civilians."
</P>
<P>
The five-point proposal also contained a threat that if Israel
does not respond by 7:00 p.m. local time on March 8, "Qassam
brigades will be free to take any military action against anyone
in the Jewish state."
</P>
<P>
"We warn the Zionist entity and the General Security Service
against committing terrorist acts," Hamas added in the leaflet
issued in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media pointed out that the leaflet is notable for being
 signed by both Hamas and Izzedine al-Qassam, indicating that they
 have reached agreement on goals and strategy.
</P>
<P>
Hamas described its offer as "a golden opportunity for the
Israeli government to rid civilians from both sides of the fear
of war and bloody conflict."
</P>
<P>
Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a senior advisor to Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat, described the leaflet as
"a very important political statement."
</P>
<P>
He said in Gaza Thursday night that the Hamas proposal
"offered the Israeli government a truce," adding that the
dialogue held between the PNA and Hamas in Cairo had helped.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials in the Israeli prime minister's office
refused to comment on the offer.
</P>
<P>
Hamas's proposal came after Israel sealed off the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, and pressed the PNA to crack down on the
infrastructures of Hamas and Islamic Jihad military wings,
following two suicide bombing attacks Sunday in Jerusalem and
Ashkelon, which left 27 dead and 84 wounded.
</P>
<P>
Hamas issued a leaflet after the attacks to claim responsiblity
for the suicide bombings, saying they were to mark the 50th day of
the death of Hamas master bombmaker Yehiye Ayyash.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's Labor Unions Call for Measures against Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of Turkish Labor
Unions (Turk-Is) has called on all non-government organizations to
improve the conditions of Turkey's young laborers, who sacrifice
their education and childhood to work long hours for low pay with
no insurance, the Turkish Daily News reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Turk-Is officials as saying that official
statistics indicate there are 10 million workers between the ages
of 12 and 19 in Turkey, and that most of these children lack any
form of social security.
</P>
<P>
The officials said child labor is widely exploited in Turkey
adding that Turk-Is had begun to take action to stop this
exploitation.
</P>
<P>
According to Turk-Is, the measures are the culmination of many
years of conferences, seminars and research aimed at finding
solutions to this problem and raising public awareness.
</P>
<P>
They singled out Istanbul, Turkey's largest industrial center,
as having the highest concentration of child laborers, and
condemned the Turkish government's approach to the subject as
unsatisfactory.
</P>
<P>
The basic goals of Turk-Is are to prevent health risks to
young workers by stopping the use of chemicals in the workplace,
ensuring normal working hours for the workers and arranging
professional courses to offer skills training.

<HEADLINE> French Defense Minister Leaves Beirut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 1 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Minister Charles
Millon, upon his departure of Beirut last night, described his
talks with Lebanese top political and military leaders as "very
positive."
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters at the Beirut International Airport, he
said the talks were "focused on ways to consolidate the relations
in order to support the Lebanese army with spare parts (of
weapons) and help it in the revival and development."
</P>
<P>
"This French initiative is not a new thing for Lebanon," he
added, "France has affirmed more than once its support for the
causes concerning Lebanon and the Arab countries, and we are
desiring a more active role of France in the region and on the
level of the peace negotiations..."
</P>
<P>
And then, Millon talked about his visit in Lebanon, and the
subjects which were raised with the Lebanese officials,
especially "the problems related not only to the bilateral
relations between the two countries, but also to the Middle East
and the peace process in the region."
</P>
<P>
During his 24-hour visit in the Lebanese capital, he held
talks with Lebanese Defense Minister Mohsen Dalloul and Army
Commander General Emile Lahoud.
</P>
<P>
He also had meetings with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi,
House Speaker Nabih Berri, Prime Minister Rafik Al Hariri and
Foreign Minister Fares Boueiz.
</P>
<P>
He described the Lebanese-French relations as "excellent,"
announcing that French President Jacques Chirac will visit
Lebanon in the next weeks "to confirm the good level which these
relations have reached, and the visit will also remind the extent
that France adheres to the Lebanese territorial peace and its
sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
He said that France has always confirmed its will to defend
Lebanon's independence and that was what he came to reiterate to
the Lebanese officials.
</P>
<P>
Millon stated that France is ready to increase its abilities in
the field of training Lebanese military cadres in France.
</P>
<P>
"At present we have 74 militaries following up the training
courses, and this number will be raised to 94 in the future," the
French official said, "and we are determined to study all the
possibilities in this field."
</P>
<P>
On the technical cooperation between the armies of the two
countries, Millon disclosed that during his talks with the
Lebanese defense minister and the army commander, they exchanged
views on re-examinations for a number of equipments of the
Lebanese army by the French side.
</P>
<P>
He said in the next weeks, contacts will happen between
Lebanese and French technicians to decide the necessary steps
to be taken and to study the executive and financial
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Millon underlined France's adherence to the U.N. Security
Council resolution 425, and "we have informed the Lebanese
officials that we are hoping the Lebanon's independence and
sovereignty to be guaranteed." The resolution 425 calls for an
Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that France is ready to take "all its
responsibilities" when international guarantees are made on the
security in Lebanon, "even in the situation which obligate us the
participation in the multinational force to keep the peace in the
South."

During the examination, Wei also complained of coronary heart

''This tax structure is a demotivating factor particularly for

off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
''A tax system should not discourage but should instead
encourage business initiatives. A good system should actually

HONG KONG, March 1 (Xinhua) -- As the Sino-British Joint
Liaison Group (JLG) concluded their two-day expert-level
discussions on the issue of mobile communications services here

The British side had provided to the Chinese side "very great
deal of" detailed technical information on the issue, after
preparations of some three months.

<P>
Chen said, "We are glad to receive these information although
it would have been better if they were provided earlier."
</P>
<P>
"We hope they could help solve the problems and our experts
study them urgently," he said.

<P>
Statistics show that during the past five years, the completed
investment in fixed assets of the whole society reached 6,163.7
billion yuan, an average annual increase of 36.1 percent over the
"Seventh Five-Year Plan" period.
</P>
<P>
Investment structure was also improved to some extent, Zhang
said.
</P>
<P>
China witnessed rapid development in foreign economic relations
during the period, Zhang said, noting that the accumulative value
of export and import through customs reached 1,014.5 billion US
dollars during the period in the country, with an average annual
growth rate of 19.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the period, the foreign capitals actually used in the
country totalled 161.3 billion US dollars, 3.5 times the figure
for the 1986-1990 period, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
With economic development, the living standards of urban and
rural households were greatly improved. In 1995, the per capita
income of urban residents that could be used as living expenses
reached 3,893 yuan, while the net income of rural residents per
capita reached 1,578 yuan.
</P>
<P>
During the period, the total volume of retail sales of consumer

</P>
<P>
China's foreign exchange reserve rose to 73.6 billion US
dollars in 1995 from 11.1 billion US dollars in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Further more, speedy progress was made in the fields of
science, education, culture, health and sports in the past five
years, Zhang noted.
</P>
<P>
During the period, a series of important reform measures were
carried out successively and achieved positive results, Zhang
said, noting that significant achievements were made in the reform
of the price system, the fiscal and taxation system, the banking
system and the foreign trade system.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhang admitted that some problems still exist in the
course of economic development at present, such as the fairly high
rise of prices, the still weak basis for agricultural production.

according to the State Statistics Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
The SSB today released the "Statistical Communique of the
People's Republic of China on the 1995 National Economic and
Social Development", saying that China's national economy grew in
a sustained and rapid manner and major macro-economic control
targets were achieved in 1995, bringing about a satisfactory
conclusion to the smooth implementation of the "Eighth Five-Year

by 75.9 percent over that in 1990. The average annual growth rate
of GNP during 1991-1995 was 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese economy enjoyed the most rapid development and the
smallest fluctuation in the history, which showed that the
vitality of market mechanism and the capacity of government
macro-control had been enhanced," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Steady development of rural economy effectively supported the
rapid growth of national economy, Zhang said, noting that the
average annual growth of value-added of agriculture was 4.1
percent during the period.
</P>
<P>
The total output of grain during the period was 2.245 billion
tons, an increase of over 200 million tons as compared with that

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Silk worms have provided once
poverty-stricken farmers in China's Qinling and Daba mountain
areas with a golden opportunity to get rich.
</P>
<P>
Many rural people in the border areas of Shaanxi, Sichuan and
Hubei provinces are becoming affluent by turning to the mountains.
</P>
<P>
As well as raising silkworms, their money-spinning ideas
include growing edible fungi and herbs, as well as planting fruit
trees and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
A local agriculture official said more than 80 percent of the
area is mountainous, while farmland accounts for only 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 10 years, the area's acreage of plots planted
with fruit and mulberry trees has increase from 147,000 to 533,000
hectares.
</P>
<P>
Xunyang County has planted 30,000 ha of fruit and mulberry
trees over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
It has proved very fruitful for rural households who have seen
their annual earnings increase by 35 percent to more than 1,000
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Almost four-fifths of Liuba County is covered with forests,
ranking first in Shaanxi Province. The county government has
contracted 98 percent of its remaining barren hills to local
farmers.
</P>
<P>
Silkworm raising has become a major industry in Ankang
Prefecture. Annual output of silk cocoons totals 11 million kg,
adding an average of some 140 yuan per head to the yearly income
of the prefecture's population.

in the overall standings.
</P>
<P>
It was there all night for Lynch as he notched up the floor,
pommel horse and vault titles consecutively.
</P>
<P>
Lynch finished with a total of 57.086, a narrow margin over
Roethlisberger, who tallied at 56.986. Their teammates, John
Macready and Blaine Wilson, followed on 56.887 and 56.698
respectively.
</P>
<P>
As meet rules allow only two gymnasts to advance from one
country, Lynch and Roethlisberger will represent the U.S. team in
Saturday's all-around finals.
</P>
<P>
Other all-around finalists are Germany's Valeri Belenki,
Georgia's Ilia Giogadze, Japan's Sigeru Kruihara, Belarus's Andrei
Kan, Romania's Adrian Ianculescu and Russia's Oleg Kizmin.
</P>
<P>
The American Cup is a top international gymnastics competition
that grows in significance in Olympic years. Because some top
Olympic contenders prefer to stay home rather than travel long
distances before the Summer Games, this year's foreign field is
slightly weakened.
</P>
<P>
The competition continues Friday with the women's
preliminaries. The men's and women's finals are slated for
Saturday.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan scientists have
successfully treated Aids patients using locally developed
anti-Aids drug, "Kenya Times" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Seven patients who were confirmed HIV positive, which causes
Aids, have tested negative after being treated with the drug
Pearl Omega. Many more patients have shown improvement since
being put on the drug last year.
</P>
<P>
Documentary evidence available at the Kenya Biodiversity
Centre shows that the drug was also tested for side-effects and
no notable side-effects have been observed.
</P>
<P>
One of the seven patients who have tested negative since being
put on Pearl Omega, David Njoroge, 24, said " The drug gave me
back life. Otherwise, I would be dead today."
</P>
<P>
Plans are at an advanced stage to make the new anti-AIDs drug
available all over the country.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Biodiversity Centre has already been established in
Nairobi where patients may make inquiries and receive immediate
help. Other similar centres are also being established in
provincial hospitals.
</P>
<P>
There are about one million people carrying HIV in Kenya.

<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The crude birth rate of population
in China was 17.12 per thousand, and the death rate was 6.57 per
thousand, resulting in a natural growth rate of 10.55 per thousand.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Zhang Sai, director of the State
Statistical Bureau, at a press conference held in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, the total population of China was 1,211.21

</P>
<P>
The annual per-capita income of urban households that could be
used as living expenses was 3,893 yuan in 1995, up 22.5 percent

percent, or a real growth of 5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhang noted, difference in growth of income between

prominent, and the real income of some residents declined.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, the staff and workers in China numbered
186.2 million, or 4.6 million persons more than at the end of
1994. Through the Re-employment Project, 1.4 million unemployed

with a real growth of 3.8 percent if price increase was excluded.
</P>
<P>
The social security system was set up in 33.2 percent of rural

BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Wei Jingsheng, who was sentenced
to 15 years in prison after his arrest last November was declared
as healthy by health officials in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested on charges of violating the Criminal Law last
November for providing foreign nationals with important military
information.
</P>
<P>
A group of mass media organizations in Hong Kong have issued
unreliable reports on Wei Jingsheng's health condition recently.
</P>
<P>
After being placed in prison, Wei received a thorough health
examination which confirmed only hypertension and a fatty liver.
</P>
<P>
During the examination, Wei also complained of coronary heart
disease. But an electrocardiogram and 24-hour monitoring have
ruled this out.
</P>
<P>
The prison hospital has treated Wei Jingsheng's diseases and he
is now in a healthy condition.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian royal troops are
closing in on Pailin, the headquarters of the Khmer Rouge, after
more than 40 days of fighting.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of Cambodia's Information Ministry said the
capture of Pailin was just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
He said royal soldiers had taken many guerrilla-controlled
front-line positions only 10 kilometers away from Pailin,
including the strongholds of Phnom Veng and Phnom Krom.
</P>
<P>
Khmer Rouge guerrillas, who firmly held the heights of Phnom
Veng and Phnom Krom in the past month, were forced to retreat by
the royal army backed by tanks, artillery and fighter planes,
added the official.
</P>
<P>
He noted that government troops had planned to seize Pailin and
another stronghold Phnom Malai before February 15, adding that
they failed to meet the deadline due to fierce resistance, water
shortage and disease.
</P>
<P>
The local press reported that royal troops and the Khmer Rouge
had suffered heavy casualties since the attack on Pailin started
on January 15.
</P>
<P>
Military and civilian hospitals in Battambang Province were
crammed with wounded soldiers and 700 serious wounded had been
transferred to hospitals in Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
The government had reportedly called for an emergent blood
donation.

Conference ended here yesterday with resolving to push for closer
cooperation between the Nile Basin countries.

Speakers at the conference noted the lack of cooperation

The conference stated that "political boundaries and national
self interests are regrettable barriers to the integrated
management of shared water resources."

It added that it is high time that the Nile Basin countries
make concerted effort to reach agreement on how to manage

The conference further warned that "the unilateral approach by
which the basin states would act in their own interest would
inevitably exacerbate conflicts among the water course states."

Delegates from Egypt, Kenya, Sudan, Zaire, Rwanda, Burundi and
Uganda attended the conference which started here on Monday.

<HEADLINE> China to Have More Insurance Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- China has given the green light to
preparations for the establishment of five new insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
The five insurance companies will be Taikang Life Insurance,
Xinhua Life Insurance, Huatai Assurance, Yong'an Assurance, and
Hua'an Assurance, said officials of the People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
Huatai, Yong'an and Hua'an will be property underwriters, said
the officials.
</P>
<P>
The two life insurance companies will be based in Beijing and
operate across the country. Taikang has been formed by the China
International Travel Service, the China National Foreign Trade
Transportation Corporation and other institutions.
</P>
<P>
With headquarters in Beijing, Huatai will provide property
coverage around China, and will be launched by China United
Telecommunications Corporation and other sponsors.
</P>
<P>
Yong'an and Hua'an will be regional insurers with Xi'an,
capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, hosting Yong'an,
and Shenzhen, a special economic zone in south China's Guangdong
Province, becoming the home of Hua'an.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has yet to approve legal representatives,
share-holders and business scales for the new insurance companies,
and during a six-month preparation period, they will not be
allowed to become involved in insurance business, said the
officials.
</P>
<P>
China has only three insurance companies operating across the
country and less than 30 regional insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
Experts have pointed out that China needs many more insurance
companies to serve the thriving market-oriented economy.
</P>
<P>
Several months ago China expressed an intention to establish
ten new insurance companies.

<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The former home of the eminent
Chinese writer Lu Xun in downtown Beijing, is to be saved from the
bulldozer.
</P>
<P>
The residence is to be preserved, rather than pulled down to
make way for a massive urban redevelopment project.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's Municipal Urban Planning Bureau has notified a
local real estate firm responsible for the project to
resettle 32 households living in Lu's former home.
</P>
<P>
The area in which Lu's former residence is located was
earmarked for redeveloped two years ago, but the real estate firm
failed to make provision for the protection of the old traditional
court-yard structure.
</P>
<P>
Renowned local writer Li Shaotang wrote letter to the local
legislature calling for the protection of Lu's old home, which was
listed as a city-level cultural relic in 1993. It was Li's
initiative that has ensured the preservation of Lu's old home.
</P>
<P>
Lu (1881-1936) moved from east China's Zhejiang Province to the
Beijing residence with his family in 1911. He lived there for
three years during which he wrote his masterpiece "The True Story
of Ah Q", and his first collection of short stories. A number of
important scholars and other renowned figures regularly visited
the place.
</P>
<P>
Lu moved to another house in Beijing after three years, but his
mother and younger brother remained there till 1965.

<HEADLINE> Speed Up Legislation, Strengthen Supervision: Top Legislator (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reviewing the work of the NPC Standing Committee in the past
year, Qiao Shi said progress was registered in legislation, the
building-up of the socialist democratic and legal systems, and in
supervising the implementation of enacted laws.
</P>
<P>
During the year, the NPC Standing Committee deliberated on 37
draft laws, and on decisions relevant to law. It adopted 24 laws,
and law related decisions, and approved eight treaties and
agreements reached between China and foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Of the laws passed last year, 13 related to the socialist
market economy, including laws governing banks and commercial
banks, insurance, lotteries, guarantees and taxation, civil
aviation, environmental protection and electricity.
</P>
<P>
Laws stipulating the status, duties and rights and obligations
of banks served as effective legal measures to ensure the smooth
development of the country's banking sector.
</P>
<P>
The 8th NPC Standing Committee has set the target of basically
establishing a legal frame-work for the country's socialist market
economy within its five-year term ending 1998.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the building up of the country's socialist democracy
and politics, the NPC Standing Committee also enacted several laws
such as the the law of judges, the law of prosecutors, and the law
of the People's Police. The measures have helped bring the
management of law enforcement personnel onto a legal track, Qiao
Shi said.

<HEADLINE> Agnelli Calls for Reform of State System in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Gianni Agnelli, former chairman
of Fiat and a life member of the parliament, today called for
reform in order to solve the political problems in Italy, the ANSA
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
When commenting on the chaos in the Italian government, Agnelli
pointed out, in an interview with Cable News Network (CNN), that
the political problems in the country are those of the political
leaders, who differ in their views.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, the chaos stems from the inefficiency of the
country's political system, which he said must be reformed. The
reform process will take at least two years and only when the
reform is completed, could Italy enjoy political stability,
Agnelli noted.
</P>
<P>
On Dini's caretaker cabinet, Agnelli said it is a perfect
solution. However, he said, as a technocrat, Dini must fit the
role of a political prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Dini's political career depends on the upcoming national
election, but the results of the election are difficult to predict
at present, Agnelli said.
</P>
<P>
Agnelli, 74, is believed to be the most powerful businessman in
Italy. He stepped down Wednesday as chairman of Fiat, the
country's largest private industrial company.

<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese lawmakers will continue to
attach importance to economic legislation in 1996, laying emphasis
on formulating more laws to govern a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to build a legal frame-work for the socialist market
economy.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC), made the statement in an interview with
People's Daily, which carries the full text of the interview today.
</P>
<P>
The legislative work will be closely linked with the practice
of reform and development, under the general requirements of
China's 9th Five-Year Plan for economic and social development,
and of the country's prospective program until 2010.
</P>
<P>
During the 9th Five-Year plan period starting this year, China
is expected to establish an initial socialist market economy
system, Qiao Shi said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the establishment of the market economy is the
process of the legalization of the economy.
</P>
<P>
While putting emphasis on economic legislation, the NPC
Standing Committee will strengthen the formulation of laws in all
other fields to ensure the development of the whole society.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 the NPC Standing Committee will strengthen the
supervision of the implementation of the Constitution, and all
promulgated laws and the performance of the duties by
administrative, judicial and prosecuting institutions.
</P>
<P>
The supervision is allowed as part of the Constitution. The
supervision will also cover the implementation of enacted economic
law, related to the socialist economic market to advance the
establishment of a new order of the market economy.
</P>
<P>
During the supervision, the NPC Standing Committee will urge
all institutions to correct all malpractices in which laws are not
observed. This will also include situations where the
implementation of laws is not strict, or where the violation of
laws is not dealt with, leading officials at various levels to
abuse their duties.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Bring Top Products to Melbourne Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong companies are going to
participate in the inaugural TCF International Textile, Clothing,
Footwear and Fashion Accessory Exhibition slated for March 26-28
in Melbourne, Australia.
</P>
<P>
According to the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC),
the fair is to be staged in the newly-opened Melbourne Exhibition
Center which is near the downtown district. And 32 out of the 380
booths at the exhibition are to be provided to 29 Hong Kong
manufacturers and traders.
</P>
<P>
This is the first such Hong Kong delegation for a trade fair in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
June Ngan, HKTDC's marketing manager for Australia, said: "As a
result of Australia abolishing its quota system in 1993 and the
gradual reduction of duties for the importation of textiles,
clothing and footwear, we see greater opportunities for imports in
the product range represented at TCF International."
</P>
<P>
"Coupled with this is the rapidly growing popularity around the
world of Hong Kong products which deliver quality and
up-to-the-minute designs at very affordable prices," she
continued.
</P>
<P>
Australia's textile, clothing and footwear industries are worth
12 billion US dollars a year with half of the products imported.
</P>
<P>
Imports from Hong Kong for these three categories in 1994 were
worth 586 million US dollars, up 6.5 percent on the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Total imports from Hong Kong including transshipments from
other countries, were worth 2.2 billion US dollars in the first 11
months last year, a 13 percent rise over the same period a year
earlier, according to the HKTDC.

<TEXT>
<P>
Bangkok, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-archa, who is chairman of the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM),
said here this morning that leaders of the two continents are
assembled at the meeting with a common purpose "to create a
dynamic new linkage and form a new partnership between Asia and
Europe."
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech at the ASEM, Banharn said that for some
time the two regions have been preoccupied with different
priorities and did not maintain the close contact they should
have.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The time has come for us to take advantage of the
synergy inherent in our long-standing relationship."
</P>
<P>
he added that Europe has signaled a desire for shared
prosperity with Asia "at a time when prospects for cooperation are
brighter than ever."
</P>
<P>
Asia, which has won economic successes through hard work and
self-help, has given itself newfound confidence and eagerness to
work with its partners for mutual benefit, Banharn said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in fact "Asia and Europe are already working
together to lay the groundwork for continued peace and development
in Asia."
</P>
<P>
He also called for more cooperation in drug control, in the
fight against international terrorism and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that to achieve progress in Asian-European
cooperation in various fields, the meeting "will re-think Asia and
Europe in a new spirit of equal partnership and mutual respect."
</P>
<P>
Banharn also said, "In developing close partnership, we should
learn to appreciate one another's strengths and weaknesses. We
must foster understanding of each other's perception and values.
Only then can we have the trust that is so indispensable among
close partners."
</P>
<P>
"Through dialogue, we can find common ground and build upon it
a new comprehensive Asia-Europe partnership for greater growth.
This partnership will entail not only economic cooperation, but
closer political and social ties as well, to meet the demands of
the new century."
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Banharn also mentioned a few areas for
Asian-European cooperation, including open trade and investment,
open regionalism, Mekong Basin development, human resources
development, and environmental research and technology.

<P>
BANGKOK, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Lamberto
Dini today expressed hopes that the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) may
open a real prospect for Asia-Europe Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the historic event, Dini
said: "We are living in a world where we can control only if we
can achieve a high level of cooperation."
</P>
<P>
To bring about a partnership between Asian and Europe, the
ongoing meeting must prepare the ground for a deeper understanding
of the problems of the two sides, said the prime minister of
Italy, which holds the rotating presidency of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Asian and European leaders are meeting here to seek the opening
of a lasting dialogue on matters of common interest, which will
pave the way for a close and profitable collaboration in the
political, economic, social and cultural spheres, Dini said.
</P>
<P>
The groundwork seems to have been already laid, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Europe and Asia have developed very different cultures and
experiences, he said, adding that the two sides can exchange
experiences without renouncing the specific features of their
history.
</P>
<P>
The European Union is certain that the dialogue procedure, based
on an understanding and respect for the concerns and values of
each side, can lead to common views even on controversial issues,
he said.

<HEADLINE> EU President On Increased Asia-Europe Economic Links </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 1 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) President
Jacques Santer, in an address to the opening ceremony of the first
Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) here today, called for growth in
economic and trade links between Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
The ASEM, intended to establish a new Asia-Europe partnership
based on greater inter-regional cooperation in the economic,
political and other fields, opened here today with the
participation of leaders from 25 Asian and European countries as
well as the EU president.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Santer said that the Europeans have seen
Southeast and East Asia become a region with the fastest growth in
the world, paving the way for expansion of economic and trade
relations with Europe.
</P>
<P>
"This impressive achievement offers an enormous potential for
growth in European trade and investment relations with Asia," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Santer said, "It is important to note that in 1994, the volume
of EU trade with the countries of East, South and Southeast Asia
exceeded our trade with North and South America."
</P>
<P>
"I want this growth in trade and investment to continue and
accelerate," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The EU president also voiced the readiness of the union to
lower tariffs by tearing down trade barriers with Asia.
</P>
<P>
"We worked successfully together with Asia in the Uruguay Round
(of multilateral trade negotiations) to remove barriers to trade
and lower tariffs," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"For the EU, nearly 40 percent of our imports of manufactured
goods will be duty free in the coming years, while tariffs on
other products will fall by at least a third during the next
decade," he said.
</P>
<P>
Economic and trade relations between East Asia and Europe have
developed steadily over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, East Asia replaced the United States as the largest
overseas export market for the EU, taking an 18-percent share of
the EU's export during the year.
</P>
<P>
However, in terms of the market share in East Asia, the EU has
obviously lagged behind the United States. In particular, the
EU's investment in East Asia accounted for only 1 percent of its
total overseas investment between 1982 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
Two-way trade between the EU and the 10 Asian countries totaled
238 billion US dollars in 1992, compared with 240 billion US
dollars between the EU and North America in the same year.
</P>
<P>
Attending the two-day gathering are leaders from China, Japan,
South Korea, the seven-member Association of Southeast Asian
Nations -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, and the 15-member EU as well as
the EU president.
</P>
<P>
The EU groups Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Spain, Belgium,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Greece, Portugal, Denmark, Ireland,
Austria, Finland and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
According to latest statistics from the World Bank, the market
size of the 10 East Asian countries reached a total of 748.7
billion US dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Over the next 10 years, East Asia needs some 1.5 trillion US
dollars worth of investment in the construction of infrastructure
facilities, creating vast market potentials.

<HEADLINE> Russia Repeats Objection to NATO Eastward Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov tonight urged the West and the central and east
European countries to find a solution to the conflict between
Russia and NATO over the latter's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Bratislava on his first trip to Slovakia, a former
Soviet Bloc state, since becoming foreign minister, Primakov
restated that NATO expansion could re-lead to a breakup of Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said the Cold-War period is over and Moscow will not order
any country not to join NATO. But Russia has the right to ask
others to work out a solution which will accommodate both the
concerns of Russia and the anxieties of the central and east
European countries.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that some major Western states and the countries
in central and east Europe preparing to join NATO should
reconsider the consequences of re-demarcating Europe.
</P>
<P>
Moscow is bitterly opposed to NATO's plan to admit countries in
eastern and central Europe, which were close allies in the former
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact, insisting that this would threaten
Russia's security.
</P>
<P>
"We oppose the extension of NATO to our neighbors as this
will bring a military infrastructure to the Russian border," he
told a press conference after meeting Slovak counterpart Yuraj
Schenk here today. He also has met Slovakian President Michal
Kovac and Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar.
</P>
<P>
Slovakia has announced its decision to join the Western
political, economic and military alliance.
</P>
<P>
"(NATO) membership of any east and central European country is
a matter for those wishing to join NATO, and Russia has no veto
right," Primakov said. "But this does not mean we regard this
prospect with pleasure."
</P>
<P>
"We respect the rights of our neighbors, but we also ask them
to respect and consider our own interests," said Primakov, who was
appointed foreign minister by President Boris Yeltsin in January.
</P>
<P>
Primakov added that Russia will not change its stand on NATO's
expansion within a few years.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister arrived in Slovakia from
Strasbourg, where Russia was formally admitted to the Council of
Europe on Wednesday.

in the U.S., "colonized" four other patients. The hospital has
kept patients in their wards to prevent the spread of the bacteria.
</P>
<P>
In the past six months, U.S. patients have been the source of
similar bacterial outbreaks at the Toronto Hospital in Ontario, Globe
and Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
Resistant bacteria have not yet become a problem within Canada
because doctors have been much more conservative in prescribing
antibiotics than their American counterparts.
</P>
<P>
"The invader is a form of staph known as VRE, a mutated
antibiotic-resistant version of enteroccoci found normally in the
human bowel. First identified in New York 10 years ago, it has now
spread coast to coast in U.S. hospitals," Dr. Low, chief
microbiologist at Mount Sinai was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The germ is potentially lethal if it finds its way into a
patient who has been weakened by an operation or infection and has
been on strong antibiotics that have killed competing bacteria.
</P>
<P>
"To keep the resistant bacteria out of Canadian hospitals,
screening of U.S. patients is a priority, even though it is
expensive and time-consuming," Dr. Low added.

SOFIA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian hospitals were today
banned from using blood and blood products from the country's
blood banks which are reported to be infected with the virus that
causes AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Labor Party Loosing Grip Of Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Labor Party is
lingering on the verge of being toppled by the opposition
coalition in the federal election due Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Paul Keating is obviously under pressure on the
final day of the election campaign. In a last-pitch dash to
survive the swing of votes against Labor, he warned voters this
morning that a coalition government would bring the economic
growth rate down to only 1.5 to 2.5 percent from the current 4-4.5
percent annually.
</P>
<P>
"If Labor goes, so will the growth rate," he said.
</P>
<P>
But his efforts to distinguish Labor from the National-Liberal
coalition came too late.
</P>
<P>
The two major political groups have been wrestling on a number
of battlegrounds such as Medicare, budget deficit, election
commitment costs, industrial relations and environment.
</P>
<P>
So far Labor's attack against the coalition on all fronts has
mostly fallen short of the target, because the coalition did its
best to minimize the differences of its policies from Labor's.
</P>
<P>
When neither side could gain a decisive edge on policy issues,
casual factors played a key role to swing the large proportion of
uncommitted voters (11 percent according to the latest opinion
poll) toward or against the party.
</P>
<P>
The issues received the most media coverage during the campaign
were racist comments and forged letters.
</P>
<P>
The coalition was criticized for comments made by several of
its members on ethnic groups in the country. But fresh on voters'
minds is the tumble of Labor Treasurer Ralph Willis.
</P>
<P>
Willis was forced to apologize for his "error of judgment"
after some "secret" letters he obtained and used to attack the
coalition were found to be forged Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls showed that Labor slipped further behind the
coalition in supporting rates after the letter affair was exposed.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, Labor saw a greater gap with the coalition
throughout the campaign than in the last election in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Though Labor had been trailing the coalition in most part of
the 1993 election campaign, opinion polls in the last few days
indicated a turnaround of voters commitment toward Labor.
</P>
<P>
But within 24 hours from this election, different polls have
unanimously foreshadowed a defeat of the Labor government. The
most pessimistic forecast estimates that Labor will lose 20 seats
Saturday. The most optimistic estimate is a loss of up to nine
seats on the Labor side.
</P>
<P>
The opposition needs only nine seats to obtain an absolute
majority in the House of Representatives, enabling it to form a
new government.
</P>
<P>
Keating is making a last-minute blitz throughout the country to
turn the table. He will visit the most marginal seats in three
states during the day, hoping to contain the expected landslide
and secure Labor's dream of the sixth consecutive term in office.

WARSAW, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Poland today rejected a Russian
proposal to build a highway through Poland to connect Russia's
Kaliningrad with Belarus.
</P>
<P>
Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski told Lithuanian
reporters today that the proposal is unacceptable because the
route of the proposed highway passes through a region which has
special ecological significance for Poland.
</P>
<P>
Polish Foreign Minister Darinsz Rosati also said that building
the highway through the Suwalki area in Poland is unacceptable and
Poland has no plans of building any highways in that area.
</P>
<P>
Kaliningrad is a Russian enclave surrounded by Poland and
Lithuania. Russia has been negotiating with Poland about the
highway project since 1991.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Firms Could Be Hurt by Anti-Cuba Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Canadian businesses operating
in Cuba are being caught in the cross-fire of words and sanctions
between Cuba and the United States following last week's shooting
down of two planes off the island's coast.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration and Congress agreed Wednesday to
pass punitive anti-Cuban legislation that opens up Canadian firms
to lawsuits and could prevent Canadians with dealings in Cuba from
entering the United States.
</P>
<P>
The bill makes it mandatory that U.S. officials deny visas or
entry into the country to third-country nationals "who traffic in
confiscated property" in Cuba after passage of the bill.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Ambassador to the United States Raymond Chretien
warned Wednesday the legislation "contravenes well-established
international principles," according a Southam News dispatch from
Washington carried today by major Canadian newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Canadian firms that have so far managed to weather previous
anti-Cuba measures could be hurt by the bill, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Among high-profile outfits doing business in, or trading with,
Cuba are Sherritt International Corp., Delta Hotels and Resorts
Ltd. and B.C. Sugar Refinery Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Andre Bergeron, president of Lantic Sugar, the Montreal-based
division of B.C. Sugar, said he is concerned because 25 percent of
Lantic's raw sugar comes from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Bergeron called for strong action from Canadian Foreign Affairs
Minister Lloyd Axworthy, who has indicated Canada will consider
going to international courts if sections of the U.S. bill are
deemed to be illegal.
</P>
<P>
Sherritt, a Toronto-based mining firm, is probably the most
vulnerable and exposed Canadian company, which has nickel and
cobalt joint ventures and oil and gas operations in Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Canada Sees Record Trade Surplus in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Canada reaped a record 20.32
billion U.S. dollar trade surplus in 1995, according to today's
local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Merchandise exports surged 16 percent last year to a record
high of 183.9 billion dollars, outpacing an 11-percent gain for
imports to 163.3 billion, which also reached a record high.
</P>
<P>
In December alone, exports totaled 15.82 billion dollars, up
1.8 percent from November, while imports slipped marginally to
13.57 billion dollars, generating a record high monthly trade
surplus of 2.25 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The monthly trade surplus was 5.8 billion dollars higher than
the previous peak set in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Much of December's gain was fostered by strong sales abroad of
machinery and equipment, energy and automotive products. Machinery
and equipment exports saw an increase of 5 percent, energy exports
8.4 percent and automotive products 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Canada's imports were dampened by a sluggish
domestic demand of energy products and machinery.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia, Bosnian Serbs Restore Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb state,
Republika Srpska, on Wednesday officially resumed economic
relations with neighboring Yugoslavia following the lifting of
U.N. sanctions against the Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
A Bosnian Serb economic delegation, headed by the Chamber of
Commerce President Bozidar Antic, held talks today at the Yugoslav
Chamber of the Economy (PKJ) over the resumption of economic ties.
</P>
<P>
The talks focused on cooperation in the manufacturing sector,
notably the automobile and aluminium industries, agriculture and
civil engineering projects, a statement issued by the PKJ said.
</P>
<P>
Other fields of cooperation, such as in the power industry and
transport, were also mentioned as important for the resumption of
overall relations.
</P>
<P>
Mihailo Milojevic, the president of the PKJ, said that the
lifting of sanctions by the international community had created
the basic conditions for re-linking the economies on either side
of the Drina, the river that forms the border between Yugoslavia
and the Bosnian Serb republic.
</P>
<P>
The statement said particular attention would be paid to the
restoration of links in communications.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government decided on Wednesday to resume
relations with Republika Srpska. Ties had been suspended since
August 4, 1994, following the Bosnian Serb rejection of an
international peace plan.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations on Tuesday suspended sanctions against the
Bosnian Serbs because of their compliance with the Bosnia peace
agreement.

<HEADLINE> Scale of Fixed Assets Curbed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- China's efforts to curb investment
in fixed assets achieved significant results in 1995 with the
growth rate proceeding at a slower pace, A statistical official
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The country's completed investment in fixed assets last year
totalled 1,944.5 billion yuan, an increase of 18.8 percent over
the previous year, Zhang Sai, director of the State Statistics
Bureau, said at a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate was 12.6 percentage points lower than that in

<HEADLINE> Fast Food Provides Rich Investment for Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- A 10-million US dollar expansion
of the fast food industry is on the menu for Beijing.
</P>
<P>
City officials have given the go ahead in the last month alone
to plans by seven foreign-funded catering outlets.
</P>
<P>
They will be bringing Thai, Japanese and Hong Kong style
fast-food restaurants to the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
The catering trade, especially the fast food sector, has become
a first choice for many overseas investors who want a slice of the
market in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Fewer foreign-funded projects have been announced in the
capital so far this year, compared to the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of foreign-backed projects in the catering
trade has increased, a city official said.
</P>
<P>
In January, the city government approved seven foreign-funded
catering companies, involving a total investment of over 10
million US dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
McDonalds, the US-based fast food giant, has opened another
four restaurants in Beijing so far this year, bringing the total
number to 17.
</P>
<P>
By the end of January, Beijing's catering trade had seen the
opening of 600 foreign-funded enterprises, involving a total
investment of 1.24 billion US dollars, the official said.
</P>
<P>
An expert attributed the fast-food boom to the rapid growth of
the city's population and the acceleration in the pace of living
among its 10m residents.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the catering market sector still has great
potential.

<HEADLINE> Faulty Speedometer Caused Plane Crash Off Dominican Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 29 (Xinhua) -- A faulty speedometer that
told pilots they were flying faster than they actually were caused
a Boeing 757 to crash off the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press quoted Gen. Hector Roman Torres, Dominican
general director of civil aviation, as saying Thursday that the
instrument misled the pilots, who thought they had sufficient
speed to maintain their altitude of 7,000 feet (2,100 meters).
</P>
<P>
All 189 people aboard Alas Nacionales flight 301 died when the
aircraft crashed six minutes after taking off February 6 from the
international airport of Puerto Plata, a popular northern
Dominican resort.
</P>
<P>
Most of the passengers were German holiday-makers.
</P>
<P>
Roman said he got the information Thursday evening from the
U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, which has been
analyzing flight recorders retrieved from wreckage on the ocean
floor.
</P>
<P>
"An alarm went off indicating that the airplane was losing a
lot of velocity, and 84 seconds later the airplane hit water," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the aircraft's voice recorder had the pilots
commenting, as they were taking off and during the brief time
they were airborne, that the velocity indicator was not
functioning well.

<HEADLINE> Australian Foreign Debt Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Australia's foreign debt surged
to 184.864 billion Australian dollars (140.50 billion US dollars)
in the December quarter last year, according to the Australian
Bureau of Statistics (ABS) today.
</P>
<P>
But the bureau said that the ratio of net foreign debt to gross
domestic product was not available yet. The ratio was 39 percent
in the previous quarter, when net foreign debt stood at 179.456
billion Australian dollars (136.387 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The net foreign debt kept rising in 1995 from 166.192 billion
Australian dollars (126.306 billion US dollars) at the end of
1994.
</P>
<P>
Federal Treasurer Ralph Willis said that despite the three
percent increase of foreign debt in the December quarter,
Australia could comfortably service the debt.
</P>
<P>
He said that rapid growth of exports ensured that every dollar
of foreign debt would be offset by 8.5 dollars earned from
exports.
</P>
<P>
Australia has one of the highest per capita foreign debt in the
Western world.
</P>
<P>
The ABS figures were released on the final day of the federal
election campaign.
</P>
<P>
The opposition used the new debt figures to attack the Labor
government's economic management.
</P>
<P>
"The horrific trend under Labor continues and when matched with
the Commonwealth government's all-up debt of 97.5 billion
Australian dollars (74.1 billion US dollars), which has tripled in
the past decade, the choice for the people is clear," the
opposition spokesman Tim Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
ABS figures showed that foreign debt borrowed by the government
has decreased to 38.3 percent of the total net debt.
</P>
<P>
The foreign debt has been a major issue in the election
campaign. Willis said that the 7.4 billion Australian dollar (5.6
billion US dollar) spending promises made by the opposition
coalition in the election campaign would deteriorate national
savings and increase the country's debt burden.

<P>
SHANGHAI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai residents crunched their
way through more fruit than ever during the Spring Festival period.
</P>
<P>
Figures show that between January 31 to February 22, people in
China's biggest city ate 16,820 tons of fruit, an increase of
almost 25 percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
But now the local fruit market is enjoying a post-festival rest
and a reorganization is underway. Most kinds of fruit are in short
supply. Strawberries, watermelon, muskmelon, and apple are the
exception with plentiful supplies available.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that fruit market will experience a sales boom
from March to April, with apples and pears becoming favorites and

<HEADLINE> High-tech Zone Powers Past Five-Year Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Xi'an Hi-tech Development Zone
in the capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, one of the
State-class zones established in 1991, has exceeded its targeted
revenues by 25 percent, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Wang Peiqi, director of the zone's
Administrative Committee as saying that by the end of 1995, the
zone's revenues from technology, industry and trade totalled 4.58
billion yuan (about 552 million US dollars) with the total
industrial output value 2.5 billion yuan, 125 percent of
anticipated figures.
</P>
<P>
A further 1.8 billion yuan was invested in infrastructure and
three sq km of construction was completed in the past five years,
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the zone has 2,150 technology-intensive
enterprises, of which 445 are high-tech.
</P>
<P>
The zone has attracted investors from 22 countries and regions,
such as Japan's Toyota and Brothers companies, MEMC Company of the
United States, Phillips of the Netherlands and Canada's Northern
Telecom, and set up 283 overseas-funded projects with 480 million
US dollars of pledged investment.
</P>
<P>
The zone, located in the south suburb of the city, has five
high-tech industrial parks with 22 universities and colleges, 49
research institutes and more than 20 state-owned larged-scale
firms.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, Wang said, the total output value of
the zone should approximate 10 billion yuan (1.2 billion US
dollars), accounting for 10 percent of the city's total. High-tech
firms are expected to number over 1,000.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- An investment and trade
information network will be built with the help of the State
Council to help boost foreign investment in land-locked regions
along the Beijing-Kowloon Railway, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Almost all the 99 counties and cities along the over
2,500-kilometer-long rail are expected to take part in the
system. Information to run through the network is categorized into
two parts -- social or business information, the Daily said.
</P>
<P>
A summary of the investment information of the counties and
cities involved will be put on laser discs and presented to
Chinese diplomats abroad as well as foreign diplomats in China.
</P>
<P>
They will also be shared with investment consultancy institutes
and companies at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Development Research Center under the State Council, which
masterminded the program, will also use its investment promotion
system to send information to the related counties and cities, the
Daily said.
</P>
<P>
The economic reaches of the north-south railway, which is the
longest in China and which is now under trial freight operation,
are estimated to cover 500,000 square kilometers with a
beneficiary population of about 200 million.

<HEADLINE> More Vehicles Roar into Agricultural Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The rapid growth in the
agricultural economy is likely to be fueled by the increase in the
number of vehicles bought, as the output of agri-vehicles is
forecast to jump 10 percent this year, according to today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
Huang Fuheng, the general manager of China Automotive Industry
Sales Corp, said that China's rural population of 900 million
would probably turn out to be the largest group of consumers in
the future auto market, noting that sales of agri-vehicles soared
to 2.2 million units in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The number of agri-vehicles in use by individuals across the
country is approaching 10 million.
</P>
<P>
While excitement grows about China's potential family car
market, hundreds of thousands of three-wheeled motorcars,
four-wheeled vehicles using diesel oil and "walking" tractors that
can do double duty as ploughs are roaring into rural family life.
</P>
<P>
Farmers want simple and economical vehicles, not fabulous cars
with lots of gadgets.
</P>
<P>
Farmers use their vehicles to transport fertilizer, fodder and
seeds in busy seasons and to carry crops after harvest.
</P>
<P>
And in the slack season when fields lie idle, hundreds of
thousands of farmers put these vehicles into commercial use,
carrying either cargo or passengers.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, more and more low-priced minibuses are
replacing the ox cars and horse-drawn carriages as taxis in the
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The country's focus on developing agriculture in the five-year
plan will lead to further investment in grain production, so 1996
should see an upswing in sales of agricultural machinery and motor
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Rapid growth in industrial township enterprises and
self-employed businesses specializing in such sectors as livestock
husbandry, fruit planting and aquatics breeding will provide an
increase in demand for light-duty trucks and mini vans, Huang
said.

FUZHOU, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Coastal Fujian Province, east
China, has built hundreds of kilometers of new navigation channels
over the past decade, linking almost all its rivers with each
other, and with the sea.
</P>
<P>
The province has injected a total of 200 million yuan (24.09
million US dollars) in the construction of over 160 kilometers of
sea channels and over 300 kilometers of inland river channels, to
improve the navigation network.
</P>
<P>
Over 30 million yuan has been spent on the construction of a
channel connecting Minjiang River with the sea, and the harnessing
of six shallow stretches with a combined length of 50 kilometers,
along the river.
</P>
<P>
About 100 million yuan has also been poured into the dredging
of channels in the Fuzhou section of the Minjiang River, enabling
20,000-ton ocean-going ships to pass Fuzhou port during high tides.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 million yuan has been devoted to the dredging and
construction of the 35-kilometer-long channel at Meizhou Bay,
which from September 1994, has enabled the water transportation to
the Fujian Oil Refinery.
</P>
<P>
The province also invested over nine million yuan in the
building of the Fuqing Bay channel for 30,000-ton ships, the first
such project involving overseas funding in the province.

<HEADLINE> Irrigated Farmland Expanded in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Nearly half of China's existing
cultivated land, or 50 million hectares, have been brought under
efficient irrigation, "China Daily" reports today.
</P>
<P>
The past five years have seen an increase of about 800,000 ha
of irrigated land, the paper quoted a Water Resources Ministry
official as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years, he said, more than 10,000 ha of new
farmland with better irrigation guarantees have been built each
year through improving or developing irrigation systems.
</P>
<P>
The increase was particularly notable in the first two years of
the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-95), when it was vital for China
to end a decade-long fluctuation on development of the high-yield
farmland that it experienced in the 1980s, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
About 35-40 percent of the world's grain was produced by only
17 percent of the globe's irrigated land. In China, nearly 70
percent of its grain yields come from its irrigated land, said a
Chinese expert.

ROME, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The Olympic committees of 14
European coutries and top sports federations urged special
treatment for sport on Thursday by European Union legislators
after the Bosman case, according to a new report.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution passed by a simple round of applause,

Thursday's meeting was called by the Italian Olympic Committee
(CONI) following the highly controversial Bosman case which ruled
that European soccer's system of transfers and limits on
foreigners was against EU law.
</P>

The case, bitterly contested by European soccer body UEFA, has
forced all of Europe's professional sports bodies to re-examine
their rules and regulations.

Dick Palmer, the British Olympic Committee secretary general,
said the resolution was of "critical importance" to the future of
European sport.

<HEADLINE> Judge Dismisses Lawsuit Against Gingrich's Former PAC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 29 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. federal judge on
Thursday dismissed a government lawsuit charging that House
Speaker Newt Gingrich's former political action committee broke
federal election laws.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Election Commission (FEC) had contended that GOPAC,
the group Gingrich once headed, helped elect federal candidates
during the 1990 election cycle and should be forced to make public
its donor lists and spending reports.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. District Judge Louis F. Oberdorfer agreed with GOPAC's
contention that the group was only helping state and local
candidates during that period.
</P>
<P>
"Although GOPAC's ultimate major purpose was to influence the
election of Republican candidates for the House of
Representatives, GOPAC's immediate major purpose in 1989 and 1990
was to elect state and local candidates and to develop ideas and
circulate them generally," Oberdorfer wrote in his ruling.
</P>
<P>
GOPAC has been saying for months that the FEC case was little
more than a partisan political attack.
</P>
<P>
FEC spokesman Ron Harris expressed disappointment, saying that
the FEC was reviewing Oberdorfer's ruling to decide whether to
appeal the decision.
</P>
<P>
In his ruling, Oberdorfer said that the FEC had failed to
identify specific federal candidates GOPAC had assisted. To
support its claims, the FEC relied on a series of fund-raising
letters from GOPAC that, while advocating a GOP takeover of the
House, did not identify individuals that donors should support.
</P>
<P>
Oberdorfer's ruling has no bearing on a separate House ethics
complaint, filed by Minority Whip David Bonior, alleging that
Gingrich received improper help from GOPAC.
</P>
<P>
The ethics panel has not yet decided whether to add Bonior's
complaint to an existing probe of Gingrich by the committee's
outside counsel.

<HEADLINE> Slovakia, Russia Differ Over NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, February 29 (Xinhua) -- While visiting Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov reiterated Moscow's opposition to NATO's
eastward expansion today, Slovak President Michal Kovac said his
country is firmly determined to join this military alliance and
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Bratislava on his first trip to Slovakia since he
became foreign minister, Primakov restated Russia's objection to
NATO's eastward expansion. "We oppose the extension of NATO to our
neighbors because this will bring a military infrastructure to the
Russian border and threaten Russia's security," Primakov told
Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar.
</P>
<P>
Primakov admitted that joining the NATO is an internal affair
of the eastern and central European countries and Russia has no
veto right on the issue. But he said, "While we respect the rights
of our neighbors, we also ask them to respect and consider our
interests."
</P>
<P>
The Slovak president told Primakov that Slovakia is determined
to join the EU and the NATO. He noted, however, that Russia's
cooperation is crucial for establishing a European security system
and preventing Europe from splitting.

<HEADLINE> Cuba to Stop New Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban Foreign Ministry
warned today it will take measures to prevent any violation of the
country's air and sea space.
</P>
<P>
The warning, which came five days after Cuba's downing of two
U.S. civilian planes piloted by Cuban exiles, was made in response
to an earlier report that "Brothers to the Rescue", a Cuban
exiles' group headquartered in Miami, was organizing new aircraft
and flotilla to travel toward Cuba next Saturday and enter the
restricted area established by the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Fernandez de Cossio, director of the Foreign Ministry's
United States and Canada Department, warned that if any aircraft
or boats coming from the United States attempt to enter Cuba's sea
and air space, his country will take measures to stop that action.
</P>
<P>
As for the shooting down of the two planes, Cuban Foreign
Minister Roberto Robaina said that Cuba was willing to accept
investigation by the International Civil Aviation Organization.
</P>
<P>
Washington said that the two planes were shot down over
international waters, but Cuba insists that the aircraft had
violated Cuban air space.
</P>
<P>
As the United States plans new sanctions against this Caribbean
island nation, the Vietnamese government and some Chilean
organizations take sides with Cuba, saying that the Cuban air
force shot down the planes to defend sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Chile's House of Friendship With Cuba called the downing of the
two light planes as an international conflict deliberately
provoked to hamper Cuba's process of political and economic
reforms.

<HEADLINE> Killer of Michael Jordan's Father Found Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Daniel Green was convicted
of premeditated murder in the slaying of the father of NBA
superstar Michael Jordan by a jury in Lumberton, North Carolina,
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Green, found guilty of first-degree murder
after a two-month trial, faces a possible sentence of execution,
reposts reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
According to the prosecutor, Green had come upon Jordan asleep in his
luxury car alongside a road and shot him in the chest.
</P>
<P>
Green, who converted to the Moslem faith after his arrest and now goes by
the name Lord Dannayaal As-Saddiq Al-Amin Salaam U'allah, pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
Larry Demery, 20, the state's star witness, who pleaded guilty
last year to participating in Jordan's murder, testified that
Green pulled the trigger.
</P>
<P>
As the other evidence tying Green to the slaying is
circumstantial, Demery's testimony was crucial to the state's case.
</P>
<P>
Police notably picked up the trail of the two young men,
childhood friends, after monitoring Green's conversations on the
cellular phone in the victim's car.

<HEADLINE> Weather Experts Study Chinese Desert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Research into weather conditions at
the heart of the earth's second biggest desert has attracted
attention from meteorologists around the world.
</P>
<P>
Chinese weather experts carried out their detailed studies in
the Taklinakan Desert in southern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The 337,000 sq km desert is the second largest after the Sahara
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists set up two weather stations in 1987, in Manxi
and Tazhong, both in the heart of the desert.
</P>
<P>
Their newly published research records show that the amount of
annual rainfall in those parts of the desert is 26 mm - a higher
level than in the southeastern part of the desert.
</P>
<P>
However, 3,732.6 mm of water evaporates annually in Tazhong,
144 times the level of rainfall in the area.
</P>
<P>
The longest recorded dry period is over 200 days, 70-100 days
less than rain-free spells in the southeastern part of the desert.
</P>
<P>
The heaviest downpour recorded lasted 48 minutes when there was
19.6 mm of rainfall, saturating the ground for two days.
</P>
<P>
Snowfall is rare in the Taklimakan, and snow seldom stays on
the ground. However, records show that snow once left the ground
white for five days.
</P>
<P>
Fog, hail, frost and thunder, common to most people in the
world, only happen once every year in the desert. Yet dew and ice
are common in the area.
</P>
<P>
Wind is the most common natural phenomena in the desert, with
speeds as fast as 20 meters per minute.
</P>
<P>
The lowest surface temperature recorded was minus 21.4 degrees
centigrade.
</P>
<P>
In summer, however, the surface temperature can be as high as
71 degrees centigrade, which makes boots a necessity to protect
feet from the scorching surface.

<HEADLINE> 160,000 Zhejiang Farmers Receive Professional Titles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 1 (Xinhua) -- More than 160,000 farmers and
fishermen in east China's Zhejiang Province have received
professional or academic titles, and 601 of them are senior
agronomists, according to a local report.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang, which was one of the first provinces to adopt the
practice of issuing professional and academic titles to farmers in
China, started the practice in 1989, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The professional titles cover pursuits in agriculture, foresty,
animal husbandry, fisheries and other related fields such as
electricity and grain processing.
</P>
<P>
Recently 1,100 fishermen in Zhoushan City, one of China's major
fish producers, received senior professional titles, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
These incomes of farmers with professional titles are 50
percent more than those of other farmers because they enjoy some
priorities in contracting farmland, and managing the processing of
farm produce and the catching of fish.
</P>
<P>
Chen Liang'en, a senior agronomist in Xiaoshan City, has
developed 10 techniques for planting grain, which have benefited
some 200,000 local farmers in the past decade, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Taxi Supervision to be strengthened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- People in Beijing may have noticed
recently that on the back windows of taxis, including mini-vanes
called "miandi", there is a strip of paper saying in Chinese "one
carriage, one piece of love."
</P>
<P>
That is part of the Municipal Taxi Administration
Bureau's(MTAB) measures to strengthen management and improve
service, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 63,500 taxis in Beijing, operated by
1,496 companies, and 840 individuals.
</P>
<P>
For a long time, except for collecting rents, the taxi
companies took little care of taxi drivers after they contracted
to rent the cabs. Consequently, there are many problems in taxi
services such as fare refusals, unreasonable charges and
impertinence toward passengers.
</P>
<P>
The mini-van cabs are popular for comparatively cheap
fares. Their flag-down price is 10 yuan(1.2 US dollars) for the
first 10 kilometres and 1.5 yuan for each additional
kilometre. However, more drivers have begun to reject passengers
when the destination is near 10 kilometres or is in a downtown
area, as there is little profit to make.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the taxi companies will now be graded by MTAB
under three categories-excellent, fair or bad-according to their
management and service. Those companies that are graded as bad for
two years in succession will be deprived of their business
licences.

<HEADLINE> Life Improves for Poor People in Shanxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, March 1 (Xinhua) -- More than 360,000 people who used
to live under the poverty line in landlocked Shanxi Province have
embarked on the road to prosperity.
</P>
<P>
This is a result of the province's efforts to help its 3.8
million poverty-stricken people.
</P>
<P>
A provincial official said the most effective way to help
people out of poverty is to improve the local living and
production conditions.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years governments at various levels in
Shanxi have allocated a total of 200 million yuan for
infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year 416 poverty-stricken counties had been
linked up with the national highway network. Over 150 boarding
primary schools and 33 township hospitals were built.
</P>
<P>
Instead of providing relief funds and materials to poor
households as it had done in the past, the local government
earmarked funds to build rural industry in many regions and
develop a diversified economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Five years of efforts have
helped south China's Guangdong Province lead the country in the
output value of its electronics industry.
</P>
<P>
The provincial output value of the sector reached 51.5 billion
yuan last year, 4.8 times the 1990 figure.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991-1995 period the province invested seven billion
yuan on technological upgrading of a group of large and hi-tech
projects.
</P>
<P>
Now 20 key projects have gone into operation to generate many
hot-selling products such as program-controlled switchboards and
computers.
</P>
<P>
Last year the output of telephones, switchboards and computers
rose by 260 percent, 1,730 percent, and 1,680 percent,
respectively, from 1990 to reach 16,11 million, 3.34 million, and
120,000.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen and Huizhou are the major local bases to export
electronics products, and the majority of computers parts produced
there are exported.
</P>
<P>
About 50 percent to 90 percent of local electronics products
are exported to foreign countries. In 1995 the province exported
more than seven million telephones, 3.19 million color TV sets,
10.65 million radio-tape recorders, and nearly three million hi-fi
stereo components.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region provided the capital with 4.3 billion kwh of electricity,
one-fourth of the capital's total power supply, in 1995, according
to a report in People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995 the region had increased its capability of
providing power to Beijing to more than 800,000 kw, bringing a
great boost to the city's power supply.
</P>
<P>
With total coal reserves ranking second in the country, Inner
Mongolia has established a strategy of "transforming coal into
power".
</P>
<P>
It has launched a series of power projects in the western part
of the region, such as the Fengzhen Power Plant, First Baotou
Thermal Power Plant and Hohhot Power Plant.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Municipal Government, the Ministry of Power and the
autonomous region's government reached an agreement in 1993,
requiring Inner Mongolia to acquire the ability of providing the
capital with more than 900,000 kw of power by 1995.

TIANJIN, March 1 (Xinhua) -- This second-largest container port
in China expects to handle 800,000 ETUs this year.
</P>
<P>
Last year Tianjin handled a record 700,000 containers,

Harbor Administration.
</P>
<P>
To retain its status as China's second-largest container
handler, the port has built seven container docks and imported a

the volume of container freight has increased at an annual rate of
20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Starting this year, Wang said, Tianjin will play host to the
fifth generation of container ships, which are capable of carrying
5,000 ETUs at a time.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for this, navigation lanes will be deepened and
dock facilities further improved, he added.

BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The State Development Bank of
China has successfully issued 30 billion yen in Samurai bonds on
the Japanese capital market.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the bank has issued bonds on an overseas

<HEADLINE> Olympics Turning Atlanta Into Business Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Atlanta in the Southeast of
the United States has been attracting a growing amount of foreign
investment as the 1996 Olympic Games is drawing near.
</P>
<P>
The Games, to be held in the city from July 19 to August 4 this
year, has brought the city not only business opportunities but
also new jobs, according to a news release issued by the city
government on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The construction, renovation and redevelopment projects related
to hosting the Olympics will cost a total of 2 billion U.S.
dollars. The fund includes 500 million U.S. dollars in venue
construction by the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games.
"These contributed to Atlanta's economic surge," officials said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 55 new companies from 18 countries and regions have
set foot at the city. They included two from the Chinese mainland
and one from Taiwan. Georgia continues to lead the Southeast in
total capital investment by foreign-based firms with 8.8 billion
U.S. dollars in cumulative investment, they said.
</P>
<P>
The number of foreign funded businesses in Atlanta has reached
1,281 and they have a total of 79,521 employees, according to
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Newly established domestic and overseas companies numbered at
260 last year, 16 percent more than the figure of 1994. Atlanta
area has produced 317,000 net new jobs since 1992, the statistics
said.
</P>
<P>
Government officials attributed the vigorous economic
activities to the economic environment which includes "an
unmatched transportation infrastructure, comparatively low costs
of doing business; an outstanding telecommunications
infrastructure; its status as the banking, retail and commercial
capital of the Southeast; and a highly-educated and skilled
workforce."

<HEADLINE> Tourism Booming in Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Tourism has been growing rapidly in
the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in the remote northwest of
China, which is endowed with rich natural and historical wonders
and colorful cultures.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the region received 240,000
overseas tourists in 1995, an increase of 2.4 times over
1990. Foreign currency earnings from tourism rose by four times in
that period to reach 40 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang offers rich and unique tourism resources. Its huge
deserts, ice-capped mountains, hunting grounds and traces of
ancient civilizations are great attractions for tourists. In
addition, the region is home to 13 ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
On its long borders with Mongolia, Pakistan and Russia the
region has opened 14 major crossing points. Since 1991 about
300,000 people from these neighboring nations have crossed into
Xinjiang for sightseeing and shopping.
</P>
<P>
Being keen to develop its tourism, Xinjiang has been making
painstaking efforts to improve its transportation and
telecommunications facilities in recent years.
</P>
<P>
With more and more tourism resources developed and much
improved tourist facilities, the authorities expect that Xinjiang
will see an annual 12 percent growth in tourism soon, making
tourism a major industry in the relatively less-developed
northwest region.

<HEADLINE> Labor Tumbles On Willis' Error: Opinion Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Labor Party
suffered loss of votes as Treasurer Ralph Willis made "an error of
judgment" on publicizing forged letters in the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
The latest national opinion poll showed that voters turned away
from the Labor government after Willis was forced to apologize for
the matter Wednesday, three days before the March 2 federal
election.
</P>
<P>
The Herald-AGB McNair Poll conducted Wednesday and Thursday
nights and each day of the week indicated that Labor slid further
behind the Liberal-National coalition. After all votes were
distributed between the two major political groups, 53 percent of
the people surveyed supported the coalition at Thursday night,
compared with 47 percent for Labor.
</P>
<P>
The supporting rates was 48.5 percent and 51.5 percent for
Labor and the coalition respectively Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In his campaign attack against the coalition, Willis
publicized letters that were allegedly from Jeff Kenett, Liberal
Premier of Victoria, to the opposition leader John Howard. But
later the letters were proved to be forged by an unidentified
person and sent into Willis' office.
</P>
<P>
Willis was forced to apologize for the issue. Keating said that
Willis made "an error of judgment."
</P>
<P>
Howard called for the resignation of Willis. And the local
press have run full-scale coverage of the incident during the past
48 hours.
</P>
<P>
The McNair Poll indicated that Labor would lose at least 16
seats in general if the figures proved to be true tomorrow. This
will mean a comfortable win for the opposition coalition, which
needs only nine extra seats to obtain an absolute majority in the
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The local press said that it was impossible for Labor to make
up such a large gap within the last 24 hours of the election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The opinion poll showed that the only hope for Labor was the 11
percent of voters who have yet to make up their minds.
</P>
<P>
The poll showed that much less people would put Labor on the
top of the ballot than in last election. Labor's primary votes
fell to 39 percent from 44.9 percent in the 1993 election.
</P>
<P>
In the traditional stronghold of Labor -- New South Wales
state, Labor is expected to see a major swing of voters toward the
coalition. It is estimated to lose up to 12 seats in the state,
which played the key role in the re-election of the Labor
government in 1993.

</P>
<P>
Members of the Bosnian Croat Commission for the Exchange of

held in a Bosnian Croat prison were actually in a Muslim prison in
Bihac in western Bosnia, and about 140 in two prisons in Travnik,
central Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Hurtubise said the pows included 62 persons suspected of war
crimes, of whom six were charged by Muslims, 51 by Croats and five
by Serbs.

<HEADLINE> Olympics Turning Atlanta into Business Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Atlanta in the Southeast of
the United States has been attracting a growing amount of foreign
investment as the 1996 Olympic Games is drawing near.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic Games, to be held in the city from July 19 to
August 4 this year, has brought the city not only business
opportunities but also new jobs, according to a news release
issued by the city government today.
</P>
<P>
The construction, renovation and redevelopment projects related
to hosting the Olympics will cost a total of 2 billion U.S.
dollars. The fund includes 500 million U.S. dollars in venue
construction by the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games.
"These contributed to Atlanta's economic surge," officials said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 55 new companies from 18 countries and regions have
set foot at the city. They included two from the Chinese mainland
and one from Taiwan. Georgia continues to lead the Southeast in
total capital investment by foreign-based firms with 8.8 billion
U.S. dollars in cumulative investment, they said.
</P>
<P>
The number of foreign funded businesses in Atlanta has reached
1,281 and they have a total of 79,521 employees, according to
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Newly established domestic and overseas companies numbered at
260 last year, 16 percent more than the figure of 1994. Atlanta
area has produced 317,000 net new jobs since 1992, according to
the statistics.
</P>
<P>
Government officials attributed the vigorous economic
activities to the economic environment which includes "an
unmatched transportation infrastructure, comparatively low costs
of doing business; an outstanding telecommunications
infrastructure; its status as the banking, retail and commercial
capital of the Southeast; and a highly-educated and skilled
workforce."

<HEADLINE> .bny:e:n:hsz:e:hsz:96/02/29/20/11 eaed022917hke -- Roundup: 3rd Force Backs Lebed in Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 29 (Xinhua) -- A new coalition of Russian
centrists and "hard-liners," ambitiously calling itself Third
Force, has announced that it will back retired General Alexander
Lebed, former commander of Russia's 14th army in Moldova's
breakaway Dniestr region, in his race for presidency.
</P>
<P>
By supporting Lebed, one of the leaders of the moderate
nationalist Congress of Russian Communities (KRO), the coalition
gives a challenge to the two major rivals for presidency --
President Boris Yeltsin and Communist Party leader Gennady
Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
The coalition was founded by well-known eye-surgeon Svytoslav
Fyodorov, film director Stanislav Govorukhin, former government
minister Sergei Glazyev and leftist hard-liner Sergei Baburin,
leader of Russia's All-People Union (ROS).
</P>
<P>
"We want to unite the voters who do not wish to choose between
the two major rivals for presidency -- communist Gennady Zyuganov
and Boris Yeltsin," said Konstantin Zatulin, one of the leaders of
the KRO and architect of the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Zatulin told reporters Thursday that under the agreement, the
coalition members, all potential nominees themselves, will
withdraw from the presidential race in favor of the front runner.
</P>
<P>
The coalition is also planning to garner support from
Derzhava (Great Power) party leader Alexander Rutskoi, former
Russian vice-president, and some other centrist blocs.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts here believe that Lebed has a limited
electorate since he represents the interests of some military and
a small segment of patriotically-minded civilians lured by the
idea of a strong state.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there are reasons to doubt that Fyodorov will make
way for Lebed or any other candidate. Speaking recently to
independent NTV television, he angrily dismissed such possibility
and insisted that he has good chances to become head of state
himself.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Baburin's ROS voiced support last weekend for
Zyuganov as the single candidate for presidency. The presidential
elections are scheduled for June 16.
</P>
<P>
As of now, Lebed is metaphorically a "general without army."
He can only gain real support from his KRO which is in deep
crisis after a turning defeat at last December's parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
According to Zatulin, KRO leader Yuri Skokov "sets his private
opinions against the will of the KRO congress which nominated
Lebed as a candidate for presidency." Earlier, experts here warned
Lebed that his allies only wanted to use his image to get seats in
the State Duma (lower house of parliament).
</P>
<P>
Skokov, after failing to win a Duma seat, changed the tactics
of supporting Lebed in trying to strip him of all political
prospects, the Itar-Tass news agency's analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Betrayed by Skokov, Lebed dashed "from the frying pan into the
fire" -- in the Duma he joined a pro-communist group of former
Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov.
</P>
<P>
The analysts believe Lebed made that move in the hope of
getting a defense minister portfolio in case of the communists'
victory at the forthcoming elections. But Zatulin does not
believe that the alliance between the general and the communists
is possible.
</P>
<P>
Still, Lebed remains an attractive personality for the
so-called Third Force, although it has no real influence so far.

<HEADLINE> US Consumers More Confident of Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New York, February 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Consumers, plagued by
news about layoffs, strikes, storms, a partial shutdown of the
Government and swollen business inventories in January, felt more
upbeat about the economy.
</P>
<P>
A latest survey, conducted by the Conference Board, a New York
research organization, reported that confidence among its sample
of 5000 households rebounded to 97 this month from 88.4 in
January.
</P>
<P>
The confidence rebounding was found in eight of nine regions,
with Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin showing a
decline.
</P>
<P>
The January decline was a result of convergence of most
one-time events,"rather than a signal from consumers that severe
economic hardship was on the way", Edgar R. Fieldler, counselor
to the Conference Board, was quoted by the study as saying.
</P>
<P>
Although consumer confidence is not robust, analysts said, the
surge in February suggested that further deterioration in the
economy was not likely.
</P>
<P>
Analysts also took the finding as support for the recent
assessment by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve,
that economic weakness would likely proved temporary.

<HEADLINE> IRA Rejects Immediate Restoration of Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Army today
rejected appeals by Britain and Ireland for immediate restoration
of ceasefire, saying that it would maintain its commitment to the
"free exercise" of the right to national self-determination.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in the name of its governing Army
Council, the IRA said that the ceasefire broke down because of
Britain's refusal to hold ministerial talks with Sinn Fein, its
political wing.
</P>
<P>
"The failure by the British government to put in place
inclusive negotiations free from preconditions, the abuse of the
peace process by the British over 18 months, and the absence of an
effective and democratic approach capable of providing an
irrevocable momentum towards a just and lasting peace in Ireland
were the critical elements which led to the failure of the Irish
peace process," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Any end to the 25-year Northern Irish conflict "demands an
inclusive negotiated settlement without preconditions", the
statement stressed.
</P>
<P>
While making no mention of a ceasefire, the statement, however,
did not exclude the possibility that the truce could be restored
at a later date.
</P>
<P>
"We repeat that we are prepared to face up to our
responsibilities. Others need to do likewise," it said.
</P>
<P>
The IRA statement followed a summit meeting between British
prime minister John Major and his Irish counterpart John Bruton in
London yesterday, at which they unveiled plans to hold all-party
talks on a lasting Northern Ireland settlement.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders said Sinn Fein would only be invited if the
ceasefire was restored.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, France Sign Nuclear Energy Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 29 (Xinhua) -- An umbrella agreement on
nuclear cooperation and trade between South Africa and France was
signed today.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also signed a more specific agreement on
cooperation in industrializing South Africa's Atomic Energy
Corporation's (AEC) molecular laser isotope separation (MLIS)
technology for the commercial enrichment of uranium.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Cape Town, South African Mineral and
Energy Affairs Minister Pik Botha said the AEC was recognized as
a world leader in MLIS technology, which could double the value
of South Africa's uranium exports, presently worth about 54.8
million US dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
The MLIS technology is one of two emerging laser-based
enrichment processes that will play a significant role in the
future international uranium enrichment market, currently valued
at about 4.1 billion US dollars per year.
</P>
<P>
Botha also said the agreement was subject to an international
agreement confining any cooperation and exchange of know-how and
technology to peaceful uses only.

<HEADLINE> US Study Reveals Huge Expenses from Smoking,  Drinking, Drug Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New York, February 29 (Xinhua) -- One of five U.S. dollars New
Yorkers pay in city taxes is spent on coping with the effects of
smoking, drinking and drug use, according to a study available
here today.
</P>
<P>
The calculation was made by the Center for Addiction and
Substance Abuse at Columbia University with 1994 as the analyzed
year.
</P>
<P>
The study was described by the center as one of the first
attempts to calculate the cost of substance abuse to a major
American city.
</P>
<P>
In that year, substance abuse cost New york City 20 billion
dollars. Much of the total went to pay for criminal justice costs,
medical bills, social welfare programs and damage to business and
property, the study said.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco accounted for 4 billion dollars of the 20 billion
dollars total estimated cost to the city. Smoking did not generate
the crime associated with drug and alcohol abuse, but "It has by
far the largest health-care cost," the study quoted Joseph A.
Califano Jr, the center's chairman as saying.
</P>
<P>
Because of drug addiction and alcoholism, it observed, mothers
are reluctant to let children play unsupervised in the parks,
children walk to school along routes protected by the police,
churches open only for worship services and many storekeepers
unlock their door only in response to a ringing bell.
</P>
<P>
The substance abuse "affects how city residents play, learn,
worship, receive medical care, go to and from work and school,
shop, war jewelry, carry their pocketbooks, drive and park their
cars, secure their apartments and homes and raise their children"
the study said.

<HEADLINE> Shumeiko Sure of Yeltsin Win in Re-election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The former Federation Council
(upper house of the Russian parliament) speaker Vladimir Shumeiko,
now the leader of the Reforms-New Course (RNK) bloc, said today
that president Boris Yeltsin will carry a day in the forthcoming
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, Shumeiko stressed that Yeltsin
"will undoubtedly win the election on June 16, and our business is
to secure the victory for him."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, 65, declared in the middle of the month that he will
run a second term of office.
</P>
<P>
At a conference held this morning, the RNK led by Shumeiko was
unanimously in favor of Yeltsin's re-election for a new term.
</P>
<P>
According to Shumeiko, Our Home Is Russia bloc lead by Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, the public committee led by former
presidential administration chief Sergei Filatov and the RNK might
act as a "crystallization center" in the pre-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that parties and coalitions embarking on the
Yeltsin-promoting campaign are to meet for a conference on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, Yavlinsk, leader of the Yabloko bloc, said today that
his bloc will never support Yeltsin's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Yegor Gaidar, former acting Prime Minister
currently leading Russia's Democratic Choice (DVR), in a
face-to-face talk with Yeltsin set three conditions on which
Yeltsin will enjoy his bloc support at the forthcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
The first condition was to put an end to the Chechen war. The
second, Gaidar urged the president to revise his personnel
policies. Gaidar said the third condition was that a "fiscal
policy should not become hostage of the election campaign."
</P>
<P>
"Now, it is Boris Yeltsin's turn to answer democrats whether he
is prepared (to meet) our counter-conditions on which we would
support his candidacy in the forthcoming election," Gaidar said.
In his words, Yeltsin was listening to him "seriously and
carefully."

ANKARA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Ministry said
today that no fuss should be made about Thursday's incident in
which a Greek missile ship and a Turkish coast guard vessel
collided around the disputed Aegean rocks.
</P>
<P>
Only minor damages were reported but each side claimed that
the incident had taken in its own waters and blamed the other for
the incident.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Anatolia News Agency quoted a Foreign Ministry
official as saying that the incident should not be exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
"The incident should not be seen as an increase in
tension. But it indicates the potential danger of a stand-by in
the Aegean," said the source. "The only way for the two sides to
end the danger is to sit at the negotiating table and talk."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ankara denied the report from Athens that the Greek
government had protested against Ankara for the incident.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Turkish ambassador to Athens, who
had been recalled to Ankara for consultations following the
deterioration in Greek-Turkish relations, will return to his post
Sunday, said local press.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both NATO allies, came close to a war one
