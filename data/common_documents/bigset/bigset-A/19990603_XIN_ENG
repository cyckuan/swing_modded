<HEADLINE> Zambia Studies Maize Production Cost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 2 (Xinhua) --Zambia has started a cost study of
maize, the staple crop of the African country, in a bid to boost
its agricultural competitiveness in the region.
</P>
<P>
With favorable climate and soil for maize production, Zambia
failed to compete favorably with that from neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest magazine of the Zambia Farmer, the
study, sponsored by the Zambia National Farmers Union, would
search for the cause of the poor efficiency of maize production
and compare its costs with that of other countries in the region
and North and South Americas.
</P>
<P>
The study will impact significantly on the livestock, poultry
and dairy sectors and also benefit coffee, cotton, wheat, soya and
tobacco productions in the country.

<HEADLINE> International Court Concerned About Legality of NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 2 (Xinhua)-- A British Committee said on Wednesday
that the International Court of Justice at the Hague had expressed
the "profound concern" about the legality of NATO's military
actions against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Committee for Peace in the Balkans, chaired by Alice Mahon,
a Parliamentary Member (MP) from the Labour Party, said in a
statement that the profound concern would be "reflected by the
hundreds of thousands of demonstrators world-wide who will march
on Saturday, 5 June against NATO bombing."
</P>
<P>
Although the International Court of Justice considered itself,
for technical reasons, "not competent" to judge Yugoslavia's
application against NATO bombing, it is of note that presiding
Judge Christopher Weeramantry said that the action "raises very
serious issues of international law," the statement noted.
</P>
<P>
The committee said its statement echoed the many legal voices
who have challenged the legality of NATO's action, including that
the action is in clear breach of the United Nations Charter, that
NATO has targeted civilians in violation of the Geneva Conventions
and that NATO leaders have authorised the use of poisonous weapons
calculated to cause unnecessary suffering, such as depleted
uranium ammunition and cluster bombs.
</P>
<P>
It said the committee was planning a demonstration against NATO
bombing in London.
</P>
<P>
"Thousands of people will add the expression of their own
concern to that of the International Court, by demonstrating in
London on Saturday 5 June," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Committee for Peace in the Balkans, which was established
in 1991 to promote peace and reconciliation in the former Yugoslav
nations, also strongly criticized NATO's bombing of the hospital
at Surdulica on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"This action is yet another blatant and brutal assertion of US
power, using NATO as its missile," it quoted Playwright Harold
Pinter, who was scheduled to speak at Saturday's demonstration, as
saying.

WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
announced Wednesday that the United States will send 7,000 U.S.
ground troops to Kosovo as part of a peacekeeping force of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
The U.S. had planned to send 4,000 troops to the Yugoslav

decided to send more after NATO increased the number to 5,0000.
</P>

Earlier on Wednesday, the West and Russia settled last-minute
differences over a Kosovo peace plan that Moscow's Balkan envoy
Viktor Chernomyrdin said provided a "realistic chance" for ending
the war in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said in Bonn both NATO and Russia would send
troops under their own respective command to Kosovo as part of a

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Economy Experiences Dramatic Recovery: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
said that the national economy has undergone dramatic recovery
since 1986 due to the good policies of the National Resistance
Movement (NRM), the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
He made these remarks when opening the fourth session of the
sixth Parliament at the International Conference Center here
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The recovery has been recorded in macro-economic stabilization,
 liberalization, privatization, infrastructure and social services
 development.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate was as high as 20 percent in 1986 when the
ruling party came to power. Now it has dropped to 5 percent. The
country's gross domestic product (GDP) has more than doubled in
the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth averages 5.6 percent in the past decade and
a rate of 7.8 percent is projected for the current financial year
ending by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Although the minimum goals have been achieved, he noted, the
government still needs to transform the fundamental character of
the neo-colonial- dependent economy.
</P>
<P>
He said that the long-term target of the government is to
ensure transformation of the neo-colonial economy into a modern,
integrated and self-sustaining national economy.
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old president listed education, infrastructure,
health and security continue to the areas of priority for the
government in the years to come.

<HEADLINE> DRC Minister Appeals Son to Abandon Rebellion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic Republic of
Congolese (DRC) Minister of Industry and Economy Bemba Saolona,
father of one of rebel leaders fighting to oust President Laurent
Kabila, appealed to Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni Tuesday to
convince his son to abandon rebellion.
</P>
<P>
The minister, one of the six members of the visiting delegation
from Kinshasa, made known his appeal at a press conference, the
New Vision paper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said his son, leader of the Congolese Liberation Army (MLC)
fighting in the northern part of the country, was trained by
Ugandans as a soldier.
</P>
<P>
The minister, a millionaire in the mineral-rich country, was
jailed for some days by Kabila on suspicion of dealing with rebels
who control nearly half of Africa's third largest country. He was
released and made minister in March at the height on an offensive
by MLC in northwestern DRC.
</P>
<P>
The junior Bemba, however, said that he was fighting to stop
the injustice in the country, adding that his father's political
line does not in the least affect his cause.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for More U.N. Role in Kosovo Peace Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese diplomat
said Wednesday that the United Nations should play an important
role in seeking a political settlement to the Kosovo crisis, and
called for an immediate end to the on-going NATO bombing to pave
the way for a political solution.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang, deputy Chinese permanent representative to the
United Nations, told the Security Council that "We hold, as
always, it is the only way out for a solution to the Kosovo crisis
to resume the United Nations role in the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Shen made the remarks at the close-door Security Council
session to hear the briefing by Sergio Vieira de Mello, U.N.
undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs, on the findings
in his recent visit to Kosovo and other parts of Yugoslavia. U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan was present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council should play an important role in the
process of a political solution, and we appreciate the efforts by
the Secretary-General in this regard," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It would be of great sadness for all its Member States if the
United Nations remains a onlooker on the important issue
concerning war and peace at a time when the air strikes has
entered 71st day," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We reject any effort to marginalise the United Nations, nor do
we accept that the United Nations is only limited to its role in
addressing humanitarian problems and the post-war reconstruction,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We once again called upon NATO to immediately end its bombing
to pave the way for a political solution," he said, adding that
efforts should be made to strengthen a U.N. task force headed by
the Deputy U.N. Secretary-General, Louise Frechette.
</P>
<P>
"What is most important is that the task force should not only
discuss the contingent plan and post-war reconstruction, but also
should concentrate on discussing how to promote a ceasefire and
seek a political solution," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shen said, "The Chinese Mission condemns all
violence in Kosovo, and deplores the bombing and destruction of
numerous civilian houses and shops, and sympathizes with more than
7,000,000 Kosovar refugees."
</P>
<P>
"We maintain that the rights of all ethnic groups in Kosovo
should be protected, and those refugees have the right to return
home in safety at an early date," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that he was also concerned at the fact that NATO is
creating the most serious humanitarian catastrophe since the end
of the World War II in the Balkans under the pretext of
humanitarianism.
</P>
<P>
The bombing caused a lot of deaths among innocent civilians,
and destroyed Yugoslavia's economic infrastructure, he said,
adding that all these can not justify what NATO is saying about
its motives of bombing.
</P>
<P>
NATO, without the authorisation of the U.N. Security Council,
unilaterally launched air strikes on Yugoslavia, a sovereign and
independent member, on March 24, thus violating the U.N. Charter
and international law.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Israeli Militia Retreats from Most of Jezzine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The pro-Israeli South Lebanon
Army (SLA) Wednesday evacuated 24 villages around Jezzine in south
Lebanon and may complete its withdrawal from the town by the end
of this week after 14 years of occupation.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said that the SLA militiamen are congregated
in the center of Jezzine and other four villages to await the
final pullout to the Israeli occupied border zone in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said Lebanese police units crossed into the Jezzine
district before dawn to patrol the villages already vacated by
the SLA.
</P>
<P>
But, the tension in the town is still high while most of the
city's shops, cafes, cinemas and businesses are closed for the
second consecutive day, residents reached by telephone said,
adding that journalists are not allowed to enter the town.
</P>
<P>
The militia's withdrawal, which began Monday night, came under
the pressure of Hezbollah' attacks that have killed more than 100
militiamen and wounded about 400 others around Jezzine in the
past 14 years.
</P>
<P>
The 2,500-strong SLA, established in 1985, is financed and
trained by Israeli forces to help patrol the security zone set up
by Israel in south Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of
protecting its northern flank from Lebanese guerrillas's
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been
leading a war of attrition trying to oust the Israeli occupation
forces and its proxy SLA out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Jezzine, just north of the zone, has been under control of the
militia since 1985.
</P>
<P>
Although Israeli warplanes provided air cover, the retreating
SLA met with Hezbollah's intensified attacks, in which three
militiamen were killed and another wounded in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
Israeli forces retaliated by staging dozens of air raids on
Hezbollah targets close to the withdrawal route, wounding three
Syrian workers and a Lebanese woman.
</P>
<P>
The escalating tensions prompted the United States to send out
appeals to Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, Lebanon and
Israel for stringent restraint so that the withdrawal would be
completed smoothly.

LUANDA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government forces
announced that they have recaptured Cuima, a city 73 kilometers
south of Huambo, a major city in central Angola, after they
recaptured several other cities recently.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Sunday, the government said that the
government forces killed over 10 military men of the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), captured
another three, and seized a lot of weapons in the battle over the
city.
</P>
<P>
The government forces drove UNITA military out of Tchicala
Tcholoanga City, about 50 kilometers west of Huambo last week, and
then on Saturday re- claimed Tchidinji, a city about 100
kilometers west of Huambo, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The government forces also destroyed one of UNITA's military
bases about 60 kilometers east of Huambo, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The government forces have since mid-May launched large scale
offensive against the UNITA, with fighting mainly concentrated on
central Angola's Huambo and Kuito cities, after the government
announced never to open peace talks with UNITA again.

KAMPALA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has assured depositors of closed banks that they would get back
their money.
</P>
<P>
In his State of Nation Address delivered at the opening of the
fourth session of the Parliament here Wednesday afternoon, the
president said that there will have to be an audit to establish
what is owed to depositors.
</P>
<P>
On the recent closure of some commercial banks, Museveni said
that only banks which adhere to the regulations governing banking
will be allowed to exist.
</P>
<P>
He rejected any attempt to politicize the closure of banks,
saying that the banks were closed because they were insolvent and
not for any other reason.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Uganda has closed the International Credit Bank,
Transafrica Bank, Greenland Bank and the Cooperative Bank because
of mismanagement and insolvency in the last 10 months, leaving
many depositors of these banks crying for their money.
</P>
<P>
The closure of banks sent waves of panic among the general
public who do not know which bank is safe and sound.
</P>
<P>
The government, however, regards this as an indication that the
banking sector is getting healthier and better for the economy.

HARARE, June 2 (Xinhua) -- International mining giant Broken
Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP) Wednesday announced in
Harare that it is pulling out of the Hartley and Mhondoro platinum
joint ventures in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The Australian company cited negative cash flows experienced
since operation started in 1996 as the major reason for the
pull-out.
</P>
<P>
President of BHP in Zimbabwe John Grubb told a press conference
that operational and financial under-performance at Hartley
platinum, 80 km west of the capital, was primarily caused by the
unstable ground conditions.
</P>
<P>
He said this resulted in expensive safety problem, loss of
reserves and the unacceptable dilution of ore.
</P>
<P>
He said the company was consulting with the Zimbabwean
government and other interested parties on the fate of 3,573
workers and about 800 contract workers.
</P>
<P>
The platinum project began in 1996 as the largest single
investment since the country got independence in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Grubb said BHP had put in 585 million U.S. dollars and had only
realized 40 million U.S. dollars revenue on sales.
</P>
<P>
"This is purely a geological problem which has affected the
quality of the ore and caused us to spend more money on safety
measures," he said.

BAGHDAD, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Iraq warned on Wednesday that the
severe shortage of water now facing the country will dangerously
affect its agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Irrigation Undersecretary Abdul Jabbar Salman told a
news conference that the irrigation of Iraqi agriculture relies
heavily on rivers and canals which are in urgent need of
dredging.
</P>
<P>
Salman said the silt deposited in the riverbeds makes it
difficult for water to reach cultivated lands.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraq needs 700 excavators to dredge these rivers
and canals, adding that Iraq has only 200 excavators, and they
are in poor conditions and need repairing.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the U.N. Sanctions Committee for delaying and
hindering the approval of contracts concluded by the Irrigation
Ministry, adding that only 27 contracts out of 70 were approved
by the committee.
</P>
<P>
A total of 113 million U.S. dollars were allocated for the
Irrigation Ministry in the five phases of the U.N. oil-for-food
program, said Salman, adding that only 23 million dollars worth
of contracts had been approved by the Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
These contracts were signed with foreign companies to purchase
equipment, machines, pumps and spare parts that are badly needed
for the agriculture sector, he added.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Government Will Not Control Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government will not
announce prices of basic commodities yet because dialog between
industry and other stakeholders is still in progress, a senior
official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of the Industry and Commerce Ministry Obert
Mpofu said that the government could only resort to price controls
when all other channels have failed.
</P>
<P>
"There is absolutely no need to gazette prices yet because
negotiations are in progress," the Zimbabwe News Agency quoted
Mpofu as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mpofu's remarks came at a time of reports that prices of the
staple maize-meal could increase by about 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government discarded the system of price controls in the
early 1990s when it opted for trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
However, because of escalating prices of basic commodities like
maize- meal, sugar, cooking oil and flour, the government late
last year set up a National Economic Consultative Forum to study
the pricing mechanism for basic commodities in the country to make
food stuffs affordable for consumers.
</P>
<P>
Although the government has not officially announced prices,
threats to do so have been issued by several ministries to force
manufacturers to keep prices of essential goods affordable.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have already
 expressed concern at the government's threats to revert to price
controls.

TEHRAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi on Wednesday dismissed allegations on Tehran's
support for Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Terming the allegations as "baseless," Asefi said that the PKK
had no training base or medical camp on the Iranian soil as raised
during the on-going trial of the PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that these claims were aimed at tarnishing the cordial
relations existing between Iran and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
There is a good level of understanding and cooperation on
security matters to prevent possible misuse by opposition elements
of either country's territory against the other, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian spokesman said that the arrangements agreed upon
by Iran and Turkey to look into incidents involving security
matters along their common border have continued to be actively
enforced based on mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Ankara Security Court No. 2 on Monday started the
trial of Ocalan on charges of treason, during which Ocalan listed
Iran as one of the collaborators of his group.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 15-year-long war for an independent
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey, which has claimed over
37,000 lives since August 1984.

<HEADLINE> UNSCOM Recommends Sending Team to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Chief U.N. weapons inspector
Richard Butler on Wednesday recommended sending a team to Iraq to
dispose of chemical and biological samples left behind in Iraq by
his staff last December.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the United Nations Security Council, Butler,
Executive Chairman of the United Nations Special Commission in
charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, said
materials left behind in the laboratory based in Baghdad's Canal
Hotel consists of tiny quantities of chemical agents used to
calibrate equipment and "do not represent a threat, even in case
of an accident."
</P>
<P>
Butler said the materials were left behind because he
originally believed inspectors would gone back to Iraq soon after
the U.S.-led military strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Russia called an emergency meeting of the Security Council
Tuesday to discuss the chemical substances Butler made some
explanations at the meeting, saying that the chemical substances
were of no danger.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council requested Butler submit a report to
give further information about the matter.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM has not gone back to Iraq to resume its work since
the U.S.-led military strikes against the country last December
and Iraq has vowed not to cooperate with it any longer.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Launch Survey on Family Income, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Central Statistical
Authority of Ethiopia said here Wednesday that a two-phase survey
on family income, consumption and expenditures will start from
selected residential councils of capital Addis Ababa over the
coming two months.
</P>
<P>
Samiya Zekeria, deputy general manager of the authority, said
that the survey is to be conducted on over 26,000 sample families
across the nation.
</P>
<P>
It will focus on the background and personal status of family
members, their weekly consumption of, among others, food and drink
as well as their overall income, the Ethiopian News Agency quoted
Zekeria as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that the survey will help identify the basic
problems affecting the living standards of the people in the
metropolis.
</P>
<P>
She called on capital residents to give full cooperation to the
data collectors, saying that data collectors would repeatedly call
on target families in the course of the survey.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier announcement by the authority, the
first phase of the survey will be conducted in June and July this
year, while the second phase would be carried out in December this
year and January next year.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia Says More NATO Troops Let in but not for Invasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Macedonian Prime
Minister Ljubco Georgievski said on Wednesday that Macedonia
agrees to let in up to 30,000 NATO troops, but they should not be
used as an invasion force against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference after meeting U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Georgievski said that if
NATO decides to launch an invasion against Yugoslavia, Macedonia
will have to debate it.
</P>
<P>
"I have to say that in the Republic of Macedonia, there is a
parliamentary position that its territory should not be used for
attacks on any of the neighbors," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He added that other countries on the Balksans had the same
position. "I have to remind you that this is not only Macedonia in
the Balkans that have the same position."
</P>
<P>
Even members of the alliance like Greece and Hungary held the
same position.
</P>
<P>
"If it comes to a change in the NATO position to use ground
troops we will be following the debate, and when the proposal
comes, we will have to put the proposal to the Macedonian
parliament again," he said.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia currently has 16,000 NATO troops on its territory as
a nucleus for the Kosovo force and has been working closely with
the Western alliance in giving shelter to almost 250,000 ethnic
Albanians from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We participate in the operation as no other country does,
first hosting the 16,000 NATO troops and now, according to the
latest request by Mr. Solana (NATO Secretary-General), I believe
that this figure will rise up to 30,000," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Albright assures him that Macedonia will receive more economic
aid from the United States.
</P>
<P>
"For our part we will work to see that Macedonia continues to
receive the full political and economic support it needs in these
very difficult times," Albright added.
</P>
<P>
Albright said a supplemental spending bill passed by Congress
in May provided 22 million U.S. dollars in economic assistance for
Macedonia and 15 million U.S. dollars in technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said Macedonian
agreement was important but not a big surprise.
</P>
<P>
"It's part of what's necessary to get the deployment started
early to move quickly in the event that President Milosevic
finally accepts NATO's terms," he added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S. African Poll Peaceful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The second democratic general
election in South Africa is peaceful although the process has been
slow across the country.
</P>
<P>
The voting is running smoothly and a high turnout is expected
as long queues are reported at polling stations.
</P>
<P>
Fears that a flood of unregistered voters would arrive at
polling stations and demand to vote, did not materialize.
</P>
<P>
Across the country, only small hitches were reported. Some
stations opened late, others did not have voting materials on time
and officials reported problems with their "zip-zip" bar code
scanning equipment.
</P>
<P>
No serious disruptions were reported in so-called "flash
points". Voting in the highly volatile KwaZulu-Natal Midlands was
not overshadowed by two shooting incidents in Richmond overnight,
where two women were killed.
</P>
<P>
In the flash point of Nongoma, an Inkatha Freedom Party
stronghold, voting proceeded peacefully under the watchful eye of
a strong security force contingent deployed in and around the
town, according to South African Press Association (SAPA).
</P>
<P>
In Lydenburg, Mpumalanga, police found and detonated what they
thought was a bomb placed near a school being used as a polling
station but it later turned out to be just a commonplace parcel.
</P>
<P>
In parts of Johannesburg, large numbers of people had begun
queuing from as early as 4:00 a.m. (0200 GMT) and the country's
largest black townships of Soweto were quiet.
</P>
<P>
In Pretoria, there was no sign of voter apathy with long queues
observed in traditionally white areas and black townships alike.
</P>
<P>
In townships like Mamelodi, Soshanguve and Mabopane, voters
said they did not mind queuing for long hours to make their cross.
 Many arrived at 5:00 a.m., and some even spent the night outside
polling stations.
</P>
<P>
Voting got off to a brisk start in the Western Cape although at
some stations ballot papers arrived late.
</P>
<P>
All 1,309 polling stations in the province were open and
functioning by 1:00 p.m. and the police reported that all was well
despite political tension between African National Congress (ANC)
and United Democratic Movement in some areas.
</P>
<P>
In North-West Province, thousands of people stood in queues
long before voting stations opened. A few voting stations in the
Kuruman area opened later than scheduled, but no serious problems
were reported.
</P>
<P>
In the Umtata area of the Transkei in the Eastern Cape, voters
began lining up at polling stations well before they opened.
</P>
<P>
In Free State, all polling stations were in operation by noon,
SAPA quoted provincial electoral officer Chris Mepha as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said since the Free State was a "low-risk" area and a high
level of political tolerance existed, no serious politically
motivated problems were anticipated.
</P>
<P>
President Nelson Mandela made his mark early in the morning at
the Transvaal Automobile Club near his home in Houghton,
Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
He said the excitement was less intense this time than it was
in 1994. "It is a very wonderful occasion."
</P>
<P>
Later in the morning, during a visit to the Independent
Electoral Commission results center in Pretoria, he praised the
commission, saying that the election appeared to be well prepared.
</P>
<P>
ANC President Thabo Mbeki, who seems set to be the next state
president, cast his vote in Pretoria shortly after 7:00 a.m.
</P>
<P>
The president-in-waiting said that the low level of violence in
the run up to the election was a good omen for a free and fair
outcome.
</P>
<P>
Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, touring
Pretoria voting stations in his capacity as Home Affairs Minister,
said that he was very impressed with the electorate because they
had come out in large numbers to vote.
</P>
<P>
"I am very encouraged by what I see," Buthelezi said. "I would
like to congratulate the voters because they have made me very
proud."
</P>
<P>
The very first result of the vote is expected late Wednesday
night and the final result will be announced by the Independent
Electoral Commission within seven days.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has 22.8 million eligible voters, of whom more
than 18 million had registered for Wednesday's vote.
</P>
<P>
At stake are 400 seats in the National Assembly and seats in
provincial legislatures, which vary from province to province with
the population.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is using the electoral system called proportional
representation, under which a political party's representation in
parliament is in proportion to the percentage of votes it receives
in the election.
</P>
<P>
The state president will be elected by parliamentarians, and
provincial premiers by provincial legislators.
</P>
<P>
Polling stations across the country were opened at 7:00 a.m.
and will be closed at 9:00 p.m.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the Independent Electoral Commission
regulations, voters already in the queue by 9:00 p.m. will be
allowed to vote.

<HEADLINE> S. African Voters Queuing After Dark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Large numbers of voters
continued to queue outside polling stations across South Africa
after dark, but officials ruled out an extension of the poll to
accommodate late comers, South African Press Association (SAPA)
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Independent Electoral Commission spokesman Victor Dlamini said
in Pretoria that polls would be kept open for voters already in
queues by the 9:00 p.m. (1900 GMT) deadline to allow them to cast
their ballots, but late comers would not be admitted.
</P>
<P>
The electoral official confirmed long queues were still waiting
to vote, particularly in densely populated areas in Gauteng and
KwaZulu-Natal, and said the police and army would be requested to
beef up security after dark outside these stations.
</P>
<P>
"We do expect that by 9:00 p.m. we will be dealing with the
tail end of the process," he said.
</P>
<P>
After nightfall, thousands of people were still queuing outside
polling stations in Alexandra, a large black township north of
Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted an electoral commission presiding officer as saying
that the process was time consuming as illiterate people needed
help when casting their vote.
</P>
<P>
There were also security concerns as Alexandra is one of the
most dangerous areas in the country.
</P>
<P>
Reports from around two-thirds of the 14,650 polling stations
throughout the country at 4:00 p.m. showed around 24 percent of
the country's 18.3 million registered voters had cast their
ballots, and optimistic electoral officials said the first results
would start coming in by 11:00 p.m. (2100 GMT), just two hours
after the scheduled close of polls.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Independent Electoral Commission and several
political leaders interpreted the long queues as a sign of a high
turnout, and observers called the poll peaceful.
</P>
<P>
Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi said not a single
incident of poll-related violence had marred the country's second
democratic polls by 6:00 p.m.

<HEADLINE> Barak Reiterates Wish to Include Likud in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister-elect
Ehud Barak Wednesday reiterated that he wants to include the
right-wing Likud Party in his new government.
</P>
<P>
Barak made the remarks after meeting with Ariel Sharon,
Likud's temporary leader, in Tel Aviv over forming a broad-based
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Barak noted that he will resume the peace
process immediately after he sets up the new government.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he wishes to meet U.S. President Bill
Clinton and leaders of other Middle East countries immediately
following the establishment of the government.
</P>
<P>
Sharon, outgoing Foreign Minister of the Likud government,
said that his meeting with Barak was constructive and
negotiations between the two parties will continue.
</P>
<P>
In Israel's May 17 elections, Barak, leader of the left-wing
One Israel coalition, won a landslide victory over outgoing Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Barak has said that he wants to form a wide coalition
government with the support of more than 90 Knesset (parliament)
members.
</P>
<P>
Likud, which won 19 seats in the 120-seat Knesset, is still
split over whether to join the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Some Likud officials said the party will be given a chance to
exert impact on the final-status talks with the Palestinians if it
joins the coalition, while others insisted that it could be
easier for the party to expedite a recovery program as an
opposition force.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- An Ethiopian government
official said here Wednesday that the proportion of the people who
have access to piped clean water, regular garbage disposal and
health care facilities in Ethiopian urban centers is low.
</P>
<P>
Less than half of all households in 10 current regional state
capitals have access to potable water, General Manager of the
Ethiopian Urban Planning Institute, Solomon Kassaye told the
on-going six-day workshop on integrated strategic planning by
urban local authorities in eastern and southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Only a quarter of the units are in neighborhood equipped with
drainage infrastructures and a third lacked private or shared
water facilities," the Ethiopian News Agency quoted Solomon as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The general manager said with rapid annual urban growth rate
ranging from five to six percent and a stagnant income, urban
poverty has become a serious phenomenon in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Available jobs in labor market are scanty and as a result
unemployment is extremely high, Solomon said, adding that "at
present unemployment rate in the capital is about 38 percent."
</P>
<P>
Representatives and pertinent officials from Kenya, Tanzania,
Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Malawi, South Africa,
Namibia and Ethiopia, are attending the workshop which will end on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is aimed at enhancing the technical and management
 capacities of participants dealing with urban policy issues.

<HEADLINE> Oman, UAE Sign Gas Memorandum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Oman Wednesday signed a gas
memorandum of understanding with the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
Oman signed the deal with UAE Offets Group (UOG), which will
enable it to receive an expected 300 to 600 million standard
cubic feet (9 to 18 million cubic meters) of gas a day.
</P>
<P>
"The signing marks the start of a process aimed at formalizing
a long-term arrangement to supply Oman with an anticipated 300 to
600 standard cubic feet of gas per day," said a statement issued
by the investment group UOG.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum was signed in Oman's capital Muscat by Omani
Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Mohammed al-Ramhi and UOG
Chairman Mohammed Saif Al Mazroui.
</P>
<P>
"The gas will ensure that we can meet anticipated demand for
energy in Oman well into the next century," said al-Ramhi.
</P>
<P>
"Through security of energy supply we can create a platform
for encouraging local business to expand and for attracting
investment into Oman from overseas," he added.
</P>
<P>
The supply of gas to Oman will be part of the UOG's Dolphin
Regional Gas Network project which is a portfolio of gas-related
activities.
</P>
<P>
Oman's involvement in the project will include the
construction of pipelines in the country.
</P>
<P>
UOG said the Dolphin project would require investments
estimated at 8 to 10 billion U.S. dollars over the next six to
seven years.
</P>
<P>
It involves the development of Qatar's gas plants and is aimed
at transporting gas from Qatar to the whole region through new
gas distribution networks.

<HEADLINE> Romania's Main Opposition Criticizes NATO For Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The NATO's bombings were not an
adequate way to solve the Kosovo crisis, said on Wednesday Ion
Iliescu, president of the Party of Social Democracy of Romania.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the main Opposition made the remark on his
meeting with Lord Russel-Johnston, the visiting President of the
Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. The meeting
occasioned the two dignitaries an opinion exchange about the
Kosovo conflict and the NATO's intervention in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Iliescu stressed that he was disappointed with the fact that
the military operations in Yugoslavia had taken place in the name
of certain principles. "We expected NATO to behave differently",
the former President of Romania said, adding that worldwide there
were much more serious situations than that in Kosovo and NATO did
not bother to interfere.
</P>
<P>
Lord Russell-Johnston did not share Iliescu's views. He
resumed, once again, the stance the British and U.S. officials had
previously voiced on the Kosovo topic.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav war's effects, the stop in the traffic on the
Danube and in the billateral commercial ties add now to the
economic hardships Romania are facing, Iliescu also said.

LUSAKA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), Erastus Mwencha,
said here Wednesday that the sub-region is moving fast into a
free-trade area without any tariff or non-tariff barriers in trade
of both goods and services.
</P>

Mwencha disclosed that by the end of May 1999, three countries
had already reduced their tariff by 90 percent, seven countries by
80 percent, one country by 70 percent, and other three by 60
percent while a further two have been allowed not to effect
reductions until the year 2000 due to their unique economic
situation.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenya values its ecomonic
cooperation and trade with China, Kenyan Minister of Industrial
Cooperation Andrew Kiptoon said here Wednesday when meeting a
Chinese business and trade delegation.
</P>
<P>
"Over the years, Kenya has benefited from several
Chinese-funded projects, the most remarkable one being the Moi
International Sports Complex in Nairobi," Kiptoon said.
</P>
<P>
Kiptoon welcomed China's plan of establishing a trade and
investment center in Nairobi, saying that "we encourage the
Chinese friends to realize the proposal and even consider setting
up enterprises in Kenya."
</P>
<P>
"Kenyans have information that the Chinese technology is
appropriate to Kenya and the costs are relatively lower than those
from other parts of the world," he said. "We hope Chinese friends
to take advantage of the industrialization process which Kenya is
undergoing."
</P>
<P>
He also appealed Chinese businessmen to help Kenya improve its
irrigation technology and development of herbal medicine on
malaria, a tropical disease and the top killer in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Xu Bingjin, head of the delegation organized by the Chinese
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, said during

have enjoyed a sustained expansion, with a trade volume in 1998
standing at 120 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"China has provided Kenya with assistance of 564 million yuan
(about 70 million dollars) without setting any political
pre-conditions," Xu said.
</P>
<P>
Xu also said that there is great potential in the bilateral
economic cooperation and trade, adding that the Chinese government
has encouraged its entrepreneurs to invest in Kenya in forms of
equipment, technology, management or setting up processing and
assembling projects.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Says More Efforts Needed to Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- After several decades of falling
poverty in East Asia, the World Bank reported Wednesday that the
financial crisis has caused a substantial surge in the region's
poverty rate, and recommended that international financial rescue
packages be better balanced to cushion the poor from the worst
effects of crises.
</P>
<P>
"Progress in income poverty reduction has probably stalled in
the latter half of the 1990s amongst large groups of the poor,
with the exception of China," the bank said in a report entitled
"World Bank Poverty Update".
</P>
<P>
"In all three key areas of income poverty, health and basic
education, there will need to be a substantial increase in
progress, compared with trends of the late 1990s, if the
international development targets are to be achieved," the report
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Bank, in 1987, 1.2 billion people lived
on less than one U.S. dollar per day; in 1993, that number was
closer to 1.3 billion. In 1999, if the proportion of people living
in poverty has remained the same as in 1993, there could be 1.5
billion people living in abject poverty at the dawn of the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
Latest survey results based on national poverty lines, not the
one dollar per day lines, confirmed the impact of the financial
crisis on the poor in East Asia has been very severe, the bank
said.
</P>
<P>
Estimates for Indonesia indicate an increase of around 10
percentage points in the incidence of poverty, corresponding to
something like 20 million newly poor people, the equivalent of a
medium-sized country. Significant increases in poverty took place
in urban Korea, and to a lesser extent in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The combined effect of lower commodity prices, conflict, and in
some cases, bad weather has been to cut growth in Sub-Saharan
Africa. The growth of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1998 appears
to have below the rate of population growth, implying a decline in
per capita income in the region.
</P>
<P>
The prospects for Latin America are clouded by the crisis in
Brazil, but per capita GDP growth was significant in 1997 and
still positive, albeit lower, in 1998, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Sharp declines in growth and increases in poverty are also
anticipated in Russia, the Ukraine, and Romania. Negative GDP per
capita growth and an increase in poverty are also expected in the
Middle East and North Africa.
</P>
<P>
"In sum, the global picture that emerges at the end of the
1990s is one of stalled progress, as a result of the East Asian
crisis, rising numbers of poor people in India, continued rises in
Sub-Saharan Africa, and a sharp worsening in Europe and Central
Asia," Michael Walton, director of the World Bank's Poverty
Reduction and Economic Management, said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Given the human impact of the crisis on the lives of millions
of people in East Asia and other developing and transition
countries, the World Bank stressed that rescue packages must be
better designed in the future to protect the poor, the sick, and
the elderly from the worst effects of crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Without an adequate safety net in place before a crisis hits,
the poor are likely to be hurt disproportionately. Accordingly,
setting up safety nets in good times may be the only effective way
to protect the poor during crises," said the bank.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Parties Invited to Formulate Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Electoral Supervisory
Commission (ESC) is inviting all political parties to a meeting
this month to formulate a code for parliamentary elections next
year.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time local political parties have been asked
to cooperate in efforts to ensure elections are held
democratically.
</P>
<P>
ESC Chairman Peter Hatendi Wednesday told the Zimbabwe News
Agency that political parties needed to agree and adhere to some
democratic electoral principles to ensure free participation of
both candidates and voters.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that his commission did not have statutory
powers to compel parties to draw up the code of conduct.
</P>
<P>
But he appealed to politicians' "morality" to strive for peace
"before, during and after polling and declaration of results" in
the municipal elections scheduled for August and parliamentary
polls expected early next year.
</P>
<P>
He said the drive behind the commission's invitation to parties
was the violent trends in Zimbabwe elections which, judging from
the few incidents already witnessed, were feared to increase and
become more dangerous during the forthcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
The commission predicted that the forthcoming elections would
be more competitive than previous ones. But this, Hatendi said,
could be verified with the response from the parties to his
invitation.
</P>
<P>
The parties are expected to have registered for the meeting by
June 16 after which the date of the meeting would be set.
</P>
<P>
"Such a meeting could allow parties to open up and iron out
some of the issues that have been sticking in previous elections
which were boycotted by some parties," he said.

<HEADLINE> Nobel Laurreate: No Difference Between Hitler and NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Nobel prize winner for literature
Alexander Solzhenitsin on Monday condemned the NATO airstrikes
against Yugoslavia, saying he sees no difference between NATO's
behavior and that of Hitler.
</P>
<P>
"Yugoslavia shows where humanity is headed. In terms of
morality we are on the way down, not up," the Interfax news agency
quoted the Russian writer as saying.
</P>
<P>
The International Court in The Hague, which has indicted
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic for war crimes, "has for a
long time been a circus, I believe, because they do what they are
told to do... I do not respect the International Court in the
Hague because it has been showing bias for decades," Solzhenitsin
said.
</P>
<P>
"I can see that under some pretext a European country has been
suffering destructive strikes for a third month before the eyes of
humanity," he said. "International law has been cast away, the
United Nations has been cast away."
</P>
<P>
"NATO is teaching the entire planet a lesson, saying 'This is
the way we will punish.' NATO wants to impose its order on the
world and Yugoslavia is needed as a terrible example."
Solzhenitsin said.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav crisis will not lead to World War III, "but may
lead to NATO tyranny over the planet," the author said.
</P>
<P>
Solzhenitsin, 80, was awarded the Nobel prize for literature in
1970.

<HEADLINE> French President Meets with Cambodian Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac met
with visiting Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen at the Elysee
presidential palace on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen explained to Chirac the three ``axis'' of domestic
policy, which are national reconciliation and political stability,
strategy of integrating Cambodia into the international community,
economic and social development with international aid, according
to Elysee press service.
</P>
<P>
The French president expressed his support to this policy and
said that France will support the measures to be taken by the
Cambodian government to revive the country, devastated by nearly
three decades of war.
</P>
<P>
Chirac called on Cambodia to conclude an agreement with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) on economic readjustment, which
he said will increase the confidence of the international
community in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
He also said that France condemns the genocide perpetuated by
the Khmer Rouge regime in the 1970s and wishes that those held
responsible for the genocide should be punished by the law.
</P>
<P>
Chirac and Hun Sen also discussed bilateral cooperations in
clearing up land mines, training medical personnel, constructing
an airport in Phnom Penh, training engineers and high level
technicians, fighting against AIDS and protecting Cambodia's
cultural treasure Angkor.

<HEADLINE> UN Agency Warns Resurgence of Cattle Plague </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Despite tremendous progress
towards global rinderpest eradication in recent years, failure to
wipe out the few remaining pockets of the deadly cattle plague
could result in its widespread resurgence, the U.N. Food And
Agriculture Organization (FAO) warned on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
FAO called on donors to provide immediate support for
rinderpest eradication programs to prevent the disease from
making a comeback in countries where rinderpest was recently
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
If global eradication is successful, it will be the first
animal disease to be eradicated from the world, and this would be
one of the greatest achievements ever in veterinary science,
according to FAO.
</P>
<P>
Animal health officials suspect that cattle plague persists in
only three isolated areas of the world: southern Sudan, southern
Somalia and parts of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
They say there are three other areas where the disease has
occurred within the last five years and where there is no
conclusive evidence that it has been eliminated. These are the far
eastern Russian Federation, the southern Arabian Peninsula and the
Kurdish area along the border between Turkey and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that it could cost as little as 3 million U.S.
dollars to eradicate rinderpest from each of the remaining pockets
through focussed control action, including intensive vaccination.
</P>
<P>
Rinderpest, a highly contagious disease of ruminants caused by
paramyxovirus, not only kills cattle, but also has a devastating
impact on rural incomes, livestock production and ultimately on
food security.
</P>
<P>
Losses include wild animals, which can be of great importance
to many rural economies. In addition to these losses, affected
countries are ofter excluded from world markets by animal health
import restrictions.

<HEADLINE> Three Iraqi Civilians Injured in U.S. Bombardment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Three Iraqi civilians were injured
on Wednesday in the U.S. and British bombardment of civilian
facilities and military camps, an Iraqi military spokesman
announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 11:00 (0700 GMT), 11 formations of
enemy warplanes coming from Turkish airspace violated northern
Iraqi airspace over the provinces of Dohuk, Neineva and Erbil.
</P>
<P>
He said that the enemy formations bombed civilian facilities
and military camps in Neineva province, injuring three civilians,
adding that Iraqi anti-aircraft units repulsed the enemy planes
at 14:05 (1005 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Thirty-three formations of enemy planes coming from Saudi and
Kuwaiti bases violated southern Iraqi airspace over Thi-Qar,
Misan, Basra and Muthana provinces at 11:03 (0703 GMT) and 16:53
(1253 GMT), said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He added that since the U.S. and British airstrikes against
Iraq last December, their warplanes have made 5,933 sorties in
the so-called southern no-fly zone and 1,478 sorties in the
northern no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq
following the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
"Baghdad's suppressions."
</P>
<P>
Since last December's U.S. and British bombardment of Iraq,
their warplanes have been regularly attacking Iraqi military and
civilian targets in the no-fly zones, causing severe civilian
casualties and property damage."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has declared that it does not recognize these restricted
zones and vowed to continue confronting any allied plane violating
its airspace.

<HEADLINE> Outlook for Wheat Trade in 1999/2000: IGC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON June 2 (Xinhua) - World wheat trade has been fairly
static for some 3 years, largely as a result of better than
anticipated supplies and slower than anticipated consumption
growth in several major importers, the International Grains
Council (IGC) said.
</P>
<P>
In its latest issue of Grain Market Report, the IGC said, some
recovery is forecast in 1999/00, largely as a result of crop
shortfalls in Near East Asia, especially Iran and due to some
expected tightening of supplies in China.
</P>
<P>
The global figure could approach 100 m.tons, up from 93.5m.
estimated for 1998/99. The amount of wheat provided is likely to
fall from the above average amount provided in 1998/99, although
in some cases shipment are likely to continue into the next year,
The IGC added.
</P>
<P>
A sharp decline in the level of carry-out stocks in some major
importing countries would normally increase the likelihood of
imports. China, in particular, was able to build up stocks
following bumper 1996 and 1997 crops, according to the IGC.
</P>
<P>
While China is unlikely to resort to large-scale wheat
purchases in 1999/00, imports are forecast to increase to some 4 m.
tons in order to keep pace with slowly rising use, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> UK Manufacturing Shows Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON June 2 (Xinhua) - Strong evidence has emerged of a
recovery in UK manufacturing, with healthy consumer demand helping
to lift companies' output, according to a leading survey
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, in spite of the boost for output, the activity index
composited by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply
(CIPS), stayed below the break-even level.
</P>
<P>
The index rose to 49.4 from 48.1 in April on a scale where any
number below 50 means recession. Nevertheless, it is the seventh
consecutive improvement.
</P>
<P>
The CIPS survey said orders, both at home and for export, were
growing. Output growth accelerated last month and is growing at
its fastest rate for almost two years.
</P>
<P>
The survey is the latest in a string of surveys to suggest
economic growth is on course for recovery, following interest rate
cuts.
</P>
<P>
The institute said the increase in manufacturing output in May,
the second consecutive monthly rise, was driven almost entirely by
higher production of consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
Peter Thomson, CIPS director general, said an improvement in
the global economy had led to an increase in export orders despite
a further appreciation of sterling.

<HEADLINE> UK Tabloid Newspaper Demanded Apology over Sophie Photo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The British press watchdog, the
Press Complaints Commission (PCC), ordered The Sun on Wednesday to
repeat its apology for publishing a topless picture of Prince
Edward's fiancee Sophie Rhys-Jones.
</P>
<P>
The decade-old photograph of Rhys-Jones appeared in last
Wednesday's newspaper -- ahead of the couple's marriage later this
month.
</P>
<P>
The Buckingham Palace called the publication "premeditated
cruelty", and made a formal protest to the Press Complaints
Commission hours after the paper hit the streets.
</P>
<P>
It called the story in the newspaper a "gross invasion of
privacy", and made the complaint under section three of the
industry's code of practice, regarding privacy.
</P>
<P>
The next day after the photograph appeared, The Sun issued a
full-page apology to Rhys-Jones, admitting that it had been wrong
to publish the picture, but denying it had acted with "deliberate
cruelty".
</P>
<P>
The paper also announced that it had decided to donate all
profits from the syndication of its pictures to charities of her
choice.
</P>
<P>
Disc jockey Kara Noble, who took the photograph, was sacked
from London commercial radio station Heart 106.2 after the photo
was published.

WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- At least nine people were killed
and some 80 others injured as an American Airlines flight with 145
people aboard skidded off a rain-slicken runway, broke apart and
burst into flames in Arkansas State of the United States before
midnight Tuesday, reports reaching here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Flight 1420, a Super MD-80, had 139 passengers and six crew
members and was due to arrive in Little Rock National Airport at
9:41 p.m.( local time). The flight from Dallas of Texas State was
delayed for more than two hours and arrived just as the storm was
hitting Little Rock, capital of Arkansas State, with lightning,
hail and winds gusting to nearly 90 mph ( 145 kph).
</P>
<P>
Passengers described a scene of terror, with the twin-engine
jetliner splitting into pieces and catching fire after it slid to
the edge of the Arkansas River. Some passengers squeezed one by
one through an emergency exit as flames spread through the plane.
</P>
<P>
The deaths are the first in an U.S. commercial airline accident
since December 28, 1997, when a woman was killed aboard a United
Airlines 747 that encountered severe turbulence over the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
After sliding down the runway, the twin-engine Super MD-80
slammed into a steel tower, split into pieces, caught fire and
wound up on the edge of the Arkansas River.
</P>
<P>
As flames spread through the plane, some passengers squeezed
one by one through an emergency exit while others escaped through
openings created when the plane's fuselage fractured. They
scrambled away from the plane across lowlands near the river in
darkness, rain and hail.
</P>
<P>
"We grabbed each other and ran away," said Missy Lewis,
traveling with her husband and teen-age daughter.
</P>
<P>
Sources familiar with the investigation said authorities could
account for nine deaths in the crash of Flight 1420. The airline
said the plane's captain was among those who died.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Ball in Belgrade's Court Despite Difference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Wednesday that the ball is now in Belgrade's court although the
West-Russian plan on Kosovo has not resolved all differences on
what kind of peacekeeping force would go into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin and Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari for the European Union, will fly to Belgrade on
Wednesday to put their ideas to Yugoslav leader Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
"We think the areas of agreement are sufficiently large, broad
and deep for a joint trip (by Chernomyrdin and Ahtisaari). The
international community is as united as it can possibly be," U.S.
State Department spokesman James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased that arrangements have been made for them to
travel together to Belgrade and present a solution.
</P>
<P>
"The big 'if' is whether this united front -- the United
States, Russia and the European Union -- will achieve the
necessary answers from President Milosevic. But the ball is
clearly in his (Milosevic's) court," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman said that differences still remain
between Russia and the West on the international force that is
to be deployed in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, Chernomyrdin said that the NATO troops will be under
NATO command, while the Russian troops will be controlled by the
Russian command.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said it was "an open question" whether Russia would
participate in sending peacekeepers under NATO command and with
NATO at its core as demanded by the allies.
</P>
<P>
"We insist that the force have NATO command and control and a
NATO structure. The open question is whether Russia can find a way
to participate."
</P>
<P>
But the Clinton administration would not object to adoption of
a resolution by the United Nations to endorse the peacekeeping
plan after a settlement to protect returning refugees, the
spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New Home Sales Rise Strongly in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. sales of new homes
increased a strong 9.2 percent in April, the Commerce Department
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The increase in sales of new single-family homes followed four
straight months of declines, the Department said. The big rise
pushed sales of new homes to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
978,000 units last month, the second highest level on record. The
all-time high was a sales rate of 985,000 units set last November.
</P>
<P>
The April's 9.2 percent gain caught analysts by surprise. Many
of them have been predicting a slowdown in this sector because
mortgage rates have been climbing up in recent weeks. A national
survey of mortgage rates showed them hitting 7.23 percent for the
past two weeks, the highest level in 18 months.
</P>
<P>
However, existing home sales declined in April by 3.3 percent,
that drop was from a record high set in March.
</P>
<P>
The Wednesday's report also showed that the surge in demand was
accompanied by a rise in prices. The median price of all new homes
sold last month climbed 3 percent to a record 159,500 U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
All regions of the country except the West enjoyed strong
increases in sales last month.
</P>
<P>
In the Midwest, sales rose 33.5 percent to an annual rate of
211,000 units. Sales were up 17.1 percent to a rate of 89,000
units in the Northeast and climbed 7.5 percent to a rate of
429,000 units in the South.
</P>
<P>
The West, jumping 22.9 percent in March, suffered a drop of 5.3
percent in April to an annual rate of 249,000 units.
</P>
<P>
The April's strong pace of sales meant that it would take only
3.7 months to exhaust the existing supply of unsold homes, a
record low for this figure.

<HEADLINE> Annan to Meet Pope on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan is expected to meet with Pope John Paul on Thursday in Rome
to discuss how to bring an end to the Kosovo crisis, in which the
U.S.-led NATO staged unabated bombing in Yugoslavia for more than
70 days, a U.N. statement said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued by a U.N. spokesman, said, "At the
invitation of His Holiness Pope John Paul II, the
Secretary-General is travelling to Rome to meet with the Pope, in
order to assess the situation in the Balkans and the prospects for
resolving the crisis and building peace in the region."
</P>
<P>
The meeting will take place in the Vatican at 1:00 p.m. (11:00
GMT) on Thursday, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General remains firmly committed to promoting a
solution to the Kosovo crisis that allows refugees and displaced
persons to return swiftly to their homes and that enables
inhabitants of Kosovo and the region to live in conditions of
peace and security with full respect for the civil, political and
human rights of all," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"He sees his meeting with His Holiness as an important
opportunity to exchange views on the moral and political issues
underling the crisis in Kosovo," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Pope sent a personal letter to Annan in April to invite the
U.N. chief to discuss the Kosovo conflict, which broke out in
February last year after ethnic Albanians have been fighting with
Serbs for independence.
</P>
<P>
The Pope has made several calls for peace in Yugoslavia since
NATO, without the authorization of the U.N. Security Council,
unilaterally began its bombing campaign on March 24 in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be taking place as the international
community is calling upon NATO to stop the bombing, which
violates the U.N. Charter and international law immediately to
give peace a chance.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Govt Urged to Resist "Conspiracy" Against Its Industrialization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A Bangladeshi industrialist on
Wednesday urged the government to beware of an "international
conspiracy" against the industrialization of the country.
</P>
<P>
Salman F. Rahman, chairman of the Bangladesh Textile Mills
Association (BTMA), said some of the country's development
partners while pressing for opening up its economy for the private
sector only look after the interest of the private sector of their
own countries.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference jointly organized by five associations of
the country's textiles sector, including the Bangladesh Garment
Manufacturers and Exporters Association, the BTMA chairman,
without naming anybody, said those donors even try to tarnish the
image and capacity of the local private entrepreneurs by leveling
charges of incapability and insincerity against them.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating the top-most importance of establishing an adequate
number of backward linkage industries to help the success of the
country's garment and textile industries after the year 2004,
Rahman censured a recent study of the International Finance
Corporation (IFC) on Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The study on the textiles sector of Bangladesh carried out by
the IFC, an affiliate of the World Bank, said the country does not
need backward linkage industries, and the consultants of the
report asked the IFC not to invest in Bangladesh for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
He called on the government and the people to help protect the
national interest in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The textiles sector has become the largest foreign exchange
earner of the country, which contributes to about 70 percent of
the country's total export earnings.

interchange in Fairfax County of Virginia State in the United
States early Wednesday, prompting the evacuation of dozens of
homes and clogging rush-hour traffic in the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
The flatbed truck ran off a ramp at the interchange of I-495,
I-395 and I-95, the major north-south highway linking New York and
Florida States. Traffic was backed up for dozens of kilometers,
including the outer loop of the beltway surrounding the nation's
capital.
</P>
<P>
Local firefighters created a 700-meter safety zone around the
site. More than 50 homes and 150 people were evacuated as a
precaution.
</P>
<P>
The explosive powder, the type used to make fireworks, was
inside a cargo container atop a flatbed trailer. None of the
powder spilled from its container.
</P>
<P>
Neither the driver nor her boy friend were injured in the
accident.

<HEADLINE> IOC 2000 Commission Holds First Meeting on Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAUSANNE, Switzerland, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The International
Olympic Committee (IOC) 2000 Commission recommended here Wednesday
that a new procedure be introduced for electing the host city of
the 2008 Olympic games after the commission met the first time
here on June 1-2 on the IOC reforms.
</P>
<P>
For bidding cities, the new procedure will be "easier and less
expensive," IOC President Juan Samaranch told Xinhua at a press
conference held at the end of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, Samaranch disclosed, some 10 cities have shown
intention to host the 2008 games. They are Beijing of China, Osaka
of Japan, Kuala Lumpur of Malaysia, Buenos Aires of Argentina,
Toronto of Canada, Cairo of Egypt, Cape Town of South Africa,
Sevilla of Spain, Istanbul of Turkey and Paris of France.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting, the IOC 2000 commission set up an
executive committee in charge of the coordination of the
proceedings and three working groups with mission to study
respectively the composition, structure and organization of the IOC;
the role of the IOC; and the designation of the host of the
Olympic games.
</P>
<P>
The commission will be presenting an initial preliminary report
to the 109th IOC session which opens in Seoul of South Korea on
June 17. The three working groups will continue their activity
throughout the summer.
</P>
<P>
The commission is expected to have prepared its conclusions and
final recommendations by the end of October 1999. These will then
be presented to the IOC at an extraordinary session planned for
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Besides IOC officials, those present at the two-day meeting
include former United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros
Ghali, former United States Secretary of State Henry Kinssinger,
Italian senator and industrialist Gianni Agnelli, French senator
Michel Barnier, and former Norwegian Foreign Minister Thomas
Stoltenberg.

<HEADLINE> Quarter of Voters Turn out in S. Africa By </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- More than 4.2 million, or 23
percent, of South Africa's registered voters had cast their
ballots by 4 p.m. (1400 GMT) Wednesday, provisional statistics
released by the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) showed.
</P>
<P>
The figure was based on information received from only 9,591 of
the 14,640 polling stations countrywide which made contact with
the IEC's operation center in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
A total of 5,090 polling stations had yet to report to the IEC,
and voting tallies from these centers could therefore not be
included, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Gauteng, with more than 4.2 million registered voters, the
highest in the country, had the lowest turnout by 4 p.m., with
18.5 percent. In contrast, the Northern Cape, with the lowest
number of registered voters in the country, had the highest
turnout with 30.64 percent.
</P>
<P>
The election is running peacefully across the country although
the process is rather slow. In some places, voters had to wait for
hours before they could cast their ballots.
</P>
<P>
The first results of the vote are expected late Wednesday
night.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council on
Wednesday morning met in a closed-door session to hear briefing by
a U.N. fact-finding mission which was sent into Kosovo, a Yugoslav
province, to assess humanitarian situation in Yugoslavia, which
has been under intensified NATO bombing for more than 70 days.
</P>
<P>
Sergio Vieira de Mello, U.N. under-secretary-general for
humanitarian affairs, briefed the Security Council on his mission
to Kosovo and other parts of Yugoslavia. U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan was present at the Council meeting.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Kosovo in late May, de Mello said his mission had
seen "pretty systematic destruction or burning of private
property. The U.N. team identified the main problems there as the
destruction of basic services, the closure of educational
facilities and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Annan decided on May 4 to set up the U.N. mission to assess the
humanitarian needs of the people in Kosovo and other parts of
Yugoslavia. The U.N. team is the first of its kinds since the
U.S.-led NATO began its bombing of Yugoslavia on March 24.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. team, composed of some 15 people from a number of U.N.
agencies, visited Serbia, Kosovo and Montenegro during the 10-day
assessment mission, and held talks with the Yugoslav leaders in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
De Mello is expected to give a press conference here on
Wednesday afternoon on his mission to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, de Mello said that he would present the mission's
findings and recommendations to Annan and to the Security Council.

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges Israel Not to Expand Settlements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Wednesday urged Israel to
give up its plans for expanding Jewish settlements in Palestinian
territories.
</P>
<P>
Moscow, a co-sponsor of the Middle Eastern peace process,
warned that implementation of these plans "may seriously hinder
prospects for unblocking and advancing a Palestinian-Israeli
resolution," a Foreign Ministry statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Eliminating this obstacle will give a strong impetus to Middle
Eastern talks upon the formation of a new government, which is
expected to take constructive steps in the region," the Interfax
news agency quoted the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Tension has escalated in the Palestinian territories in
connection with the latest attempts of the outgoing Israeli
government to carry out plans for expanding settlements on the
West Bank of the Jordan River," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Palestinians are extremely concerned about these illegal
steps. Eastern Jerusalem is in effect being isolated from the rest
of the West Bank of the Jordan River," the document said.
</P>
<P>
Russia believes that "actions for unilateral violation of the
status quo in the occupied Palestinian territories are
unacceptable in light of the Middle Eastern peace process," the
statement said.

<HEADLINE> IFC Finances Colombian Development Finance Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) announced Wednesday the approval of 50 million
U.S. dollars in financing for a development finance company in
Colombia to help meet the company's long-term capital needs at a
time when Colombia is experiencing a severe capital shortage.
</P>
<P>
IFC's financing package, which is provided to Corporacion
Financiera Nacional y Suramericana S.A. (Corfinsura), consists of
25 million dollars in equity and a 10-year revolving credit
facility of 25 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The equity investment will enable the company to rebalance its
capital structure, while the credit facility will allow the
company to improve its asset-liability management when the market
is volatile and to provide the industrial sectors with greater
access to longer-term funding, said the IFC, a member of the World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
This investment in Corfinsura reflects IFC's continued
confidence in Colombia despite a difficult economic environment
over the last two years, said Karl Voltaire, IFC's director of
Latin America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
As Corfinsura revamps its operations in response to the
country's newly deregulated financial sector, focusing on merchant
banking and corporate financing, it will serve as an example for
other financial institutions, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
With Corfinsura's client base of more than 1,000 large and
medium-sized industrial companies, the company can be an important
element in th economic recovery of the Colombian corporate sector,
the IFC said.
</P>
<P>
Corfinsura will focus on strengthening its investment banking
and advisory and financial services, benefiting local industries
and the financial sector as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The mission of IFC is to promote private sector investment in
developing countries, which will reduce poverty and improve
people's lives.

<HEADLINE> NATO's Depleted Uranium Weapons Threaten Danger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The clouds of radioactive dust
created by the depleted uranium weapons which NATO is using in the
Balkans threaten soldiers on both sides and ordinary Yugoslav
people, Britain's New Scientist magazine warned on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Depleted uranium, a radioactive heavy metal, is the waste left
over when the isotope uranium-235 is extracted from natural
uranium to fuel nuclear power stations and build nuclear bombs.
</P>
<P>
Mike Thorne, a uranium expert from AEA Technology, which is
formerly part of the UK Atomic Energy Authority, told New
Scientist that as an alpha-emitter, depleted uranium poses a
similar risk to plutonium if it gets inside the body.
</P>
<P>
Chemically, depleted uranium poses a great threat to the
kidneys, where high concentrations can lead to organ failure.
</P>
<P>
But according to Thorne, even small amounts could have subtle
but ill-understood effects.
</P>
<P>
As such, even the tiniest amounts of uranium could "cause cell
damage that marginally increases the risk of cancer", the magazine
said.
</P>
<P>
Depleted uranium was used for the first time in Gulf war in
1991. U.S. and British veterans believed exposure to it is one of
the causes of Gulf War Syndrome that has afflicted thousands of
soldiers afterward.

<HEADLINE> NATO to Deploy Some 48,000 Troops in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- NATO said here Wednesday that it
is preparing to deploy around 48,000 troops in Kosovo after Serb
forces begin to pull out from the war-torn area.
</P>
<P>
NATO spokesman Jamie Shea told reporters that the NATO military
authorities has consulted with 19 allies and partners countries to
endorse final plan of the troop deployment in Kosovo. The
countries concerned had committed a total of 47,868 troops, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"This shows that our planning is more than well under way. Our
brigades are now almost fully sourced and those partner countries
agree to put about 10 percent of that total on the table," Shea
said.
</P>
<P>
NATO is currently in contact with countries in the region in
order to arrange transit and transport facilities and
predeployment for the bulk of this force in the theater so that it
will be able to move into Kosovo rapidly as soon as the Serb
forces begin to withdraw, the spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> One Million New High-tech Jobs Added to U.S.Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 2 (Xinhua) -- More than a million new jobs
have been created by the U.S. high-tech industry since 1993,
according to an analytical report issued Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The new report from the American Electronics Association (AEA)
said that the U.S. high-tech industry employed 4.8 million workers
in 1998, making it one of the nation's largest industries.
</P>
<P>
States leading the job growth were Texas, California, Georgia,
Colorado and Washington, indicating the tech-fueled economic boom
has spread far beyond Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
"Throughout the mid-1990s," said the report, "the U.S.
high-tech industry has mushroomed, becoming the significant new
component of U.S. business growth." In fact, all but nine states
created new technology jobs between 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
California on the West Coast is by far the U.S. technology
powerhouse, employing 784,000 workers in 1997 and adding 66,000
net new jobs between 1990 and 1997. But California's growth rate
of nine percent during the period lagged behind the growth in
technology jobs of several other states.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Warns of "Great Tragedy" in Trade Barriers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan said Wednesday that the U.S. economy has reaped
enormous benefits from lowering trade barriers, but it would be a
"great tragedy" if these benefits were reversed by protectionist
forces.
</P>
<P>
"I am concerned about the recent evident weakening of support
for free trade in this country," Greenspan said in a speech to an
international business conference in Boston. "Should we endeavor
to freeze competitive progress in place, we will almost certainly
slow economic growth overall," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Protecting markets from new technologies has never succeeded.
Adjustments to newer technologies have been delayed, but only at
significant cost," Greenspan said, repeating a warning he first
made in April that the U.S. economy could be harmed if
protectionist forces succeeded in erecting higher trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
In today's speech released in Washington, Greenspan made
no mention about the state of the overall economy currently, or
the central bank's decision two weeks ago to change policy to
favor increasing interest rates if the inflationary pressures
start to mount.
</P>
<P>
He said he was concerned about increased protectionist
pressures at a time when the U.S. trade deficit has soared to
record levels because of the world financial crisis which has cut
sharply into U.S. export markets while increasing imports into
this country.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said the proper response was to support programs to
retrain workers who lose jobs to global competition rather than
erecting barriers to protect industries that are no longer
competitive.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that all economic progress rests on competition.
It would be a great tragedy were we to stop the wheels of progress
because of an incapacity to assist the victims of progress,"
Greenspan said.

<HEADLINE> FDI Rises in East Europe, Falls in Russia: U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investment
(FDI) flows into Central and Eastern Europe grew to a new high of
16 billion U.S. dollars in 1998 from 13 billion dollars in 1997,
according to U.N. figures released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Russia received FDI of 2 billion dollars in 1998,
falling dramatically from 6 billion dollars a year earlier, the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) said.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, FDI into Central and Eastern Europe other than Russia
was heavily dominated by investors from Western Europe, who
captured 72 percent of the total, against a share of 9 percent for
investors from the United Sates, UNCTAD said.
</P>
<P>
FDI into Russia in 1998 fell back to its 1995 level, following
the country's general economic downturn and the drying up of
privatization-related inflows, the U.N. agency said.

LONDON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- All Europe's main markets closed
higher Wednesday, despite an early slump on Wall Street caused by
renewed concern about inflation and interest rates.
</P>
<P>
News that British Steel was in merger talks with Dutch steel
giant Hoogovens gave shares a lift in the hour before trading
closed.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE-100 Index closed up 52.2 points at 6302.2 - near to
its high for the day of 63.8 points ahead. It was buoyed
throughout the session by strong buying of the two pharmaceutical
heavyweights on merger speculation.

<P>
SmithKline Beecham, which has been linked with the Swiss drug
company Novartis, closed more than 4 percent higher - one of the
strongest performances in the FTSE.
</P>
<P>
London's best blue-chip performer was the engineering group
Invensys, which soared more than 11 percent to end at 301 pence,
after posting a 13.5 percent rise in operating profit to 998
million pounds for the year ended March 31.
</P>
<P>
But even that impressive jump was overshadowed by former blue

gain of 21 percent - on the news as analysts hoped for a tasty
return of capital as a result of the deal.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, Anhui, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Naitional spiker Zhang Xiang
regained his form to lead Sichuan Fo Lan for a comprehensive
triumph over Paykan of Iran at the first AVC Cup Men's Club
Volleyball Tournament on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, who shruggled off his poor shadow in the opener against
NEC Blue Rockets on Wednesday, spearheaded the attacking of the Fo
Lan by blasting a bundle of unanswered spikes from the backcourt
and close the net.
</P>
<P>
The spiker also stamped his strenghth with his solid blocks,
holding off the fierce charges of the Iranians before they settled
a 25-21, 25-22 and 25-13 win.
</P>
<P>
Zhang was not the only winning factor as An Jiajie and Zhang
Liming also flexed their muscle to demoralize Paykan, who have
suffered a disastrous defeat against Samsung Fire &AMP; Marine
Insurance club on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Paykan coach Hosseivi Mohammd. H. lavished his praises on the
performances of Sichuan, saying that the reigning champions of the
Chinese league was "strong in every term".
</P>
<P>
Fo Lan's head coach Zhou Jian'an also showed his satisfaction
with his side, thinking that the players have been true to their
form.
</P>
<P>
"The setter did a better job with the spikers and the team
lived up to their expectation," said the coach, also the setter of
the national team.
</P>
<P>
Another Chinese club Chendu Army scored its second win by
thrashing the NEC Blue Rockets 25-19, 25-21, 25-23.
</P>
<P>
The team, with an average age of 33-34, showed little sign of
being aged as they made full use of their experience and fighting
stamina to blunt the attack of the short-figured Japanese.
</P>
<P>
In the last match of the day, the Samsung Fire &AMP; Marine
Insurance club maintained its winning momentum as it spiked to a
25-13, 25-21, 25-17 victory.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Angry Over Jewish Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEBRON, West Bank, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Declaring it a "Day of
Anger," Palestinians held demonstrations in the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip Thursday to protest against intensified Jewish
settlement expansion over the last few months.
</P>
<P>
Scores of Palestinian youngsters threw stones at Israeli
soldiers, who responded by firing rubber-bullets towards them.
</P>
<P>
This scene, on the Bab el Zawieh street linking the
Israeli-controlled and Palestinian-controlled areas in this
divided West Bank city, could be seen at many other places
throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The marches were organized by the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
The largest demonstration took place at a junction outside the
Gush Katif, a bloc of Jewish settlements in the southern Gaza
Strip, where about 1,000 Palestinians blocked the main road and
chanted "settlers get out."
</P>
<P>
Despite the stone-throwing and rubber bullets-firing, all the
demonstrations were relatively peaceful. In some places,
Palestinian police pushed back marchers who tried to hurl stones
at Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials said by holding the marches, they were
sending a message to Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak,
urging him to halt the settlement expansion which they said will
"kill the peace process" if not halted immediately.
</P>
<P>
In Hebron, hundreds of Palestinians led by officials from
various Palestinian political groups marched along the main
streets, chanting slogans calling for the end of "Israeli
occupations."
</P>
<P>
Home to about 400 Jewish settlers surrounded by some 120,000
Palestinians, Hebron was divided into Israeli-controlled and
Palestinian-controlled parts under an agreement signed two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
"We will not allow the Israelis to draw up the map of the final
status (of the Palestinian entity) by themselves," said Jamal Al
Shoubake, a Palestinian legislator and spokesman for the Fatah
movement.
</P>
<P>
Since outgoing hard-line Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was
poised to lose in the May 17 polls, Jewish settlers have stepped
up settlement expansion, fearing that a Barak-led government might
freeze these activities.
</P>
<P>
They have set up the nucleus of several new settlements on West
Bank hilltops and resumed construction at several sites in Arab
East Jerusalem, including Har Homa and Ras al-Amoud.
</P>
<P>
In a move further outraging the Palestinians, the parting
Israeli government approved a plan soon after Netanyahu was
crushed in the elections to expand the borders of the biggest
West Bank settlement Maale Adumin to East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Almost doubling the current size of Maale Adumin, which has a
population of about 22,000, the expansion would form a band of
Israeli-held land in East Jerusalem that cuts the West Bank in
half.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, more than 150 settlements scatter in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, effectively destroying the geographic continuity
of the Palestinian areas. The expansion of Maale Adumin would
worsen the situation.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who has pledged to revive the peace talks with the
Palestinians, has kept silence on the increasing settlement
activities since the elections. He has until early July to put
together a governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians are concerned that he might have his hands
tied if he finally form a coalition including right-wing parties
such as the Likud and the National Religious Party, which favor
expanding Jewish settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
They have repeatedly urged Barak to break his silence to halt
the settlement expansion, saying "peace and settlements could not
co-exist."
</P>
<P>
With the Israeli-controlled part cutting in the center of
Hebron, Palestinians sometimes have to take a big detour if they
want to go from one street to the other in the nearby area, thus
making a five-minute walk into a 40-minute or one-hour journey,
Kawther Salam, a Palestinian journalist, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"I've covered Hebron for a long time. My understanding is
that, with this situation going on, there will never be peace in
Hebron," she said.

<P>
LHASA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Tibet has great prospects for
cooperating with foreign companies in exploiting new energy
resources, according to Yang Chuantang, the executive vice-
chairman of China's Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with a Japanese delegation here today, Yang said
that Tibet has many solar and subterranean heat resources that
have helped many villages and schools get electricity.
</P>
<P>
He says that the energy issue has long been a major concern of
departments in the Tibetan and Central Chinese governments.
</P>

<HEADLINE> EU Lays Ground for "Common Defense" Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOGNE, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Union on Thursday laid
the foundations for a "common defense" for the 15-nation bloc,
boosting its image in the field of foreign and security affairs.
</P>
<P>
The two-day European Union Summit, that went underway on
Thursday, approved, as a "decisive step forward", a joint
declaration that said the move intended to give the union
"necessary means and capability to assume its responsibilities
regarding a common European policy on security and defense".
</P>
<P>
"The Union must have the capability for autonomous action,
backed up by credible military forces, the means to decide to use
them and a readiness to do so, in order to respond to
international crises without prejudice to actions by NATO," said
the declaration.
</P>
<P>
The declaration was announced after the heads of state and
government from the European Union nations met in Cologne to
approve the formation of a common foreign and security policy.
</P>
<P>
The approval meant that the European Union would be able to
carry out a range of conflict prevention and crisis management
missions, including such operations as in the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana has been hailed as the
most likely candidate for the newly-designated EU common foreign
and security coordinator and officials of the German EU presidency
said that they hoped the 57-year-old Spaniard would be nominated
later in the day.
</P>
<P>
An Italian delegate to the EU Summit said, however, that the EU
might postpone the appointment until after unionwide European
Parliament elections next week to avoid any impression that the
United States-led western military alliance was dominating Europe.

<HEADLINE> EU Cautions Bangladesh to Reduce Dependence on Garments Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Union Thursday cautioned
Bangladesh to diversify its export items in order to reduce
dependence on the garments sector, the largest foreign exchange
earner of the country.
</P>
<P>
"It appears essential for Bangladesh to diversify the export
range and to develop industries and service, which can contribute
to export earnings," Jorg V. Ketelsen, counselor of the European
Commission Delegation in Dhaka, said at a seminar here.
</P>
<P>
The heavy reliance on ready-made garments will become
problematic in the medium term, not least because of garments
exports will come under an increasing challenge as the developed
countries are bound to liberalize their respective imports from
other supplying countries by the year 2005, he said.
</P>
<P>
The special export facilities for garments export such as the
Multi-Fiber Agreement for the United States and the General
Preferential System for Europe are due to be phased out by the
year 2005 after the World Trade Organization agreement on tariff
becomes fully operative.
</P>
<P>
The garments sector, which accounts for over 73 percent of the
country's export earnings, earned 3.9 billion U.S. dollars in the
1997-98 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is the fifth largest apparel exporter to the
European Union.

<HEADLINE> Too Soon to Party: Finnish Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOGNE, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Finnish Prime Minister Paavo
Lipponen warned on Thursday that it was still "too soon to party"
after the European leaders heard of the acceptance by Yugoslavia
of the Group of Eight peace plan.
</P>
<P>
"We can have final confirmation about peace only after
receiving (Finnish) President Martti Athisaari's report," said the
prime minister during the European Union Summit.
</P>
<P>
He told the press in Cologne that June 3 might be a great day
in European history but "this is too serious to start partying
yet".
</P>
<P>
The Finnish president is flying from Belgrade to Cologne after
his talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic for the past
two days.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav president has accepted the G8 peace plan after the
Yugoslav Parliament voted on Thursday 250-82 with one abstention
to ratify the plan after two days of negotiations between the
Balkan nation and Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin and EU
President Martti Athisaari.
</P>
<P>
The G8 peace plan, worked out earlier last month in Bonn, calls
for a withdrawal of Yugoslav army and police units from the
Yugoslav province of Kosovo, the deployment in Kosovo of an
international peacekeeping force including NATO troops and the
secure return of refugees to the province.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin and Athisaari went to Belgrade on Wednesday after
they had talked the issue over with United States Deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbott in Bonn prior to the European Union
Summit.
</P>
<P>
The three men reached broad agreement on the first joint
initiative from Russia and NATO.

COLOGNE, June 3 (Xinhua) -- German Defense Minister Rudolf
Scharping said on Thursday that Yugoslavia must begin withdrawing
its troops from Kosovo before NATO stops the airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Bonn news conference, Scharping said he was "

G-8, the seven leading western powers and Russia.

Earlier Thursday, the Finnish delegate to Cologne's EU summit

Milosevic and Ahtisaari agreed that NATO should stop the

from Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Paper Calls Cox Report Despicable Farce (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The report of the U.S.
Congressional committee led by Christopher Cox is a despicable
anti-Chinese farce, according to China's leading newspaper,
People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Cox Report vilifies China for "stealing" U.S. nuclear
secrets and "threatening" its national security and has stirred up
anti-Chinese clamor on Capitol Hill and Cox and the members of his
team have chosen a sensational topic, but without hard evidence,
the paper says in a commentary prepared for its Friday edition.
</P>
<P>
The Cox Report alleges that China has been stealing U.S.
military secrets for the past 20 years, but this is a sheer lie
and everyone knows that, as early as 35 years ago, China
successfully exploded its first nuclear device during a strict
blockade and embargo imposed by the West and, by 1970, had
succeeded in developing its first atomic bomb, H-bomb and
satellite, the paper points out.
</P>
<P>
China had relied completely on its own science and technology
to develop its national defense and the thefts imagined by Cox
underestimates China's scientific and technological capacity, the
paper says.

<P>
China is a large, responsible country and developing a limited
number of nuclear weapons is for self-defense and not an arms race,
the paper says. There is no need to steal nuclear secrets from
other countries.
</P>
<P>
The Cox Report raves from beginning to end, makes groundless
accusations and takes materials that are openly available in
periodicals and on the Internet as secrets and normal academic
exchanges as theft, the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
There has been no evidence after several months of
investigations in the case of a Chinese-American scientist who is
alleged to have passed secrets to China and even the FBI admitted
that the scientist didn't violate any security regulations, let
alone commit espionage.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the Cox Report is intended to spread
fallacies to deceive people but has met with criticism from U.S.
politicians, economists, and media people.
</P>
<P>
It says that one Democratic Congressman and member of the Cox
team pointed out that the report's many conclusions are untenable.
He said that since the supposedly stolen missile guidance
technology has been used on commercial aircraft like Boeing 747s
for many years, the accusation that the technology has enhanced
China's missile guidance ability so as to have posed a threat to
the U.S. is "far-fetched".

The New York Times called the Cox Report a first-class spy
story, whose narration is too bizarre and complicated, the paper
says, adding that all this has shown that any attempt to cheat the
world with lies, no matter when and where, is hard to succeed.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the report has ulterior motives and Cox is doing all
he can to demonize China and to impede China's development. He and
others decided that, rather than talking about the "China threat",
China's stealing of U.S. nuclear secrets would be more exciting
and sensational.
</P>
<P>
However, lies only last for a limited time and all farces end
in due time. There will come a day when the American people make a
clear distinction between truth and falsehood and reach the right
conclusions, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
It is not accidental that the report came out just after the U.
S.-led NATO attacked the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. Just when
the U.S. government is needed to explain clearly to the Chinese
people, the U.S. Congress came up with the report in a move that
is clearly intended to divert people's attention.
</P>
<P>
In the history of Sino-U.S. relations, says the paper, domestic
politics have always been a major influence on ties and it is not
surprising that some people are making a fuss as U.S. election
approaches.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that some people in the United States still
stick to the Cold-War mentality now that the arch-rival of the
former Soviet Union is gone and they see China as an opponent.
</P>
<P>
All the anti-China farces staged by certain people in the
United States in the past ended with failures, and the current one
can not have a different ending, the paper concludes.

<HEADLINE> UK Supermarkets Withdraw Belgian Food Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Supermarkets across Britain started
withdrawing all products containing Belgian eggs, poultry and pork
on Thursday following a cancer food alert and warning from the
government.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of a cancer-causing chemical dioxin in feed for
hens and pigs on some Belgian farms has already caused two Belgian
ministers to resign.
</P>
<P>
The health scare led the British Ministry of Agriculture to
warn food sellers in Britain to stop using all Belgian chicken,
eggs and pork products.
</P>
<P>
British Agriculture Minister Nick Brown admitted authorities
had not acted as quickly as they could have to prevent any risk to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
"My concern is that we've probably got to this later than we
should have done," he said.
</P>
<P>
He agreed this meant some shoppers had probably bought infected
products in the past couple of days.
</P>
<P>
The only way to guarantee not being at risk from eggs, poultry
or pork from Belgium would be not to eat it, he said, and added
that he would not eat Belgium food.
</P>
<P>
France, Germany and the Netherlands are believed to be most at
risk from having imported infected animal feed or products.
</P>
<P>
European Union vets have already ordered the destruction of
millions of pounds worth of chicken and eggs products exported
from Belgium since 15 January.

ZAGREB -- The Yugoslav government on Thursday accepted an

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Despite lingering differences in their positions, Russian
and Western envoys presented a plan to end the Kosovo conflict to
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on Wednesday, and the
Serbian parliament plans an emergency session to take up the
proposal on Thursday while talks continue.
</P>
<P>
-- An American Airlines jetliner landing in fierce wind gusts
careered off a rain- and hail-slicked runway in Little Rock,
Arkansas, slammed into a light tower and broke apart in flames,
killing eight passengers and the pilot and injuring more than 80
others on board.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton urged the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan
Milosevic, to "cut his losses" by bending to allied demands for
ending the NATO attacks on his country. The alternative, Clinton
said in an address to graduating Air Force academy cadets in
Colorado, is the military and economic devastation of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
-- On the first day of closing arguments in an explosive case
of police brutality in New York City, a Federal prosecutor
declared on Wednesday that four police officers had brutalized
Abner Louima in a night of violence and terror that ended in a
vicious assault in a police station restroom.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- A drought in Iraq has killed about 70 percent of the
nation's crops and threatens a catastrophe if aid isn't increased,
U.N. and Iraqi officials said. Meanwhile, the chief of U.N. arms
inspector urged retrieval of nerve-gas samples from abandoned
offices in Baghdad in response to a flap touched off by Russia.
</P>
<P>
-- New-home sales in the United States increased a sharp 9.2
percent in April as consumers rushed to lock in low mortgage rates.
The rise follows a 0.8 percent decline in March. Meanwhile, Car
sales rose to record or near-record levels for many auto makers in
May. Ford and Daimler-Chrysler had gains, but GM's sales dropped
5 percent, partly from weak Chevrolet sales.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Assessment Mission in East Timor Hoists Flag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Assessment
Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) hosted the blue and white U.N. flag
over its headquarters in Dili, capital of East Timor, Thursday in
a ceremony led by mission chief Ian Martin.
</P>
<P>
The flag-raising ceremony marks the official start of the
team's work on the implementation of a direct balloting on a
wide-ranging autonomy package offered by the Indonesian government
to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"It is an honor for us to welcome you all in the name of the
U.N. secretary general, with the establishment of our new office
for our mission in East Timor. We have the support of the
government to carry out the mission," Martin was quoted by Antara
News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Present at the ceremony were East Timor Governor Abilio Jose
Osorio Soares, Dili Bishop Carlos Belo and other officials.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Portuguese envoy to Indonesia Anna Gomes said U.N.
presence is needed in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"At last, the tripartite agreement signed in New York on May 5
could be implemented. The agreement has decided on a popular
consultation of the East Timorese this August to know their will,"
Gomes said.
</P>
<P>
According to Antara, pro-independence supporters kicked and
smashed the cars of three government officials following the
flag-raising ceremony at the headquarters of the UNAMET in Dili.
</P>
<P>
No one was injured, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Under a U.N.-brokered agreement with Portugal, Indonesia agreed
to hold the direct ballot in East Timor on August 8.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with a population of some 800,000 and an area of
15,000 square kilometers, had been a Portuguese colony until 1975.
It became an Indonesian province in 1976, but the U.N. never
recognized the move.
</P>
<P>
On January 27, the Indonesian government announced that it is
ready to release East Timor if the alternative to provide wider
autonomy is refused by the people in the region and the
international community.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladesh Estimates 5.2 Percent Growth This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has upped
its economic growth projection for the 1998-99 fiscal year from a
previously-anticipated less than 4 percent to a surprising 5.2
percent, which officials said was due to a bumper crop harvest.
</P>
<P>
Defending the achievement of 5.2 percent growth rate for the
current fiscal ending on June 30, 1999, State Minister for
Planning Mahiuddin Khan Alamgir told reporters Thursday that the
estimate was made "on the basis of correct and realistic data."
</P>
<P>
"There's no scope at all to brand this estimate as miraculous
or otherwise since it was based on realistic data available up to
May this year," he told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The unexpected development in the agriculture sector and other
key sectors had generated a kind of confidence to achieve a higher
growth of 7 percent next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture and Food Minister Motia Chowdhury said, "The heavy
amount of silt carried by last year's flood has helped a lot side
by side the government's efforts" for the country to have a good
harvest. She put the estimated food cereals production at 21.358
million tons, a 5 percent increase over that of last year.
</P>
<P>
The output of boro crop, an irrigational paddy variety, would
stand at 10.3 million tons, she said.
</P>
<P>
Normally, the country's GDP growth rate is announced in the
finance minister's budget speech before the parliament in June
each year. The early announcement of the growth rate this year has
surprised many people, who expressed doubt about the figures.
</P>
<P>
"5.2 percent looks miraculous, if you look at broad economic
situation and the last floods," World Bank country director
Federick Temple said last Sunday at a meeting with members of the
Foreign Investors' Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
He said the bank had estimated the growth rate would be around
3-4 percent supplemented by good boro crops.
</P>
<P>
Although the economy saw good development in boro crops, the
donor representative said, the manufacturing sector and exports
did pick the way everybody thought.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that the country fetched 2.98 billion
dollars during the July-January period, the first seven months of
the current fiscal, trailing the target of 3.28 billion dollars by
9 percent, and 1 percent less than the figure of the corresponding
period of the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Primary commodity exports slumped in both volume and value, by
14 percent and 18 percent respectively, while industrial exports
marked a slight upturn. Officials said the country lost 350
million to 500 million dollars in exports during the
three-month-long flood.
</P>
<P>
A report in Wednesday's edition of the Daily Star newspaper
said that the Agriculture Ministry originally set a target of 8.2
million tons of boro production this year, but raised it to 8.7
million tons in mid-February and further increased it to 9 million
tons in April.
</P>
<P>
The government fixed a target for this year crop production at
21 million tons, including 1.9 million tons of aus (a variety of
rice), 9.5 million tons of rain-fed aman rice, 7.8 million tons of
boro, and 1.8 million tons of wheat. But there was already a 0.3
million ton-loss in aus and 1.8 million tons of aman was wiped
away by floods, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The government had originally estimated a growth rate of 3.8
percent at the donors' consortium meeting in April this year,
which was revised to 4.5 percent in May keeping in mind a bumper
boro crop, and was later increased to 5.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report, quoting sources, said the Bangladesh Bureau of
Statistics had been asked to "back calculate" the other figures to
match the 5.2 growth rate and the boro output had been refixed at
over 10 million tons.
</P>
<P>
And a source in the government was quoted by the Financial
Express newspaper Tuesday as saying that the growth estimate might
have to be revised downward at a later stage.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh was severely hit by a prolonged flood in 1998, which
lasted from July to September, affecting over 30 million people,
resulting in more than 1,000 deaths and causing an estimated
overall loss of 4.3 billion U.S. dollars.

Yugoslavia, Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari who went to the
Yugoslav capital on Wednesday after having talked with Russian
envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin and United States Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
It will be the fourth time in four months for the EU leaders to
discuss the issue of Kosovo where NATO warplanes have been
dropping missiles and bombs since March 24.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders have tasked the Finnish president to go to
Belgrade to gauge how Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic would
accept the peace plan worked out by the Group of Seven and Russia
last month.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- China's State Environmental
Protection Administration (SEPA) said today that the general
ecology in the Three Gorges Project area basically remained the
same last year as the year before.
</P>
<P>
It also called for urgent measures to protect wild animals and
forests in the area.
</P>
<P>
The SEPA said in an annual environmental monitoring bulletin
released today that the people moved out of the reservoir area
have remained healthy, and the undertakings concerning science,
education, culture and social security in the region have
witnessed a rapid development.
</P>
<P>
The environment has been improved and plant species have
remained quite rich, it said, adding that the water quality of the
mainstream of the Yangtze River has remained good, with no
remarkable changes during the year.
</P>
<P>
However, the bulletin points out that the top priority must be
to protect local wild animals and forests, and to get rid of the
garbage along the river.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Ecological and Environmental Monitoring System,
set up in 1996 by government departments in charge of
environmental protection, agriculture and forestry, has enabled
scientists to collect a lot of data and played a major role in
coordinated development of environmental improvement and
construction in the area.

LAGOS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Monarch of an Itsekiri community was
feared killed Wednesday by Ijaw militant youths in the deepening
crisis, which has claimed more than 200 lives, in southern
Nigeria's port city of Warri.
</P>
<P>
Olara-Aja of Ugborodo, the monarch of an Itsekiri community in
the Warri South West Local Government Area, was missing and
allegedly beheaded by some youths suspected to be Ijaws, reported
Punch, a major Nigerian daily Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The alleged king came after reports of a fresh Itsekiri
counter-attack on Ijaw communities, leading to the death of seven
persons.
</P>
<P>
The Itsekiris allegedly launched the attack on Sahara Bubon, an
Ijaw community, at about 6:30 p.m. (1730GMT) Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian government Tuesday had urgently deployed an additional
150 soldiers to the troubled Warri area in the country's oil rich
Delta Sate as conflict there seemed to be escalating.
</P>
<P>
Delta State Governor James Ibori had also held an urgent
meeting with leaders of Ijaw, Itsekiri, and Urhobo, the three
main ethnic groups in Warri region Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Militant Ijaw youths Monday touched the entire Itsekiri
dominant village of Aruton, including two primary and one
secondary schools, killing reportedly about 200 people.
</P>
<P>
Although Delta governor pledged his support for the agitation
by the youths for better stake in the national resources located
in their communities, he condemned the use of violence.
</P>
<P>
The trouble was triggered when tax collectors from the two
council areas, which are in a hot debate over the ownership of
the area, are on their revenue drives one week ago.

<HEADLINE> Clashes Erupt Between Palestinians and Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- "No peace with settlement" is no mere
a slogan carried by the Palestinians today, better known as the
"day of anger, in the face of Israeli settlers, but is a true
event unfolding in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Violent confrontations raged out in the day between angry
Palestinian youths, on the one hand, and Israeli troops, on the
other, opposite the settlement of Nitsareem in the Khan Younis
governorate, south of Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The two sides exchanged stones for tear gas grenades and rubber
bullets. At least two injured Palestinians were rushed to hospital.
</P>
<P>
At the crossroads opposite the settlement of Kosh Karif located
in the vicinity of the Khan Younis municipality, about 1,000
Palestinians from all walks of life staged peaceful marches in
protest against Israeli settlement activities in Palestinian lands.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli troops in charge of protecting the settlement were
on a high alert. Thereupon, the Palestinian police force
intervened to separate the masses and the Israeli troops.
Demonstrations and speeches went on in a quiet, peaceful
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The masses, expressing their outrage, shouted slogans such as
"no peace with settlement", "settlements an international crime",
"no to settlements - no to Judaization of Jerusalem - yes to
checking occupation out of Palestinian lands".
</P>
<P>
In a statement to Xinhua, Dr Awad Higazi, chairman of the
national and Islamic anti-settlement committee in the southern
zone, said these marches are an expression of the Palestinian
people's determination to defend their lands, and constitute a
clear message to the Israeli government to learn that settlements
will not find stability.
</P>
<P>
"Though peace is our strategic option. But, he who seeks
settlement does not really want peace, because peace and
settlement will never meet, " he added.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Ibrahim Abul Naja, speaker of the Palestinian
Legislative Council, told Xinhua, "should the Israeli government
fail to put an end to settlement practices which aim at seizing
and usurping our territory, the Palestinian people are not
responsible for whatever takes place later.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim held the world responsible for confronting the Israeli
government which disregarded agreements signed with the
Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
He said the Palestinian people were asserting their basic
principle of "no peace with settlement and no negotiations with
settlement".
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim demanded the Israeli government to cease all settlement
activities and to abolish all that had taken place.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sakhr Bassisso, governor of the Khan Younis
governorate, told Xinhua that "the Palestinian people are for
peace, but the peace process is presently facing the dangers of
settlement activities."
</P>
<P>
"We want peace, but on the basis of restoration of Palestinian
people's rights, hence, the prevalence of security and stability
in the region, " he said.
</P>
<P>
"We want Israel, once our enemey, to become a partner in the
institution of peace in this region," the governor added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, anti-settlement mass movements have taken place on
Thursday throughout the West Bank in response to a resolution
adopted by the fifth anti-settlement national conference of May
30.
</P>
<P>
The conference designated today as the "day of anger and
rejection" of Israeli settlement practices in Palestinian lands.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Palestinian in Jerusalem went on general strike in
the day in solidarity with the national events taking place in the
West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The number of Israeli settlements on Palestinian lands has run
up to 170 units with a population of well over 200,000 people by
the end of 1998, according to the Israeli Bureau of Statistics.

CAIRO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israeli government's tax collection increased only
0.2 percent to reach 50.6 billion shekels (about 12.3 billion
U.S. dollars) in the first five months of the year compared with
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The low collection led to a shortage of 1.4 billion shekels
(340 million dollars) from the projected tax revenues in the 1999
state budget, The Jerusalem Post reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's polished diamond exports reached 379
million dollars in May, a 13 percent increase over May 1998.
</P>
<P>
The total diamond exports for the first five months of this
year amounted to 1.721 billion dollars, a 4 percent growth over
the same period last year, The Jerusalem Post reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- U.S. multinational 3M Company has invested 10
million dollars in Israeli BATM Advanced Communications company,
which is 3M's first-ever investment in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The deal, which was announced earlier this week, grants 3M the
option of raising its holdings in BATM from 4.5 percent to 9.9
percent in a year's time.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Iraq's losses from the U.N.-imposed oil embargo has
amounted to about 160 billion dollars by the end of April, and are
expected to rise in the coming months after the renewal of the
oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
The world energy studies center said the losses are estimated
based on Iraq's oil exporting capacity of 3 million barrels per
day before the imposition of the sanctions in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is currently producing 2.5 million barrels of petroleum
per day, 2 million of which are exported under the oil-for-food
deal with the U.N., the Arabic daily Al Hayat reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The deal, which started in 1996, allowed Iraq to export limited
amount of oil to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian goods
for its 22 million people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is the second largest petroleum producing country in the
world after Saudi Arabia, with reserves estimated at 112 billion
barrels.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Saudi Arabia has lifted the temporary embargo imposed
against the import of sheep, goats and camels from Djibouti,
Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Yemen, Mauritania, Tanzania and
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
But it maintains ban on importing cows from these states and
all African countries on account of the cattle plague, the Arabic
economic daily Alam Al Yom reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Saudi sources said the embargo was lifted after the Ministry of
Agriculture and Water received assurance reports from the
U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, the World Health
Organization and the International Organization on Animal Health.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Accepts Peace Plan for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav government on Thursday
accepted an international peace plan for Kosovo, the state-run
Tanjug news agency, monitored here, reported.
</P>
<P>
The Tanjug report came after Serbia's parliament overwhelmingly
approved the peace plan designed to end the Kosovo crisis and the
U.S-led NATO bombardment of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The peace plan was presented to Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic Wednesday by the Balkans envoys, former Russian premier
Viktor Chernomyrdin and Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari.
</P>
<P>
The plan was approved by 136 members of the 250 seat parliament
while 74 voted against, with three abstentions, the French news
agency AFP quoted Dragan Veselinov, a deputy with the opposition
Coalition Vojvodina, as saying.
</P>
<P>
It also quoted Finnish Foreign Ministry spokesman Yrjo
Lansituro as saying that the talks between the two envoys and
Milosevic would be resumed "as soon as possible" after the
parliamentary vote.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace plan, NATO and Russia would separately send
troops to Kosovo as part of a peacekeeping presence with the
United Nations' approval and support.
</P>
<P>
NATO and Yugoslavia would have to hammer out a document on the
withdrawal of Yugoslav troops from Kosovo so that NATO would end
its bombing that started on March 24.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during talks near Bonn among
Chernomyrdin, his EU counterpart and Finnish President Ahtisaari
and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott earlier
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The outlines of the peace plan were agreed on May 6 by foreign
ministers of the seven most industrialized nations -- Britain,
Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States -- and
Russia, which form what is called the Group of Eight.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Chief Executive on Civil Service Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Thursday stressed the
six primary principles on the civil service reform.
</P>
<P>
These include changing amidst stability; reforming step by step;
taking a comprehensive overview; holding wide consultation;
adopting practicable measures; and ensuring that the reform is
reasonable and lawful.
</P>
<P>
Tung made these remarks at the 85th anniversary reception of
the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants' Association Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Since the proposed civil service reform was announced by the
government in March this year, members of all civil service unions
and bodies have been very active in joining discussions and
voicing their opinions.
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong has an excellent team of civil servants and
all its people should take pride in. With the approach of the 21
st century and a rapidly changing external environment, he said: "
We are undergoing a difficult process of economic recovery."
</P>
<P>
It is indeed essential that the civil service keeps pace with
the community it serves, improves itself and enhances its
efficiency so that services of better quality can be made
available to the community, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will put special emphasis on the introduction of changes
amidst stability, the step-by-step implementation of reforms and
the reasonableness and lawfulness of reform," he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that civil service reform is of course a complicated
process with far-reaching impact, he expressed the hope that
members of the staff unions and their colleagues will continue to
put forward their views and take part in discussions actively so
that practical and feasible proposals will be worked out with
concerted efforts.

LONDON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said on Thursday that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic must
fulfill NATO's demands in full.
</P>
<P>
"Those terms aren't negotiable. They are there, they are set

<HEADLINE> Pak Committed to Dialogue Process With India: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif Thursday stressed that his country is still looking forward
to peaceful dialogue with India and defusing of tension in
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Despite the current fire exchanges in Kashmir, Sharif said that
he still hopes that the Lahore Declaration which he signed with
his Indian counterpart Atal Bihari Vajpayee "would prove to be a
milestone in their efforts to banish conflict, dissipate tension
and promote meaningful dialogue for a just and final settlement of
the Kashmir dispute".
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press briefing at the Prime Minister's House
Thursday afternoon, Sharif blamed India for initiating military
action in Kashmir, the disputed area which has brought India and
Pakistan into two wars.
</P>
<P>
The situation now is "fraught with dangers and serious risks,"
observed the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Since early May, troops of Pakistan and India began exchanging
fire across the Line of Control (LoC). India went so far as to
launch air strikes on May 26 in the LoC area, which was claimed to
be aimed at eliminating so-called "Pakistan-backed Muslim
infiltrators."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan shot down two Indian MiG jets on May 27, alleging they
violated Pakistan's air space.
</P>
<P>
"We want to prevent any further escalation and to defuse this
situation," said Sharif, adding that India has escalated military
action on both sides of the LoC in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
He also condemned the killing of ten school children in India's
artillery shelling on schools.

<HEADLINE> Japan Scores Goaless Draw with Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Japan failed to delight its home fans
as the hosts played a goalless draw with Belgium in the three-
nation Kirin Cup soccer tournament on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It was very good 0-0 draw and means we kept our chances alive,
" said French coach Philippe Troussier, "we will wait until Sunday
to decide who will be the winners."
</P>
<P>
The Japanese were a bit tense in the first half, but made no
mistakes as the Belgians pressed very hard for a victory although
Sandy Martens, Marc Hendrikx and Gert Verheyen all missed their
shots.
</P>
<P>
Verheyen was close to the goal as his shot hit the left post
soon before the break.
</P>
<P>
The home side also had its chance when substitute Atsushi
Yanagisawa produced a pass for Wagner Lopes in the 76th minute,
who netted in but was ruled off side.
</P>
<P>
Four minutes later, Mbo Mpenza also netted an off-side goal
after a corner.
</P>
<P>
"Normally, we have to win a game of this level. I believe we
must have scored two goals in the first half. Japan also must have
scored one goal," said Belgian head coach Georges Leekens.
</P>
<P>
Belgium ended with two draws after they held Peru 1-1 in the
opener last weekend. They were to leave for South Korea Friday
morning for a friendly match.
</P>
<P>
Peru will take on Japan on Sunday to vie for the 160,000 US
dollars title.

<HEADLINE> EU Sets Common Strategy for Cooperation With Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOGNE, June 3 (Xinhua) -- During its summit in Cologne, the
European Union (EU) adopted a foreign policy strategy that will
enable Europe to work more effectively with Russia.
</P>
<P>
State and government leaders from the 15 EU members have
devised a "strategic partnership" with Russia, said Uwe-Karsten
Heye, a German government spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The Goal of EU's "common strategy plan toward Russia" is to
develop a durable and close partnership that will provide Russia
with an opportunity for "greater participation in the European
continent's future," Heye said.
</P>
<P>
EU members will coordinate their Russian policy more closely,
and it will provide Russia with more experience in building modern
political, economic, social and managerial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The EU called for more enduring political and security
dialogues, strengthened contacts, and more frequent visits between
the countries' peoples International organizations such as the U.N.
, the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE),
the European Council, and International financial institutions,
should strive to cooperate with each other more intensively.
</P>
<P>
The common strategy underlines the importance of stabilizing
Russia's energy policy, its nuclear security, and its battles
against organized crimes.
</P>
<P>
On the Kosovo issue, Heye said EU leaders insist that all
peacekeeping troops to be deployed in Kosovo, including Russians,
be put under a unified military command.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace plan worked out by the Group of Eight, NATO and
Russia will separately send troops to Kosovo as part of a
peacekeeping presence with the approval and support of the United
Nations.

SHANGHAI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- A trade symposium attended by
experts from the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) and Chinese trade officials and personnel
ended today in Shanghai, China's largest city and a major import
and export base.
</P>
<P>
The three-day symposium has focused on the universal favorable
treatment system of the UNCTAD and relevant trade laws and
regulations. The system requires developed countries to grant
preferential treatment such as tariff reductions for the exports
of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
During the symposium, eight officials and experts from the
UNCTAD delivered speeches introducing the latest policies of the
European Union, Japan, Canada, Norway, Switzerland and other
developed nations in adopting the universal favorable treatment
system.
</P>
<P>
The 200-strong Chinese audience later drew the conclusion that
China still has great potentials in expanding its exports through
a better use of the universal favorable treatment system.
</P>

<HEADLINE> State-Level Arts Festivals To Introduce Market Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Competition is to become an element
of the only two state-level arts festivals in China, the National
Arts Festival and the Shanghai International Arts Festival, in
order to explore a new market-oriented mechanism for the country's
cultural sector.
</P>
<P>
This will take the form of fund-raising, advertising and box
office receipts, according to the organizing committee of the 6th
China National Arts Festival.
</P>
<P>
The committee will also seek opinions from the general public
through public bidding to select the best scheme.
</P>
<P>
The festival, to be held in October 2000, will raise funds from
the government reserves, social investment, box office receipts
from performances and a range of other sources.
</P>
<P>
A high profile broadcast during TV's prime time or an eye-
catching page in the print media could also attract funds from
advertisement income.
</P>
<P>
"The Shanghai International Arts Festival is to be run as a
business enterprise and the Ministry of Culture and Shanghai
Municipal Government will not invest even a single cent," said
Zhou Muyao, Vice-Mayor of Shanghai, in a recent news release.
</P>
<P>
"Invitations to artistic groups and box office management will
be controlled by agents and intermediary companies who will
compete to win the business and be responsible for either profits
or losses," according to Zhou.
</P>
<P>
China's international performing arts fair will also be held
during the festival and many cultural agents worldwide will be
invited with the hope of promoting future cultural trade between
China and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
"The key to the development of China's cultural sector is the
renewal of ideas, management and technology," as Li Yuanchao, Vice
Minister of Culture, puts it.
</P>
<P>
"The government is shifting its role to a more macroscopical
supervision and a system of modern enterprise is under way, with
more versatile and wide-ranged cultural products to meet the
increasing demand of the public," Li said.

<HEADLINE> Cartoons Help In China's Drug Crack Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- A hard-hitting book of cartoons has
been published by China's Ministry of Public Security as part of
its crack down on narcotics and to boost its campaign to warn
young people about the dangers of drug use and abuse.
</P>
<P>
Last year the ministry sponsored the National Anti-Narcotics
Exhibition in Beijing which received a record shattering 1.6
million visitors. The new book incorporates some of the best
illustrations and cartoons which were on display.
</P>
<P>
Deng Ming, an official with the ministry's narcotics bureau,
said the new book was aimed at helping China's young people
understand the evils of drugtaking and urge them to keep away from
them throughout their lives.
</P>
<P>
"It also looks at the current domestic and international
narcotics situation and outlines the policies adopted by Chinese
government in its anti-drug campaign," added Deng.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese central government has been striking hard at the
narcotics trade, while some local governments such as southwest
China's Yunnan Province have injected hundreds of millions of yuan
to persuade peasants in the notorious "Golden Triangle" area to
plant grain and cash crops instead of opium poppies, which was
their primary source of income for generations.
</P>
<P>
Deng said that the Chinese government also helps drug-addicts
to quit their bad habit through medical treatment and
psychological rehabilitation, as well as providing overall
assistance from society.
</P>
<P>
"China now has a registered drug population of some 600,000,
four-fifths of them youngsters and children," he added.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Expects Bumper Crop: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is expecting a bumper
harvest this year, with the total food cereals production to reach
over 21 million tons, a 5-percent increase over that of last year,
Agriculture and Food Minister Begum Motia Chowdhury said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We have made a conservative estimate on the basis of available
data up to May 1999, that the food cereals production this year
would surely be a total of 21.358 million tons," she told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
The government's war-footing efforts to produce more food in
the country had amply contributed towards this year's bumper crop
production, she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this bumper crop, she said, "We have constantly
maintained a coordination in the distribution of fertilizer and
other agri-inputs as well as supplying diesel with the help of the
concerned ministry for irrigation purpose to the crop areas
throughout the country."
</P>
<P>
Crop damaged by flood and bumper crop following a flood "was
never a miraculous event" in this country, she said, explaining
that since flood-silt enhances fertility of land, crop production
automatically increases but there must be sincere efforts of the
government.
</P>
<P>
The total food cereals production this year would register an
increase by one million tons over last year's level despite the
century's worst flood that created havoc on the overall economy
and the agriculture in particular, she added.

<HEADLINE> Renault Seeking Auto Plant Approval in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The French auto company Renault is
seeking Chinese government approval to set up a joint venture
assembly plant in Beijing to produce multi-purpose vehicles (MPV).
</P>
<P>
Li Honglu, an official from Beijing Automotive Industry Group,
said that the company has put forward a plan for setting up a
joint venture with Renault to the central government for approval.
</P>
<P>
He said that the plan has won support from the government
departments that are in charge of the auto industry.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks at the Auto Parts, Manufacturing and
Related Products Show being held here this week.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture is designed to turn out some 30,000 Megane
MPVs every year. The Chinese name of the model is Scenic. The
model won the best car in Europe award in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese government has made clear that it will not
approve the establishment of any car plant that has an annual
production capacity under 150,000 and it has not listed MPVs as
cars on its industrial catalogue. Therefore the proposed Renault
joint venture does not run against the country's industrial plan.
</P>
<P>
Li said that Beijing has been the production base of light vans
and cross-field vehicles in China and the new MPV plant would add
a new growth area to the local auto industry. He said that the
Renault joint venture will also help local auto parts companies to
improve technological standards and update products.
</P>
<P>
Renault is displaying two Scenic cars at the show. Yang Jungang,
director of the Sales Department of the Beijing Automotive
Industry Import and Export Corporation, said that the cars are
currently sold at prices around 290,000 yuan (35,000 US dollars)
in China.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Military Experts Refute COX Report (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese military experts said today
that accusations of China's alleged "theft" of classified U.S.
military information contained in the Cox Report are not only
ridiculous, but also an intentional insult designed to show
contempt for Chinese scientists.
</P>
<P>
The report uses ambiguous language, rather than specific and
persuasive evidence, to accuse China of stealing the U.S. nuclear,
missile and satellite technology.
</P>
<P>
A special committee chaired by Representative Christopher Cox
recently released the report on China's alleged "theft" of U.S.
military technology.
</P>
<P>
Wang Fei, a nuclear scientist with the Chinese Defense
Scientific and Technical Information Center, said that U.S.
nuclear threats and blackmail in the early 1950s forced China to
develop nuclear weapons. China successfully tested the atom bomb
and H-bomb and launched its own satellite long before establishing
diplomatic relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
"The strict blockade at the time made it impossible for China
to acquire the nuclear technology from the United States and we
relied solely on our own strength to develop limited self-defense
nuclear power," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China has many excellent missile experts and
nuclear researchers with high-level innovative capacity. China has
never in the past, nor will it in the future base its development
of nuclear weapons on foreign technology.
</P>
<P>
The Cox Report quite simply contains outrageous fabricated
accusations that China stole classified data for seven types of
nuclear warheads, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the performance data of the warheads in question was
published in public periodicals in the United States in the 1970s
and 1980s. Therefore, the theft of such information was both
impossible and unnecessary.

<HEADLINE> Serbian Parliament Approves Peace Plan for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Serbia's parliament Thursday
overwhelmingly approved an international peace plan for Kosovo
designed to end the Kosovo crisis and the U.S-led NATO bombardment
of Yugoslavia, news reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The peace plan was presented to Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic Wednesday by the Balkans envoys, former Russian premier
Viktor Chernomyrdin and Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari.
</P>
<P>
The plan was approved by 136 members of the 250 seat parliament
while 74 voted against, with three abstentions, the French news
agency AFP quoted Dragan Veselinov, a deputy with the opposition
Coalition Vojvodina, as saying.
</P>
<P>
It also quoted Finnish Foreign Ministry spokesman Yrjo
Lansituro as saying that the talks between the two envoys and
Milosevic would be resumed "as soon as possible" after the
parliamentary vote.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace plan, NATO and Russia would separately send
troops to Kosovo as part of a peacekeeping presence with the
United Nations' approval and support.
</P>
<P>
NATO and Yugoslavia would have to hammer out a document on the
withdrawal of Yugoslav troops from Kosovo so that NATO would end
its bombing that started on March 24.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during talks near Bonn among
Chernomyrdin, his EU counterpart and Finnish President Ahtisaari
and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott earlier
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The outlines of the peace plan were agreed on May 6 by foreign
ministers of the seven most industrialized nations -- Britain,
Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States -- and
Russia, which form what is called the Group of Eight.

The expert, a participant in negotiations concerning joint Sino-
U.S. satellite launches, said security officials from the U.S.
Department of Defense participated in all negotiations. They
supervised both Chinese and U.S. technicians, and normal contacts
between participants from the two sides were closely monitored.
</P>
<P>
During the cooperation U.S. companies protect their commercial
interests and steadfastly guard against leaking high-tech research
achievements to China, he added.
</P>
<P>
Missile expert Li Ying pointed to the U.S. censorship
surrounding classified technology and noted that any mention of
sensitive technology in science magazines will be deleted by U.S.
departments concerned prior to publication.
</P>
<P>
"That explains why we quite often find publications with
incomplete or missing pages," according to the expert.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts agreed that the Cox Report simply represents a
continuity of the U.S. containment policy towards China since
World War II and is quite simply another failed attempt to attack
China on issues related to human rights, Taiwan and Tibet.

<P>
One unnamed Chinese space technology expert pointed out that
China successfully launched 30 satellites with constantly
improving precision rates prior to 1992.
</P>
<P>
The expert cited the fact that satellite launches require
highly sophisticated technology and are thus subject to normal
successes and failures.
</P>
<P>
Just as their foreign counterparts, Chinese experts have
continued to improve the design and management of satellites.
Therefore, rising precision rates are quite natural, according to
the expert.
</P>
<P>
He asked: "Has the high U.S. success rate for satellite
launches resulted from the theft of outside technology?"
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts have independently conducted extensive
investigations of all failure of attempts to launch commercial U.S.
satellites with Chinese carrier rockets, he said.
</P>
<P>
Calculation and analysis of telemetry data and recovered debris,
as well as simulations, have enabled Chinese experts to determine
the cause of problems and introduce technological upgrades, the
expert said. And it is totally groundless that the Cox Report
alleged the cause was determined with the help of U.S. experts.
</P>
<P>
"How can we expect help from any U.S. company in the
investigations after the foiled attempts to launch U.S. commercial
satellite since it is impossible for us to provide our state-of-
the-art rocket manufacturing technology to the United States?"
according to the expert.
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of fact, China has never received technological
support from a U.S. satellite manufacturing company in this
respect."
</P>
<P>
Yet another veteran expert who has been observed launches on
several occasions pointed out that the tight security system
implemented by the U.S. side makes it impossible for the Chinese
side to gain access to satellite technology during the launch of U.
S. commercial satellites.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that U.S. satellites are subject to tight security
after entering Chinese territory. U.S. aircraft deliver satellites
to the Chinese launch site and all containers are immune from
customs inspections. The launching site is totally isolated from
the outside and the U.S. side controls access to all workshops. In
fact, it is the U.S. side that is responsible for round-the-clock
security.
</P>
<P>
What's more, he said, all satellite test facilities are linked
to an electronic supervision system under U.S. supervision.  (

MANILA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Airlines Chairman Lucio
Tan said Thursday that he can now raise the 200 million U.S.
dollars before the June 4 deadline imposed by the Securities and
Exchange Commission to keep the flag carrier in business.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Presidential Palace said in a news release that Tan
informed Philippine President Joseph Estrada of the new
development Thursday afternoon in Japan, where Estrada is on a
working visit and Tan is part of the business delegation
accompanying the president.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said Tan was able to raise the entire 200 million U.S.
dollars without tapping government financial institutions for help
in coming up with the amount that would pave the way for the
implementation of PAL's rehabilitation plan.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Secretary Jose Pardo said the infusion of
fresh capital into PAL is part of the final step that will signal
the start of the airline's rehabilitation program on June 5.
</P>
<P>
He said Tan and his group will have to deposit the amount with
a bank in the Philippines, after which the interim receiver for
PAL will inform the SEC of the deposit.
</P>
<P>
The SEC in turn will appoint a permanent receiver, which, along
with the new PAL management group, would implement the
rehabilitation plan.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said earlier the government would take over the task of
looking for new PAL investors should Tan fail to raise the
required amount to keep PAL flying.

<HEADLINE> World Bank: Angola's End of Foreign Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank representative to
Angola, Philipe Owsu, said that Angolan government's removal of
its foreign exchange control is "important and timely".
</P>
<P>
Owsu said that the measure has brought "active influence" to
the macro-economy of the country, and has temporarily stopped the
drop of the local currency kwanza, the Angola Daily reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan State Bank, the central bank, announced on May 21
the end of fixed exchange rate system, and let the market adjust
the exchange rate, in consideration that the country's foreign
reserve was on the brink of exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
Owsu said that the World Bank will continue to negotiate with
the Angolan government to find out solutions for the serious
economic problems in the country.
</P>
<P>
The official also said that the Angolan government must take
further actions to improve the macro-economic situation in the
country before the World Bank start its aid plan to the country.
</P>
<P>
The actions which are taken as pre-conditions for the World
Bank aid, Owsu said, include a strict control of financial
spending, the cut of inflation, the realization of a transparency
system for the finance.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has finished three of the 10 aid programs in
the country, which cover basic education, energy, transportation,
water supply and health projects. The programs will cost 250
million U.S. dollars, for which the World Bank will spend 90
percent of the total and the rest come from the Angolan
government.
</P>
<P>
Since 1997, Angola has fallen into serious economic crisis with
the fall of oil price in the world market and the re-start of
civil war in the country.

China hopes that the court, in the following procedure, could
make a just sentence in accordance with facts of the case and the
law, the spokesman said.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- China's private sector has
maintained an upbeat momentum this year, with the number of newly-
emerged businesses surging in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the State Administration for Industry
and Commerce (SAIC) available today, China had 67,100 new private
firms during the January-March period, with the average registered
capital of each private firm hitting 616,500 yuan.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the crop farming and animal husbandry
sectors of the primary industry had 1,055 newly-added enterprises,
accounting for 65 percent of the total increase in the sector.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector embraced over 20,000 new firms, while
the wholesales and retail sales sector as well as the catering
industry had 32,000 newly established businesses.
</P>
<P>
China re-defined the status and role of the private sector in
March by adding to the Constitution that the non-public sector is
"an important component of the country's socialist market economy".
This has strongly boosted the development of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
SAIC sources indicate that China had a total of over 1.23
million private companies by March this year, with combined
registered capital exceeding 750 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Up to March, more than 16 million people were employed in the
sector, slightly down from the figure in December last year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the drop in employees is only seasonal, as
large numbers of floating employees in the catering sector
returned home for reunions during China's traditional Spring
Festival which fell on February 16 this year.

<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- China will erect an environmental
protection monument at the source of the Yangtze River, China's
longest river, on June 5 which is International Environment Day.
</P>
<P>
An official from the State Environmental Protection
Administration said at a news conference here today that the
building of the monument aims to emphasize the importance of
protecting the environment and ecology along the river and improve
public awareness of environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The 6,300-kilometer-long Yangtze River starts at the
Jianggendiru Glacier on the southwestern foothills of the 6,621-
meter-high snow-covered Geladandong Mountain, the main peak of the
Tanggula Mountains in northwestern Qinghai Province. About one
third of the Chinese population live along the valley of the river.
</P>
<P>
In the past one hundred years the environment of the river has
deteriorated rapidly, with forest coverage areas dropping to 10
percent of the original figure. And the soil erosion areas now
exceed 570,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Last year's devastating floods along the Yangtze River caused
heavy economic losses. In addition to abnormal climatic conditions,
environmental and ecological deterioration is an explanation for
the floods, experts say.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan C. Bank Officials held over Money Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Twenty Central Bank officials have
been arrested over the loss of 30 millions Rwandan Francs (RF) or
87,714 U.S. dollars since the end of last week ; official sources
from the Rwandan Central Bank disclosed.
</P>
<P>
"The money displaced ranged between 20 million RFs (57,142
dollars) and 30 million RFs (87,714 dollars) only made up of 5,000
notes which were designed to be "recycled for the new ones," the
Rwanda News Agency (RNA) quoted official sources from the Bank as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The detainees deny misplacing all that much. However, they
agree to have distributed among themselves 10 million RFs (28,571
dollars) which they say will be disbursed .Official sources say
the money was locked up in its fullness.
</P>
<P>
It is said that outdated money is kept in safe custody and is
only opened if all officials are available.
</P>
<P>
Those who were arrested include those responsible for recycling
and the supervisors. However, they do not accept the
accountability of the rest of the money other than 10 million RFs
(28,571 dollars) they shared among themselves.
</P>
<P>
Further investigations are being undertaken by the Central Bank
Governor Francois Mutemberezi and the criminal Investigation
Department in Kigali.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank , following a presidential decree no. 03/01 of
March 17, 1999, is to introduce new Rwandan currencies of 5000,
1000 and 500 notes to ease the misplacement .

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Legislators Turn Elections into Fracas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Legislators in Lagos and Imo State in
Nigeria Wednesday turned their inauguration into a free-for-all
fight as they tried to protest against the election of the House
President.
</P>
<P>
The confusion in Lagos State Assembly started as 14 of the
State's 40 legislators protested what they termed as the
"imposition" of a "non- indigene" on them as the speaker of the
House.
</P>
<P>
As the clerk of the house Lamidi Gbadamosi was to introduce the
 proceeding after the State Governor, Chief Justice took seat in
the Assembly house, some of the aggrieved legislators swooped on
him to snatch the microphone.
</P>
<P>
They shouted "no proclamation today. Nothing will happen here
today." Then came the flying of chairs, tables, broken pieces
of glass, which had lasted several hours, before the Lagos
Governor, Ahaji Ahmed Bota Tnubu and his aged mother Abibat
Mogaji, tried to get out from the back door.
</P>
<P>
Several persons including the deputy speaker of the house were
injured in the chaotic event.
</P>
<P>
Armed police were ushered in to chase out some protesting
legislators to allow the governor to proclaim the opening of the
State Assembly before his escaping from the back door.
</P>
<P>
The newly-elected speaker, Adeleke Olorunimbe Mamowora,
explained afterwards that the trouble was caused by some group of
disgruntled legislators who wanted to conduct a shadow election
and impose a speaker on the house.
</P>
<P>
He described the incident as "not unusual in a democratic
setting" but said he felt "embarrassed" by the incident.
</P>
<P>
Equally embarrassing was the incident in Owerri, the lmo State
Capital where legislators also engaged in a fight over the
election of the speaker.

"This act was in violation of the most basic humanitarian
principles, as they used a warship to ram an unarmed Chinese
fishing vessel," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"It is known to everyone that Huangyan Island is part of
Chinese territory and the area where the incident occurred is
within the Chinese fishermen's traditional fishing area," he added.
</P>
<P>
During the past few years the Philippino side has time and
again detained Chinese fishing vessels and fishermen in the south
China Sea, he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhu pointed out that China has already expressed its strong
displeasure at the actions of the Filipino navy, and urged the
Philippine side to punish those responsible for the incident and
compensate the Chinese fishermen for their losses.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Coalition governments are in
the offing in South Africa's Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal as it
appears that none of the parties could win a simple majority.
</P>
<P>
The African National Congress (ANC) and the Inkatha Freedom
Party (IFP) are in a neck-to-neck race in KwaZulu-Natal. In the
Western Cape, the New National Party (NNP) is leading by a small
margin, but is unlikely to be heading for a simple majority.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary results by noon Thursday based on 61
percent of the votes, the IFP has 40 percent of support in
KwaZulu-Natal and the ANC, 39 percent. In the Western Cape, the
NNP has gained 42 percent, compared with 38 percent for the ANC.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party secured a third place in both provinces,
with 13 percent of the vote in the Western Cape and 10 percent in
KwaZulu-Natal.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say there is a fair chance of ANC-IFP coalition in
KwaZulu- Natal while the form of coalition in the Western Cape is
still not clear.
</P>
<P>
During its election campaign, the DP has categorically ruled
out coalition with the ANC in the Western Cape, saying that an
opposition party should be strengthened instead of the ANC.
</P>
<P>
According to initial results, the ANC has won all the other
seven provinces.
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the ANC is heading for a two-thirds majority,
according to projections by the South African Broadcasting
Corporation television.
</P>
<P>
With 62 percent of the votes counted by Thursday morning, the
ANC won 64 percent of the vote, followed by the DP with 11
percent. Both the NNP and IFP got eight percent.

<HEADLINE> Britain Says Serbian Resolution Not Enough to Stop Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Thursday that a vote
by the Serbian parliament to accept an international peace plan
for Kosovo was "an interesting development," but was not enough to
persuade NATO to call off its airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
"A simple resolution of the Serbian parliament is not going to
be enough to persuade a single refugee to go back into Kosovo so
there is still a lot of water to go under that particular bridge,"
Defense Secretary George Robertson told a briefing.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made shortly after Serbia's parliament on
Thursday accepted the "international peace plan for Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
Britain, the most hawkish in the NATO nations, repeatedly said
that the bombing should keep on "until Yugoslavia accepted all the
terms of the military alliance."
</P>
<P>
Serbia's parliament overwhelmingly approved the peace plan for
Kosovo designed to end the Kosovo crisis and the U.S-led NATO
bombardment of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The peace plan was presented to Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic Wednesday by the Balkans envoys, former Russian premier
Viktor Chernomyrdin and Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari.

Kosovo and a unionwide employment pact.
</P>
<P>
The summit attendants are expected to discuss and hear a report
by EU envoy to Yugoslavia, Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, who
went to the Yugoslav capital Wednesday after talking with Russian
envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin and United States Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbot in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
It will be the fourth time in four months for the EU leaders to
discuss the issue of Kosovo where NATO warplanes have been
dropping missiles and bombs since March 24.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders have tasked the Finnish president to go to
Belgrade to gauge how Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic would
accept the peace plan worked out by the Group of Seven and Russia
last month.
</P>
<P>
The Summit host, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, said
prior to the summit meeting that there had been "substantial
progress" in bringing together the positions of the EU, the United
States and Russia over how to end the NATO air campaign.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders are also expected to approve a European defense
and security initiative which is to choose a European to serve as
the union's foreign and security policy chief. The initiative will
also give the union the capability to use NATO military assets for
regional peacekeeping operations without involving the United
States.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana has been hailed as the
most likely candidate for the post.
</P>
<P>
The two-day summit is due to endorse a European Employment Pact,
which was brought forward by Schroeder as one of the main tasks
for the German EU presidency, which ends in June. The rotating
presidency will be taking over by Finland for the next six months.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, however, different statements, aired by the Union
of Industrial and Employers' Confederations of Europe and the
European Trades Union Confederation showed that the parties of
labor and management are still way from agreeing on how to deal
with the problem of joblessness.
</P>
<P>
Within the 15-nation union, one out of every 10 workers are now
without a job.

<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- China urged the UN Special
Commission (UNSCOM) in Baghdad to give "detailed and satisfactory
explanations" to the UN Security Council about recent finding of
sarin and VX nerve toxic in its office.
</P>
<P>
The UN secretary-general should promptly make thorough
investigation into the case and put forward to the Security
Council suggestions on how to handle it, said Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao here today.
</P>
<P>
"We are highly concerned over coverage of the case, and approve
of a serious investigation into it," said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
"If it is true, it is a serious and extremely vile case
demonstrating that UNSCOM Executive Chairman Richard Butler holds
in contempt of the authority of the Security Council, which is
absolutely unbearable," added Zhu.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that those in charge of the UNSCOM have hidden such a
serious case for so long despite early awareness of it, can only
arouse strong suspicion about their motives," added Zhu.

<HEADLINE> Euro Drops to New Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOGNE, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The euro plummeted to a new low as
the European Union summit opened here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It dropped to 1.0303 U.S. dollars early Thursday in the Tokyo
foreign exchange market despite the remarks by European Central
Bank Governor Wim Duisenberg Wednesday to boost the currency.
</P>
<P>
It was the lowest point for the single currency since it was
first launched in January this year. It has by now lost one tenth
of its original value.
</P>
<P>
The New York exchange market closed around one euro to 1.0345
dollars Wednesday for an earlier record decline.
</P>
<P>
The European leaders are now under added pressure to find ways
to bolster the European Union's faltering single currency which is
in use now in 11 of the 15 EU states.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange traders in Tokyo said that they had been
unimpressed by the remarks of the European central banker, which
pushed the fledgling currency further down.
</P>
<P>
The European leaders are expected to discuss, during their two-
day meeting, issues of Kosovo, common employment policy and common
defense policy.
</P>
<P>
They are scheduled to name a unionwide foreign and security
coordinator. NATO Secretary General Javier Solana is the most
likely candidate for the post.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Manufacturers Urged to Improve Product Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA KANGSAR, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian International Trade
and Industry Minister Datuk Seri Rafidah Aziz called on
manufacturers in the country to Improve the quality of their
products so as to make them more competitive in the international
markets.
</P>
<P>
She said this to reporters after attending a four-hour briefing
on the Kuala Kangsar parliamentary development projects at the
District Office here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah said local manufacturers have increased their
production and export capacity since middle of last year,
especially towards the last quarter, which had helped to increase
Malaysia's trade surplus this year.
</P>
<P>
"The local manufacturers are really taking advantage of the
competitive edge Malaysia has now in terms of cheaper ringgit, but
they cannot expect the situation to last forever since other
countries would also be equally competitive when once their
economy turns around," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said the local manufacturers should produce quality
products at a competitive pricing and with aggressive promotion,
market them abroad.
</P>
<P>
"If we have pricing and cost competitiveness, it will be easier
to maintain our trade surplus situation," she added.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's trade surplus in April this year grew by 6.2 billion
ringgit (about 1.63 billion U.S. dollars) compared with 3.4
billion ringgit (0.9 billion dollars) recorded in the same month
last year.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the coming Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
meeting in Auckland, New Zealand on June 29-30, Rafidah said,
apart from the follow-up plans decided at the meeting last year,
she would also brief the APEC members on the current economic
situation in the country,
</P>
<P>
It is important among APEC members that there is a clear
understanding of what is happening with each member, said Rafidah,
who is leading the Malaysian delegation to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Malaysia would also look at the progress of
the individual and collective action plans, and to what extent
they have been implemented by the members, she said.

<HEADLINE> Seoul, Pyongyang to Resume Talks on June 21 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 3 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) have agreed to resume their vice-
ministerial talks in Beijing on June 21, said South Korean
Unification Minister Lim Dong-won Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Lim told a press conference that the agreement was signed by
Kim Bo-hyon, special assistant to South Korean Prime Minister Kim
Jong-pil, and Chon Kum-chol, chief councilor of the DPRK's
Administration Council, Thursday morning in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The June 21 talks will focus on reunion of separated family
members and other mutually-concerned issues.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming talks resulted from the dialogues between the
two sides in Beijing three times from May 12 to June 3 to prepare
for the official restoration of the suspended talks.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Seoul will provide Pyongyang with 200,000
tons of fertilizer in June and July this year, of which 100,000
tons will be supplied before June 20.
</P>
<P>
The unification minister's press conference came one day later
than scheduled.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning, Shin Eon-sang, spokesman of the
unification ministry, said Seoul and Pyongyang would sign an
agreement in China Wednesday morning to resume the suspended vice-
ministerial meetings.
</P>
<P>
"If the pact is concluded as scheduled, Unification Minister
Lim Dong-won will announce the reopening of governmental level
talks Wednesday afternoon," said Shin.
</P>
<P>
The inter-Korean talks were suspended in Beijing in April 1998
when Seoul and Pyongyang failed to reach agreement over
preconditions such as reunion of separated family members and the
amount of fertilizer provision.

<HEADLINE> Barak Asks for Delay on IAF Jet Purchase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister-elect
Ehud Barak has proposed Israeli Air Force (IAF) postpone plans
to purchase a new generation of fighter planes.
</P>
<P>
Barak put forward his proposal after senior defense officials
briefed him on the IAF's purchase plans, Israeli Ha'aretz daily
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted outgoing Defense Minister Moshe Arens as
saying Barak demanded the final decision on the deals be
delayed because he was not sure if the decision to be made
by the defense establishment was correct.
</P>
<P>
IAF has recommended that Arens sign an order to buy 50 F-16
fighter jets from Lockheed-Martin Company for 2.5 billion
U.S. dollars rather than Boeing-made F-15 jets.
</P>
<P>
Arens has not yet voiced his position publicly, but it appears
that talks on buying planes from Boeing or Lockheed-Martin have
been shelved.
</P>
<P>
Defense sources said the decision has to be made in the next
few weeks as any additional delays will result in extra payments
to the American manufacturers and also could deter the delivery of
the chosen planes.
</P>
<P>
Barak won a landslide victory in May 17 elections and he will
have to form a coalition government by July 6.

<HEADLINE> China Establishes Banking Supervision System (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- China has basically established a
banking supervision system in line with Basle Core Principles for
Effective Banking Supervision, according to Chinese and foreign
financial experts and officials.
</P>
<P>
The Basle Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), sponsored by
the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), is an international
institution which focuses on developing banking supervision.
</P>
<P>
Related experts point out that reforms in the financial sector
in China over the past few years have helped create an effective
central bank supervision system which continues to reinforce risk
management in the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
Major reforms in the fields of central bank restructuring,
supervision methods, the commercialization of state-owned banks,
financial risk management, and financial laws and regulations have
largely improved the rationality and effectiveness of banking
supervision.
</P>
<P>
The BCBS introduced 25 core principles for effective banking
supervision in September 1997 as part of an effort to provide
effective measures designed to enable various countries to
reinforce their financial stability.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China (PBOC), China's central bank and a
member of BIS, participated in drafting and revising of related
core principles.

<TEXT>
<P>
PBOC Professor Tang Xu said China has introduced reforms of its
financial sector in accordance with the Basle core principles and
has worked diligently to establish modern banking regulations and
supervision principles.
</P>
<P>
"China has established an effective banking supervision system
in line with Basle core principles," said Xu.
</P>
<P>
A primary requirement of the core principles states that
commercial banks must have a capital adequacy rate of at least
eight percent. The fact that assets of Chinese banks have grown in
tandem with the nation's opening and reform drive over the past 20
years has led to relative decline in their capital adequacy rate.
</P>
<P>
China issued 270 billion yuan in special treasury bonds in 1998
in order to replenish capital of state-owned commercial banks and
raise their capital adequacy rate to the standards required by the
core principles, according to Xu.
</P>
<P>
Kathie Krumm, World Bank lead economist for China, said China
has worked to stem problems to the flow of non-performing loans by
introducing a risk-based loan classification system, consolidating
the central bank's network of branches along regional lines to
enhance supervision and reduce local government interference, and
resolving problems at some small troubled financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
She noted that related measures endorse the core principles and
are effectively addressing the weaknesses of the financial sector.
However, she warned that continued efforts will be a critical
factor in further minimizing financial risks.

Davin Mackenzie, chief China representative for International
Finance Corporation (IFC), said the affirmative results of China's
banking reform are beginning to surface, with state-owned banks
gradually acting as commercial entities.
</P>
<P>
He said the establishment of Cinda Asset Management Corp.,
which will assume non-performing loans held by the China
Construction Bank, represents a giant step forward in the
government's effort to tackle the bad loans of state-owned
commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that the revocation of the credit ceiling on
commercial banks in early 1998 was a significant step toward the
commercialization of banks. The adoption of asset-liability
management represented a fundamental transition from a planned to
a market system and has enabled the central bank to use more
indirect tools to control the financial market.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's financial supervision currently enjoys an
appropriate legal environment, according to Tang. China has
adopted over 200 laws and regulations directly related to
financial supervision since 1995, including central bank,
commercial bank and insurance laws.
</P>
<P>
Experts point out that China's banking reforms have not only
followed the core principles, but have also fully considered the
country's special conditions and are thus crucial for ensuring the
steady and healthy development of the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
However, they point out that challenges surrounding the
effective implementation of reform initiatives require skill and
good judgment on the part of bank officials and regulators. They
also note that extensive training will be required to ensure
further development.

<HEADLINE> Concerted Efforts Called for Better Future for Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- On the occasion of the 200-day
countdown to Macao's return to the motherland, the leaders of
several social organizations in Macao called on local residents to
make concerted efforts to create a promising future for Macao.
</P>
<P>
Ng Si Meng, director of the Macao Association of Neighborhood
Communities, said that the association is holding activities to
enhance the residents' enthusiastic expectations for Macao's
return.
</P>
<P>
"Through these activities, we want them to have a sense of
urgency about the returning process, and arouse their confidence
in the notion of Macao people governing Macao," Ng said.
</P>
<P>
Local people all pin high hopes on the chief executive of the
future Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) and expect that
he will be able to usher Macao into a novel era, Ng Si Meng said.
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime, I wish that the Macao people can take an
active part in the work related to the return and exert joint
efforts to build a beautiful future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pun Hun Veng, director of the Macao Association of Trade Unions,
said that he feels rather excited because Macao is going to be
reunited with the motherland in 200 days.
</P>
<P>
"The date of December 20 indicates the end of foreign rule in
Macao," he noted. "Moreover, it signifies the formal
implementation of the principles of 'one country, two systems,'
'Macao people governing Macao' and a high degree of autonomy in
Macao," Pun said.
</P>
<P>
The period of 200 days toward Macao's return is critical since
it is a period for the chief executive designate to organize the
SAR government and make preparations for the transfer of power,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Pun added that the residents, especially workers in various
social sectors, should take part in Macao's development with an
attitude of being masters of their own affairs.
</P>
<P>
Kun Sai Hoi, director of the Macao Association of Civil
Servants, said that the association will actively advocate the
awareness of historic mission among civil servants, so as to
enable them to contribute to Macao's steady transition and a
smooth transfer of power.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest official report, the localization of
civil servants is not well done. However, most of the localized
civil servants are diligent and devoted to their duty, Kun Sai Hoi
said.
</P>
<P>
"Being a vital force to execute the policies of the government,
civil servants will do their best in the process of organizing the
SAR government," he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government to Boost Vocational Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
allocated 1.07 billion pesos (26.75 million U.S. dollars) this
year to boost development of human resources through formal
technical-vocational education and training.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) said Thursday
that the amount comprised about 50 percent of the 2.1 billion peso
(52.5 million U.S. dollar) budget which the Congress allotted to
DOLE's Technical and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) this
year.
</P>
<P>
Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma said that overall, TESDA's
thrusts and programs are geared at developing the right skills to
maximize gainful employment while helping uplift the country's
poor and disadvantaged communities.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that technical-vocational schools are important
in pushing the emergence of world-class Filipino workers crucial
to the country's economic progress.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the 1.07 billion pesos (26.75 million U.S.
dollars) was intended mainly for the operation of 28 trade and 30
agricultural, agro-industrial, fishery and home industry schools
in various regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
Clifford Paragua, executive director of TESDA's Office of
Formal Technical-Vocational Education and Training said around
9,980 students graduated from these 58 TESDA-supervised schools in
secondary and post-secondary levels in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Paragua said their enrollees are expected to approach 50,000 in
1999.
</P>
<P>
Apart from TESDA-supervised institutions, there were also more
than 1,300 private and 700 public institutions providing
technical-vocational education and training to people in the
country last year.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Israeli Militia Completes Pullout from Jezzine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army
(SLA) early Thursday completed its three-day withdrawal
from Jezzine, a town in south Lebanon it has held for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
Truck convoys were seen streaming out of the beleaguered town,
carrying artillery and mortar guns, equipment, ammunition and
household furniture to the Israeli occupied border zone southeast
of Jezzine.
</P>
<P>
Following the withdrawal widely seen as a prelude to the
Israeli pullout from Lebanon, Lebanese police units crossed into
Jezzine and set up checkpoints at the entrance of the town.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese policemen have been sent to take over the security of
more than 20 villages around the town, which were vacated by the
SLA in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
Although Israeli warplanes provided air cover for the
withdrawal, the retreating SLA still met with Hezbollah
guerrilla's attacks, in which three militiamen were killed and
another one wounded in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
Israeli forces retaliated by staging dozens of air raids on
Hezbollah targets close to the withdrawal route, wounding three
Syrian laborers and a Lebanese woman.
</P>
<P>
The SLA decided to withdraw from Jezzine due to Lebanese
guerrillas' attacks that have killed more than 100 SLA militiamen
and wounded about 400 others around Jezzine in the past 14 years.
</P>
<P>
The 2,500-strong SLA, financed and trained by the Israeli
forces, was established in 1985 with an aim of helping Israel
soldiers patrol the security zone which it set up in south Lebanon
to shield its northern area from Lebanese guerrilla cross-border
attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been
leading a war of attrition trying to oust the Israeli occupation
forces and its proxy SLA out of the country.
</P>
<P>
After the SLA departure, the most pressing issue in Jezzine is
the fate of 203 SLA militiamen who opted to turn themselves over
to the Lebanese authorities.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss has pledged that they will
not be revenged and will be dealt with by the judiciary according
to their various circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Judicial sources said that the defected SLA members will be
tried before court on charges of collaborating with Israel but
all will be provided with extenuating circumstances.

<HEADLINE> China To Carry Out Lightning Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists are to carry out
a series of experiments to artificially induce lightning in a bid
to study its reactions and effects in order to test the capability
of conductors and to try and prevent future disasters and
accidents from lightning strikes.
</P>
<P>
The experiments will be conducted in the vicinity of Guangzhou,
capital of south China's Guangdong Province, where lightning
happens frequently from mid-June to July.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Liangcai, a leading researcher from the Guangdong
Electronic Power Research Institute, explained that small rockets
with long, metal wire tails will be fired into the clouds which
will hopefully create the conditions which encourage lightning.
</P>
<P>
The position and time of the artificially induced lightning can
therefore be predicted, and will thus enable analysis and tests on
the actual mechanism and force of lightning, according to Zhou and
his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
"The small rockets, no larger than winebottles, can travel as
high as 1.23 kilometers into the clouds," said Zhou.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that the experiment is often very difficult
because the rockets sometimes fail to induce lightning. Last year
the institute carried out five successful trial experiments.
</P>
<P>
According to Yao Jianguo, an expert with the Science and
Environmental Protection Department of China State Power
Corporation (CSPC), micro-electronic technology has been developed
rapidly and used widely in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, the threats from lightning strikes to the
electronic power system, communications, aviation and other high-
tech fields are becoming more serious," said Yao.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that economic losses caused by lightning
strikes in China exceeds one billion yuan (about 120 million US
dollars) every year.
</P>
<P>
Yao said that although many lightning conductors have been
developed, they have not been properly tested under real and
natural conditions.
</P>
<P>
In addition, detailed research on lightning is difficult and
complicated to carry out because of its very random nature.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhou Liangcai, many advanced observation and
recording facilities will be used in this latest experiment.

<HEADLINE> China, Ford Develop Luxury Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- A new luxury car for the China
market is being jointly developed by the US Ford Motor Company and
the China First Automobile Group which hopes that the new Red Flag
model will be launched by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Hua Shaozhong, deputy director of the Technical Center of China
First Automobile Group Corporation announced details of the
project at the Auto Parts, Manufacturing and Related Products Show
which is being held here this week.
</P>
<P>
The car will be based on Ford's well known Lincoln model and
will also use some of the technical features of the existing Red
Flag luxury cars manufactured by the Chinese company.
</P>
<P>
Hua explained that the look of the new car will not be exactly
like the Lincoln. And it will be significantly distinct from
conventional Red Flag cars which are modified versions of
Germany's Volkswagen Audi models.
</P>
<P>
The new Red Flag car will be the top grade luxury car made in
China.
</P>
<P>
The First Automobile Group Corporation is the largest
automotive company in China and like the Shanghai Automotive
Industry Corporation (SAIC), China's second largest car
manufacturer, has set up a joint venture with Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
SAIC has already jointly developed a B5 car with Volkswagen for
the China market. The B5 car is a modified version of the Passatt
car that Volkswagen developed in the mid 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The decision by the First Automobile Group Corp. to jointly
develop new cars is because it feels its current range based on
the Volkswagen is relatively outdated; hence its decision to
choose Ford and the Lincoln. The company is also looking for
further opportunities to jointly develop more advanced cars with
foreign auto makers.
</P>
<P>
Ford has also now begun manufacturing Transit vans in China.

<HEADLINE> Successful Cloud Seeding Ensures HK's Water Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Successful cloud seeding above
Shenzhen City of south China's Guangdong Province in the past
month has alleviated city's eight month long water shortages and
has ensured water supplies to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen has been hit by a severe drought since last September.
In the first four months of the year, the volume of rainfall was
just 75 mm, a quarter of the previous level for the same period.
</P>
<P>
The water, stored in different reservoirs in Shenzhen, dropped
to its lowest level ever, causing water shortages throughout the
city and affecting people's daily life. The water crisis in
Shenzhen, a major fresh-water base, also affected its water supply
to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
From April 24, six experts from the Cloud Seeding and Hail
Prevention Office of Jilin Province were called in and carried out
16 successful cloud seeding operations in the skies above
Shenzhen's reservoirs, producing an average of 124 mm of rainfall
and enormously alleviating the drought in this special economic
zone.
</P>
<P>
The Jilin Cloud Seeding Office is the oldest in China and also
boasts the only open laboratory in China which can influence the
weather.

Spokeswoman of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry Phan Thuy Thanh
announced at a press conference here Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Phieu's visit to Cambodia is at the invitation of King of
Cambodia Norodom Sihanouk and other Cambodian leaders.

Thanh said that Phieu's visit of Cambodia is aiming at further
promoting the good neighborly friendship of the two peoples and
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Thanh did not reveal the date of Phieu's visit to Cambodia.
But, she emphasized that Phieu will begin his official friendship
visit to Cambodia in the very near coming day.
</P>
<P>
On the relations between Vietnam and Cambodia, Thanh said that
it is a relationship of unity, friendship and comprehensiveness.
</P>
<P>
Along with this spirit, Thanh added, the leaders of Vietnam and
Cambodia have the policy to build the Vietnam-Cambodia Boundary
line into a border of peace, friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
That will contribute to the promotion of the relations of the
two countries on the basis of the treaties and agreements on land
border as well as at sea border which have been reached in the
years of 1982, 1983, 1985 respectively as well as in the
principles of the international law, she said.

<HEADLINE> China Seeks More Overseas Funds to Develop Offshore Oil and Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- China's offshore oil industry
policy makers are exploring new ways and channels to expand Sino-
foreign cooperation in tapping the country's vast offshore oil and
gas resources.
</P>
<P>
According to Wei Liucheng, president of the China National
Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC), China has huge offshore oil and gas
resources, which is estimated at 25 billion tons and 14 trillion
cu m, respectively.
</P>
<P>
"However, the proven offshore oil and gas reserves in China
account for only five percent of the country's total estimated
resources," said the official.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that only by dramatically increasing Sino-foreign
cooperation in the sector, can China speed up its offshore oil and
gas development.
</P>
<P>
Wei said that the foreign oil giants have shown intense
interest in investing in China's offshore oil and gas exploration.
</P>
<P>
To date, China has already had over 130 contracts with 18
countries and regions in jointly developing the country's offshore
oil and gas resources, utilizing in total nearly 7 billion US
dollars in foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Through Sino-foreign joint effort, China has sunk more than 400
exploratory wells and verified more than 100 oil and gas-bearing
structures.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that China is planning to develop more oil
and gas blocks in the South China Sea, East China Sea and Yellow
Sea through Sino-foreign cooperation.
</P>
<P>
CNOOC has to date developed annual crude oil and gas production
capacities of 16.31 million tons and 3.8 billion cu m,
respectively.

NICOSIA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus is believed to be in talks
with Ukraine to buy up to 40 T-84 MBT tanks, the Cyprus Mail
newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the Cypriot government is holding
talks with the Ukrainian Kharkov Morozov Design Bureau and its
associated production company, the Malyshev plant, for the
acquisition of the battle tanks.
</P>
<P>
These tanks would complement 45 Russian T-80 tanks bought by
Cyprus in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Each T-84 is priced at 2.2 million U.S. dollars. The Ukranians
can promise the delivery of 10 to 12 tanks within four to six
months.
</P>
<P>
The T-84 tank is based on the T-80 UD design but has a
different turret.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus currently has 27 T-80Us and 14 T-80UDs.

<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese-manufactured commodities
currently account for 15 percent of the total sale volume for
China's duty-free stores, according to Gai Zhixin, president of
the China National Duty-Free Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has granted approval for duty-free stores to
sell six categories of Chinese products, including tobacco, wine,
handicrafts, silk and garments.
</P>
<P>
Sales of Chinese manufactured products in duty-free stores not
only promotes related items, but also places constraints on the
ability of some foreign suppliers to demand irrational prices.
</P>
<P>
China had 140 duty-free outlets by the end of May this year,
with stores in operation prior to 1997 limited to sales of foreign
products.
</P>
<P>
The duty-free sector has generated foreign exchange of over 1.7
billion US dollars over the past 20 years, according to Gai.

<HEADLINE> Results of S. African Election to Be Out Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At some stations balloting extended into late night, several
hours later than the 9:00 p.m. regulation time because of long
queues.
</P>
<P>
Political parties were almost unanimous in agreement, saying
their agents at voting stations had reported very high turn-outs
and enthusiastic voters.
</P>
<P>
Early Thursday morning, the fortunes of the political parties
changed second by second as the first results of the election
started flashing on the giant electronic screen at the Independent
Electoral Commission (IEC) center in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
As expected, the African National Congress (ANC) took the
lead, followed by the New National Party (NNP) and Democratic
Party (DP). But analysts warned it was far too early to predict
the outcome.
</P>
<P>
The IEC had decided not to delay the counting process, even in
areas where the polls closed long after the regulation time to
prevent a recurrence of incidents in 1994 when ballot boxes, left
at voting stations overnight, were tampered with, election
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The officials said verified result will be announced at the
earliest at 9 p.m. Thursday. This gives political parties enough
time to object to aspects of the electoral process.
</P>
<P>
The IEC, however, may delay the announcement of the result for
seven days to deal with possible objections. The IEC expected the
bulk of the counting to be completed by Thursday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's ANC Leads in Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 3 (Xinhua) -- As expected, South Africa's
African National Congress (ANC) is leading in the second
democratic general election, but a two-thirds majority seems out
of reach, initial results show.
</P>
<P>
With 54 percent of the country's voting districts declared
Thursday morning, the ANC won 62 percent of the eight million
votes counted so far.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party (DP) came in as the second, with 12
percent. This may well indicate that the DP is going to replace
the New National Party (NNP) as the new official opposition. The
NNP got nine percent of the eight million votes, followed by the
Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) with eight percent.
</P>
<P>
Although more than 18.1 million people had registered to vote,
it was not clear what the voter turn-out was by Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
In the provincial elections, the ANC has secured seven of the
country's nine provinces, according to projections by the South
African Broadcasting Corporation television.
</P>
<P>
The seven provinces are Northern Province, North-West,
Mpumalanga, Free State, Northern Cape, Gauteng and Eastern Cape.
</P>
<P>
The other two provinces, the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal,
are still hotly contested between the ANC and the NNP, and the ANC
and the IFP respectively.

<HEADLINE> Dubai Bans Entry of Poultry Products From Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DAHBI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Municipality of Dubai, the second
largest emirate of the United Arab Emirate (UAE), has instructed
all its ports to ban the entry of poultry products from Belgium
following the dioxin-contaminated chicken scandal.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as the municipality learned of the possibility of
contamination in chicken products from Belgium, it stopped the
entry of these products into Dubai," said Rashid Ahmad bin Fahad,
head of the Food and Environment Lab at the Dubai Central
Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
Fahad said a meeting will be held at the General Secretariat of
UAE Municipalities next week to discuss the issue, the Khaleej
Times daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He assured consumers that no contaminated products will be sold
in the market of Dubai, which is also an important commercial and
trade center in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the European Union has decided to trace and
destroy all eggs and chicken-based foodstuffs which could be
contaminated with the cancer-causing chemical dioxin.
</P>
<P>
The chicken crisis was caused by a Belgian company, which has
been providing contaminated fat to European feed manufacturers
since January. Many farms in Belgium and other European countries
have been affected.

<HEADLINE> COMESA to Monitor Money Laundering: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) has said the issue
of money laundering is challenging the regional grouping which
intends to establish a free trade area in October next year.
</P>
<P>
However, said Sindiso Ngwenya, deputy secretary-general of
COMESA, the problem of money laundering in COMESA member states
will not disrupt the achieving of a free trade area, Thursday's
Zambia Daily Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
Making the assurance here Wednesday, the deputy
secretary-general said working committees which comprise bank
governors of member states were working round the clock to check
the illegal operations.
</P>
<P>
The committee of bank governors always exchanges information
from their various countries on financial problems like money
laundering, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Member countries are already monitoring the issue of money
laundering in their respective countries and the information is
usually exchanged with their fellow partners during regular
meeting," Ngwenya said.
</P>
<P>
International Criminal Police Organization also helps in
tracking down dealers in the illegal trade, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ngwenya observed that with the cooperation of law enforcement
agencies within member states, the region has been able to put in
check the levels of money laundering.
</P>
<P>
"It is a collective effort which needs collaboration with all
stake- holders in the region because the people laundering money
are always ahead which makes it difficult if information is not
shared among member states," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ngwenya said the malpractice should be dealt with viciously in
the various member states because it is a danger to their
economies which in turn will affect their partnership within
COMESA since their economies will be distorted.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Sets Economic Growth Target for 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has set an
economic growth target of 2.3 percent for 1999, Vice-President
George Saitoti said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This is a radical departure from the under two percent that was
 predicted by a top official from the Central Bank of Kenya just
two weeks ago, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The official had based his evaluation on the performance of the
economy for the past five months of 1999, during which economic
growth had stagnated in the lower 1.7 percent range.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 economic survey report released by Saitoti Wednesday
said that last year the economy grew by 1.8 percent against an
economic survey projection of three percent.
</P>
<P>
According to this year's survey report, the 2.3 percent rate is
pegged on hopes that the country will receive adequate and
reliable rains, tight monetary policies will be followed and
donors will renew disbursement of aid to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti said the factors which resulted in a decline in the
economic growth were mainly the continued unreliable
infrastructure, depressed investment, declining tourism
activities, a slump in manufacturing production, high interest
rates, rising costs of farm inputs and a fall in world prices of
coffee and horticulture.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Nairobi bomb blast and increased insecurity
generally also combined to stem the flow of tourists to the
country.
</P>
<P>
However, the vice-president expressed his optimism that with
the expected major reforms in the government finances aimed at
reducing the public domestic debt and budget deficit, and the
improvement of the revenue collection system, the country's
economic performance would be enhanced.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts have said the country needs to attain an annual
growth rate of six to eight percent to realize the proposed
newly-industrialized
nation status by 2020.

<HEADLINE> Kaunda not allowed to Stand for Zambian Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Former Zambian President Kenneth
Kaunda will not be allowed to stand for presidency in the
elections in 2001 because of his stateless status, a senior
government minister has said.
</P>
<P>
Minister Without Portfolio Michael Sata said Wednesday in
Ndola, northern Zambia, that Kaunda is aware of his predicament
and the best way for him is to regularize his nationality because
he is neither Zambian nor Malawian.
</P>
<P>
Sata, who is national secretary of the country's ruling party,
said, "if he wants to stand in 2001, let him regularize his
nationality first because he knows the requirements of our
constitution."
</P>
<P>
Kaunda's United National Independence Party (UNIP) insists it
will field Kaunda in the elections.
</P>
<P>
UNIP information secretary Bwendo Mulengela said here Wednesday
that Kaunda has indicated that he would like to retire from
politics after spearheading the comeback of his party to
government.
</P>
<P>
In March this year Kaunda, who had been ruling the country
since its independence in 1964 until 1991, when he was defeated by
current President Frederick Chiluba, was declared stateless by
the Ndola High Court.
</P>
<P>
The judgement means Kaunda, who was born of Malawian parents,
is neither a Zambian nor a Malawian.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda was barred from running for the presidency in the
elections held in 1996, when a constitutional amendment was
adopted under which foreign nationals and those with foreign
parentage are prohibited from contesting the position.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda has vowed to contest the post in the next elections in
2001.

<P>
BAGHDAD, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz has described the U.S.-led NATO aggression on Yugoslavia as a
terroristic act and an attempt to eliminate any independent
tendency in the world.
</P>
<P>
In a televised interview aired on Wednesday evening, Aziz said
the U.S.-NATO aggression on an independent state does not bear
any legitimacy, adding each independent state has become
threatened in a deal or another by the American arrogance.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said Europe's involvement in the aggression on Yugoslavia
has led to the refugees crisis.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed that so many European states would sustain
problems due to the U.S.-NATO aggression on Yugoslavia, pointing
out that Romania is now suffering from suffocating economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister stressed that Iraq will remain
steadfast and it will never be scared by America.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 3 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling African
National Congress (ANC) might well be able to win a two-thirds
majority in Wednesday' s general election, South Africa's national
television projected Thursday.
</P>
<P>
With counting results continuing to pour in at the results
center in Pretoria, the South African Broadcasting Corporation
(SABC) television announced its projection that the party is to
achieve its goal of a two- thirds majority, which will enable it
to change the constitution.
</P>
<P>
However, the ANC has repeatedly denied that it would change the
 constitution.
</P>
<P>
With 58 percent of the country's votes counted Thursday
morning, the ANC has won 63 percent of the vote. Since the
support for the ANC is expected to be strong in the rest of the
districts, a two-thirds majority is likely, the SABC predicted.

AMMAN, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
returned home Thursday morning after his week-long visits to
Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt and France over bilateral relations and
regional issues.
</P>
<P>
The four-nation tour was part of Abdullah's extensive
diplomatic efforts to rally financial support for his debt-ridden
kingdom and to revitalize the deadlocked Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the Jordanian monarch had visited Britain, Germany,
Canada, the United States, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Libya and a
number of other Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
He called on the U.S. and other creditor countries to forgive
or reschedule the payment of half of Jordan's debts of some 6.8
billion U.S. dollars, and appealed the Arab countries to open
their market to Jordanian labor and agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah also used his foreign tours to emphasize the need for
a just, durable and comprehensive peace in the Middle East,
particularly the need to revitalize the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process which remains virtually deadlocked since 1996.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to meet Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn
Abdul-Aziz who arrives in Amman Thursday for a two-day visit.

<HEADLINE> No Change To Overseas Investment Policy: Minister (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- China's policy on overseas
investment will remain unchanged whatever the circumstances, the
Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Shi Guangsheng
stressed while visiting two joint ventures here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"China will remain firm on the policy of reform and opening up
and its policy of absorbing overseas investment in an active and
effective manner will remain unchanged," he said while inspecting
the production lines of the Beijing Ericsson Mobile Communications
Co. Ltd. "The only changes, should they occur, will be policy
improvements."
</P>
<P>
The minister and Beijing Deputy Mayor Zhang Mao also inspected
the Beijing Nokia Mobile Telecommunications Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Antti Ware, general manager of Beijing Nokia Mobile
Telecommunications LTD., told Shi that since production began in
1996, Beijing Nokia achieved one billion yuan (about 120.48
million US dollars) sales volume in its first year. The sales
volume reached 6.2 billion yuan (about 746.99 million US dollars)
last year.
</P>
<P>
The company's exports hit 80 million US dollars in 1997 and 170
million US dollars in 1998. Exports between January and April this
year were also "quite good."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Robert J. Parris, managing director of the Beijing
Ericsson Mobile Telecommunications Co. Ltd., said that Ericsson's
sales income hit 3.4 billion yuan (about 410 million US dollars)
in China in 1998, which made China Ericsson's biggest market
worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Manila Declares PAL Pilots' Strike Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Government declared
Thursday the 22-day strike by the Airline Pilots Association of
the Philippines (ALPAP) last year as "illegal" and affirmed that
the strikers had lost their employment status with Philippine
Airlines (PAL).
</P>
<P>
The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) said in a
seven-page decision that the strike was "procedurally infirm" and
in "open defiance" of DOLE's return-to-work order.
</P>
<P>
The decision also dismissed ALPAP's complaint that PAL
management had illegally locked them out.
</P>
<P>
"This Office hereby declares the loss of employment status of
all officers and members who participated in the strike in
defiance of the return-to-work order of June 7, 1998.
Concomitantly, PAL cannot be deemed to have illegally locked out
the striking pilots as it was their collective will to defy the
said Order," the DOLE ruled.
</P>
<P>
ALPAP staged the strike on June 5, 1998 despite two previous
orders from the DOLE strictly prohibiting such action while it
assumed jurisdiction over the dispute.
</P>
<P>
On June 7, 1998, the DOLE issued a return-to-work order,
expiring 24 hours later, but the department was unable to serve
this on ALPAP because the latter's counsel repeatedly snubbed it.
</P>
<P>
ALPAP finally consented to receive the DOLE's return-to-work
order on June 26, 1998, when it unilaterally declared an end to
the strike.
</P>
<P>
The strike stemmed from a dispute on the retirement of an ALPAP
member, Capt. Albino Collantes, whom PAL management retired based
on a provision of the PAL-ALPAP Retirement Plan, which is part of
the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the two parties.

<HEADLINE> No Change To Overseas Investment Policy: Minister (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The MOFTEC minister said that the success of the two companies
shows that while overseas invested companies have gained profits
in China, they have also helped the country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"China will continue to improve its investment environment,
both soft and hard," he pledged. "We will also make the investment
policy stable and continue to refine the policy."
</P>
<P>
Overseas investments in China declined both in contractual and
materialized volume in the first four months of the year. By the
end of April, there were nearly 330,000 overseas-funded firms in
China, involving a total contractual investment volume of 580
billion US dollars, and arrived investment of 270 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that China regards foreign-invested companies
as its own as they were registered in China. "We will try our best
to serve them and protect their legitimate interests and rights,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the minister urged overseas-invested ventures to
explore markets not only within China, but also in Asia and the
entire world. He also urged them to pay attention to technology
upgrading and China's industrial restructuring so as to have a
better development.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he hoped that joint ventures like Nokia and
Ericsson can use more locally-made instruments and parts.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Violates Cease-fire In Congo (K): Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has accused Rwanda of
violating its unilateral cease-fire declaration in Congo (K) by
attacking Southern African Development Community allied forces
positions in Kalanga, Manono and Lusambo.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe Defense Forces spokesman Colonel Chancellor Diye said
Wednesday a Rwandan brigade had attacked the allied forces'
position near Lake Tanganyika over the weekend, resulting in a
four-day battle.
</P>
<P>
Up to 86 Rwandans were killed in the battle and an assortment
of military hardware, including picks and shovels the enemy used
to dig trenches, were recovered, the daily Herald reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the rebels have been trying to capture the
diamond- rich town of Mbuji-Mayi and Manono, the birthplace of
Congolese President Laurent Kabila, to use as bargaining chips
during talks scheduled for Lusaka, Zambia, on June 26.
</P>
<P>
"The Rwandans are breaching their own cease-fire declaration.
They have made several attempts to take control of Manono, but
they have been denied on several occasions," said Diye.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Rwanda proclaimed a unilateral cease-fire in Congo
(K), where it has deployed thousands of troops in support of
rebels fighting to oust President Kabila, said the report.
</P>
<P>
However, Congolese Deputy Minister of Defense Dieudonne Kayembe
told a press briefing in Kinshasa Tuesday that Rwandan troops
launched "offensive actions" in central Kasai and south-eastern
Katanga provinces following heavy losses they suffered last month.
</P>
<P>
He accused Rwanda of seeking to use last Friday's announcement
of a unilateral cessation of hostilities to buy "time to breathe"
following military setbacks in the fighting.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Rebels Removes Roadblock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean rebels have removed a
roadblock on a highway serving as the supply line for the west
African peace keeping force ECOMOG, local radio reported.
</P>
<P>
But travellers in this west African country said tension
remained high in other parts of the country, and the two sides
has been accusing each other of truce violations.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the ECOMOG force confirmed the removal of the
block the rebels erected Tuesday at Okra Hill, about 60 kms from
capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The highway which was blocked is used by the Nigeria-led ECOMOG
force backing the Sierra Leonean government to provide supplies
for its troops in the country's interior areas.
</P>
<P>
The rebels had once guarded their blocks with heavy machine
guns, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG force had complained to the U.N. Observer Mission in
Sierra Leone and warned that the ECOMOG may strike in the next
few days if the United Nations failed in mediation.
</P>
<P>
The rebels followed the U.N.'s suggestions and removed the
blocks thus saving the fragile cease fire.
</P>
<P>
The cease fire taking effect on May 24 in a bid to nurture
atmosphere for peace talks held in Togo has been largely
respected, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The talks, jointly brokered by the Economic Community of West
Africa States (ECOWAS) and United Nations have made some progress
though the thorny dispute on a transitional government remains.
</P>
<P>
The rebels suggest that they must share power with President
Tejan Kabbah in a transitional government until a new election is
held, while Kabbah insists that the rebels must transform
themselves into a political party and compete in the general
election.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Prices Go Up In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Petrol price in Zimbabwe rose by 27
percent from 9.67 Zimbabwean dollars (25 U.S. cents) to 12.25
Zimbabwean dollars (32 U.S. cents) a litre Thursday to cope with
the devaluation of the Zimbabwean dollar and the cost of fuel at
its source.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, diesel price was up by 32 percent from 8.1 Zimbabwean
dollars (21 U.S. cents) to 10.68 Zimbabwean dollars (28 U.S.
cents) a litre.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Transport and Energy Enos Chikowore said in a
statement Wednesday night that two critical factors have
necessitated the present adjustment of fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
They are the depreciation of the Zimbabwean dollar by 107
percent since July 1998 to the current rate of some 38.7
Zimbabwean dollars to the U.S. dollar; and the marked increased
cost of fuel product at source, which left the National Oil
Company of Zimbabwe (NOCZIM) selling fuel at 30 to 40 percent
below cost.
</P>
<P>
Despite the increase, he said, the price of local fuel was
still far below prices in other countries in the region.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Inflation Up in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's average month on month
inflation in May rose to 4.5 percent, up from 2.5 percent in
April, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) has said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said Wednesday that the underlying average
annual inflation fell to 6. 7 percent in May from 7.3 percent in
April and the overall average inflation fell to 3.3 percent from
3.5 percent, the East African Standard reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The bank's chief economist Maurice Kanga said liquidity on the
domestic market tightened in the week to May 28 and the interbank
interest rate increased from 5.59 percent at the beginning of the
week to 7.09 percent at the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
Economists here said the inflationary rate was pushed up
largely by the high cost of foodstuffs due to the prevailing dry
conditions and the weakening shilling which was also pushing
inflation up since imports are more expensive compared to a month
or two ago.
</P>
<P>
The week saw the base lending rate in commercial banks declined
from 19. 15 percent to 19.07 percent, with the lowest at 15
percent and the highest standing at 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
On exchange rates, the shilling continued receiving a battering
from the main hard currencies.
</P>
<P>
The average exchange rates in the week were 70.46 shillings to
the U. S. dollar, 112.87 shillings to the pound and 73.48
shillings to the euro compared to 69.57 shillings, 111.91
shillings and 73.91 shillings to the dollar, the pound and the
euro respectively in the previous week, said the bank.

<P>
The Beijing-based Guangming Daily quoted a surgery team at
Xijing Hospital, in northwest China's Xi'an City, as saying that a
150 centimeter long small intestine, provided by the recipient's
father, has survived in his body, which enables him to now take
food and to walk.
</P>
<P>
"However, he will have to endure a process of rejection
reaction, which is expected to be very strong due to abundant
lymphocyte contained in the small intestine, thus making the
recovery fairly difficult," said Wang Weizhong, who led the 60-
person team.
</P>
<P>
The surgery on May 20 was unusual for the transplanted small
intestine was taken from a living person. "Only five similar
transplants have taken place: in the United States, Britain and
Japan, and this one marks a prominent breakthrough in human organ
transplants in China," the newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
The recipient, Yang Feng, a farmer of Lushi County of Henan
Province, had most of his small intestine removed last September
as a result of obstruction. He suffered from serious diarrhea and
weight loss, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Peace Talks Continue in Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The talks between Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and the Balkans envoys from Russia and the
European Union (EU) entered the second day, in which the peace
plan agreed by the West and Russia was discussed, said reports
reaching here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The plan, the exact details of which remained unclear, had been
delivered by Russia's Balkans envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin and
Finnish President Martti Ahtisaar, who represents the EU, to
Milosevic when they arrived in Belgrade on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The NATO-Russia agreement on the plan was reached during the
talks near Bonn among Chernomyrdin, Ahtisaar and U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott. ITAR-Tass quoted Chernomyrdin
as saying that the agreement calls on Yugoslavia and NATO to work
out a formula for the withdrawal of Serbian troops from Kosovo and
deployment of "an international presence," which will be followed
by a "bombing pause."
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said NATO and Russia would send troops to Kosovo
as part of a peacekeeping presence with the United Nations'
approval and support. However, he ruled out the West option of
putting the Russian peacekeepers under the NATO command.
</P>
<P>
Until now, Yugoslavia rejects any foreign military presence on
its soil with NATO at the core and calls on NATO to stop bombing
before any peace deal is clinched.
</P>
<P>
In Belgrade, an official accompanying Ahtisaar was quoted as
saying that the Yugoslav leadership raised some questions during
Wednesday's talks. But he declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin was quoted as saying after the talks that "It's
hard to talk about chances, but there is hope."
</P>
<P>
Another report said that the Serbian parliament would discuss
the plan on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, NATO did not stop its fierce bombardment amid the
ongoing peace efforts. NATO jets had raided Serb forces in Kosovo
on Tuesday and Wednesday and U.S. President Bill Clinton had
ordered to dispatch 7,000 more troops to the Balkans.

<HEADLINE> NZ State-Owned Coal Company to Cut Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Solid Energy, a state-owned coal
company in New Zealand, is laying off 120 of its 536 staff across
the country.
</P>
<P>
The company has been hit by a big slump in world coal prices
and a depressed steel industry, one of its main customers. It lost
34 million NZ dollars (18.5 million U.S. dollars) in the second
half of last year.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand government tried to sell Solid Energy last
year, but failed to get the price it wanted. The company had a
book value of 120 million NZ dollars (66 million U.S. dollars),
but bids fell well below 100 million NZ dollars (55 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
"Without restructuring, the company would not be able to
exist," Chairman Tim Saunders of the company was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion, a Wellington-based newspaper, reported Thursday
that the company has announced it would lay off 120 staff
including 68 miners by the end of the year. It would also shut
down offices in Wellington, Auckland and Huntly.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Expects Increase in Wine Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand expects to double
its
wine exports to 33.7 million liters worth 275 million NZ dollars
(151
million U.S. dollars) by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
The projections are based on the present 10 tons a hectare
average grape yield, according to a survey by the Wine Institute
of
New Zealand of owners of the country's 14 largest vineyards,
representing 88 percent of New Zealand wine production.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which was made public Thursday, said the value is a

giant leap from 1990 when 4 million liters of wine worth 18.4
million
NZ dollars (10 million U.S. dollars) were exported. Last year, New

Zealand exported about 16 million liters of wine worth more than
100
million NZ dollars (55 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Philip Gregan of the Wine Institute said export

wine is rapidly becoming the dominant part of production in New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the total New Zealand sales would be in
export
wine by 2003, compared with 30 percent this year and only 20
percent
in 1995, he said.
</P>
<P>
The main markets -- Britain, Australia and the United States --

are expected to continue to dominate the export trade, according
to
Gregan.

WELLINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's many small and
medium-sized businesses with computer equipment have not yet
started
assessing the risk of being affected by the millennium bug.
</P>

In its surveys, New Zealand Y2K Readiness Commission said

the
complexity of the problem.
</P>
<P>
However, Logan said he is pleased that local authorities can
express "a high level of confidence in their ability to provide
water and waste water services."

"They are also expressing confidence in the providers of other
essential services such as power and telecommunication companies,"

This is the latest of several filed lawsuits against Rodman in
Las Vegas. Rebecca Mardis of Kentucky, filed the suit Tuesday in

<HEADLINE> Work-for-Food Program Yields Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- China's "Work-for-Food Program", an
innovative poverty relief program designed to assist backward
inland areas, has proved highly successful, according to the State
Development Planning Commission (SDPC).
</P>
<P>
Recent SDPC statistics show that some 80 billion yuan (9.7
billion US dollars) flowed into the program between 1984 to 1998,
with some 50 percent of the funding coming from the central
government.
</P>
<P>
The Work-for-Food Program contrasts sharply to the former
method of simply distributing relief funds to poverty-stricken
areas. Instead, the program provides employment and wages for
people living in related areas.
</P>
<P>
Analysts note that the program has played a pivotal role in
improving the infrastructure in China's poverty-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Roads stretching 300,000 km. have been built or renovated, and
irrigation facilities serving over five million ha have been
either been constructed or upgraded over the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The program has been a major factor in helping to control
erosion in areas covering 42,000 sq.km. and in providing potable
water to over 63 million people.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government previously provided subsidies in the
form of various goods to poverty-stricken areas. Since 1996,
however, the Work-for-Food Program has transformed in-kind good
into wages. Last year alone the government issued one billion yuan
in treasury bonds to support poverty relief efforts in related
areas.

<HEADLINE> Holyfield-Lewis Rematch in Jeopardy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The title rematch between
Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis was in jeopardy despite
promoter Don King's announcement last week that the fight would be
held in November at a Las Vegas casino.
</P>
<P>
"There's no deal," HBO vice president Lou DiBella said. "There
are some problematic issues that need to be worked out. We're
hopeful we can work them out, but they haven't been resolved yet."
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Lewis and his promoter sent a letter to Park
Place Entertainment on Wednesday telling the casino operator to
stop giving the public "a false impression that the fight is made,
which is consistent with the current state of facts."
</P>
<P>
Lewis and Holyfield have both agreed to $15 million paydays for
the proposed November fight and Park Place has signed a deal with
Kings to hold it at one of its Las Vegas casinos, but so far, no
contracts for the fight have actually been signed.
</P>
<P>
"Evander wants this fight to happen very badly and so, we think,
does Lennox," said Holyfield's attorney Jim Thomas.
</P>
<P>
The main issue to be resolved is HBO's insistence that Kings
step aside as the fight promoter if he were to be indicted on
charges stemming from a number of ongoing investigations into
boxing, sources close to the negotiations, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said King has refused such a clause in the contract.
</P>
<P>
"We've settled basically on the money," said Lewis attorney
Milton Chwasky. "There's only one hindrance to this. It's Don's
thing with HBO."

<HEADLINE> Foreman Wants to Fight Tyson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- George Foreman, a 50-year-old
former heavyweight champion, hopes to fight against Mike Tyson in
a bout that would pay Tyson $25 million and Foreman $20 million.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Showtime network, which shows Tyson's fights,
said they were interested and Tyson adviser Shelly Finkel did not
discount the possibility of a matchup between the two former
champions.
</P>
<P>
Foreman adviser Ron Weathers and light heavyweight champion Roy
Jones Jr. were trying to put together a deal for Foreman and Tyson
to meet in December in a pay-per-view spectacle.
</P>
<P>
"It's a good story more than reality right now," Finkel said. "
I've told them to have Foreman call me personally so we would know
if he really wants to fight. So far he hasn't."
</P>
<P>
Tyson, released last month from a Maryland jail, has been
running and doing conditioning exercises since then while Finkel
and others try to arrange a deal for his first return fight.
</P>
<P>
His first fight would most likely be in September on Showtime
against the likes of Denmark's Brian Nielsen or Germany's Axel
Schulz.
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, Tyson would fight again in December, and his
opponent could possibly be Foreman.
</P>
<P>
"From both of their standpoints, where else would they get this
kind of money," said Fred Levin, who is Jone's lawyer and would co-
promote the bout.
</P>
<P>
"Mike has got problems now and it would be George's swan song.
People wouldn't but Larry Holmes and George Foreman, but they will
buy Mike Tyson and George Foreman."
</P>
<P>
Foreman would be 51 at the time of the fight, which would
fulfill a goal he had when he came out of retirement 13 years ago
to fight Tyson.
</P>
<P>
"It's always been his one goal in life to fight Mike Tyson,
Weathers said. "It would be a great show with two guys who are
huge punchers. Mike Tyson didn't want this fight for a long time,
but I'm told he does now."

612,000 cu.m. of natural gas at a wildcat well in Tianjin's Dagang
Oil Field.
</P>
<P>
The production verified expert predictions that the oil-bearing
strata contains abundant reserves and portended bright prospects
for the future of the Dagang Oil Field.
</P>
<P>
The wildcaters discovered the oil-bearing strata earlier this
year near Qianmiqiao while drilling another well nearby.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that total gas and oil reserves in the oil
bearing strata will equal as much as 130 million tons of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
The Dagang Oil Field covers 18,000 sq.km. on the west coast of
Bohai Bay some 50 km from Tianjin. Dagang is the most important
energy base for the major port city in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
A total of 800 million tons of oil reserves and 35 billion cu.m.
of gas reserves have been verified since 1964.
</P>
<P>
The field has estimated total oil and gas reserves of well over
350 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Politicians Play Game With Cricketers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- While ordinary Bangladeshis are
singing the same tune celebrating the country's cricket team's
victories at the World Cup Cricket in England, politicians here
have refused to share a common platform to greet the national
cricket "heroes."
</P>
<P>
The government has planned a public reception for the
cricketers at the National Parade Square at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar on
Friday at 10:00 a.m. while the main opposition - the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP has decided to greet them at Zia
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The BNP also plans to arrange a public reception for the team
when they will return after the June 20 World Cup final, party
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The players are coming to Dhaka to attend Friday's reception
and will go back to England next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dhaka Mayor Mohammad Hanif called an all-party meting on
Wednesday evening to discuss the reception preparations, but none
from the major opposition parties, including the BNP, the Jatiya
Party (Ershad) and Jamaat-e-Islami turned up, The Daily Star
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Only representatives of the Jatiya Party faction led by Mizan
Chowdhury and Anwar Hossain Manju, the communication minister, and
other smaller parties came to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The two major parties, the ruling Awami League (AL) and the BNP,
behaved in a similar manner two years ago when Bangladesh won the
International Cricket Committee (ICC) Trophy.
</P>
<P>
The BNP boycotted the civic reception for the ICC Trophy
winners,organized by an AL-led national committee in April 1997,
and organized a separate reception a few days later.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Wednesday drew a similarity
between this year's bumper harvest and the stunning win by the
Bangladeshi team on Monday against Pakistan at the World Cup
Cricket, the BSS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"We did not expect a bumper harvest this year after the
protracted floods of 1998," and "we also did not expect that our
boys would win against Pakistan," she said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh won two matches at the World Cup Cricket, first
against Scotland on May 25 and then against Pakistan on May 31.
</P>
<P>
Cricket is the most popular sport in Bangladesh, and this is
the first time that the Bangladeshi squad has been qualified to
contest with 11 other world-class teams in the Cricket World Cup.

<HEADLINE> Gas Field Discovered at "Fault Block" in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has for the first time
discovered a gas field at a "fault block" in Capna of the
northeastern district of Sylhet, opening a new horizon for its gas
sector, The Financial Express daily newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the past, gas fields had been discovered only in the
"anticline" structure in this gas-rich South Asian country.
</P>
<P>
There are huge "fault blocks" throughout the country, but these
blocks were not considered for the discovery of gas or oil in the
past because earlier test results were not good. The Capna
discovery however has been an eye-opener for both private- and
public-sector gas developers, sources were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Capna gas field, situated between Sylhet and the
Kailashtila gas field, might be one of the largest gas fields in
the country, they said.
</P>
<P>
The Capna discovery might increase the country's gas reserves
to around 80 trillion cubic feet, they added.
</P>
<P>
The current estimate is that the country has a gas reserve of
30 trillion to 40 trillion cubic feet including the 13 trillion
cubic feet already discovered, according to a senior executive of
a multinational oil company.
</P>
<P>
For the expeditious exploration and expansion of gas resources,
the whole country has been divided into 23 blocks, which have been
offered for investment by local and foreign investors. In the
meantime, agreements have been concluded with four foreign
companies for eight blocks, on which work is in full swing.
Besides, negotiations are being conducted for the signing of
contracts for 12 more locks.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Cambodia to Discuss Border Demarcation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Cambodia will meet for
the first time later this month to discuss border demarcation
after recent disputes along the their border, the local television
station TV 9 quoted the Thai Army as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of the joint boundary committee has been set for June
29 and 30 in Bangkok, the army said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported earlier that the Thai Army had sent
reinforcements to the Thai-Cambodian border in the northeastern
province of Buri Ram after the Cambodian government claimed an
undemarcated area there.
</P>
<P>
Cambodian soldiers have alleged that the area, known as
Checkpoint 27, belongs to Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
However, the Thai Army had denied any confrontation or violence
along the border.
</P>
<P>
Before last year's election in Cambodia, areas along the
Thai-Cambodian border had been under the control of the
now-defunct Khmer Rouge guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The formation of a new Cambodian government and the collapse of
the Khmer Rouge guerrilla movement paved the way for the start of
demarcation talks.

<HEADLINE> Tamil Rebels Suspend Boycott in North S. Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The separatist Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka has suspended its call for public
workers in the northern government-controlled Jaffna peninsula to
stop work on two days a week, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to the Additional Government Agent of Jaffna,
the LTTE said the civil disobedience action they had asked
government servants to observe on Tuesdays and Fridays has been
relaxed.
</P>
<P>
The letter which was signed by Thooyavan, the LTTE's political
wing leader for the Jaffna peninsula, said they did not want to
cause inconvenience to the public.
</P>
<P>
However, the letter warned that they were not giving up their
efforts to disrupt the local administration.
</P>
<P>
The two-week boycott led to the closure of all government
offices in Jaffna on Tuesdays and Fridays and a huge backlog of
work.
</P>
<P>
The Tigers, who controlled the Jaffna peninsula for five years
until mid-1996, have been trying to demonstrate their continuing
grip over the population.
</P>
<P>
Jaffna Security Forces Commander Major General Gunawardena on
Wednesday issued a directive to public and private sector
employees in the peninsula to report for duty on all working days.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels, blamed for several political assassinations
in their quest for an independent homeland in Sri Lanka's north
and east since 1983, on Wednesday denied reports that they were
plotting to kill Indian politician Sonia Gandhi.

NEW DELHI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Indian newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Hindustan Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee said Wednesday that
while there would be no let-up in the air strikes in Kargil of
Kashmir, his government could still consider any plea by the
Pakistan-backed infiltrators for a "safe passage" to retreat.
</P>
<P>
The Times of India:
</P>
<P>
-- The talk of "safe passage" for Pakistani intruders seems to
reflect the government's keenness not to escalate the Kargil
face-off into a full-scale war. The different voices from the
government, a senior minister explained, were actually intended to
send different signals to facilitate negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Hindu:
</P>
<P>
-- As long as Pakistan and India continue with their arms race,
escalate insurgency and squabble over unlivable pieces of
territory, they are unlikely to be able to put stable
confidence-building measures in place.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Express:
</P>
<P>
-- India is concluding negotiations to buy varied ordnance from
abroad to replenish ammunition expended over several weeks in the
Kargil conflict for around 2 billion rupees (476 million U.S.
dollars).

YANGON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader Senior-General Than
Shwe Wednesday called for expediting the completion of special
projects being implemented in the country, saying these projects
are basically indispensable for the nation's development.
</P>
<P>
"If these projects can be completed rapidly, they can be
beneficial to the nation quickly," said Than Shwe, chairman of the
Myanmar State Peace and Development Council, at a coordination
meeting of the country's Special Projects Implementation Committee
 (SPIC) here Wednesday, official newspaper The New Light of
Myanmar reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Than Shwe, who is also chairman of the SPIC, stressed the
importance to use funds allocated by the government for the
respective projects without causing losses and wastage and urged
that  priority be given to qualitative improvement.
</P>
<P>
The meeting discussed projects of eight reservoirs being built
in six states and divisions, 17 bridges to be built in other
regions, and diversion weirs to be constructed on the eastern and
western parts of the Bago Yoma mountain range and on the western
bank of the Ayeyawaddy River.
</P>
<P>
A project for establishment of teak plantations was also
discussed.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Myanmar's SPIC approved numerous special projects to
be further carried out in the country in an effort to promote
infrastructure development.
</P>
<P>
Under the impact of the Asian financial crisis, Myanmar has
intensified efforts in the agricultural sector as part of its
economic recovery measures by reclaiming fallow, vacant, virgin
and wet lands and building indispensable dams and reservoirs
while restricting new larger infrastructure projects.

MEXICO CITY, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's international reserves
dropped 70 million U.S. dollars during the week from May 21 to 28,
reducing the total reserves to 30.18 billion dollars, said the
Bank of Mexico on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said the Mexico's net international assets
dropped 87 million dollars in the same period, due to a fall in
the net income of Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) and changes in the
government's outlays.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Mexico attributed the last factor to the lower net
yields from purchases and sales of metals and stocks abroad.
</P>
<P>
The situation was aggravated by the variation of the commercial
banks' deposits in dollars in the Bank of Mexico and the change of
the currency value against the dollar.

the Eastern Conference finals against the Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
"Patrick had a tearing sensation in his left Achilles during
warmups prior to last night's game," Knicks team physician Dr.
Norman Scott said. "Following the game, Patrick showed signs of
swelling in his Achilles that we have not previously seen.
</P>
<P>
"This morning, Patrick underwent an MRI, which showed a partial
tear of his left Achilles tendon. This is not a career-threatening
injury, and we expect Patrick to make a complete recovery."
</P>
<P>
Ewing, 36, has hobbled through most of the lockout-shortened
season due to left Archilles tendinitis. The pain was so severe
before Tuesday's game that Ewing told coach Jeff van Gundy that he
"didn't know what he could give" the team.
</P>
<P>
Ewing ended up playing 25 minutes, finishing with 10 points on
2-of-7 shooting and three rebounds in New York's 88-86 loss at
Indiana. However, with a chance to tie the game in the final
seconds, Ewing missed a 5-meter off a court-length pass from
Charlie Ward.
</P>
<P>
Ewing's disappointment after the missed shot turned into a
bitter pill to swallow this morning after the MRI administered
today revealed the tendon tear. Ewing was devastated by the news.
</P>
<P>
"His reaction was like, 'You're kidding.' He just didn't
believe me," said Dr. Scott. "He was despondent, really depressed.
"
</P>
<P>
Ewing's Achilles will be immobilized in a camwalker for six
weeks before he is re-examined.
</P>
<P>
"It's frustrating to work so hard and to be so close to
something I've dreamed about for so many years," said Ewing. "To
not be able to be on the floor to help my teammates is very
frustrating and disappointing, but if my Achilles ruptures
completely, it would end my career."
</P>
<P>
The Knicks will have to beat the favored Pacers without Ewing,
who has seen his role reduced but nevertheless is a vital piece to
the team's success. His absence leaves defensive-minded and foul-
prone Chris Dudley as New York's starting center for the rest of
the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
Van Gundy, who has coached the Knicks to the conference finals
despite swirling rumors that he will not be retained, was
especially sympathetic to Ewing's plight.
</P>
<P>
"I just felt very bad for him because it seems he's being
cheated out of another opportunity," said Van Gundy. "I'm just
terribly disappointed for him. I know how hard he rehabbed from
his wrist injury from last season and how much he struggled
through this season on his knee. I just hope in his last two years
on a Knicks contract he could be healthy."
</P>
<P>
Last year, Ewing missed the majority of the regular season with
a dislocated wrist. He returned for the last four games of the
conference semifinals against the Pacers. During the regular
season, he missed 12 games due to Achilles tendinitis and averaged
17.3 points and 9.9 rebounds. The scoring average was a career
low and the rebounding average his lowest in 10 years.

<HEADLINE> NBA Playoffs Resume Friday After Two-Day Break </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- After a two-day break, the NBA
playoffs will resume Friday night with the Western Conference
finals.
</P>
<P>
The Portland Trail Blazers will use the time to regroup after
an especially painful 86-85 loss to the San Antonio Spurs in Game
2 of the West finals on Monday. The Trail Blazers did not trail
until Sean Elliott's miraculous 3-pointer with 9.9 seconds left
gave the Spurs the win and a 2-0 lead in the series, which shifts
to Portland for Game 3 on Friday and Game 4 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Indiana Pacers and New York Knicks are tied at one game
apiece in the Eastern Conference finals. The series heads to New
York for Game 3 on Saturday and Game 4 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Knicks will be without ailing superstar center Patrick
Ewing, whose body finally gave in to a series of injuries. Ewing
has a partial tear of his left Archilles tendon and is done for
the season.
</P>
<P>
The Spurs won the first game 80-76, but appeared headed for
defeat in Game 2 until Elliott's miracle shot. The Blazers are
faced with having to beat the Spurs four times in the next five
games, a tall order considering San Antonio had lost four times in
its last 32 games.
</P>
<P>
This is San Antonio's fifth trip to the conference finals but
the first time it has held a 2-0 lead. The Spurs never have been
to the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
The Knicks overcame a 17-point deficit and a hostile crowd
against the Indiana Pacers on Tuesday. But they were still nipped
by the Pacers 86-88. The Knicks had won a franchise-record six
straight playoff games, but without Ewing, they are facing a tough
task to crack the experienced Pacers in the remaining games.

<P>
BUDAPEST, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian Foreign Minister
Martonyi Janos said that Hungary would send engineering and
security troops to the peace-keeping mission if a peace deal could
be reached on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement at a press conference after party leaders
in the parliament ended consultations on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Before this, Hungary expressed it would send no troops to
Kosovo in any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Now that with changes in the situation, it seemed likely the
warring sides could reach a peace deal, and Hungary would like to
discharge its obligation in the process, he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted Hungary would discuss with NATO on the specifics of
the troops, which would have to be approved by two thirds in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the conference, Commander and Chief of General
Staff Vegh Ferenc said that Hungary would send in 120 to 250
security and engineering troops, who would be equipped with
weapons for self defense.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian, Thai Leaders Urge Regulating Hedge Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso and visiting Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai on
Wednesday agreed that the international community must reach
consensus on regulating hedge funds, as their entry and departure
can destabilize the world financial systems.
</P>
<P>
Hedge funds are speculative investments that seek quick gains
in financial markets.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, the two leaders reviewed the impacts of the
two-year-old international financial turmoil on their countries,
both of which bore the brunt of the global financial crunches
originating from Southeast Asia in the second half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Chuan Leekpai said emerging Asian economies and members of the
Southern Common Market (Mercosur) should increase mutual visits,
exchange experience and take joint actions against speculative
attacks on their financial markets.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed the presidency of the World
Trade Organization (WTO), which is sought by, among others, Thai
Commerce Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi, according to a Brazilian
Foreign Ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
But he did not indicate whether Cardoso committed his support
for the Thai candidate.
</P>
<P>
Chuan Leekpai arrived here Sunday for a three-day visit to
Brazil and will continue his week-long Latin American tour to Peru
and Chile.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Slim Hope for Breaking WTO Leadership Deadlock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government Wednesday once
again stressed that its candidate for the top post of the World
Trade Organization (WTO), Commerce Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi,
would not withdraw from the bitter race.
</P>
<P>
A government statement said Thailand still believed Supachai,
who is also one of the deputy prime ministers of the government,
could win the WTO leadership battle against his rival, New
Zealander Mike Moore.
</P>
<P>
It was the second attempt for the Thai government to brush off
rumors that Thailand may have admitted it cannot win the
leadership race after a campaign which has dragged for months and
paralyzed the world trade body.
</P>
<P>
The process of selecting a new director-general for the WTO has
been in a deadlock ever since the world trade body missed its last
deadline when the term of former Director-General Renato Ruggiero
expired on April 30.
</P>
<P>
The latest meeting among representatives of the 134 members in
the WTO headquarters in Geneva did nothing effective to mend the
rift between supporters of Moore and the so-called "Friends of
Supachai."
</P>
<P>
Backers of the two candidates have refused to budge from their
choices and bitter bickering and allegations are close to
derailing other crucial trade agenda issues.
</P>
<P>
Supachai is supported unanimously by Asian countries and is
also backed by Australia, some European Union countries and some
African members while Moore mainly has the backing of the United
States and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
As Supachai had been leading in every poll held before April 30
and Thailand thought he deserved the top post when Ruggiero left.
</P>
<P>
However, opposition from the United States made Supachai's
bidding for the leadership almost a "mission impossible."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. stance has aroused fierce indignation in Thailand,
which considers itself a U.S. ally.
</P>
<P>
Thai ministers, citing promises made by U.S. President Bill
Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright not to block
Supachai, have repeatedly called for transparency of the WTO
selection process and a neutral U.S. stance.
</P>
<P>
Some Thai politicians have urged the government to reconsider
its policies toward the United States and some of them even joined
the public to rally in front of the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok to
protesting against what they called the U.S. "foul play" in the
matter.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the United States chooses Moore partly because he
has ingratiated himself with the most powerful U.S. labor lobby,
the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
In a U.S. election season, labor's vote matters to Democrats
and Republicans alike, they said.
</P>
<P>
The United States also worried that if Supachai becomes
Ruggiero's successor, he could hurt U.S. interests in the WTO by
listening more to the less-developed countries' concerns about the
WTO statutes on anti-dumping.
</P>
<P>
The huge differences between the United States and Asian
members over many trade issues are reasons behind the unbreakable
impasse of the director-generalship race.
</P>
<P>
While the United States calls for linking trade with labor and
environmental issues at the WTO's Seattle ministerial meeting in
November, the Asians want the issues to be tackled by the
International Labor Organization and the United Nation's
environmental agency respectively.
</P>
<P>
Eager to have their voice heard, the Asian nations find that
the most effective way is to have a director-general from the
region.
</P>
<P>
The WTO has the tradition of reaching accords by
"consensus-building." Despite Thailand's and the Asians' repeated
calls for a vote to end the deadlock, the United States cited the
tradition to avoid it.
</P>
<P>
As both the Americans and the Asians are unlikely to soften
their stances on the new director-general of the world trade body,
hope is slim for either Supachai or Moore to finally get the top
post.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats in Geneva had predicted that the selection process
may end with the emergence of a third candidate who would command
support from a majority of the WTO members.
</P>
<P>
But, to start the selection process all over again will take a
long time, which is something that the WTO can not afford.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Peso Devaluation Termed Positive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The devaluation of the Mexican
currency, the Peso, against the U.S. dollar in the last week is
positive, said the BBV Probursa Financial Group Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Group said in its most recent report that the
peso devaluation last week, which amounted to 3.5 percent, will
check the aggravating imbalance of trade.
</P>
<P>
It added that the national currency devaluation in the past
weeks will prevent an expansion in a short time of the trade
deficit and that of the current account, especially when a "bigger
economic growth" is expected in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
The Peso fell as rising U.S. interest rates lured investors
from Mexican securities, cutting demand for pesos.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that investors cashed their pesos for dollars
as the interest rate of the U.S. 30-year Treasury bond rose 10
basis points to 5.93 percent following a higher-than-expected
increase in the May manufacturing index reported by the National
Association of Purchasing Management.
</P>
<P>
The Group said that the impact on the official inflation goal
of 13 percent by the end of this year will be minimal.
</P>
<P>
The national currency performance against the dollar is natural
in the floating system in this field, said the Group.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Hopes Its Bridge Team Can Win Bermuda Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Indonesian
Contract Bridge Association (Gabbsi) Wiranto is hopeful that
national players will continue a run of winning form to triumph in
the Bermuda Bowl World Championships and Venice Cup in January
next year.
</P>
<P>
"I believe our team, especially the men's team, can win in the
Bermuda Bowl because they eliminated other strong teams in the
just concluded Asia Pacific Bridge Tournament," Wiranto said.
</P>
<P>
"The men's team defeated New Zealand and Australian teams from
zone VII and China from zone VI. It's not an exaggeration to hope
they win the Bermuda Bowl. We finished second in the 1996 Bridge
Olympics in Rhodes, Greece, after losing to France," Wiranto was
quoted by The Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia men's and women's teams won the 39th Asia Pacific
Bridge Tournaments in Guangzhou, China, last week. Both teams also
won tickets to the World Championships in Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto was satisfied with both the men's and women's teams
results in qualifying for the World Championships.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time we have managed to have both the men's
and women's team qualify for the championships," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia last won the Asia Pacific trophy in 1993.

JAKARTA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The All Indonesia Soccer Federation
(PSSI) has taken into account it's pre-Olympic loss announcing it
will focus on dominating Southeast Asian soccer, rather than the
whole Asia arena.
</P>
<P>
PSSI chairman Agum Gumelar said the federation must start to
focus on the gold medal in the 20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in
Brunei Darussalam in August.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia failed to qualify for the pre-Olympics after losing 0-
7 to South Korea in a do-or-die match of the Group Eight
qualifying round in Seoul last week.
</P>
<P>
"Considering the result, I realize where our soccer team
belongs in the world. The last board of executives vowed to bring
our soccer onto the world arena, but I told current officials we
could not make a big jump directly," Agum said in an evaluation of
the national team's performance with PSSI officials recently.
</P>
<P>
"First, we must gain supremacy in Southeast Asian before
dominating in Asia. Then we can move into the world arena," Agum
was quoted by The Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>

Indonesia will face tough challenges from the 1997 SEA Games
soccer champions Thailand, the 1998 Tiger Cup champion Singapore

JAKARTA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The voter registration throughout
Indonesia has reached 91.14 percent or 116,254,217 voters,
according to spokesman of the General Elections Commission
Djohermansyah Djohan.
</P>
<P>
Data collected by the commission show that West Java Province
has the highest number of registered voters (96.16 percent),
followed by Central Sulawesi and North Sulawesi (95.54 percent and
94.87 percent respectively).
</P>
<P>
The areas with the smallest number of registered voters are
East Timor and Aceh, with 43.9 percent and 56.76 percent
respectively, Djohan was quoted Thursday by Antara News Agency as
saying.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the overseas general elections bureau reported
that voter registration has reached 74 percent or 579,318 voters.
</P>
<P>
Despite mushrooming complaints from election officials about
the ill-prepared polls, the General Election Commission
Secretary-General Amur Muchasim insisted that preparations were
"running smoothly."
</P>
<P>
Reports from poll officials throughout the country said various
technical disruptions were found only four days ahead of the poll,
such as misprinted ballot papers and inferior ink in Jakarta,
Central and East Java as well as in Kalimantan, Lampung and North
Sumatera.
</P>
<P>
"All elections tool kits consisting of ballot papers, ink,
ballot pads up to the nails used to punch the ballot papers have
been distributed to all regencies," Amur said.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Information Minister Yunus Yosfiah Wednesday said
the government will soon issue a presidential decree to declare
June 7, 1999, a holiday to give the people ample time to go to the
polls.
</P>
<P>
During the former President Soeharto administration, polling
was always done on workdays, compelling civil servants to cast

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Billiard Body to Choose 14 Players for SEA Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Billiard and Snooker
Association (POBSI) was ready to select 14 of 20 players for
preparations for the 20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's snooker coach Hendro T. Nuraji said the national
team, to compete in the biennial event in Brunei Darussalam from
August 7 to August 15, will comprise three players in the snooker
event, three players in the English billiard event, four players
in the nine-ball event and another four in the 15-ball event.
</P>
<P>
"In the snooker event, Rudi Sulaeman has been training in
Australia at his own expense for several months. Other candidates
are Sayumin, Peng K. Sen, Bernhard and Hek Ta," Nuraji was quoted
by The Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Brunei, which will host the Games for the first time, will not
feature all billiard events, unlike the Indonesian hosting of the
1997 SEA Games.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia will miss opportunities to win gold from carom events
as they will not be featured at the event.
</P>
<P>
"If we could compete in carom, we could win two golds as
promised by POBSI chairman Putera Astaman earlier," Nuraji said.
</P>
<P>
Due to limited finances, POBSI is yet to announce any plans to
send players for tryouts abroad. Indonesia made a clean sweep of
12 golds in the 1997 SEA Games here.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Studies Way of Logistic Support to Kosovo Peacekeeping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria is studying the way in which
it could provide logistic support for future NATO peacekeeping
operation in Kosovo, but has not yet begun negotiations with NATO
on the matter, Foreign Ministry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ministry spokesman Radko Vlaikov said several Bulgarian
departments are coordinating efforts in which the country could
logistically support the operation following the possible signing
of a peace accord on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
However, a document on the logistic support, which is worked on
by the departments, is not the subject of negotiations, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Vlaikov admitted that about a dozen NATO representatives are
currently in Bulgaria, familiarizing themselves with the
infrastructures in all sites that could be useful for the
realization of the logistic support.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that as of this February, the Bulgarian government
was principally ready to support the operation once a Kosovo peace
accord was signed and also voiced its readiness to take part in
the operation with non-combat units.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Italians Urge Limiting Auto Traffic in City Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 2 (Xinhua) -- More than 88 percent of Italians are
in favor of banning auto vehicles in city centers to reduce noise
pollution and improve the quality of the air.
</P>
<P>
According to a study by the Demoskopea group, 70 percent of
Italians favor banning the smoky, two-cycle motors, and 80 percent
are ready to back banning cars without catalytic converters from
downtown.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the report, Environment Minister Edo Ronchi said,
"These findings demonstrate that Italians are in agreement with
the measures we have been proposing for some time, and those who
view them as too drastic must now rethink their position after
these results, which clearly indicate that traffic in cities has
become unbearable."
</P>
<P>
On the question of how to improve urban traffic, 97 percent of
those surveyed proposed creating parking lots outside city centers
and 94 percent called for greater investment in public transport.
</P>
<P>
Although Italians have strong opinions on anti-smog measures,
they are apparently not well informed on what measures are already
in force. Only 22 percent of the respondents knew that a law
against the use of benzene exists.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Tap U.S. Tourism Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka will soon launch an
extensive promotional tourism drive to tap the tourist market in
the United States, the state press reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As a prelude to the drive, authorities are planning to appoint
a Sri Lankan honorary director of tourism in New York to handle
the promotional activities, the Daily News said.
</P>
<P>
"Our tourism industry will receive an unprecedented boost if we
could capture even a small percentage of this market," said W.P.S.
Jayawardena, secretary of the Tourism Ministry.
</P>
<P>
U.S. tourists are considered to be high spenders and prefer
destinations which are eco-friendly and of historical
significance.
</P>
<P>
A recent promotional tour of officials to the United States led
by Minister of Tourism Dharmasiri Senanayake was a great success
which enabled the groundwork to be laid for the drive.
</P>
<P>
A large number of American tourists visit India and other Asian
countries regularly. It is expected that Sri Lanka could also draw
a portion of this tourist traffic.
</P>
<P>
More than 381,000 tourists came to Sri Lanka last year, an
increase of 4 percent over 1997. The most arrivals were from West
Europe and Asia.

<HEADLINE> Thai Rice Exports Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Thai rice exports in the first five
months of this year earned 691 million U.S. dollars, down by 22
percent from 885 million dollars a year earlier, according to the
Foreign Trade Department of the Thai Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the volume of rice exported also declined to 2.31
million tons from 2.81 million tons.
</P>
<P>
However, prospects were improving in terms of volume for the
rest of the year, Pracha Charutrakulchai, the department's
director-general, was quoted Thursday by the Bangkok Post as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Exports for May increased by about 10 percent year-on-year to
472,000 tons from 427,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
But the shipments were worth 121 million dollars, down from 140
million dollars a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Even so, May's figure was an improvement from 370,000 tons
exported in April, 450,000 tons in March, 430,000 tons in February
and 560,000 tons in January.
</P>
<P>
Export figures would be boosted by the government's sale of
300,000 tons of rice to Iran, pending shipment of 200,000 tons to
Indonesia and a deal with the Philippines, Pracha said.
</P>
<P>
China would also buy 200,000 tons this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe Thai rice exports on a government-to-government
basis will pass 500,000 tons projected earlier," Pracha said.
</P>
<P>
Export approvals were currently for an average of 20,000 tons a
day, he said.

<HEADLINE> D'Alema: Ground Invasion of Sovereign State "Unimaginable" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 2 (Xinhua) -- It would be "unimaginable" for NATO to
decide on its own to invade a sovereign state, Italian Prime
Minister Massimo D'Alema said Wednesday amid growing controversies
over NATO's sending ground troops to the troubled Serbian province
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on a TV talk show, D'Alema said NATO member countries
have not started discussions on sending ground troops to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He said if the ongoing mediation could not get along, the
United Nations should be called in to approve a resolution, which
would be the only way out of the Balkan war.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Italy hopes for an immediate halt to the bombing
of Yugoslavia to facilitate the search for a peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, in his speech to
foreign ambassadors in Rome on the National Day on Wednesday,
expressed deep concerns over the "terrible" state of affairs in
the Balkans and called for negotiations to solve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Party of Italian Communists Armando Cossutta
said Wednesday that whenever there is hope for peace, the United
States would always come up with new obstacles because it wants to
continue this war. He urged the Italian government to let people
hear its peace calls on every occasion.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, demonstrations were staged in Rome, Milan,
Naples, Venice and Brescia in protest against NATO's protracted
bombing of Yugoslavia, calling for a quick end to the bombing and
a negotiated solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators in Milan set up 400 crosses in a park and placed
toys in front of them in memory of innocent Yugoslav children
killed by NATO bombings.

<HEADLINE> EU Will not Become Military Group: Klima </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Prime Minister Viktor Klima
said here Wednesday that the European Union (EU) would not turn
itself into a military bloc even if it made considerable progress
in mutual diplomatic and security policies.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for the forthcoming EU Summit in Koln, Germany,
Klima told reporters that if the regional organization appeared as
a military group with mutual commitments, it would bring no good
to the group itself, to its enlargement and to Europe as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Klima noted that the government of Austria, a neutral member of
the 15-nation bloc, had affirmed its position in the document on
mutual diplomatic and security policies, which had been drafted
for the summit by EU's current rotating presidency Germany.
</P>
<P>
Further evolution of these policies conformed to the Austrian
Constitution and could not change a jot of the neutral status of
Austria, the prime minister held.
</P>
<P>
Referring to reports that NATO's Secretary-General Javier
Solana would assume the post of EU's representative for mutual
diplomatic and security policies, Klima expressed his disapproval
that Solana should hold the two positions concurrently.
</P>
<P>
But in principle, Klima went on, he welcomed the nomination of
Solana for the EU post, who is a member of the Spanish Workers'
Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
Solana's term as the NATO chief expires at the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Bosnich Signs Four-year Deal with Man United </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Mark Bosnich completed his long-
awaited move to Manchester United with the signing of a four-year
deal on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Aston Villa goalkeeper signed the contract after agreeing
terms for a move back to the club where he began his career as a
teenager almost 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Bosnich paid
tribute to the man he is replacing, Peter Schmeichel, and said he
had enjoyed his time at Villa Park.
</P>
<P>
"If there is any animosity it is only from their end," 27-year-
old Bosnich said.
</P>
<P>
"All I can say is that I am deeply grateful to Villa for giving
me my chance to fulfil my dream of playing in the Premier League.
</P>
<P>
"Manchester United had the greatest goalkeeper in the world in
Peter Schmeichel and I could not see the opportunity of playing
first team football with him around.
</P>
<P>
"From my point of view everything has worked out well, I have
had the chance to develop as a goalkeeper at Aston Villa, " he
said.
</P>
<P>
Bosnich was at the end of his contract with Villa and moves to
Old Trafford on a free transfer under the Bosman ruling.
</P>
<P>
Earlier a United spokeswoman said: "A deal has been completed
after a medical that occurred on Friday and after extensive talks
with chairman Martin Edwards."
</P>
<P>
Bosnich made his debut for United against Wimbledon in 1990 but
played only three first team games before leaving Old Trafford.
</P>
<P>
At that time, he was unable to get a work permit and returned
to Australia to play for Sydney Croatia.
</P>
<P>
He returned to England after marrying an Englishwoman but
instead of rejoining United he signed a two-year contract with
Villa in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Australia Urges U.S. Apology for Chinese Embassy Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Australian Defense Minister John
Moore urged the United States to quickly apologize to China over
the missile attack on its Belgrade embassy, The Australian
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the paper, the minister warned that
relations between the United States and China were crucial to the
stability of the Asia-Pacific region and would worsen further if
the United States did not respond promptly to China's four
demands, including an official apology and a briefing on the
subsequent investigation into the incident.
</P>
<P>
NATO warplanes bombed the Chinese Embassy in a May 7 raid,
killing three Chinese journalists and wounding more than 20
Chinese diplomats.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's not at all unreasonable for them to ask for a
proper response to the bombing and I'd urge America to respond,"
Moore told The Australian, a leading national newspaper in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
"It's not only important to Asia-Pacific relations but to world
relations."
</P>
<P>
The defense minister has just returned from a visit to China,
where he met top defense and political leaders in a bid to
strengthen Australia's relationship with China.

<HEADLINE> Peruvian Customs Seize Contraband Historical Books </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Peruvian customs authorities have
seized a cargo of more than 840 books printed in the 17th and 18th
centuries, and library experts confirmed Wednesday that they are
cultural inheritance which should be kept by the General Archives
of the Nation.
</P>
<P>
The invaluable books, to be sent to the United States, were
discovered by customs agents in the four chests whose contents had
been declared to be simple books valued at 900 U.S. dollars by
their owner, U.S. citizen Bruce Headfitz.
</P>
<P>
The National Library experts supposed that the books were from
a private library owned by the Prado family, one of the most
traditional families of Peru, from which at least two presidents
of this Andean country came.

<HEADLINE> Spain's United Left: Put NATO on Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, June 2 (Xinhua) -- General Coordinator of Spain's
United Left (UL), Julio Anguita, demanded Wednesday The Hague
International Court to put on the defendant's seat all those who
lead the NATO aggression against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Anguita condemned the NATO bombings of civilian targets, saying
that in these actions nobody can talk of "collateral damages"
since "they are deliberate bombings."
</P>
<P>
He added that the decision to bomb Yugoslavia was made last
January by United States President Bill Clinton and British Prime
Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
He denounced that the decision was proposed in Rambouillet to
force Yugoslavia to permit the NATO troops to enter the country
and detain any person.
</P>
<P>
"Spaniards have been systematically misled and that they must
refuse their confidence to those who lie," he said.
</P>
<P>
Anguita insisted in demanding The Hague International Court to
give an order to persecute and capture "all the criminals of the
zone," and to analyze the action of the allied bombings, to which
he referred as "acts of international terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Anguita said that the allied bombings are a cover to hide the
goal of "sinking Europe's political projects," because the United
States does not want to permit it that a politically strong and
socially united European Union will become "an alternate power"
after the disappearance of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
The general coordinator said that after 71 days of bombings,
NATO countries "do not know what to do" and are forced to
negotiate with Milosevic, after the Serb president was declared "
war criminal."

<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The American continent faces
serious environmental problems that endangered the population's
health, a United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) official
warned here Wednesday at the opening of a regional environmental
forum.
</P>
<P>
Enrique Leff, representative of the UNEP, told Xinhua that "the
environmental problems are very acute and they are touching basic
aspects of human survival."
</P>
<P>
The accelerated environmental pollution in the last decade in
the continent has caused epidemics, respiratory diseases, and
intoxication with deadly substances, and it did not only affect
the big cities, but also spread toxic and dangerous substances in
agricultural production, said Leff.
</P>
<P>
In the American continent's rural areas, the chemicals applied
to the agriculture damaged seriously the soil and affected the
agricultural workers' health, Leff added.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Peru, and Panama
attended the three-day international forum on the environment,
aiming at designing new strategies of environmental preservation.

<P>
ZAGREB, June 2 (Xinhua) -- NATO continued to bomb military and
civilian targets across Yugoslavia overnight Tuesday and Wednesday,
pounding heavily on Yugoslav armed forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Media reports here said NATO blasted 32 heavy artillery
positions and eight mortar positions of the Yugoslav military,
which were deployed against the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army
in the southern Serbian province. The bombing destroyed 15 armored
vehicles of the Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian Radio and Television, quoting a report from
Belgrade Radio, said the Yugoslav air defense forces shot down a
NATO plane in Panchevo and were looking for the pilot who bailed
out.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, NATO warplanes again bombed power relay
transmitters in Belgrade, a military airport in Batajnica, a
military camp in Obrenovac and eight radio-television transmitters
throughout Serbia.
</P>
<P>
NATO also raided the Yugoslav air defense headquarters in Novi
Sad, two fuel bunkers in northern Serbia, an arms depot and a
bridge for highway and railway.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian Radio and Television, citing Yugoslav military
sources, said the second-in-command of the Yugoslav air force,
General Ljubisha Velickovich, was killed in action when he visited
the front-line on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economists Sign Open Letter on Antitrust Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The long-drawn-out war between
Microsoft and the U.S. Department of Justice and 19 states has
prompted heated arguments in and out of the court. An open letter
published Tuesday added something new.
</P>
<P>
The Independent Institute, an Oakland, California-based
scholarly public policy institution published the letter to
President Bill Clinton. It was signed by 240 leading economists
addressing "runaway antitrust protectionism" and calling for an
end to speculative enforcement efforts.
</P>
<P>
Citing recent high-profile litigation against Microsoft, Intel,
Cisco Systems, Visa and MasterCard, the letter said that the cases
were instigated by rival business firms instead of consumers.
</P>
<P>
"Where antitrust authorities respond to these protectionism
demands, the workings of markets are short-circuited," the letter
said. "Antitrust protectionism means that market decisions about
how to compete for consumers' favor are displaced by bureaucrat ic
and political decisions."
</P>
<P>
Antitrust is supposed to be about protecting consumers against
higher prices and other consequences of monopoly power, said the
letter, adding that it was not consumers but rival firms that
asked for these antitrust actions. In fact, the letter said,
consumers of high technology have enjoyed falling prices,
expanding outputs and array of new products and innovations.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that more of the energies of firms are now
directed to politics, less to production and innovation.
"Successful innovators are penalized, scales economies are lost,
and competitions thwarted," said the letter, warning that these
cases would weaken U.S. firms and reduce their international
competitiveness.

TIRANA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The supreme commander of NATO,
Wesley Clark, said Wednesday in the Macedonian capital of Skopje
that new NATO troops will begin to arrive in Macedonia just in
days.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark after meeting with Macedonian President Kiro
Gligorov.
</P>
<P>
Clark said that he discussed with Gligorov the issue of
increasing NATO troops in the country and the situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He said that Macedonia has agreed to admit additional 14,000
NATO troops for peacekeeping mission in the southern Serbian
province of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
If the situation turns complicated, the NATO troops can force
their way into Kosovo without agreement from Yugoslavia, he
threatened.
</P>
<P>
With the new deployment, which Clark said will take several
weeks to complete, the total NATO troops in Macedonia will amount
to 30,000.
</P>
<P>
He said that air strikes will continue until Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic accepts all the conditions set by NATO.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton announced Wednesday to send 7,000
U.S. soldiers to Macedonia, half of the additional 14,000 troops
NATO has planned to deploy in the former republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
From Skopje, Clark flew to Tirana's Rinas Airport, "the hawk
base" of NATO troops in Albania, to conduct his routine weekly

<HEADLINE> Blair Says Air Campaign against Yugoslavia Must </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said on Wednesday that the air campaign against Yugoslavia must
continue until Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic clearly
accepts NATO's terms over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"The NATO demands have been very clear from the very
beginning," a BBC report quoted Blair as saying in Cologne, a
German city where he was visiting to attend a European Union
summit starting on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Serb troops must go, an international force must enter and the
ethnic Albanian refugees must return, he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair, who was widely seen as NATO's leading hawk, said the
military alliance would press on with its long-established
strategy of "diplomacy backed with force" until Milosevic met all
the demands from NATO.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin and Finland's
President Martti Ahtisaari who represents the EU and is acting in
such close concert with the United States that he effectively
speaks for NATO, travelled to Belgrade to brief Yugoslav President
Milosevic of the agreement reached between Russia and the United
States on the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian parliament was expected to discuss the NATO-Russia
plan on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said after meeting Milosevic that the leadership
in Belgrade had to make a tough decision, reports from Belgrade
said.

<HEADLINE> World Air Traffic Grows 1 Percent in 1998: ICAO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Total scheduled traffic of
the world's airlines recorded only 1 percent growth in 1998 over
1997, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The world's scheduled airlines fetched an operating profits of
5.5 percent of revenues in 1998, the Montreal-based ICAO said.
</P>
<P>
Operating revenues and expenses both rose by 3 percent over
1997, with 298.5 billion U.S. dollars and 282.0 billion dollars
reached respectively, it said.
</P>
<P>
The results reflected a generally healthy world economy, said
ICAO, adding that setbacks in several major economies notably in
Asia resulted in a substantial slowdown in traffic growth.
</P>
<P>
The airlines of Europe and Latin America/Caribbean showed
growth well above world average in 1998, while growth of the
Middle East and North America was close to world average and
Africa below the world average, ICAO added.

<HEADLINE> NATO Bombing Has Adversary Impact on Yugoslavia, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The first U.N. humanitarian
assessment mission said Wednesday that the on-going NATO bombing
against Yugoslavia has created civilian deaths, massive
unemployment and has adversary impact on health care and
environment in the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
Sergio Vieira de Mello, U.N. undersecretary for humanitarian
affairs, told a closed-door Security Council session that "the
assessment mission saw ample evidence of serious additional damage
inflicted by the NATO air strikes on an economy already
debilitated as a result of sanctions and the break up of the
former Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
The Balkan country met with "civilian casualties as a result of
NATO bombardments," and "unemployment reaching crisis proportions,
due to the destruction of industrial plants and enterprises and
the collapse of the country's economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Priority concerns throughout Yugoslavia are also the "health
and environmental impact of the destruction of chemical and other
plants producing hazardous materials contamination," and "damage
to infrastructure providing basic services -- health, water
supply, education, transport, telecommunications," he said.
</P>
<P>
Beginning May 15, de Mello led a U.N. team, composed of some 15
people from a number of U.N. agencies, in making a 11-day
fact-finding tour in Kosovo and other parts of Yugoslavia, and
held talks with Yugoslav leaders in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The NATO bombing also "has serious impact on the educational
system" in the country because "schools and universities have been
closed throughout the FRY (the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia)
since March 24," he said.
</P>
<P>
The air strikes had "adverse effects on medium-term
agricultural production, especially in view of the destruction of
the largest fertilizer plant near Pancevo," he said.
</P>
<P>
Even worse, NATO has created "a serious landmine problems in
Kosovo and the threat posed by unexploded ordnance in the country
as a whole," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan decided on May 4 to set up the U.N. mission to assess
the humanitarian needs of the people in Kosovo and other parts
of Yugoslavia. De Mello said that he would offer suggestions on
how to help Kosovar refugees return home in safety.
</P>
<P>
NATO, under the pretext of humanitarianism, has created a most
serious humanitarian catastrophe in Yugoslavia since the end of
World War II.

<HEADLINE> Cooked Vegetables Better in Fighting Cancer: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Cooked vegetables give people
considerably more protection against heart disease and cancer than
raw ones, a Europe-wide study has found.
</P>
<P>
The researchers, from Britain, the Netherlands, Spain, Ireland
and France, studied an active ingredient in vegetables called
carotenoid, which is one of a group of chemicals known as
antioxidants that are thought to protect against cancer.
</P>
<P>
The study, published Wednesday in New Scientist magazine,
showed that by softening up plant cells, cooking makes carotenoids
more easily absorbed by gut.
</P>
<P>
"Absorption of carotenoids from raw carrots is about three or
four percent, but if you cook and mash them, absorption increases
by four or fivefold," said Sue Southon, at the Institute of Food
Research in Britain, who is coordinator of the project.
</P>
<P>
The research suggested that cooking can improve the performance
of carrots, broccoli and spinach when it comes to protecting
health.
</P>
<P>
The scientists, conducting their study using an artificial gut,
also found that it was easier for the body to absorb vitamins from
vegetables than from supplements.

<HEADLINE> Smart Microwave Oven Makes Cooking More Simple </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Scientists are developing a
smart microwave oven that knows how to cook foods and can also
give warning about unhealthy ingredients, Britain's New Scientist
magazine reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Many microwave ovens are hard to operate as their front panels
often contain confusing arrays of badly labelled buttons.
</P>
<P>
The so-called Intelligent Microwave Oven, developed by
scientists at Rutgers University in New Jersey, the United States,
aims to end that problem using bar code technology.
</P>
<P>
With the smart oven, people can cook their ready meal by simply
swiping the packaging over a bar-code scanner on the oven's front
panel.
</P>
<P>
The bar code will contain information telling the oven how to
cook the food, ensuring that the food is cooked at the right
temperature for the right amount of time as the maker intended.
</P>
<P>
The Intelligent Microwave Oven, funded by Samsung, the Korean
consumer electronics company, is due to go on trial in six months,
according to New Scientist.

<HEADLINE> Clark Says NATO Troops to Enter Kosovo in "Days" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The supreme commander of NATO,
Wesley Clark, said Wednesday in the Macedonian capital of Skopje
that NATO troops will enter Kosovo in just a few days.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark after meeting with Macedonian President Kiro
Gligorov.
</P>
<P>
Clark said that he discussed with Gligorov the issue of
increasing NATO troops in the country and the situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He said that Macedonia has agreed to admit additional 14,000
NATO troops for peacekeeping mission in the southern Serbian
province of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
If the situation turns complicated, the NATO troops can force
their way into Kosovo without agreement from Yugoslavia, he
threatened.
</P>
<P>
With the new deployment, which Clark said will take several
weeks to complete, the total NATO troops in Macedonia will amount
to 30,000.
</P>
<P>
He said that air strikes will continue until Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic accepts all the conditions set by NATO.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton announced Wednesday to send 7,000
U.S. soldiers to Macedonia, half of the additional 14,000 troops
NATO has planned to deploy in the former republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
From Skopje, Clark flew to Tirana's Rinas Airport, "the hawk
base" of NATO troops in Albania, to conduct his routine weekly
visit.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the NATO troops in Albania said that Clark made
a detailed assessment on the troops' preparedness for their
missions in Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Dow Jones Moves lower On Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average moved lower Wednesday as investors pondered whether the
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow closed down 18.37 at 10,577.89. The index gained
36.52 points Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Investors' worries about higher interest rates pulled the
Dow average as much as 131 points lower in the trading.
The market was calmed down after the speech given by the
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan in Boston, erasing most
of the losses for the index in the late afternoon trading.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Greenspan focused his remarks on free trade
and gave no word on interest rates. The Federal Reserve warned
two weeks ago that it would raise interest rates to cool off
the economy if inflation is building up.
</P>
<P>
But investors moved into technology sector to search
bargains, pushing the technology heavy Nasdaq index and The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 5000 index higher. The Nasdaq rose 20.38 at
2,432.41 and the S&AMP;P rose 0.55 at 1294.81.
</P>
<P>
Other stock indicators were lower. The NYSE composite
index fell 0.78 at 620.50 and the American Stock Exchange
composite index fell 4.88 at 771.23. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 0.72 at 436.74.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,635 dow, 1,358 up and 570
unchanged.

NYSE volume increased to 726.14 million shares from 681.99
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> FAO Calls for Final Push to Eliminate Rinderpest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) on Wednesday called for more
efforts to make rinderpest or cattle plague the first animal
disease to be eradicated from the earth.
</P>
<P>
Animal health officials suspect that cattle plague persists in
only three isolated areas of the world, including southern Sudan,
southern Somalia and parts of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
However, they have reported the occurrence of the disease in
other areas within the last five years. The areas include the far
eastern Russia, the southern Arabian Peninsula and the Kurdish
area along the border between Turkey and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Rinderpest is a contagious disease, characterized by
fever,focal erosive lesions in the mount and throughout the
alimentary tract, and by diarrhoea and a high fatality rate.
</P>
<P>
Rinderpest pandemics have killed millions of cattle, buffalo,
yaks and their wild relatives for many decades.
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s and 1980s, devastating epidemics spread in South
Asia, the Middle East and Africa, with the latest case taking
place in Pakistan in 1994, killing over 50,000 cattle and buffalo
before being brought under control.
</P>
<P>
FAO urged donor countries to provide immediate support for
rinderpest eradication programs including intensive vaccination.
