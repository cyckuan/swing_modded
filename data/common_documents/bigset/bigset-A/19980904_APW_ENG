	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Mother Teresa's church is planning lavish
public commemorations for Saturday's first anniversary of her
death, including an homage from Pope John Paul II, memorial Mass in
St. Peter's Basilica and a television spectacular from the Vatican.
	   The Roman Catholic Church's tributes _ including the Italian TV
special from a Vatican hall draped in the blue and white of her
saris _ offer everything but the speeded-up sainthood that her
followers say the extraordinary nun of Calcutta deserves.
	   Even for Mother Teresa, the Vatican made clear again Thursday,
the mandatory five-year waiting period stands.
	   ``Rome has got its rules,'' sighed Calcutta Archbishop Ivan
Dias, at the Vatican for Thursday's kick-off of the anniversary
events.
	   Mother Teresa died Sept. 5, 1997, in Calcutta at 87, after a
life spent aiding the poor and wretched through her Missionaries of
Charity order and other good works.
	   Italian Cardinal Pio Laghi will preside at Saturday morning's
memorial Mass in St. Peter's.
	   Saturday night's television tribute will feature everyone from
Kofi Annan and Yasser Arafat to Ben Kingsley and Italian singers
and celebrities _ including a model, paying her respects to Mother
Teresa's own ``beauty.''

Tokyo prosecutors raid electronics giant NEC in defense scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo prosecutors raided NEC Corp. on Friday to
investigate any role it may have played in a scandal involving
alleged shady ties between Defense Agency officials and an
NEC-affiliated contractor.
	   Prosecutors were searching NEC's Tokyo headquarters but the
company would make no comment until more was known about the
investigation, said NEC spokesman Aston Bridgeman.
	   On Thursday prosecutors arrested a former senior Japanese
Defense Agency official and three executives from NEC-affiliate
Toyo Communication Equipment Co. in connection with the scandal.
Prosecutors also raided the central Tokyo headquarters of the
Defense Agency on Thursday.
	   Those arrested are suspected of conspiring to allow Toyo to keep
profits it made by overcharging the government.
	   Prosecutors said Thursday they arrested Kenichi Ueno, a former
deputy director of the procurement department at the Defense
Agency.
	   Ueno is suspected of reducing the amount of money Toyo had to
reimburse the government after overcharging for military supplies.
	   Prosecutors also arrested Toyo Communication President Shinichi
Ito and Sales Director Yasunori Nagamoto, along with Hideo Arai, a
former defense project promotion chief at NEC _ the largest
shareholder in Toyo Communications _ and the current head of
another NEC affiliate.
	   Toyo Communications had been ordered to repay 2.5 billion yen
(dlr 18.2 million) to the government in 1994 for having sold
overpriced equipment over a five-year period. But it wound up
having to return only 874 million yen (dlrs 6.4 million) to
government coffers.
	   Defense officials allegedly went along with the deal in exchange
for private-sector jobs after retirement from the agency.

Malaysian shares suspended in Singapore, currency rate set
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The Stock Exchange of Singapore suspended
trading of Malaysian shares in the over-the-counter market Friday,
and Singapore banks set a rate for clearing transactions in the
Malaysian currency.
	   Malaysian shares traded on Singapore's over-the-counter market _
known as Central Limit Order Book, or Clob _ have come under heavy
selling pressure since Monday when the Malaysian government
effectively banned foreign trading of its country's shares.
	   More than 90 percent of Singapore's over-the-counter trading is
in Malaysian shares.
	   The Malaysian government also said its currency, the ringgit,
will have no value outside the country after Oct. 1, and it placed
immediate restrictions on foreigners' use of the currency in
transactions and exchange.
	   The Malaysian government also set a value of three ringgit to
the U.S. dollar for use inside the country.
	   Singapore banks, which have undeclared, but large investments in
Malaysia and hold ringgit accounts, responded Friday by advising
their customers to settle all their ringgit transactions by Sept.
9.
	   The Association of Banks in Singapore said many of its members
had agreed on a spot rate for the settlement of four ringgit to the
U.S. dollar, less than the rate set by the Malaysian government.

<SLUG> Moody's says China's credit rating may be lowered </SLUG>


<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Moody's Investors Service Inc. said
Friday it is considering downgrading the credit rating on China's
foreign-currency debt because of lower foreign investment and
exports.
	   Moody's, a major international credit-rating agency, said it
also was considering downgrading the four major Chinese state-owned
banks.
	   A downgrade could raise the cost of borrowing for the Chinese
government and banks, and make foreign investors more reluctant to
put money into a country where many already are unhappy with low
profits.
	   It also would affect Hong Kong's credit rating on foreign
currency debt because of the territory's extensive trade ties with
the mainland.
	   Although China has avoided a direct hit from the economic
turmoil sweeping Asia, its own problems are increasing. Economic
growth of 7 percent in the first half of 1998 was below
projections. Foreign investment has fallen and massive summer
flooding in some parts of the country has disrupted industry.
	   ``Today's action was prompted by mounting pressures on China's
external position from export weakness and declining foreign direct
investment, both of which are important sources of economic growth
in China,'' Moody's said in a statement issued in New York.
	   Nevertheless, a top official insisted Wednesday that China would
meet growth targets of 8 percent this year.
	   Liu Hong, director-general of the State Statistics Bureau, said
in Washington that policies meant to increase domestic demand and
infrastructure spending should compensate for lower exports, the
official China Daily newspaper reported.
	   China's exports have become more expensive than those of its
Asian neighbors because the value of its currency, the yuan, has
held steady while others have plunged by up to 70 percent.
	   On Monday, Moody's reduced credit ratings for major Chinese
state-owned investment companies, including the Chinese Cabinet's
flagship China International Trust and Investment Corp. The ratings
service said it believed they were receiving less government
support.
	   Moody's said Friday that it was reviewing the A1 rating on
long-term government debt, the prime-2 rating on short-term debt
and the Baa2 long-term ceiling on bank deposits.
	   It said the Baa2 rating for the four state-owned commercial
banks would be reviewed, taking into account concerns that mounting
economic problems could cut into their government support.
	   Moody's said the outlook for Hong Kong was hurt by concern that
the yuan would be devalued. China has vowed repeatedly not to
devalue the yuan, but Moody's said it was looking closely at how
concern over that possibility has affected Hong Kong financial
markets.
	   Hong Kong, which has its own currency, has tied its value to the
U.S. dollar for a decade. It has held that rate steady over recent
months, which has taken a toll on local industry by making the
territory far more costly than other places in Asia to do business.
	   Moody's noted that Beijing has large foreign-currency reserves
and a healthy trade balance.
	   But the service said it would ``assess the effects ... of a
continued deep slump in regional economic and trade performance''
as well as falling interest among foreign investors for emerging
markets such as China.

Aspiring Thai monks must take urine tests before being ordained
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Ministry of Education wants
men applying to become Buddhist monks to submit to urine tests for
drug use and the virus that causes AIDS, a ministry spokesman said
Friday.
	   More than 60 complaints have been filed with Thai police in the
past two years involving drug abuse at Buddhist temples, the
spokesman said.
	   Amphetamine abuse is soaring in Thailand. The country is also
the epicenter of the AIDS epidemic in Southeast Asia.
	   Traditionally, almost all Thai Buddhist men become a monk for a
brief period at some point during their lives to make religious
merit.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Ministry of Education wants
men applying to become Buddhist monks to submit to urine tests for
drug use and the virus that causes AIDS, a ministry spokesman said
Friday.
	   More than 60 complaints have been filed with Thai police in the
past two years involving drug abuse at Buddhist temples, the
spokesman said.
	   Amphetamine abuse is soaring in Thailand. The country is also
the epicenter of the AIDS epidemic in Southeast Asia.
	   Traditionally, almost all Thai Buddhist men become a monk for a
brief period at some point during their lives to make religious
merit.
	   Education Minister Akhom Engchuan has asked the Religious
Affairs Department, which the ministry controls, to study the
proposal before submitting the recommendation to the Sangha Supreme
Council.
	   The council, made up of the education minister and the country's

Suharto son testifies about troubled bank after warrant issued
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Police issued an arrest warrant for a
son of former President Suharto after he ignored a summons to
testify about a troubled bank he partly owns, newspapers reported
Friday.
	   Bambang Trihatmodjo was testifying before prosecutors Friday
about allegations of misconduct at Bank Andromeda. It was not
immediately clear whether police planned to arrest him.
	   It was the latest blow to the fortunes of the Suharto clan,
which crafted a huge business empire during the 32 years that the
autocrat held sway over Indonesia.
	   The companies of Suharto, his children and associates have come
under scrutiny since the former army general quit in May following
riots and student protests.
	   His downfall stemmed largely from public discontent over
Indonesia's worst economic crisis in decades. Critics allege
widespread corruption by the Suharto family contributed to the
turmoil, and the reform-minded government has pledged to curb
graft.
	   Police issued arrest warrants Thursday for 10 Bank Andromeda
commissioners and directors after the bankers ignored three police
summonses, local newspapers reported.
	   ``Why do we have to call them three times? Two summons is enough
to issue an arrest warrant,'' the daily Kompas newspaper quoted
police spokesman Togar Sianipar as saying.
	   Bambang was also questioned Thursday night, The Jakarta Post
reported. It was not clear if police had picked him up or if he had
gone to police headquarters voluntarily.
	   Suharto has three sons and three daughters. Bambang is his
second son.
	   Bank Andromeda was closed in November for allegedly violating
lending limits. It is one of 21 banks that have been referred to
the police by the central bank, Bank Indonesia, for investigation
into possible violations of the country's banking laws.
	   Suharto's own enterprises are being investigated.
	   Earlier this week, the government said evidence indicates
charities set up and controlled by Suharto misused their funds.
Critics have alleged that funds from the charities were funneled
into companies owned by the Suharto family.
	   On Thursday, a former trade minister and longtime associate of
the former president testified that he used central bank funds to
finance part of a paper-making company he owns. Mohamad ``Bob''
Hasan said he was ready to face charges of corruption.

Ex-Rwandan leader seeks leniency in genocide sentence

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ Preparing to issue its first sentence, a
U.N. tribunal must weigh an ex-prime minister's admission of guilt
and testimony incriminating other killers against his crime _ the
genocide of more than 500,000 Rwandans in 1994.
	   Jean Kambanda, the highest-ranking former political leader in
the custody of the tribunal, was hoping for leniency during his
sentencing Friday.
	   The defense asked for a sentence of two years or nothing at all
on Thursday for Kambanda, the first ever to plead guilty to
genocide.
	   The prosecution countered that Kambanda merits life
imprisonment, despite agreeing to plead guilty and giving evidence
against other alleged ringleaders.
	   Defense lawyer Oliver Michael Inglis contended that Kambanda,
42, was merely a puppet manipulated by a powerful and evil
military. ``The strings were pulled and he danced,'' he said.
	   Rwandans in the gallery at the U.N. tribunal laughed aloud in
derision as he pleaded for a light sentence for Kambanda ``to
enable the healing to take place.''
	   In the Rwandan capital Kigali, Anastase Murumba, director of the
survivors' group Ibuka, asked in anger, ``How dare he ask for such
a sentence when we who lived know Kambanda was no puppet? He was a
big supporter of the genocide. He deserves the death penalty.''
	   Kambanda has already recorded 90 hours of testimony about the
1994 carnage to help build genocide cases against others. The
court's rules allow it to consider factors including substantial
cooperation with the prosecutor.
	   But Deputy Prosecutor Bernard Muna argued that no amount of
testimony against others could offset such wrongdoing. Kambanda is
accused of inciting massacres, ordering roadblocks to help round up
of Tutsis, and distributing weapons for the slaughter as his
hard-line Hutu government presided over the bloodbath.
	   ``How can you balance the thousands and hundreds of thousands
killed with the cooperation of the accused?'' Muna asked the court.
``We believe this crime merits nothing less than life
imprisonment.''
	   A life sentence is the maximum that can be imposed by the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, based in the northern
Tanzania town of Arusha.
	   Rwanda has carried out its own prosecutions. In April, Rwandan
firing squads executed 22 people convicted of genocide, the first
executions in connection with the meticulously planned, 90-day
slaughter.
	   Kambanda pleaded guilty before the U.N. court on May 1 to six
counts of genocide and crimes against humanity, including
responsibility for the murder and extermination of civilians,
becoming the first person to accept culpability for genocide before
an international court.
	   The crime of genocide was decreed and defined in 1948, after the
post-World War II Nuremberg trials.
	   During the hourlong session, defense attorney Inglis said the
three-month frenzy of killing had already begun by the time
Kambanda took office, after the assassination of Prime Minister
Agathe Uwilingiyimana on April 7, 1994.
	   Although the indictment said Kambanda controlled the government
ministers and military officers who were carrying out the killings,
Inglis characterized him as a reluctant officeholder manipulated by
a powerful military.
	   Kambanda was afraid to object because he and his family would
have been killed, his lawyer said.
	   Kambanda _ slight and bearded, wearing a dark suit and tie _ let
his lawyer speak for him, telling the chief judge: ``I have nothing
further to add.''
	   Kambanda fled Rwanda when Tutsi rebels seized power in July
1994, and was arrested in Nairobi three years later with six other
high-level officials.

Ruble in free fall, parliament girds for battle
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with warning by defense minister, new details

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With the ruble plunging in street trading and the
price of food and other items soaring, parliament headed Friday for
a second vote on confirming President Boris Yeltsin's acting prime
minister.
	   If the lower house of parliament, the State Duma, again rejects
Viktor Chernomyrdin, the nation's crisis will drag on. His approval
could ease the political instability reigning over Russia, though
it would not end the nation's economic distress.
	   Just last month, the ruble was trading at 6.2 to the dollar, or
about 16 cents. On Friday, two days after the government said it
was powerless to control the crashing currency, the U.S. dollar was
close to 18 rubles in street trading.
	   Russians were worried, but there was no sign of panic or unrest.
	   ``Some people are panicking, like pensioners,'' said Yulia
Nazarova, a 30-year-old seamstress. ``We're all nervous, of
course.''
	   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said the military wanted a quick
end to the crisis and said nobody wanted a repeat of the 1993
confrontation between Yeltsin and parliament that ended with a tank
battle in Moscow.
	   ``We expect the relevant branches of government to make
decisions as soon as possible,'' he was quoted as saying Thursday
by the Interfax news agency, in an apparent warning to lawmakers.
	   ``The armed forces are not in a festive mood,'' he added.
	   Leaders of the hard-line opposition to Yeltsin vowed to vote
against Chernomyrdin, and the Communist speaker of the Duma,
Gennady Seleznyov, predicted that Chernomyrdin would fall short of
the 226 votes he needs.
	   Under the Constitution, Yeltsin has the option of proposing him
a third time, or choosing a new candidate. If the Duma votes no for
a third time, Yeltsin can call new Duma elections.
	   Some say Yeltsin will do just that _ forcing the legislators to
undergo elections a year earlier than scheduled. The Communists,
led by Gennady Zyuganov, are not particularly strong in the polls
at the moment, but the turmoil is likely to strengthen their
support.
	   ``Zyuganov thinks this is his best chance of gaining power,''
said Galina Starovoitova, a liberal Duma deputy. ``The more unrest,
the better he thinks they'll do.''
	   However, ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky and others warned
that Yeltsin could decide to impose emergency rule instead _
governing by decree until the next regularly scheduled elections
for parliament in December 1999.
	   Yeltsin himself moved Thursday to promote a compromise, reviving
a political deal nearly clinched last weekend, which the Communists
abandoned at the last minute.
	   According to Russian news agencies, Yeltsin made some amendments
to the document _ which proposes a reallocation of powers between
the president and parliament _ and sent it back to the Duma.
	   Some Duma members rushed to try and block any attempt by Yeltsin
to dissolve parliament by putting a motion to start impeachment
proceedings on the Duma's agenda for next week.
	   Once impeachment proceedings are under way, the Constitution
bars Yeltsin from disbanding the legislature. However, the
proceedings pose little actual threat to Yeltsin because the
procedures are lengthy, complex and would require confirmation by
the Supreme Court and Constitutional Court _ both of which are
loyal to the president.
	   Russia has been operating with an interim government since
Yeltsin fired the previous prime minister on Aug. 23 and named
Chernomyrdin acting prime minister. The political turmoil has left
the interim government unable to devote its attention to the
mounting economic crisis.

Two politicians question Hong Kong's market intervention
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Two leading opposition leaders said Friday that
the government's recent intervention in the territory's financial
markets was damaging foreign investor confidence.
	   Lawmakers Martin Lee and Emily Lau spoke during an hour-long
conversation with current and former members of the board of
directors of The Associated Press and senior AP news executives.
The group was led by Chairman of the Board Donald E. Newhouse and
Louis D. Boccardi, AP's president and chief executive officer.
	   Lee, chairman of the Democratic Party, Hong Kong's largest, and
Lau, leader of a small populist group, the Frontier, are among the
most popular politicians here.
	   They have run afoul of Beijing leaders by often criticizing Hong
Kong and Beijing leaders and calling for more democracy in the
Chinese territory. Both have been barred from mainland China.
	   In July, U.S. President Bill Clinton met privately with Lee,
giving him the same stature as Hong Kong's Beijing-selected chief
executive, Tung Chee-hwa.
	   On Friday, Lee and Lau on a variety of topics, ranging from
media freedom and the post-handover leadership, to the development
of China and the future of democracy.
	   They joined a chorus of criticism that the government's recent
intervention in the stock and foreign exchange markets of Hong Kong
was eroding investors' confidence and damaging the longstanding
free-market policy of the city.
	   ``It's the most stupid thing the government has done,'' said
Lee, a renowned barrister. ``Instead of allowing the invisible hand
of the free market to operate, you have the invincible hand of the
Hong Kong government.''
	   To defend the Hong Kong currency link to the U.S. dollar, the
government last month waged a costly battle with speculators and
introduced measures to curb speculation.
	   The government spent an estimated 15 percent of the U.S. dlrs 96
billion in foreign reserves on stocks last month, and successfully
lifted share prices to levels that left speculators who had bet
against the market stuck with huge losses.
	   On Thursday, Tung Chee-hwa had told the AP group in an interview
that the government needed to intervene to protect the peg, and
would continue to do so for as long as speculators keep attacking
it.
	   On Friday, the lawmakers criticized Tung, who was selected by a
400-member committee picked by Beijing. A conservative in politics
and finance, Tung is often accused of being old-fashioned and
indecisive. His popularity has plunged with the stock and property
prices during the 14-month-old Asian financial turmoil.
	   Calling Tung ``a courteous and sincere man, but definitely a
stooge of Beijing,'' Lee said the leader is ready to appease
Chinese leaders at the expense of Hong Kong.
	   ``He's so loyal he can anticipate what the Beijing government
wants him to do, and he does it without being ordered,'' Lee said.
	   Tung told the AP executives that Hong Kong needs time to mature
politically before democratic elections.
	   On media freedom, Lau, a former journalist, said that although
officials have not clamped down on the press, the local media had
started self-censorship before the July 1, 1997, handover. She said
news executives understand ``the thing to do is not to embarrass
China.''
	   On democracy, the pair's views were grim.
	   They said whether Hong Kong end up with full democracy depends
on the political developments in China. Under the constitution,
Hong Kong can decide on the electoral arrangements, but they must
be approved by Beijing.
	   Under a convoluted electoral system designed to guarantee
conservative businessmen and Beijing supporters a majority, only a
third of the 60-seat legislature was chosen by direct, popular vote
in May. Others were selected by small groups of professionals,
business groups and labor unions.
	   Pro-democracy candidates garnered two-thirds of the vote, but
won only a third of the seats.
	   Tung reiterated Thursday that Hong Kong needs time to mature
politically before it can have a legislature with every member
elected democratically.

Kim Jong Il to be anointed as North Korean president
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL SHIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ He has lived in his father's shadow
for all of his 56 years, but the time has finally come for Kim Jong
Il to make his own mark as president of North Korea.
	   That milestone will be of concern to a world already worried
about the possible nuclear capability and growing missile
technology of Kim's belligerent, isolated Marxist state.
	   Kim will assume the presidency next week, ascending to an office
that has been vacant ever since his father, Kim Il Sung, died of
heart failure in July, 1994.
	   The first legal step in that ascension comes Saturday when the
country's newly elected parliament, the Supreme People's Assembly,
convenes its first session.
	   The 680-member assembly will elect Kim and he is expected to be
installed in office on Wednesday, the 50th anniversary of the
founding of North Korea in 1948.
	   In a brief dispatch Friday, the North's official Korean Central
News Agency reported the arrival in Pyongyang of assembly deputies
and said ``they are filled with firm determination to make a
historic phase for the strengthening and development of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea.''
	   Four years after his death, the elder Kim is still revered in
North Korea as the ``Great Leader,'' the embodiment of ``the sun
and the stars,'' a ruler who had ``the mandate of heaven.''
	   So long and deep is his shadow, that his son, known as the
``Dear Leader,'' is not expected to radically change the nature of
the regime he inherits in communism's first hereditary power
succession.
	   ``For North Korea, it'll be a long time coming but it will not
bring any drastic change in the country's Cold War foreign
policy,,'' said Park Young-rim, a political science professor at
Korea University.
	   Indeed, even without the title of president, Kim Jong Il has
been running the country since his father's death as commander in
chief of its 1.1-million strong military and head of the ruling
Workers' Party. Little has changed in that time.
	   Park said, however, that North Korea under Kim Jong Il's
presidency might expand economic contact with the outside world,
especially with South Korea, to earn badly needed hard currency.
	   At the same time, Park said, Kim would carefully guard against
the possibility of any economic opening causing instability in
North Korea's tightly controlled society.
	   North Korea already has approved plans by two South Korean
businesses, including the giant Hyundai group, to start sightseeing
tours of a scenic mountain on its east coast beginning later this
month. The deals could earn the North up to dlrs 100 million a
year.
	   North Korea desperately needs the money. Its economy is in
shambles, forcing the country to rely on outside aid to feed its 24
million people.
	   Nearly 5 million North Koreans reportedly subsist in part on
grass, tree bark and other food substitutes. Some International
monitors believe that up to 2 million people have died of
starvation in the past three years.
	   Despite the acute economic problems, North Korea's old tactics
of upping the security stakes as a means of exacting economic
concessions will likely persist under the new leader, analysts say.
	   ``The recent firing of a long-range missile over Japan is a
typical example of the North's hard-line policy of resorting to
brinkmanship,'' said Yoon Duk-min, a researcher at the Institute of
Foreign Affairs and National Security, a government think-tank.
	   The missile launch, Yoon said, appears to have had the dual
purpose of solidifying internal unity and sending a message to the
outside world that despite its deepening economic difficulty, North
Korea's military power remains formidable.
	   Yoon compared the North's missile-firing with a crisis created
by the communist country's threat to pull out of the Nuclear
Non-proliferation Treaty in 1993.
	   That led the United States to strike a deal with North Korea the
following year, giving it two nuclear power plants worth at least
dlrs 4.6 billion in exchange for the North's promise to dismantle
its suspect nuclear weapons program.
	   ``Missiles are another bargaining chip North Korea is using to
exact economic aid from neighboring countries,'' Yoon said. ``They
are desperate, so they have nothing to be afraid of.''

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Groom Glenn Emerton watched wide-eyed
as wife-to-be Leif Bunyan walked towards him in her ice blue dress.
She had that wedding day glow, but he couldn't have known. He had
never seen her before.
	   ``God, she's beautiful,'' Emerton declared to no-one in
particular.
	   Emerton, 24, and Bunyan, 22, were introduced at the altar in
front of 350 people Friday courtesy of a seven-week promotion for a
local radio station.
	   The only contact between them before they exchanged vows, at the
commitment ceremony performed by a celebrant, was when Emerton
popped the question on the telephone.
	   The proposal and ceremony went live to air on 2Day FM, but there
was one significant setback for the promotion. Under Australian
law, marriages have to be registered a month in advance except in
special circumstances.
	   ``That is a little disappointing but we knew it would probably
be the case,'' said station spokeswoman Michelle Christison. ``They
had a commitment ceremony today and have planned a private ceremony
with their families to sign the marriage certificate after they
come back from their honeymoon.''
	   The radio station paid for the wedding, a one-week honeymoon in
Paris and urged listeners to send the couple some wedding presents.
After that they're on their own.
	   The promotion was launched with the attitude that it was getting
impossible for young Sydneysiders to meet available members of the
opposite sex. In Sydney the common refrain from frustrated females
is that the young men are ``either married or gay.''
	   Emerton and Bunyan were found after several hundred listeners
applied to be considered for the wedding. The men's short list was
cut to five and the women's nine. The shortlisted candidates who
missed out were also present at Friday's ceremony.
	   The lucky pair kissed enthusiastically and seemed pretty pleased
with each other.
	   ``I couldn't have picked a better bride myself,'' Emerton said.
``I had a sort of a picture of her (in my mind) but she's even
better than what I thought, her personality's just so nice.''
	   Bunyan said: ``I think he's lovely. He's got a really lovely
heart, beautiful eyes and a great big smile and he seems
wonderful.''
	   The ceremony drew criticism from the Catholic Church. Father
Brian Lucas branded it an arranged marriage that did little credit
to its promoters and participants.
	   Station announcer Wendy Harmer dismissed the criticism.
	   ``The Catholic Church said there's no place in society for
arranged marriages,'' Harmer said. ``These are also the same people
who say there's no place in modern society for contraception.''

 &UR; Kim Jong Il: World's first communist hereditary ruler
 &UR; By PAUL SHIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ He is known to the outside world as an
unpredictable leader perhaps armed with a nuclear bomb. But at
home, he is a ``peerless leader'' and the ``lode star of the 21st
century.''
	   He is Kim Jong Il, who at the age of 56 finally succeeds his
father this week as the head of state of North Korea, one of the
world's few remaining hard-line Marxist states.
	   Kim is the first in communist history to succeed his father, but
his throne owes as much to Korea's ancient Confucian monarchies as
it does to 19th and 20th century political philosophies.
	   He is embraced at home in almost the same personality cult that
still surrounds his father, ``Great Leader'' Kim Il Sung, four
years after his death in 1994.
	   The influence of the two Kims is absolute in North Korea. Their
portraits hang side by side in all homes and buildings, and their
writings and philosophy are reported and broadcast daily.
	   Although the junior Kim has been groomed to succeed his father
since the 1970s, little is known and much is feared about the man
who controls the 1.1 million-strong People's Army, the world's
fifth largest.
	   North Korean media credit Kim with turning the country into an
``ideological and military power.'' But for the past three years,
the nation has been unable to feed its 24 million people without
international help.
	   Some observers estimate that up to 2 million North Koreans have
died of malnutrition or related ailments since 1996, when its
chronically ineffient farming industry was beset by a series of
floods and droughts.
	   The North's factories are reported to be operating at less than
50 percent capacity, frequent power outages are said to be
widespread and its old communist allies no longer provide support.
	   Still, the country is believed to have extracted enough
weapons-grade plutonium to make one or two atomic bombs. It also is
armed with ballistic missiles that can reach beyond Japan.
	   Kim rarely appears in public and his voice is seldom broadcast.
But defectors from North Korea describe him as an eloquent and
tireless orator, primarily to military units that form the base of
his support.
	   Kim is said to be a movie fan who owns a collection of 20,000
foreign films. He reportedly has produced several films himself,
mostly historical epics with an idealogical tinge.
	   The West's demonic image of Kim is based in part on suspicions
that he masterminded a 1983 terrorist bombing in Rangoon that
killed 17 high-ranking South Korean officials and the 1987 bombing
of a South Korean airliner that killed all 115 people aboard.
	   Biographical data on Kim is extremely sketchy. He is short and
pudgy at 160 centimeters (5-foot-3) and 85 kilograms (187 pounds)
and wears his hair in an exagerrated pompodour.
	   He was Kim Il Sung's eldest son by his late first wife, Kim Jung
Sook. North Korea says he was born Feb. 16, 1942, in a ``secret
camp'' at Mount Paekdu on the North Korea-China border when his
father was supposedly a guerrilla fighter against the Japanese.
Western officials say he was born in the Soviet Union.

overnight losses on Wall Street, political and financial
uncertainty in Malaysia, and another possible downgrade of Hong
Kong's creditworthiness.
	   In Singapore, Malaysian shares trading in the OTC market were
temporarily suspended early Friday, after the Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange on Monday banned trading in Malaysian shares outside the
country.
	   Shares in Singapore opened slightly lower over Malaysia's
political and financial confusion, with the benchmark Straits Times
Index shedding 0.59 percent to 807.86.
	   In Malaysia, shares opened sharply higher despite the political
and financial turbulence, as retail investors piled into the market
for a quick profit on hopes the government would further inject
liquidity into the economy, traders said.
	   The benchmark Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Index was 6.2 percent
higher at 332.59 by midday.
	   Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim lost all government positions on
Thursday when he appeared to challenge Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad's 17-year leadership.
	   Earlier this week, Malaysia introduced sweeping currency
controls that effectively pegged the ringgit at 3.80 to the U.S.
dollar, in an attempt to insulate the bleeding local economy from
regional ills.
	   In Hong Kong, stocks opened lower on the losses on Wall Street
overnight, growing tensions in Malaysia, and the announcement of a
possible downgrade of the territory's creditworthiness by a leading
credit rating agency.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index slumped 1.4 percent to 7,216.19 at
midday, tracking a 1.3-percent decline in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average in the United States.
	   ``The outside factors are not that favorable to (the) Hong Kong
market,'' said Josephine Hui of Celestial Securities Ltd.
	   Moody's Investors Service said Friday it will review Hong Kong's
long-term and short-term foreign currency ceilings for possible
downgrade.
	   Moody's announcement follows a downgrade earlier this week by
rival ratings agency Standard and Poor's. Moody's cited regional
instability, speculation in the Hong Kong currency, and the
government's recent market intervention.
	   In Tokyo, share prices were lower on the overnight drop in New
York and worries about Japanese corporate earnings.
	   The Nikkei average of 225 selected issues was down 1.1 percent,
closing the morning session at 14,098.20.
	   Market sentiment was dampened by Thursday's news that Toa Steel
Co. would liquidate itself, becoming Japan's biggest manufacturing
sector failure since the end of World War II. Another manufacturer,
Hitachi, also said it will post its first annual loss after the
war.

Rash of summer poisonings puts Japan on edge

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Four people die after eating curry at a festival. A
supermarket worker drinks some pineapple juice and doubles over in
nausea. A man sips canned tea at breakfast _ then collapses and
dies.
	   A rash of poisonings _ from arsenic in curry to cyanide in
oolong tea _ has gripped Japan this summer, killing five,
confounding police and making many think twice before taking a sip
of anything.
	   ``It's so scary _ I really have to be careful,'' said Akiko
Takayanagi, 24, as she stood outside a Tokyo department store.
``Whenever I buy a drink I have to check the can for holes.''
	   Authorities have yet to arrest anyone in the string of cases,
which spread rapidly this week as copycats have been piercing drink
cans and injecting poisons around the country.
	   In the latest case, a woman working in a convenience store in
the western city of Nagoya swallowed a mouthful of pineapple juice
Thursday night and immediately vomited. She later recovered.
	   The poisoning wave started with the worst attack yet. A local
festival in the western city of Wakayama turned to horror in July
when dozens fell ill after eating arsenic-loaded curry served under
picnic tents. Four people _ including two children _ died.
	   Since then, poisoning cases have mounted. A man died this week
after drinking canned tea laced with cyanide in his home. Two hot
pots used for making tea _ one at a company and one at a Buddhist
temple _ have been found poisoned.
	   The attacks have struck a cord in Japan, where memories of the
1995 subway nerve gas assault that killed 12 in Tokyo _ and the
smaller gassings that followed _ are still fresh.
	   The poisonings have also come as the nation is grappling with a
growing crime rate, a jump in juvenile delinquency and general
malaise related to the economy, now in its worst recession since
World War II.
	   For many Japanese, the most chilling aspect of the poisonings is
the apparent randomness of the attacks and the creeping sense that
another killing could come anywhere, anytime.
	   The inability of the police so far to make much progress on the
poison curry killings _ or any of the other poisonings _ has only
added to the fear.
	   ``We have to catch the culprits quickly,'' Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi was quoted as saying Friday by Kyodo News agency. ``Aiming
so indiscriminately at the public is cruel.''
	   Police have mobilized more than 100 officers to investigate this
week's cyanide death. The nation's top beverage makers called an
emergency meeting Friday on the poisonings and plan warning
stickers for vending machines.
	   Children are a special concern. Authorities handed out pamphlets
warning of spiked drinks to youngsters at supermarkets. Schools in
Wakayama have taken curry off the menu because it reminded students
of the July killings.
	   Still, for some the strong sense of security that many Japanese
take for granted has been hard to shake _ especially in Tokyo,
where no cases have been reported yet.
	   ``I haven't really thought about it,'' said Tokyo housewife
Natsuko Iwaki, 31. ``Maybe if the problem gets a little closer to
home, then I'll start getting worried.''

Strong quake rocks southern Tibet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.2 struck
southern Tibet on Friday, but there were no immediate reports of
deaths or damage.
	   The quake at 2:16 a.m. (1816 GMT Thursday) was strongly felt in
the towns of Tingri and Dinggye, near the Himalaya Mountains and
the border with Nepal, about 350 kilometers southwest of Lhasa, the
state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   The area is sparsely populated and remote, and inspection teams
had not yet reported any casualties or damage, said an official
with the Central Seismology Bureau who gave only his surname, Wang.

ASEAN accepts Cambodian election results
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The Southeast Asian nations group that barred
Cambodia's membership last year because of the violent power grab
by Prime Minister Hun Sen endorsed Friday the results of the July
election won by his party.
	   The nine-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations made no
independent finding on the validity of the July 26 elections, which
are still contested by opposition parties.
	   But ASEAN supported the evaluation of a U.N.-coordinated
observer group that said the polling and counting process was
``free and fair to an extent that enables it to reflect, in a
credible way, the will of the Cambodian people.''
	   A statement released Friday by ASEAN Chairman Shanmugam
Jayakumar, Singapore's foreign minister, said the group looks
forward to the time when Cambodia ``could be embraced by its ASEAN
brothers into their fold and restored in its rightful place in the
international community.''
	   There has been no indication when Cambodia would join ASEAN,
although leaders will hold a summit in December in Hanoi, Vietnam.
	   Cambodia's membership had all but final approval last year as
the group planned to include all 10 Southeast Asian nations on its
30th anniversary. But when fighting broke out between supporters of
Hun Sen and his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, ASEAN
foreign ministers refused to recognize Hun Sen's self-declared
government.
	   Burma and Laos were admitted and Cambodia was left out.
	   Other members of ASEAN are Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam, the
Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand.

Chernomyrdin calls for ``economic dictatorship'' to rescue economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin called
Friday for ``economic dictatorship'' to end the Russian crisis and
preserve market reforms.
	   Addressing the Federation Council, the upper chamber of
Parliament, Chernomyrdin said the government would let the ruble
float freely. He said the government would press ahead with market
reforms despite calls from hard-line opposition groups to reverse
them.
	   ``Starting in January the government will introduce an economic
dictatorship _ enterprises will be put in the conditions under
which they will not be able to fail under their obligations,'' he
said.
	   The State Duma, the lower chamber of parliament, was due later
Friday to vote on whether to confirm Chernomyrdin as premier. The
chamber voted against him Monday despite Russia's growing political
and economic crisis.

China begins issue of infrastructure bonds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China has begun to issue 100 billion yuan (dlrs
12.1 billion) in government bonds to fund infrastructure projects
intended to boost its flagging economy, state media reported
Friday.
	   The bonds will be purchased by China's four state-owned
commercial banks and will be traded on the interbank market, said
the Financial News, the central bank's newspaper.
	   Half of the bonds have already been sold. The Bank of China
bought 10 billion yuan (dlrs 1.21 billion); the Agricultural Bank
of China 20 billion yuan (dlrs 2.42 billion) and China Construction
Bank 20 billion (dlrs 2.42 billion).
	   The bonds will have a 5.5 percent coupon rate and carry a
10-year term.
	   As reported, funds raised will be spent on improved
infrastructure, agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, grain
storage facilities and urban housing. Most of the investment will
be used in the less developed central and western regions of China.

Thai conservationists demand Indonesia return Thai elephants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai conservationist group has called
on the Foreign Ministry to help secure the return of five Thai
elephants sent to Indonesia two years ago to work.
	   The Thai Elephants Conservation Group has submitted a letter to
the ministry urging it to intervene in the matter, Kobsak Chutikul,
the ministry spokesman said on Friday.
	   Six Thai elephants and their trainers were hired two years ago
by an Indonesian company to help catch wild elephants, said Kobsak.
One elephant has died since then.
	   Kobsak said the Indonesian company went broke because of the
country's economic crisis and is unable to pay the cost of sending
the elephants home, or pay the salaries of the elephant's trainers.
	   He said the ministry had not yet decided what action to take as
far as securing the animals' return, but will ask that the trainers
be compensated for their back pay. They were hired at dlrs 600 per
month.

Dollar lower in Tokyo, Japanese stocks decline
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stock, bond and dollar rates.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen Friday after
senior finance ministry officials hinted Japan may intervene to
further strengthen its currency. Tokyo stocks fell.
	   The dollar bought 135.29 yen in midafternoon trading, down 0.30
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but above its late New York level
of 134.70 yen overnight.
	   The U.S. currency weakened after Japan's vice finance minister
for international affairs, Eisuke Sakakibara, hinted early Friday
that Japan may intervene in currency markets to support the yen.
	   He was joined by Haruhiko Kuroda, head of the ministry's
international bureau, who warned that the yen's rise against the
dollar could pick up pace.
	   Overnight in New York, the dollar fell sharply after Dow Jones
Newswires quoted unidentified traders as saying George Soros'
investment fund group was dumping dollars and buying the German
mark.
	   A spokesman for Soros' fund refused to comment.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, shares fell in line with a decline
on Wall Street overnight and amid worries about the outlook for
Japanese corporate profits, traders said.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 218.33 points,
or 1.53 percent, to close at 14,042.91. On Thursday, the index fell
115.38 points, or 0.80 percent.
	   The collapse of a major steel company on Thursday and a forecast
by Hitachi that it would lose money this year for the first time
since the end of World War II both weighed heavily on shares.
	   The failure of Toa Steel Co. was Japan's biggest manufacturing
sector collapse since the end of World War II. Shares of related
companies tumbled Friday.
	   Steelmaker NKK, which holds a majority stake in Toa, sank
sharply after it said it would suffer a big loss to take over Toa's
operations. Fuji Bank, Toa's main lender, also fell sharply.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the exchange dropped 19.30 points, or 1.73
percent, to 1,094.47. The TOPIX declined 4.99 points, or 0.45
percent, the previous day.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average declined 100.15 points, or 1.3
percent, to 7,682.22 on Thursday. It had suffered its
second-biggest point loss ever on Monday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.065 percent from Wednesday's 1.085 percent, driving
its price up to 112.65 yen from 112.51 yen.

Tiny village insulated from worst of Flight 111 horrors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVE HOWLAND &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Residents and emergency workers
in the tiny seaside village of Peggy's Cove know that death is
floating only kilometers from their shoreline.
	   But the town with its pastel clapboard houses is largely
insulated from the horror of Swissair Flight 111. Apart from search
helicopters and a navy frigate a few kilometers off the coast, the
ocean looks blue and undisturbed.
	   The only hard evidence of the disaster amid a maze of tents,
barricades and emergency vehicles are the small piles of debris
ferried in for sorting on the town's fishing dock. The remains of
some of the 229 people aboard the flight from New York to Geneva
are being kept away from the village and shipped to a temporary
morgue on a military base 35 miles (55 kilometers) away.
	   Emergency workers were reluctant to speak about death, and many
were still determined to find survivors late Thursday.
	   Navy Lt. Com. Jacques Fauteux said airplanes would continue to
drop flares to search the seas overnight.
	   ``We will not stop looking until we have gone down every
possible route,'' he said. ``That is what we have to do.''
	   Fauteux said the possibility of saving someone is the greatest
motivator in an otherwise traumatizing task. He said grief
counselors would be available for the crew of the frigate
Preserver, which was being used as a collection point for the human
remains.
	   Meanwhile, utility workers, soldiers and firefighters prepared
the town for an overnight growth spurt, from 90 residents _ as
listed on its welcoming sign _ to as many as 800 rescue workers.
	   Workers for the local phone company strung new cables across the
town to a parking lot on a hill that doubles as a helicopter
landing pad and home to the region's mobile crisis center, a red
and silver 1967 bus.
	   ``We've been here since five this morning stringing phone
lines,'' supervisor Charlie Stott said, ``and if they want data and
fiberoptic lines tomorrow, we'll do that next.''
	   Down the street, Red Cross worker Mike MacIsaac handed out tuna
fish sandwiches and juice with a smile to anyone with an appetite.
Asked about the airline debris collected by police on nearby docks,
he looked away.
	   ``I don't concentrate on that,'' he said. ``That's their job.''

Chechen president to reorganize government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechnya's president said he will not try to
influence events in a neighboring region suffering from ethnic
tensions, and that he plans to reorganize his own government to
give himself more power, a news agency said Friday.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said on television late
Thursday that his region would not get involved in events in
Dagestan ``under any circumstances,'' Interfax reported.
	   Dagestan borders Chechnya in the Caucasus Mountains of southern
Russia. The entire region has been awash in kidnappings and
violence since the end of Chechnya's two-year war for independence
from Russia in 1996.
	   Chechnya considers itself independent and runs it own affairs,
though no other nation recognizes its claim. Dagestan remains part
of Russia.
	   Dagestan has suffered in particular in recent months from power
struggles among some of its 50 ethnic and religious groups.
	   Dagestan's region's Islamic spiritual leader was killed in a
car-bombing earlier this month and a small Islamic sect known as
the Wahhabis recently tried to create a separate Islamic state in
Dagestan.
	   ``Dangerous ideas are being prompted by forces that are
indifferent to the future of Dagestan,'' Maskhadov said. ``Dagestan
is an adventure which one should keep away from at a distance.''
	   Maskhadov's comments contradict those of former prime minister
Shamil Basayev, now the No. 2 man in charge of the military, who
has frequently offered to support the Wahhabis if Dagestani
authorities use force against them.
	   Maskhadov told his Cabinet on Thursday that he would reorganize
the government and give himself the prime minister's job in
addition to his presidential duties, Interfax said.

Dollar lower in Tokyo, Japanese stocks decline
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS day in last graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen Friday after
senior finance ministry officials hinted Japan may intervene to
further strengthen its currency. Tokyo stocks fell.
	   The dollar bought 135.29 yen in midafternoon trading, down 0.30
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but above its late New York level
of 134.70 yen overnight.
	   The U.S. currency weakened after Japan's vice finance minister
for international affairs, Eisuke Sakakibara, hinted early Friday
that Japan may intervene in currency markets to support the yen.
	   He was joined by Haruhiko Kuroda, head of the ministry's
international bureau, who warned that the yen's rise against the
dollar could pick up pace.
	   Overnight in New York, the dollar fell sharply after Dow Jones
Newswires quoted unidentified traders as saying George Soros'
investment fund group was dumping dollars and buying the German
mark.
	   A spokesman for Soros' fund refused to comment.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, shares fell in line with a decline
on Wall Street overnight and amid worries about the outlook for
Japanese corporate profits, traders said.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 218.33 points,
or 1.53 percent, to close at 14,042.91. On Thursday, the index fell
115.38 points, or 0.80 percent.
	   The collapse of a major steel company on Thursday and a forecast
by Hitachi that it would lose money this year for the first time
since the end of World War II both weighed heavily on shares.
	   The failure of Toa Steel Co. was Japan's biggest manufacturing
sector collapse since the end of World War II. Shares of related
companies tumbled Friday.
	   Steelmaker NKK, which holds a majority stake in Toa, sank
sharply after it said it would suffer a big loss to take over Toa's
operations. Fuji Bank, Toa's main lender, also fell sharply.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the exchange dropped 19.30 points, or 1.73
percent, to 1,094.47. The TOPIX declined 4.99 points, or 0.45
percent, the previous day.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average declined 100.15 points, or 1.3
percent, to 7,682.22 on Thursday. It had suffered its
second-biggest point loss ever on Monday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.065 percent from Thursday's 1.085 percent, driving
its price up to 112.65 yen from 112.51 yen.

Perkins in strong form says coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Olympic swimming champion Kieren
Perkins is back to the form which won him the Atlanta 1500-meter
gold medal, national coach Don Talbot said Friday.
	   Speaking to Australian reporters at the team's pre-Commonwealth
Games base in Singapore, Talbot said he would not attempt to pick a
winner in a race featuring Perkins, world champion Grant Hackett
and Olympic silver medalist Daniel Kowalski.
	   Perkins was back in full training with the rest of the 41-strong
Australian swimming team in Singapore Friday after a bout of the
flu a couple of weeks ago disrupted his preparations.
	   After watching the three Australians train, Talbot said only a
brave person would be willing to place a bet on the outcome in
Kuala Lumpur.
	   ``I wouldn't gamble on that at all, not a chance in hell,''
Talbot said.
	   Although 25-year-old Perkins, the world record holder, has not
cracked 15 minutes since his dramatic victory from lane eight in
Atlanta two years ago, Talbot said he could not be left out of the
equation in KL.
	   ``Kieren is the world record holder. Grant and Daniel are both
great athletes but despite what they've done they haven't been
within 10 or 12 seconds of what Kieren's best is,'' Talbot said.
	   ``Lately, there's been a question mark about Kieren because he's
been ill and he's got all these life stresses on him. He's been
married. He's got a baby. They have a cost. But the only comment I
can say about Kieren at this point is that he's swimming much
better than he was in Atlanta and he won in Atlanta.''
	   Perkins, whose wife is expecting their second child next
February, will go into his first major international meet since
Atlanta ranked number five in the 30-lap event behind Hackett,
Kowalski, Britain's Olympic bronze medallist Graeme Smith, and
South African Ryk Neethling.
	   It will be the first time Perkins and Hackett have met at a big
international and Talbot is clearly rubbing his hands in
anticipation of the contest.
	   ``Grant won the world championship. He doesn't want to let that
go and he knows what he's going to run into with Kieren,'' Talbot
said.
	   Hackett's gold medal chase may begin on Sept. 10 _ a day before
the games officially start with the opening ceremony.
	   The 18-year-old Gold Coast university student is expected to
have to swim a time trial for a place in the 4x200-meter freestyle
relay if the relays are swum as straight finals, as Talbot expects.
	   Talbot usually uses the morning heats to test the form of
swimmers before deciding on the final four, but if heats are not
swum in KL he will rely on time trials _ two days before the
swimming starts _ to pick his lineups in the freestyle relays.
	   The relay team is easy favorite for gold and is a chance to
break the world record held by the United States.
	   The swimming team will train in Singapore for another three days
before flying to Kuala Lumpur for the Games on Sept. three days
before the opening ceremony.

Chernomyrdin calls for `economic dictatorship' to solve Russian
</HEADLINE>
crisis &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Chernomyrdin comments in parliament. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin called
Friday for ``economic dictatorship'' to end Russia's crisis and
preserve market reforms as the hard-line opposition said it would
again block his confirmation.
	   Outlining plans to stem the country's economic crisis,
Chernomyrdin said the government would allow the ruble to float
freely, allowing market forces to determine its value. He also said
the government would press ahead with market reforms as soon as the
situation was stabilized.
	   ``Starting in January the government will introduce an economic
dictatorship _ enterprises will be put in the conditions under
which they will not be able to fail under their obligations,'' he
told the Federation Council, the upper chamber of Parliament.
	   Russia has been plunged into crisis by the collapse of the ruble
and a power struggle between the Communist-dominated Duma, or lower
chamber of parliament, and President Boris Yeltsin.
	   The Duma was to vote for a second time Friday on whether to
confirm Chernomyrdin as premier, after rejecting him on Monday. His
approval could ease the political instability reigning over Russia,
though it would not end the nation's economic distress.
	   The opposition says it will never approve Chernomyrdin, accusing
him of creating many of the current problems during his previous
five years in the job. Yeltsin has said he will accept no one else.
	   Just last month, the ruble was trading at 6.2 to the dollar, or
about 16 cents. On Friday, two days after the government said it
was powerless to control the crashing currency, the U.S. dollar was
close to 18 rubles in street trading.
	   Russians were worried, but there was no sign of panic or unrest.
	   Chernomyrdin warned that a quick solution to the political
crisis must be found.
	   ``It may be our last chance to build a normal economy in Russia.
Yes, our actions will be unpopular. Everyone will assail us. But
don't tie the government's hands, give us time to step back from
the precipice. That refers to everyone from the president on
down,'' he said.
	   Chernomyrdin said his economic rescue package would concentrate
on meeting unpaid wages and pensions, closing down bankrupt and
inefficient businesses, getting rid of dishonest managers and
officials, and lowering taxes. He said the government would use
hard currency reserves to back the value of the ruble.
	   ``We will have prices rising. The ruble rate will be falling.
But since every ruble will be insured by our hard currency
reserves, the rate will stabilize,'' he said.
	   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said the military wanted a quick
end to the crisis and that nobody wanted a repeat of the 1993
confrontation between Yeltsin and parliament that ended with a tank
battle in Moscow.
	   ``We expect the relevant branches of government to make
decisions as soon as possible,'' he was quoted as saying Thursday
by the Interfax news agency, in an apparent warning to lawmakers.
	   ``The armed forces are not in a festive mood,'' he added.
	   If the Duma again rejects Chernomyrdin, Yeltsin has the option
of proposing him a third time, or choosing a new candidate. If the
Duma votes no for a third time, Yeltsin can call new Duma
elections.
	   Some say Yeltsin will do just that _ forcing the legislators to
undergo elections a year earlier than scheduled. The Communists,
led by Gennady Zyuganov, are not particularly strong in the polls
at the moment, but the turmoil is likely to strengthen their
support.
	   Yeltsin moved Thursday to promote a compromise, reviving a
political deal nearly clinched last weekend, which the Communists
abandoned at the last minute.
	   According to Russian news agencies, Yeltsin made some amendments
to the document _ which proposes a reallocation of powers between
the president and parliament _ and sent it back to the Duma.
	   Some Duma members rushed to try and block any attempt by Yeltsin
to dissolve parliament by putting a motion to start impeachment
proceedings on the Duma's agenda for next week.
	   Once impeachment proceedings are under way, the Constitution
bars Yeltsin from disbanding the legislature. However, the
proceedings pose little actual threat to Yeltsin because the
procedures are lengthy and complex.
	   Russia has been operating with an interim government since
Yeltsin fired the previous prime minister on Aug. 23 and named
Chernomyrdin acting prime minister.

Japan steelmaker goes bust in biggest postwar manufacturer failure
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Toa Steel Co., a midsized affiliate of leading
Japanese steelmaker NKK Corp., has collapsed under a massive debt
load in Japan's biggest failure of a manufacturer since the end of
World War II.
	   NKK Corp., which owns a 52 percent stake in Toa, will take over
the operations of the effectively bankrupt steelmaker from next
April, NKK spokesman Ryosuke Nishiyama said Friday.
	   Toa's decision to abandon a planned restructuring underscores
the depth of the economic malaise in recession-bound Japan, where
many companies are struggling to cope with sluggish sales and huge
debt burdens.
	   ``This is just the latest shock in a long line of shocks,'' said
Russell Jones, an economist at Lehman Brothers Japan Inc., noting
that many other, similarly troubled Japanese firms could follow in
Toa's footsteps.
	   News of the collapse broke just hours after Hitachi Ltd., one of
Japan's largest electronics makers, announced plans to eliminate
4,000 jobs. The drastic cost-cutting comes in an effort to recover
from the company's first dip into the red in 50 years.
	   Hitachi reversed a previous profit forecast on Thursday, saying
it now expects to post a net loss of 250 billion yen (U.S. dlrs
1.81 billion) for the fiscal year to March, 1999.
	   On Friday, Kawasaki Steel Corp., another major steelmaker,
announced huge losses from a 100 billion yen (dlrs 739 million)
bailout for an ailing leasing affiliate.
	   Instead of showing a profit as initially expected, Kawasaki
Steel now anticipates a net loss of 61 billion yen (dlrs 45
million) for the fiscal year through March. The loss cost Kawasaki
Chairman Kenzo Monden his job. He will resign on October 1, the
company said.
	   Worry that other Japanese companies will suffer the same fate as
Toa _ or be forced to sharply cut earnings forecasts like Hitachi
and Kawasaki Steel _ weighed heavily on the Japanese stock market
in trading Friday.
	   The benchmark Nikkei 255 stock average lost 218.33 points, or
1.53 percent, to close at 14,042.91 on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
Friday.
	   Toa plans to sell off assets to help cover debts of around 250
billion yen (dlrs 1.86 billion), but parent company NKK said it
still expects to suffer 60 billion yen (dlrs 45 million) in losses
due to Toa's liquidation.
	   Investors dumped shares of NKK on Friday, sending the stock
price of Japan's second-largest steel producer tumbling 13 percent
to 98 yen (dlrs 0.72).
	   In addition to NKK, other major shareholders in Toa include
Japanese trading house Marubeni Corp., which owns 8.8 percent of
the company, and Fuji Bank Ltd., which has a 1.2 percent stake.
	   Toa's collapse comes less than a month after Mita Industrial
Co., a Japanese maker of copy machines with debts of 205 billion
yen (dlrs 1.53 billion), sought court protection from creditors.
	   Many Japanese have become especially sensitive to news of
corporate failures after the collapse of a number of financial
institutions, such as lenders and brokerage houses, over the past
two years.

McGrath out of Commonwealth Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Australian cricketer Glenn McGrath
has suffered a new injury which will keep him out of this month's
Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur and possibly the following tour
of Pakistan.
	   McGrath missed most of last season, including tours of India and
New Zealand, with a stomach injury and he strained a groin muscle
in a warm-up match Friday.
	   Australia's leading strike bowler broke down after 5.5 overs in
a match against the Australian Cricket Academy.
	   McGrath's troubles last summer started in November when scar
tissue from a hernia operation contracted and pinched a nerve. He
then suffered a stomach muscle tear.
	   Australia has brought in Queenslander Andrew Bichel for the
Games, leaving McGrath at home to try and recover in time for
Pakistan.
	   The test players leave Australia on Sept. 22 to join up with
those at the Games. Australia is in a pool with Canada, Antigua and
India for the Games' cricket competition, which starts Sept. 9.

Philippine stocks fall to new six-year low
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks plunged Friday
following Wall Street's steep overnight fall, with the main index
dropping 2.8 percent to a new six-year low.
	   The Dow Jones Industrial Average's 1.3 percent overnight loss
triggered a rush of foreign selling, traders said.
	   ``Investors continue their liquidation even for ridiculous (low)
prices. Investors feel the market has nowhere to go in the short
term,'' said Juanis Barredo, analyst for Citisecurities Inc.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 33.57 points,
or 2.8 percent, to 1,159.38. The last time the index ended below
this level was on April 13, 1992, when it closed at 1,139.665.
	   The index gave up 4.82 points on Thursday.
	   Edwin Siao, trader for institutional sales of Abacus Securities
Corp., said Wall Street's overnight loss gave foreign investors
more reason to punish Manila shares, which have already weakened
considerably in past sessions as a result of the global economic
slowdown.
	   Not even the peso's gain against the dollar Friday morning
deterred foreign selling, traders said.
	   The dollar averaged 43.355 pesos at midday, down from 43.506
pesos on Thursday, on the back of a stronger Japanese yen.
	   Traders said Standard and Poor's announcement Thursday that it
has lowered ratings for nine Philippine banks also contributed to
Friday's stock-market selldown. S and P cited deteriorating asset
quality due to the weak economy for the ratings downgrade.
	   Edison Yap, analyst for Philippine Commercial International Bank
Trust, said the S and P report confirmed fears that local banks
have been affected by the economic slowdown.
	   ``The report wasn't really a surprise,'' he said.
	   August inflation figures released Friday had little impact on
Manila shares, said Siao.
	   ``The 10.5 percent August inflation rate was on the better side
of expectations, but at this point, unless there's a big
improvement in inflation, it won't have much of an effect on market
sentiment,'' he said.
	   Inflation was 10.7 percent in July.

Philippine Muslims protest U.S. attacks on Sudan, Afghanistan

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A new Philippine Muslim group on
Monday condemned the U.S. attacks on suspected terrorist targets in
Sudan and Afghanistan in a protest outside the heavily guarded U.S.
Embassy in Manila.
	   Manila police threw a tight security net around the seaside
embassy earlier in the week after Philippine authorities were
informed of a written bomb threat found on board a plane in Kuwait.
	   U.S. officials announced the closure of the non-immigrant visa
section of the embassy on Friday and Monday, giving no specific
reason. The section is the most crowded, with people filling the
sidewalk to line up for visas.
	   About 500 members and supporters of the Philippine Muslim Task
Force Against U.S. Aggression chanted ``Allahu Akbar,'' or God is
great, as they marched to the embassy after praying at a mosque
about two kilometers (one mile) away.
	   The demonstrators, some carrying placards saying ``Clinton is a
liar'' and ``Muslims unite versus American tyranny,'' gathered in a
small park across the street from the embassy. About 50 police
formed a cordon to prevent them from approaching the embassy.
	   ``We Muslims cannot accept the reason given for the U.S. attacks
in Sudan and Afghanistan,'' said Abdul Bashed Marangid, a Muslim
cleric and a leader of the group.
	   The missile strikes were in retaliation for the bombings of U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which Washington has blamed on
Saudi Arabian millionaire Osama bin Laden.
	   Marangid, however, said no clear evidence has been presented to
show who was responsible.
	   He said his group will ask the U.N. Security Council to
investigate the U.S. missile strikes.
	   On Thursday, Kuwait's Interior Ministry said a handwritten note
warning of a bomb attack on the American embassy in Manila on
Friday was found on a plane that arrived in Kuwait from Dubai.
	   In response, Philippine police blocked off a lane of the
boulevard which passes in front of the embassy and deployed more
men, including plainclothes officers, to guard the area.
	   Before Friday's protest, photographers saw a group of police
wearing black special tactics uniforms enter a hotel in front of
the embassy, apparently to take up positions.
	   Marangid dismissed the bomb threat against the U.S. Embassy as
``a lot of bull.''
	   ``Did those who bombed the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania send
a letter before they set off the bombs?'' he asked.
	   A Muslim cleric, Aging Khan Saripada, described bin Laden as a
philanthropist and freedom fighter.
	   ``He is not a terrorist. Bill Clinton is the real terrorist,''
Aging said.

Human rights group accuses military of involvement in Indonesia

riots

<TEXT>
	   LHOKSEUMAWE, Indonesia (AP) _ A respected human rights group on
Friday accused the military of instigating riots in a northern
Indonesian town where mobs burned buildings and looted
Chinese-owned shops.
	   The military has denied accusations that it played a role in the
violence earlier this week in Lhokseumawe, suggesting instead that
Islamic separatist rebels may have been involved.
	   The unrest prompted the military to send in reinforcements,
reversing a decision to pull out some troops from troubled Aceh
province, on the northern tip of Sumatra island.
	   The scandal-tainted military, accused of atrocities there, is
taking a more conciliatory approach in order to improve its image.
	   In Jakarta, the head of the independent Commission for Missing
Persons and Victims of Violence said elements in the military may
have masterminded the riots to ensure that soldiers returned.
	   ``In our view, the riots were engineered by groups that so far
have benefited from the existence of the military operation,'' said
Munir, chief of the commission.
	   Witnesses have said vehicles arrived from outside Lhokseumawe
and dropped off rioters. Also, leaflets encouraging people to
gather during the withdrawal of 660 troops on Monday were
reportedly found. Violence erupted as the soldiers departed.
	   In a separate case, a government-sponsored team is investigating
whether elements in the military instigated deadly riots in May
that swept Jakarta and helped oust former President Suharto.
Military officials have denied involvement.
	   But accusations of links to the Lhokseumawe riots are bound to
further weaken the credibility of the military, which faces an
array of investigations into misconduct under the autocratic
Suharto.
	   Without elaborating, a group of 50 students in Lhokseumawe
issued a statement Friday that said the riots were well planned by
``certain groups.''
	   They said armed forces chief Gen. Wiranto should not use the
riots, in which two people were killed, as an excuse to abandon the
troop withdrawal policy.
	   Lt. Col. Agus Ramadhan, a regional military spokesman, has
indicated rebels may have been responsible.
	   Some protesters threw stones at the trucks of the soldiers who
departed, and later shouted separatist slogans and hoisted a rebel
banner.
	   The military is resented in Aceh, where soldiers suppressed a
rebel movement in the late 1980s and 1990s. Investigators have
found mass graves with alleged victims of the military.
	   Two people died and hundreds of ethnic Chinese fled their homes
in the Lhokseumawe riots. Reluctant to return, about 100 frightened
ethnic Chinese were staying at a nearby military base.
	   Chinese, who make up 4 percent of Indonesia's 202 million
people, dominate the economy and have been blamed for a financial
crisis that has hit millions of poor Indonesians hard. Although
President B.J. Habibie is implementing democratic reforms, there
are fears that economic turmoil will trigger more unrest.
	   In Jakarta on Friday, about 30 students protested outside
Parliament, blaming Suharto and a former Aceh governor for what
they described as ``war crimes'' in the province.

Russian ruble falls again, government backs down on bank plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QL; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The ruble tumbled again Friday and the government
tried to placate angry Russians by reversing an order to freeze
personal accounts at the country's largest retail banks.
	   The official ruble rate fell to 16.99 to the U.S. dollar, or 5.8
cents, down from 13.48 to the dollar, or 7.4 cents, on Thursday.
The street level was even lower.
	   Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said the government
would continue to let market forces determine the currency's value
_ even though it will mean higher prices.
	   When the economy stabilizes, the government will press ahead
with market reforms, he told the upper house of parliament, the
Federation Council.
	   Meanwhile, the government backed down on its hugely unpopular
plan to prevent the collapse of Russia's banking system by freezing
personal accounts at six of the country's biggest private banks,
the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The Central Bank ordered the six banks on Wednesday to close
their branches temporarily and transfer all personal accounts to
the national savings bank, Sberbank, where deposits are fully
guaranteed by the government.
	   It said depositors would regain access to their money no later
than Nov. 15, but that they could only withdraw rubles, not foreign
currency, and at the unfavorable exchange rate of 9.33 rubles to
the dollar.
	   Many Russians have both ruble and dollar accounts in commercial
banks.
	   On Friday the government said Russians could retain access to
any accounts opened before Sept. 1 at the six affected banks _
Mosbusinessbank, Inkombank, Most Bank, Menatep, SBS-Agro and
Promstroibank.
	   Details were unclear, but it appeared they would be able to
withdraw funds from both their ruble and dollar accounts.

Two politicians question Hong Kong's market intervention

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Two leading opposition leaders said Friday that
the government's recent intervention in the territory's financial
markets was damaging foreign investor confidence.
	   Lawmakers Martin Lee and Emily Lau spoke during an hour-long
conversation with current and former members of the board of
directors of The Associated Press and senior AP news executives.
The group was led by Chairman of the Board Donald E. Newhouse and
Louis D. Boccardi, AP's president and chief executive officer.
	   Lee, chairman of the Democratic Party, Hong Kong's largest, and
Lau, leader of a small populist group, the Frontier, are among the
most popular politicians here.
	   They have run afoul of Beijing leaders by often criticizing Hong
Kong and Beijing leaders and calling for more democracy in the
Chinese territory. Both have been barred from mainland China.
	   In July, U.S. President Bill Clinton met privately with Lee,
giving him the same stature as Hong Kong's Beijing-selected chief
executive, Tung Chee-hwa.
	   On Friday, Lee and Lau touched on a variety of topics, ranging
from media freedom and the post-handover leadership, to the
development of China and the future of democracy.
	   They joined a chorus of criticism that the government's recent
intervention in the stock and foreign exchange markets of Hong Kong
was eroding investors' confidence and damaging the longstanding
free-market policy of the city.
	   ``It's the most stupid thing the government has done,'' said
Lee, a renowned barrister. ``Instead of allowing the invisible hand
of the free market to operate, you have the invincible hand of the
Hong Kong government.''
	   To defend the Hong Kong currency link to the U.S. dollar, the
government last month waged a costly battle with speculators and
introduced measures to curb speculation.
	   The government spent an estimated 15 percent of the U.S. dlrs 96
billion in foreign reserves on stocks last month, and successfully
lifted share prices to levels that left speculators who had bet
against the market stuck with huge losses.
	   On Thursday, Tung Chee-hwa had told the AP group in an interview
that the government needed to intervene to protect the peg, and
would continue to do so for as long as speculators keep attacking
it.
	   On Friday, the lawmakers criticized Tung, who was selected by a
400-member committee picked by Beijing. A conservative in politics
and finance, Tung is often accused of being old-fashioned and
indecisive. His popularity has plunged with the stock and property
prices during the 14-month-old Asian financial turmoil.
	   Calling Tung ``a courteous and sincere man, but definitely a
stooge of Beijing,'' Lee said the leader is ready to appease
Chinese leaders at the expense of Hong Kong.
	   ``He's so loyal he can anticipate what the Beijing government
wants him to do, and he does it without being ordered,'' Lee said.
	   Tung told the AP executives that Hong Kong needs time to mature
politically before democratic elections.
	   On media freedom, Lau, a former journalist, said that although
officials have not clamped down on the press, the local media had
started self-censorship before the July 1, 1997, handover. She said
news executives understand ``the thing to do is not to embarrass
China.''
	   On democracy, the pair's views were grim.
	   They said whether Hong Kong ends up with full democracy depends
on the political developments in China. Under the constitution,
Hong Kong can decide on the electoral arrangements after 2007, but
they must be approved by Beijing.
	   Under a convoluted electoral system designed to guarantee
conservative businessmen and Beijing supporters a majority, only a
third of the 60-seat legislature was chosen by direct, popular vote
in May. Others were selected by small groups of professionals,
business groups and labor unions.
	   Pro-democracy candidates garnered two-thirds of the vote, but
won only a third of the seats.
	   Tung reiterated Thursday that Hong Kong needs time to mature
politically before it can have a legislature with every member
elected democratically.

Human rights group urges Indonesia to scrap repressive laws
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Many repressive laws implemented under
former President Suharto remain even though the new government has
pledged democratic reform, a human rights group said Friday.
	   In a report, New York-based Human Rights Watch warned that
Indonesia's reform effort could unravel if authorities fail to
institute legal protections for basic rights.
	   President B.J. Habibie, once a protege of the autocratic
Suharto, has overseen big changes since the former army general
quit in May following riots and student protests.
	   Habibie has freed some political prisoners, allowed trade unions
and political parties to form and scheduled general elections next
year.
	   However, Human Rights Watch warned that laws often used by
Suharto to silence dissidents remain in place, including laws
against subversion, spreading hatred toward the government and
insulting the head of state.
	   The group acknowledged that many Suharto-era laws are not
enforced, such as a ban on autonomous student organizations and the
freedom of students to express political views on campus.
	   It urged the government to repeal ministerial decrees that allow
those laws to exist, arguing they should be scrapped to prevent the
possibility of future use.
	   A handful of previously banned books have been allowed to
circulate by the government. But Human Rights Watch said hundreds
of other works are still banned and rules giving the government
broad power to censor books and other printed materials remain in
place.

King doubts talks will resolve Cambodian political crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk expressed
doubt Friday that crisis talks he will lead between Cambodia's
rival political parties will bring an end to the current round of
turmoil.
	   Meanwhile, protests by thousands of people continued for the
12th day against strongman Hun Sen. They accuse him of using fraud
to win parliamentary elections July 26 and have demanded his
ouster.
	   Sihanouk, who received Hun Sen at his palace Thursday in the
northern town of Siem Reap, site of the ancient Angkor monuments,
is to chair a meeting starting Saturday between the three main
parties to end the political deadlock.
	   Hun Sen has said he will attend personally, but his opponents
plan to send lower-level representatives.
	   ``I do not have much hope that the three-day meeting will have
the positive result that I want,'' Sihanouk, 75, said in a
statement released by the palace.
	   ``The parties have deep conflicts with each other and have not
yet agreed to make any concessions or compromises,'' the king said.
	   Hun Sen has been declared the election victor, but the
opposition parties led by Sihanouk's son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh,
and his ally, Sam Rainsy, allege that hundreds of irregularities
were committed.
	   The Hun Sen-controlled electoral authorities have rejected all
their complaints, and thousands of opposition supporters have taken
to the streets in protest, marching Friday on foreign embassies. No
violence was reported.
	   The weekend talks are expected to revolve around technical
issues, mainly the appellate process that the opposition says was
biased in favor of Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party.
	   The CPP won 64 of the 122 National Assembly seats, a slight
majority but short of the two-thirds needed to form a government
alone. Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have refused to lend their vital
support when the assembly convenes for the first time Sept. 24.
	   Hun Sen received a major boost Friday when the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations endorsed the election results.
	   ASEAN postponed Cambodia's membership last year after Hun Sen
deposed Ranariddh in a bloody coup, and the elections were seen as
a major step toward restoring international legitimacy.
	   ASEAN urged Cambodia's political leaders to peacefully resolve
their differences.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The daughter of a wealthy Milan businessman was
freed by her kidnappers early Friday, nine months after she was
abducted outside her apartment.
	   Alessandra Sgarella, 40, was picked up by police in the small
town of Moschitti di Locri, in the southern region of Calabria.
Italian news reports said she was dropped off in the town at about
1:30 p.m. and then knocked on the door of the nearest home to call
police.
	   Sgarella, who is currently being questioned by investigators, is
said to be in good health.
	   Her captors had initially demanded a ransom of 50 billion lire
(dlrs 28 million), the highest known in Italy, but it was unclear
whether anything had been paid to secure her release.
	   Under a controversial law aimed at stemming the number of
kidnappings, the assets of victims and their families are frozen to
prevent them from paying ransom demands. Milan anti-Mafia
prosecutor Alberto Nobili said no ransom had been paid.
	   Sgarella's relatives, however, had apparently tried to negotiate
with the kidnappers to lower the sum through ads in the Corriere
della Sera daily.
	   In June, police arrested seven members of a Calabrian crime
organization known as the Anonima (Anonymous), suspected of
planning the kidnapping.
	   Sgarella was abducted Dec. 11 when she returned home after work.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Groom Glenn Emerton watched wide-eyed
as wife-to-be Leif Bunyan walked towards him in her ice blue dress.
She had that wedding day glow, but he couldn't have known. He had
never seen her before.
	   ``God, she's beautiful,'' Emerton declared to nobody in
particular.
	   Emerton, 24, and Bunyan, 22, were introduced at the altar in
front of 350 people Friday, courtesy of a seven-week promotion for
a local radio station.
	   The only contact between them before they exchanged vows was
when Emerton popped the question by telephone.
	   The proposal and ceremony were broadcast live on 2Day FM, but
there was one big setback for the promotion. Under Australian law,
marriages have to be registered a month in advance except in
special circumstances, so the couple had to settle for a
``committment ceremony.''
	   ``That is a little disappointing, but we knew it would probably
be the case,'' said station spokeswoman Michelle Christison. ``They
had a commitment ceremony today and have planned a private ceremony
with their families to sign the marriage certificate after they
come back from their honeymoon.''
	   The radio station paid for the wedding, a one-week honeymoon in
Paris and urged listeners to send the couple some wedding presents.
After that they're on their own.
	   The promotion was launched because many young Sydneysiders have
been complaining about the difficulty meeting available members of
the opposite sex. In Sydney the common refrain from many women is
that the young men are ``either married or gay.''
	   Emerton and Bunyan were found after several hundred listeners
applied to be considered for the wedding. The men's short list was
cut to five and the women's nine. The shortlisted candidates who
missed out were also present at Friday's ceremony.
	   The lucky pair kissed enthusiastically and seemed pleased with
each other.
	   ``I couldn't have picked a better bride myself,'' Emerton said.
``I had a sort of a picture of her (in my mind) but she's even
better than what I thought, her personality's just so nice.''
	   Bunyan said: ``I think he's lovely. He's got a really lovely
heart, beautiful eyes and a great big smile and he seems
wonderful.''
	   The ceremony drew criticism from the Catholic Church. Father
Brian Lucas branded it an arranged marriage that did little credit
to its promoters and participants.
	   Station announcer Wendy Harmer dismissed the criticism.
	   ``The Catholic Church said there's no place in society for
arranged marriages,'' Harmer said. ``These are also the same people
who say there's no place in modern society for contraception.''

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's ousted deputy prime
minister told supporters during Friday prayers that he not only
expected to be arrested, but that ``there will be hundreds who will
follow me.''
	   Anwar Ibrahim, stripped from his deputy and finance minister
posts on Wednesday, told some 2,000 worshipers at his neighborhood
mosque that he would demand justice against allegations of sexual
misconduct and leaking state secrets.
	   ``True power is with those who are brave enough to demand the
right for reform and change,'' Anwar said. ``Remember, man can
plan, but God also has his plans.''
	   Anwar was expelled from the ruling United Malays National
Organization Thursday, after months of bitter differences over
economic policy with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Anwar, 51, lashed out at the 72-year-old Mahathir, who has led
the Southeast Asian nation for 17 years.
	   ``For how long do you want power? Do you want to run with a
walking stick?'' Anwar said. ``How much longer do you want to
monopolize wealth? How much longer do you want to cheat the
people?''
	   Anwar for years was seen as Mahathir's heir to the prime
minister's post. Many believed he would be given the nod from his
one-time mentor during next year's UMNO elections.
	   But now, the conservative Muslim who once spearheaded the drive
for stronger Islamic influence over the secular government, has
been accused of having sexual trysts and of leaking state secrets.
	   In an affidavit filed in High Court on Wednesday, Malaysia's
Inspector General of Police Rahim Noor said Anwar was under
investigation on charges contained in a book that has widespread
allegations about sexual misconduct.
	   On Thursday, Rahim filed an affidavit at the High Court in the
case of S. Nallakaruppan, who has been detained on weapons charges.
Nalla, as he is known, is Anwar's tennis partner and in the book is
alleged to have arranged the ousted minister's sexual trysts.
	   In the document, Rahim said that Nalla was ``believed to have
access to national secrets through Anwar and he likely could leak
these national secrets.''
	   The affidavit said that Nalla and Anwar could face charges under
the Internal Security Act and the Official Secrets Act.
	   Anwar said that if he were arrested under the country's Internal
Security Act, which allows for detention without trial, ``there
will be hundreds who will follow me.''
	   Mahathir, who made his first public comments after Anwar was
ousted from UMNO, told reporters he was ``saddened'' by events.
	   ``I wish it hadn't happened, not at this point,'' he said. ``But
these things have gone out of my control.''
	   Mahathir said he would serve as acting finance minister for now
and wait until next year's UMNO party elections before appointing a
new deputy.
	   Anwar had been left out of economic decisions for months after
differing with his boss on the course for economic recovery.
	   Malaysia's currency, the ringgit, and the markets have plummeted
since the Asian economic crisis broke out in July 1997. The
country's economy, which boasted 8 percent growth for the last
decade, formally went into recession last week after its economy
shrank another 6.8 percent.

Exodus of Gypsies to Britain increases
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREA LORINCZOVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ The exodus of Gypsies from eastern
Slovakia is increasing, Slovak newspapers reported Friday, with
1,256 members of the minority applying for asylum in Britain.
	   Most are from the area near Michalovce, a town of 114,000
inhabitants. They complain of discrimination and problems finding
work in a country with a 14.1 percent unemployment rate.
	   ``About 70 to 80 families left Michalovce region,'' said
Jaroslav Ferenc, chairman of the regional Gypsy organization, ROI.
``There are others who have already prepared their airplane tickets
and are ready to go next week. They are leaving because they are
discriminated against. How can a Gypsy get a job here?''
	   Gypsies, known here as Romanies, make up a great part of the
long term unemployed. But local authorities claim the problem is
due to the country's sluggish economy rather than discrimination.
	   ``Both Romanies and non-Romanies are unemployed,'' Milan
Matejovic, a local official in Michalovce, said Friday.
	   Ferenc said Slovak Gypsies who migrate to Britain ``have nice
apartments and a reasonable social support.''
	   Since many of the area's Gypsies are poor, Michalovce
authorities build a public housing project. But the apartments were
too small for Gyspies, who often have larger families than other
Slovaks.
	   Matejovic said British authorities should warn Gyspies that
conditions in Britain, although better than here, do not measure up
to what many of the Gyspies expect.
	   ``They go there with the vision of a land of milk and honey,''
he said.
	   Britain became a popular destination after Britain granted
asylum to six Gypsies in April. A Foreign Ministry official said
immigration counselors were coaching Slovak Gyspies about how to
dress and talk with British officials when they interview them for
resettlement.
	   Gypsies settled in eastern Europe in the 13th Century. They are
nomadic people with a distinct language and ancient folklore and
are found mostly in Spain, Hungary, Slovakia and the Balkans.

Philippine inflation dips on slower growth in food prices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Declining growth in food prices
curbed inflation slightly in the Philippines in August, and
economists predict that more stable consumer prices over the rest
of the year would lead to a further softening of interest rates.
	   The government announced Friday that the consumer price index
rose 10.5 percent in August from a year earlier and 0.5 percent
from the previous month. It also revised its figure for inflation
in July to 10.7 percent from the previous 10.6 percent.
	   This brings inflation in the first eight months of 1998 to an
average 9.3 percent, well within the government's target of 9.5
percent to 10 percent for the year.
	   The August inflation data reflects slower growth in food prices,
which make up about half of the consumer price index. Food costs
have risen steadily over the past several months because of a
severe drought attributed to the El Nino weather phenomenon.
	   Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu welcomed the inflation figure
and said it indicates inflation has stabilized, which should
favorably affect interest rates.
	   Asia's regional currency crisis unleashed a long spell of high
interest rates and a credit crunch that caused hard times for many
businesses.
	   But measures adopted by the government and central bank over the
past several months have reduced interest rates, and economists
believe there is scope for further declines.
	   Economists expect inflation will remain stable in the coming
months, possibly even tapering off, assuming that the food supply
isn't hard hit by expected heavy rainfall beginning in October.
	   Teresa Taningco, chief economist at Banco Santander's Philippine
branch, noted that the government is prepared to import food,
particularly rice and corn, in the event heavy rainfall causes
floods that damage crops.
	   Edison Yap, an investment analyst at PCI Bank Trust, said that
maintaining a manageable inflation rate will help relieve pressures
on the Philippine central bank to defend the peso, which remains
susceptible to regional developments.
	   Since the start of the year, the central bank has been defending
the peso chiefly by raising its overnight borrowing rate, its main
tool in controlling domestic funds that could be used to speculate
against the peso.
	   The overnight borrowing rate is currently 16 percent, up from 13
percent before the peso hit a seven-month low of 44.79 pesos
against the dollar on Aug. 10.
	   The peso has lost nearly 40 percent of its value since the start
of the regional financial crisis in July 1997.
	   Although encouraged by the lower-than-expected inflation rate
for August, Audi Pantillano, an economist at Securities 2000 Inc.,
said investors cannot be expected as a result to give the
Philippines a second look.
	   ``These are just a few bright spots in an otherwise bearish
financial market,'' he said, noting that neither the foreign
exchange nor equities markets were affected by the release of the
inflation data.
	   He said regional developments continue to weigh on investment
sentiment for the Philippines, and this is likely to continue well
into the next year.

Gunfire breaks out outside Lesotho palace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Police opened fire on protesters outside
the royal palace of this tiny mountain kingdom, killing one person
and injuring 12, a news agency said Friday.
	   Police let loose with volleys of bullets when shots came from
the crowd of about 500 people, the South African Press Association
quoted an unnamed diplomat as saying.
	   Supporters of the three main opposition parties have regularly
protested outside the palace of King Letsie III since Aug. 4,
claiming the May election was rigged in favor of the ruling Lesotho
Congress for Democracy, which won 79 of 80 seats in the National
Assembly.
	   Surrounded by South Africa, Lesotho is a nation of 2 million
that has long been plagued by political upheaval.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin called
Friday for ``economic dictatorship'' to end Russia's crisis and
preserve market reforms as the hard-line opposition said it would
again block his confirmation.
	   Outlining plans to stem the country's economic crisis,
Chernomyrdin said the government would allow the ruble to float
freely, allowing market forces to determine its value. He also said
the government would press ahead with market reforms as soon as the
situation was stabilized.
	   ``Starting in January the government will introduce an economic
dictatorship _ enterprises will be put in the conditions under
which they will not be able to fail under their obligations,'' he
told the Federation Council, the upper chamber of Parliament.
	   Russia has been plunged into crisis by the collapse of the ruble
and a power struggle between the Communist-dominated Duma, or lower
chamber of parliament, and President Boris Yeltsin.
	   The Duma was to vote for a second time Friday on whether to
confirm Chernomyrdin as premier, after rejecting him on Monday. His
approval could ease the political instability reigning over Russia,
though it would not end the nation's economic distress.
	   The opposition says it will never approve Chernomyrdin, accusing
him of creating many of the current problems during his previous
five years in the job. Yeltsin has said he will accept no one else.
	   Just last month, the ruble was trading at 6.2 to the dollar, or
about 16 cents. On Friday, two days after the government said it
was powerless to control the crashing currency, the U.S. dollar was
close to 18 rubles in street trading.
	   Russians were worried, but there was no sign of panic or unrest.
	   Chernomyrdin warned that a quick solution to the political
crisis must be found.
	   ``It may be our last chance to build a normal economy in Russia.
Yes, our actions will be unpopular. Everyone will assail us. But
don't tie the government's hands, give us time to step back from
the precipice. That refers to everyone from the president on
down,'' he said.
	   Chernomyrdin said his economic rescue package would concentrate
on meeting unpaid wages and pensions, closing down bankrupt and
inefficient businesses, getting rid of dishonest managers and
officials, and lowering taxes. He said the government would use
hard currency reserves to back the value of the ruble.
	   ``We will have prices rising. The ruble rate will be falling.
But since every ruble will be insured by our hard currency
reserves, the rate will stabilize,'' he said.
	   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said the military wanted a quick
end to the crisis and that nobody wanted a repeat of the 1993
confrontation between Yeltsin and parliament that ended with a tank
battle in Moscow.
	   ``We expect the relevant branches of government to make
decisions as soon as possible,'' he was quoted as saying Thursday
by the Interfax news agency, in an apparent warning to lawmakers.
	   ``The armed forces are not in a festive mood,'' he added.
	   The Defense Ministry issued a statement Friday denying that
troops were being moved in to Moscow because of the political
situation.

	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ A U.N. tribunal, in the world's first
sentence for genocide, Friday ordered an ex-prime minister to serve
life in prison for the savage slaughter of more than 500,000
Rwandans in 1994.
	   Jean Kambanda, the highest-ranking former political leader in
the tribunal's custody, pleaded guilty on May 1 to six counts of
genocide and crimes against humanity, including responsibility for
the murder and extermination of civilians. He was the first person
to accept culpability for genocide before an international court.

United States warns North Korea against further military tests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES that Japan would use defensive strike only if
attacked first; UPDATES with US warning North over tests &QL; 
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The United States considers North Korea's missile
test over Japan earlier this week a serious threat to Japan's
security and has warned the North against carrying out any further
tests, a senior official said Friday.
	   North Korea test fired a Taepo Dong 1 ballistic missile on
Monday that flew across northern Japan and crashed into the Pacific
Ocean. The first stage, or booster, landed in the Sea of Japan.
	   The firing was a threat to Japan's national security and the
United States would work with its Asian ally to formulate a
response to that threat, a senior U.S. Defense Official said during
a trip to Japan Friday.
	   One measure would likely be an agreement by Japan to join the
United States in developing a ballistic missile defense system,
said the official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.
	   Also on Friday, Japan's defense chief was quoted as saying Japan
would not rule out a military strike against North Korean bases if
it were under attack by the communist country.
	   In response to a reporter's question, Fukushiro Nukaga, director
general of the Defense Agency, said a government understanding
dating from 1956 permits Japan to carry out such an attack in
self-defense, but only as a last resort, if it were under attack,
Kyodo News reported.
	   Japan has long been wary of its communist neighbor and the
missile test greatly increased fears here about the possibility,
however remote, of an attack on Japan.
	   On Thursday, Japan placed its forces on increased alert when
signs emerged that North Korea could be preparing for another test.
	   The U.S. defense official refused to say whether a second
missile launch was expected.
	   Monday's launch was the first test for the Taepo Dong 1, a
missile capable of striking any part of Japan, including U.S.
military bases that are home to some 50,000 American troops.
	   The motives for the launch _ like many of the actions of the
seclusive North Korean government _ were largely a mystery, the
defense official said.

South Africa gives warm welcome to Castro
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Cuban President Fidel Castro
received full honors when he arrived for a state visit Friday that
included an address to Parliament.
	   Castro stepped fresh off a world stage, coming from the summit
of developing nations held in the Indian Ocean city of Durban. The
Nonaligned Movement meeting ended Thursday.
	   At the summit, the Communist leader defended the movement as
still relevant -- despite its formation as a counterweight to the
Cold War superpowers.
	   ``There is no need for the Movement to apologize or ask for
anyone's permission to exist and to go on fighting,'' Castro said
in a speech Thursday.
	   South African Communist Party and union members stood at the
Tuynhuys presidential offices to welcome Castro, who inspected an
honor guard as President Nelson Mandela and senior Cabinet
ministers watched. The two men at the summit warmly embraced.
	   A band played the Cuban national anthem, and a 21-gun salute was
fired. Mandela planned a state banquet for Castro Friday evening.

<TEXT>
	   Jean Kambanda was ordered to stand and gazed directly at Chief
Judge Laity Kama of Senegal as he issued his verdict.
	   Sighs of relief rippled through the audience of many Rwandan
survivors of the genocide.
	   ``Jean Kambanda abused his authority and the trust of the
population,'' Kama said. ``Nor has he expressed contrition, regret,
or sympathy for the victims in Rwanda even when given the
opportunity.''
	   The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda said the
sentencing of Kambanda, 42, was the first for the crime of genocide
by an international court.
	   All those accused in the post-World War II Nuremberg trials
pleaded innocent to charges including murder and extermination. The
trials pre-dated the creation of the crime of genocide 50 years
ago.
	   On Thursday, the defense asked for a sentence of two years or
nothing at all for Kambanda, contending he was merely a puppet
manipulated by a powerful and evil military.
	   The prosecution countered that Kambanda merits life
imprisonment, even though he pleaded guilty and recorded 90 hours
of testimony incriminating other alleged ringleaders of the
genocide.
	   Deputy Prosecutor Bernard Muna argued that no amount of evidence
against others could offset such wrongdoing. Kambanda is accused of
inciting massacres, ordering roadblocks to help round up of Tutsis,
and distributing weapons for the slaughter as his hard-line Hutu
government presided over the bloodbath.
	   More than 500,000 Rwandans, mostly minority Tutsis but also
moderate Hutus, were butchered with machetes and nail-studded clubs
in the carefully orchestrated genocide.
	   The killing that began April 7, 1994, the day after President
Juvenal Habyarimana plane's was shot down, ended 90 days later when
Tutsi rebels took power.

	   Many Rwandans were disappointed that Kambanda failed to

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ A tornado ripped through several
flooded villages in northern Bangladesh, injuring at least 50
people and leaving about 1,000 others homeless, delayed news
reports said Friday.
	   Wednesday's 20-minute tornado leveled hundreds of mud-and-thatch
huts in Kurigram district, one of the hardest-hit areas, 150 miles
(240 kilometers) north of Dhaka, the capital.
	   None of the injuries was life-threatening, Dhaka's Bhorer Kagaj
newspaper reported.
	   Another tornado had hit eastern Bangladesh last week, injuring
50 people.
	   Deadly floods ravaging the country for two months have killed
700 people and marooned or displaced 30 million others in
two-thirds of Bangladesh, one of the world's largest delta.

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ A U.N. tribunal, in the world's first
sentence for genocide, Friday ordered an ex-prime minister to serve
life in prison for the savage slaughter of more than 500,000
Rwandans in 1994.
	   Jean Kambanda, the highest-ranking former political leader in
the tribunal's custody, pleaded guilty on May 1 to six counts of
genocide and crimes against humanity, including responsibility for
the murder and extermination of civilians. As the first person to
accept culpability for genocide before an international court,
Kambanda had sought a lenient sentence.
	   Kambanda was ordered to stand and gazed without expression at
Chief Judge Laity Kama as the judge announced the sentence.
	   Sighs of relief rippled through the audience, filled with
Rwandan survivors of the genocide.
	   ``Jean Kambanda abused his authority and the trust of the
population,'' Kama said. ``Nor has he expressed contrition, regret,
or sympathy for the victims in Rwanda even when given the
opportunity.''
	   The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda said the

	   ``Justice has been done by imprisoning Mr. Kambanda,'' said
Rwandan ambassador to Tanzania Joy Makanyange outside the
courtroom. ``This is a historic event.''

firing squads executed 22 people convicted of genocide, the first

	   Officials in Rwanda, where an estimated 130,000 people are in
prison awaiting trial for genocide crimes, say at least 10,000
people have pleaded guilty to genocide charges against them as part
of a plea-bargain program aimed at clearing out swamped courts and
prisons.
	   Under Rwandan law, however, those categorized as leaders of the
genocide cannot receive leniency in exchange for confessions.
	   Rwanda's genocide courts, which have been criticized by
international organizations for being too swift in rendering
judgements, have tried more than 500 suspects and condemned at
least 116 to death since trials began in Dec. 1996.
	   Although the indictment said Kambanda controlled the government
ministers and military officers who were carrying out the killings,
defense lawyer Oliver Michael Inglis had characterized him as a

Singapore imposes AIDS checks for foreign workers, students
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURINDA KEYS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Parliament passed a law Friday requiring all
foreign workers, from bricklayers to bank executives, to take
medical exams showing they are free of AIDS or other diseases.
	   Foreign students and relatives of foreign residents visiting for
long periods of time will also face the requirement.
	   The new law was included in an Immigration Amendment Bill that
also increased punishments for illegal aliens and smugglers as part
of a government campaign to ``to keep Singapore safe and secure.''
	   Foreigners already in Singapore will be immediately subject to
the law, which takes effect when it is printed in the Government
Gazette, which is due out in a couple of weeks. The medical exam
will cover not only all infectious diseases, but ``other medical
conditions, such as mental illness, insofar as a foreigner may be a
danger to society as a result of his medical condition,'' Home
Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng said in introducing the bill.
	   Tourists, or people in transit through Singapore for short
periods of time such as business conferences, would not be
subjected to the tests, Wong said. Parliament passed the bill by a
unanimous vote.
	   Wong said that since 1993, more than 2,000 foreigners living and
working in Singapore have been found to be carrying HIV, the virus
that causes AIDS.
	   Those who refuse to take the tests face a fine of 2,000
Singapore dollars (dlrs 1136), six months in prison, and
deportation.
	   Another change brought by the bill is that boat operators who
smuggle in illegal aliens, and those who attempt to enter the
country illegally will now receive three strokes of the cane.
Before, only individuals who succeeded in entering illegally were
liable to be caned.
	   ``There is no reason to treat an unsuccessful attempt more
leniently than a successful one,'' Wong said.

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Amsterdam became the only European
capital without CNN on Friday after the news channel refused to pay
what it called an exorbitant fee, prompting the city's cable TV
agency to pull the plug.
	   CNN International faded to black at midnight Thursday, replaced
by a message from cable agency A2000 apologizing to viewers but
saying the American broadcaster gave it no choice.
	   CNN eventually will be replaced by BBC World, Dutch media
reported Friday.
	   The switchoff ended a bitter standoff between Turner
Broadcasting System Europe, which operates CNN, and A2000, which
demanded a 725,000 guilder (dlrs 362,500) annual fee for CNN to air
its round-the-clock programming in the Amsterdam area.
	   TBS executives argued that the fee was far more expensive than
anything it had to pay in other cities. A2000 defended its charges,
saying it helped keep cable TV subscriptions low in Amsterdam.
	   A consumer watchdog group intervened last week and brokered
talks between the two sides, but neither side was willing to budge.
	   Thousands of irate viewers have been calling A2000 to complain
about the loss of CNN, which is hugely popular among the Dutch and
widely watched by visiting businessmen and diplomats. CNN is still
available via satellite, but relatively few Dutch have the dishes
and decoders needed to watch it that way.
	   Hotels in and around the capital have said they'll install
rooftop dishes to ensure their guests still have access to CNN.
	   Other channels already have pulled out of Amsterdam in protest
over the fee, including MTV Europe, Eurosport and The Discovery
Channel.

Philippine finance secretary predicts slower economic growth
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu
said Friday he expects the Philippines' gross national product will
expand 1.5 percent this year, indicating a further slowing of the
country's economy.
	   Officially, the government continues to target an economic
growth rate of between 2 percent and 3 percent this year, but many
economists have been skeptical that even the low end of the target
can be reached.
	   The present target was a downward revision of an original goal
for the GNP to expand by between 3 percent and 4 percent this year.
But economic growth has slowed as a result of Asia's financial
crisis, which pushed interest rates higher, and because of a severe
drought which lowered agricultural production.
	   The government's growth target remains a sticking point with the
International Monetary Fund. An IMF mission is in the Philippines
to review recent economic developments and to set economic targets
under the terms of a dlrs 1.4 billion IMF precautionary loan
arrangement.
	   Espiritu acknowledged that no agreement has been reached with
the IMF on some economic targets, including the growth goals.
	   Last month, the IMF's Manila representative said the Philippines
would be ``lucky'' to achieve growth of 1 percent this year, a
comment that so annoyed the central bank that it publicly censured
the IMF official.
	   As matters stand, it appears that the Philippine economy will at
least grow this year, a marked contrast with the shrinking
economies of most other crisis-hit Southeast Asian countries.

Taiwan moves to prevent speculative attacks by Soros
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan moved on Friday to bar any illegal
trading of funds managed by U.S. financier George Soros, after
dealers blamed those funds for the local stock market's recent
plunges.
	   Prosecutor Hsueh Wei-ping said a task force was formed to look
into the Soros-managed funds' sales or trading in Taiwanese markets
by proxy accounts.
	   Taiwan has not approved any local sales of Soros funds for fear
the international hedge speculator could use the money raised to
make attacks on Taiwanese financial markets.
	   But newspapers quoted unidentified officials as saying at least
six local securities firms are selling those funds on proxy
accounts.
	   The United Daily News said a stock analyst had gone on a
television program to promote a Soros-managed fund.
	   The Securities and Futures Commission said securities firms risk
having their licenses revoked for selling the unauthorized funds
and the dealers could face up to two years in prison.
	   The Taiwan stock index had shed 1.3 percent in the first four
trading days this week before recovering partially Friday after the
government announced measures to boost the market. Dealers blamed
the plunges in part on Soros funds dumping high-tech shares.

Heavy fighting north of beleaguered capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Fighter jets screamed out of the
combined military and civilian airport toward a battlefield north
of Kabul Friday following a night-long artillery duel between the
Taliban army and its opponents, said eyewitnesses.
	   But no ground was lost or gained in the fighting, said Mullah
Abdul Shabir, a Taliban soldier at the front line, some 40
kilometers (24 miles) north of the beleaguered Afghan capital.
	   Throughout the morning Friday, Taliban fighter jets took off
from the airport, while opposition rockets slammed into the area in
an apparent attempt to stop the aircraft.
	   There were no reports from the Taliban authorities at the
airport that the rockets had caused any damage.
	   The Taliban and its northern-based enemies are fighting on
several fronts, although the Taliban army has made significant
progress in recent weeks.
	   The Taliban now controls roughly 90 percent of the country and
its opponents, a collection of small parties representing minority
ethnic groups, control the remaining 10 per cent.
	   In recent days there have been reports, including one from
Amnesty International, of mass killings of civilians in northern
Afghanistan by the Taliban army as they march through opposition
territory.
	   The Taliban has denied the charges accusing its opponents of
waging a propaganda campaign against the religious militia.
	   Last year when the Taliban army was pushed out of northern
Afghanistan by the anti-Taliban alliance there were similar reports
of mass killing of Taliban prisoners. United Nations officials also
found evidence of mass executions of Taliban prisoners by their
enemies.
	   So far it has been impossible for independent investigators to
reach northern areas newly captured by the Taliban to probe the
claims of mass killings by the Taliban army.
	   Meanwhile, Iran also has laid charges against the Taliban,
accusing the religious army of illegally detaining its nationals,
who were in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif when the
Taliban took control in early August.
	   On Thursday the Taliban released five Iranians, although there
are reportedly as many as 65 Iranians still being detained. Iran
says the Taliban also is holding 11 of its diplomats and a
journalist with the state-run news agency, a charge the Taliban
denies. There were other reports that the Iranian diplomats were
killed.
	   In retaliation for the capture of its nationals, Iran launched a
large military exercise earlier this week on its border with
Afghanistan. About 70,000 elite Iranian soldiers are taking part in
the exercise.

Arafat says progress unlikely as U.S. envoy heads to region
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) - As Washington resumed Mideast
mediation efforts, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Friday
that a deal on an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank was not
close at hand.
	   Israeli officials have said the gaps between the two sides have
narrowed, but Arafat said little progress has been made.
	   ``Actually, they (Israelis) are saying so but the gaps are still
wide,'' Arafat told reporters in Gaza City after returning from a
visit in South Africa.
	   U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross plans to arrive in the region
next week to try and wrap up a deal. On the table is an American
proposal for an Israeli withdrawal from 13 percent of the West
Bank, to be met by a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Asked whether he believed Ross would be able to persuade Israel
to agree to the U.S. initiative, Arafat said: ``I don't think so.''
	   ``This is not the first time that Ross is coming here,'' Arafat
said.
	   White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Ross would meet with
Netanyahu and Arafat early next week ``on the chances of the
parties reaching agreement on the basis of the U.S. initiative.''
	   Israel originally rejected the U.S. initiative but recently
softened its position, saying it was ready to hand over 10 percent
in full and another 3 percent with some conditions.
	   If the Ross visit proves successful, Clinton might try to
arrange a meeting with Netanyahu and Arafat around Sept. 23, when
both leaders are in New York for the U.N. General Assembly, Israel
media reported.
	   The United States put its mediation attempts on hold several
weeks ago and asked the sides to work out a deal themselves.
	   Clinton decided to send Ross to the region after talking
Wednesday by phone to Arafat and Netanyahu who both requested the
envoy's visit.
	   The U.S. president expressed dissatisfaction with Netanyahu, a
senior U.S. official told reporters traveling in Ireland with
Clinton.
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Clinton
later called Arafat, who was attending a conference in South
Africa. He offered no description of the conversation.

	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ A U.N. tribunal, in the world's first
sentence for genocide, Friday ordered an ex-prime minister to serve
life in prison for the savage slaughter of more than 500,000
Rwandans in 1994.
	   Jean Kambanda, the highest-ranking former political leader in
the tribunal's custody, pleaded guilty on May 1 to six counts of
genocide and crimes against humanity, including responsibility for
the murder and extermination of civilians. As the first person to
accept culpability for genocide before an international court,
Kambanda had sought a lenient sentence.
	   Kambanda was ordered to stand and gazed without expression at
Chief Judge Laity Kama of Senegal as the judge announced the
sentence.

Authorities close roads to university campus in Yangon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military government closed all
roads leading to a university campus in Yangon after students began
chanting and demanding examinations be delayed.
	   Roads to the Hlaing campus of the Yangon Institute of Technology
were sealed off Thursday evening and remained closed Friday.
However, no heavy security presence was visible.
	   The military government is extremely wary of any activism on the
part of students, as they have historically played pivotal roles in
Myanmar's political movements.
	   From outside the campus grounds, students could be heard
shouting and chanting Thursday evening. It is not known how many
students were protesting inside as access was not allowed.
	   The main demands concern what students see as problems relating
to their studies, though some have also called for an end to
military rule and convening of the parliament elected in 1990.
	   The political party of Nobel Peace Prize-winner Aung San Suu Kyi
won 82 percent of the seats in that assembly, but the military
refused to honor the result.
	   Suu Kyi and her colleagues have vowed they will convene
parliament sometime during September. The government has threatened
to arrest the opposition leaders and ban her party if they try.
	   Hundreds of students have demonstrated publicly at least three
times during the past two weeks, the first public protests in
Yangon in almost two years.
	   Students last demonstrated in December 1996. The military put
down the protests without excessive force, but sentenced dozens of
students to long prison terms. Universities have been shut since.
	   Some were reopened within the last few months so students could
prepare for and take long-delayed exams. Examinations are scheduled
for Monday, and students at the Hlaing campus said they wanted them
delayed.
	   They said they were given a seven-day crash course covering the
last two school years' curriculum, and that simply was not enough.
	   Students at Yangon Institute of Technology were also protesting
a government plan to break up the university into several smaller
campuses in far-flung locations.
	   Students in Myanmar, also known as Burma, have historically been
at the forefront of movements aimed at gaining independence or
democracy.
	   When the military took control of the country in 1962, one of
its first acts was to blow up the students union building at Yangon
University.
	   Students also led the early stages of the nationwide democracy
uprising in 1988. The military government gunned down thousands of
unarmed protesters.

	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Moody's Investors Service may downgrade
the credit ratings of China and Hong Kong, citing Chinese export
weakness and worries about Hong Kong's financial markets.
	   The credit-rating agency said Friday it also was considering
downgrading the ratings of four major Chinese state-owned banks.
	   A downgrade could raise the cost of borrowing for the Chinese
government and banks and make foreign investors more reluctant to
put money into a country where many already are unhappy with low
profits.
	   Even though the former British colony of Hong Kong maintains its
own currency, China's difficulties are also being considered as
part of the territory's review because of its extensive trade ties
with the mainland.
	   While China has avoided a direct hit from the economic turmoil
sweeping Asia, its own problems are increasing, a point noted by
Moody's.
	   Moody's said the outlook for Hong Kong was hurt by concern that
the Chinese yuan currency would be devalued. China has repeatedly
promised not to devalue the yuan, but Moody's said it was looking
closely at how concern over that possibility has affected Hong Kong
financial markets.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The weak yen and Japan's sluggish economy took a
toll on sales of imported automobiles, pushing them down 23 percent
in August from a year earlier to 16,588, an industry group said
Friday.
	   Sales of imported cars, buses, and trucks fell for the 17th
straight month in August, the Japan Automobile Importers
Association said.
	   Foreign car makers have been hit hard in Japan, which is
struggling through its worst recession in decades. A drop in the
yen against the dollar has made an already tough market even more
difficult for foreign automakers by raising the price of imported
vehicles.
	   Sales of imported passenger cars fell 20.2 percent in August to
15,907 while sales of trucks sank 58.1 percent to 678, the group
said.
	   As a group, U.S. carmakers suffered the biggest decline, with a
drop of 44.5 percent to 2,590 autos.
	   Among U.S. manufacturers, only General Motors sold more cars on
the month. GM sold 1,026 cars in Japan in August, 1.3 percent more
than a year before.
	   German automakers, which accounted for more than half of Japan's
imports, saw their sales slip 14.4 percent to 9,344 automobiles.
	    &UR; _____
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Handing out their latest no-confidence votes in
Japan's economy, two credit agencies said they are considering
downgrading two more Japanese blue chip companies.
	   Standard and Poor's said Friday it has placed Hitachi Ltd. on
``CreditWatch'' _ meaning it may soon cut its assessment of the
electronics giant's ability to repay its debts. It currently gives
Hitachi a ``double A'' long-term rating, its third-highest rating.
	   On the same day, Moody's Investors Service said it has placed
Nomura Securities Co., Japan's largest brokerage, on review for a
downgrade of its credit rating. Moody's now assigns Nomura a rating
of A1, solid but five ranks below its top rating.
	   The moves are the latest in a series of credit reviews and
downgrades of top Japanese companies by the two New York-based
credit agencies. In all cases, they cited a stubborn downturn by
Japan's domestic economy as their key concern.
	   Standard and Poor's, which downgraded Hitachi just two months
ago, said it may do so again a day after the maker of computers and
consumer electronics announced it will post its first ever loss in
the current fiscal year, which ends in March.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's largest auto components
supplier partially resumed operation at its seven plants Friday, a
day after police broke up an 18-day-old strike.
	   But Mando Machinery Corp. said normal operation was at least
three days away because hundreds of workers were in police custody
for questioning and many others refused to return to work in
protest against the police raids.
	   Mando is a monopoly supplier of air conditioners, heaters,
alternators and other key components for Hyundai Motor Co. and
other domestic automakers.
	   Its strike has hampered operation at Hyundai, South Korea's No.
1 auto maker, which was recovering from its own 36-day-old strike
that ended just last week.
	   In Thursday's coordinated dawn assaults at Mando's plants around
the country, some 8,000 riot police used bulldozers and tear gas to
break through barricades and disperse strikers protesting layoffs.
	   Mando's 4,300 unionized workers went on strike Aug. 17 to
protest the company's plan to dismiss 1,090 employees amid a severe
slump in the auto industry.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu
said Friday he expects the Philippines' gross national product will
expand 1.5 percent this year, indicating a further slowing of the
country's economy.
	   The present target was a downward revision of an original goal
for the GNP to expand by between 3 percent and 4 percent this year.
Economic growth has slowed as a result of Asia's financial crisis,
which pushed interest rates higher, and because of a severe drought
which lowered agricultural production.
	   The government's growth target remains a sticking point with the
International Monetary Fund. An IMF mission is in the Philippines
to review recent economic developments and to set economic targets
under the terms of a dlrs 1.4 billion IMF precautionary loan
arrangement.
	   Espiritu acknowledged that no agreement has been reached with
the IMF on some economic targets, including the growth goals.
	   Last month, the IMF's Manila representative said the Philippines
would be ``lucky'' to achieve growth of 1 percent this year, a
comment that so annoyed the central bank that it publicly censured
the IMF official.
	    &UR; _____
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The Stock Exchange of Singapore suspended
trading of Malaysian shares in the over-the-counter market Friday,
and Singapore banks set a rate for clearing transactions in the
Malaysian currency.
	   Malaysian shares traded on Singapore's over-the-counter market _
known as Central Limit Order Book, or Clob _ have come under heavy
selling pressure since Monday when the Malaysian government
effectively banned foreign trading of its country's shares.
	   More than 90 percent of Singapore's over-the-counter trading is
in Malaysian shares.
	   The Malaysian government also said its currency, the ringgit,
will have no value outside the country after Oct. 1, and it placed
immediate restrictions on foreigners' use of the currency in
transactions and exchange.
	   The Malaysian government also set a value of three ringgit to
the U.S. dollar for use inside the country.
	   The Association of Banks in Singapore said many banks had agreed
on a spot rate for the settlement of four ringgit to the U.S.
dollar, less than the rate set by the Malaysian government.

South Korea's foreign and trade minister to visit U.S.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korean Foreign and Trade
Minister Hong Soon-young will meet Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright next week to discuss North Korean missile threats and
other issues, officials said Friday.
	   A key topic on Hong's four-day trip to Washington, scheduled to
begin next Wednesday, will be the communist state's test launch of
a long-range ballistic missile that crossed over Japan and crashed
into the Pacific Ocean on Monday.
	   The North's new Taepo Dong 1 missile has a range of up to 2,000
kilometers (1,250 miles), capable of hitting all of Japan and South
Korea and U.S. military bases there.
	   Albright and Hong also will discuss international efforts to
stop North Korea's scheme to build atomic bombs.
	   U.S. officials are demanding an outside inspection of a large
underground construction site in North Korea that they believe is a
nuclear-related facility.
	   In a 1994 agreement with the United States, North Korea agreed
to halt nuclear weapons development in exchange for two
Western-built civilian reactors and fuel oil shipments.
	   But North Korea is threatening to walk out of that accord,
accusing Washington of not holding up its end of the agreement by
providing 500,000 tons of heavy fuel oil each year.
	   After the North's missile test, Japan is refusing to endorse its
financial commitment to the new reactors for the North, which will
cost dlrs 4.6 billion.

Thai Science Ministry wants leaking power plant shut down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Ministry of Science will
propose that a lignite power plant in a northern province be closed
down permanently because it leaks sulfur dioxide, a ministry
spokesman said Friday.
	   The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand, the
state-owned power company, has repeatedly failed to repair the
leakage at Mae Moh power plant in Lampang Province, 510 kilometers
(317 miles) north of Bangkok, said the spokesman, who declined to
be named.
	   Residents of the area have complained they are suffering from a
slew of health problems because the sulfur dioxide is poisoning
their environment.
	   The spokesman said EGAT has tried to repair the plant several
times over the past few year, but been unable to stop the leakage.
	   The ministry will ask EGAT to consider shutting the plant down
for good. If the company refuses, the ministry will take the
proposal directly to the Cabinet of Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai.
	   An EGAT spokesman said the company has yet to receive a formal
proposal from the ministry. He said the company is aware of the
problem.
	   He said EGAT is in the process of installing 12 special filters
at a cost of 1 billion baht (dlrs 24.4 million) each, and suggested
the environmental situation be reassessed before any drastic
decision is made.

Russian ruble falls again, government backs down on bank plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new Chernomyrdin quote, inflation up 15 percent
in August. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The ruble tumbled some more Friday, inflation is
rising sharply and the government tried to placate angry Russians
by reversing an order to freeze personal accounts at the country's
largest retail banks.
	   The official ruble rate fell to 16.99 to the U.S. dollar, or 5.8
cents, down from 13.46 to the dollar, or 7.4 cents, on Thursday.
The street level was even lower.
	   Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said the government
would continue to let market forces determine the currency's value
_ even though it will mean higher prices.
	   When the economy stabilizes, the government will press ahead
with market reforms, he told the upper house of parliament, the
Federation Council.
	   ``It may be our last chance to build a normal economy in
Russia,'' Chernomyrdin said, appealing for support. ``Yes, our
actions will be unpopular. Everyone will assail us. But don't tie
the government's hands, give us time to step back from the
precipice. That refers to everyone from the president on down.''
	   But in another sign that the economy was still going downhill,
the government announced that inflation for August was 15 percent _
a sharp escalation from July's 0.2 percent.
	   Month-to-month inflation has been less than 1 percent this year,
and before the financial crisis hit, the annual rate was expected
to be in single digits this year for the first time since
free-market Reforms began in 1992. The inflation rate was 11
percent in 1997 and 22 percent in 1996.
	   Meanwhile, the government backed down on its hugely unpopular
plan to prevent the collapse of Russia's banking system by freezing
personal accounts at six of the country's biggest private banks,
news agencies said.
	   The Central Bank ordered the six banks on Wednesday to close
their branches temporarily and transfer all personal accounts to
the national savings bank, Sberbank, where deposits are fully
guaranteed by the government.
	   It said depositors would regain access to their money no later
than Nov. 15, but that they could only withdraw rubles, not foreign
currency, and at the unfavorable exchange rate of 9.33 rubles to
the dollar.
	   Many Russians have both ruble and dollar accounts in commercial
banks.
	   On Friday the government said Russians could retain access to
any accounts opened before Sept. 1 at the six affected banks _
Mosbusinessbank, Inkombank, Most Bank, Menatep, SBS-Agro and
Promstroibank.
	   Details were unclear, but it appeared they would be able to
withdraw funds from both their ruble and dollar accounts.

Turkish prosecutor pushes for imprisonment of Islamic mayor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The 10-month prison sentence for the
pro-Islamic mayor of Istanbul on charges of inciting hatred based
on religious differences was fully in line with Turkish law, a
prosecutor told an appeals court Friday.
	   Prosecutor Vural Savas urged the court to issue a speedy
decision upholding the verdict.
	   If upheld, the verdict would bar Mayor Recep Tayyip Erdogan,
seen as the Islamic movement's up-and-coming leader, from active
politics before general elections in April.
	   Erdogan was convicted of reading a folk poem that prosecutors
charged that was a call for a religious uprising. His lawyers
appealed the verdict issued in April.
	   Erdogan is seen as a future leader of a new Islamic party,
formed to replace the Welfare Party, which was closed down by the
Constitutional Court earlier this year for violating the
constitution's secular principles. The party was the largest in
parliament.

	   Prosecutor Vural Savas urged the court to issue a speedy
decision upholding the verdict.
	   If upheld, the verdict would bar Mayor Recep Tayyip Erdogan,
seen as the Islamic movement's up-and-coming leader, from active
politics before general elections in April.
	   Erdogan was convicted of reading a folk poem that prosecutors
charged that was a call for a religious uprising. His lawyers
appealed the verdict issued in April.
	   Erdogan is seen as a future leader of a new Islamic party,
formed to replace the Welfare Party, which was closed down by the
Constitutional Court earlier this year for violating the
constitution's secular principles. The party was the largest in
parliament.

Two volcanoes spew ash in Russia's Far East
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two volcanoes erupted on eastern Russia's sparsely
populated Kamchatka Peninsula, spewing ash high into the air, a
news agency said Friday.
	   The Shiveluch volcano blew on Thursday afternoon, shooting up a
cloud of ash and sending lava flows down its sides, the Interfax
news agency said.
	   A similar eruption occurred Wednesday at the Kluychevskaya
volcano, where ash spewed as high as five kilometers (3 miles)
above the volcano, Interfax said.
	   The two eruptions did not threaten the nearest village of
Klyuchi, situated 30 kilometers (18 miles) away. But local
geologists predicted that the eruptions will intensify, and lava
floes and ash could damage surrounding roads, Interfax said.
	   There are 29 active volcanoes on the Kamchatka Peninsula,
located eight time zones east of Moscow along the Pacific Rim's
``ring of fire.'' In the last decade eight of those volcanoes have
erupted repeatedly, sometimes sending up ash and smoke 12
kilometers (7 miles) high.

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ A U.N. tribunal, in the world's first
sentence for genocide, Friday ordered an ex-prime minister to serve
life in prison for the savage slaughter of more than 500,000
Rwandans in 1994.
	   Jean Kambanda, the highest-ranking former political leader in
the tribunal's custody, pleaded guilty on May 1 to six counts of
genocide and crimes against humanity, including responsibility for
the murder and extermination of civilians. As the first person to
accept culpability for genocide before an international court,
Kambanda had sought a lenient sentence.
	   Kambanda was ordered to stand and gazed without expression at
Chief Judge Laity Kama of Senegal as the judge announced the
sentence.
	   Sighs of relief rippled through the audience, filled with
Rwandan survivors of the genocide.
	   ``Jean Kambanda abused his authority and the trust of the
population,'' Kama said, adding that Kambanda's leadership position
had been an aggravating circumstance in the case. ``Nor has he
expressed contrition, regret, or sympathy for the victims in Rwanda
even when given the opportunity.''
	   The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda said the
sentencing of Kambanda, 42, was the first for the crime of genocide
by an international court. This was the first sentencing since the
tribunal was established more than four years ago.
	   All those accused in the post-World War II Nuremberg trials
pleaded innocent to charges including murder and extermination. The
trials pre-dated the creation of the crime of genocide 50 years
ago.
	   Defense lawyer Oliver Michael Inglis said he would appeal the
sentence.
	   ``I didnt expect a life sentence,'' Inglis said. ``I was
expecting something like 10 to 15 years.''
	   Deputy Prosecutor Bernard Muna said it was an ``exemplary
sentence. But I am afraid it might dissuade others from coming
forward to plead guilty.''
	   On Thursday, the defense asked for a sentence of two years or
nothing at all for Kambanda, contending he was merely a puppet
manipulated by a powerful and evil military.
	   The prosecution countered that Kambanda merits life
imprisonment, even though he pleaded guilty and recorded 90 hours
of testimony incriminating other alleged ringleaders of the
genocide.
	   Muna argued that no amount of evidence against others could
offset such wrongdoing. Kambanda was charged with inciting
massacres, ordering roadblocks to help round up of Tutsis, and
distributing weapons for the slaughter as his hard-line Hutu
government presided over the bloodbath.
	   ``Justice has been done by imprisoning Mr. Kambanda,'' said
Rwandan ambassador to Tanzania Joy Makanyange outside the
courtroom. ``This is a historic event.''
	   More than 500,000 Rwandans, mostly minority Tutsis but also
moderate Hutus, were butchered with machetes and nail-studded clubs
in the carefully orchestrated genocide.
	   The killing that began April 7, 1994, the day after President
Juvenal Habyarimana plane's was shot down, ended 90 days later when
Tutsi rebels took power.
	   A life sentence is the maximum that can be imposed by the U.N.
tribunal, based in the northern Tanzania town of Arusha.
	   The three-judge panel ordered him held at the U.N. prison in
Arusha until it decides where he will serve his full term.
	   Rwanda has carried out its own prosecutions. In April, Rwandan
firing squads executed 22 people convicted of genocide, the first
executions in connection with the genocide.
	   Officials in Rwanda, where an estimated 130,000 people are in
prison awaiting trial for genocide crimes, say at least 10,000
people have pleaded guilty to genocide charges against them as part
of a plea-bargain program aimed at clearing out swamped courts and
prisons.
	   Under Rwandan law, however, those categorized as leaders of the
genocide cannot receive leniency in exchange for confessions.
	   Rwanda's genocide courts, which have been criticized by
international organizations for being too swift in rendering
judgments, have tried more than 500 suspects and condemned at least
116 to death since trials began in Dec. 1996.
	   Although the indictment said Kambanda controlled the government
ministers and military officers who were carrying out the killings,
his attorney had characterized him as a reluctant officeholder
manipulated by a powerful military.
	   Kambanda was afraid to object because he and his family would
have been killed, his lawyer said. Muna said Kambanda had been
promised nothing in exchange for his guilty plea other than
protection for his wife and children.
	   Kambanda _ slight and bearded, let his lawyer speak for him
Thursday, telling the chief judge he had nothing to add.
	   Many Rwandans were disappointed that Kambanda failed to
apologize.
	   Kambanda fled Rwanda when Tutsi rebels seized power in July
1994, and was arrested in Nairobi three years later with six other
high-level officials.

<TEXT>
	   TOMAKOMAI, Japan (AP) _ Defending champion Shigeki Maruyama,
Shinichi Yokota, Katsunori Kuwabara and Burmese Zaw Moe survived
the second and third rounds Friday, advancing to the semifinals in
the Japan PGA Matchplay Championship Promise Cup.
	   In 36-hole contests Saturday, Maruyama takes on Yokota, in
contention for his first title of the season and second overall.
Kuwabara, winner of the 1995 Acom International, plays against Moe,
a non-winner in five years on the Japan PGA Tour.
	   Of a selected field of 32, 16 players were left after Thursday's
opening round, and two rounds were held Friday, leaving the
semifinalists.
	   Those eliminated included American Brian Watts, the Japan-based
golfer who finished second in the British Open in July, Australian
Peter McWhinney, Frankie Minoza of the Philippines, Colombia's
Eduardo Herrera and Naomichi ``Joe'' Ozaki, the youngest of three
Ozaki brothers on the Japan tour.
	   The winner Sunday will collect 30 million yen (dlrs 223,600)
from a purse of 100 million yen (dlrs 746,000) and a five-year
exempt status on the tour.
	   The match play is one of the tour's four major tournaments.

King doubts talks will resolve Cambodian political crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Hun Sen likely to leave talks to aides, raises
ASEAN endorsement.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk expressed
doubt Friday that crisis talks he will lead between Cambodia's
rival political parties will bring an end to current turmoil.
	   Meanwhile, protests by thousands of people continued for the
12th day against strongman Hun Sen. They accuse him of using fraud
to win parliamentary elections July 26 and have demanded his
ouster.
	   But Hun Sen received a major boost Friday when the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations endorsed the election results and urged
Cambodia's politicians to peacefully resolve their differences.
	   ASEAN postponed Cambodia's membership last year after Hun Sen
deposed Prince Norodom Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a bloody
coup, and the elections were seen as a major step toward restoring
his international legitimacy.
	   Sihanouk, who received Hun Sen at his palace Thursday in the
northern town of Siem Reap, site of the ancient Angkor monuments,
is to chair a meeting starting Saturday between the three main
parties to end the political deadlock.
	   Hun Sen had planned to attend personally, but a spokesman said
Friday that he would instead send a trio of Cabinet ministers after
his opponents insisted they would only send lower-level
representatives.
	   Khieu Kanharith, the spokesman, said Hun Sn would remain in Siem
Reap to follow developments.
	   ``I do not have much hope that the three-day meeting will have
the positive result that I want,'' Sihanouk, 75, said in a written
statement. ``The parties have deep conflicts with each other and
have not yet agreed to make any concessions or compromises.''
	   Hun Sen has been declared the election victor, but the
opposition parties led by Sihanouk's son, Ranariddh, and his ally,
Sam Rainsy, allege that hundreds of irregularities were committed.
	   The Hun Sen-controlled electoral authorities have rejected all
their complaints, and thousands of opposition supporters have taken
to the streets in protest, marching Friday on foreign embassies. No
violence was reported.
	   The weekend talks are expected to revolve around technical
issues, mainly the appellate process that the opposition says was
biased in favor of Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party.
	   The CPP won 64 of the 122 National Assembly seats, a slight
majority but short of the two-thirds needed to form a government
alone. Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have refused to lend their vital
support when the assembly convenes for the first time Sept. 24.

Finland gets new culture minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ President Martti Ahtisaari on Friday
named Suvi-Anne Siimes as the new culture minister, to replace
Claes Andersson.
	   Andersson, 61, agreed in May to step down as chairman of the
Left Wing Alliance, when it voted to replace him with Siimes. He
also said he would relinquish his post as culture minister once the
government had finalized details of next year's budget in
September.
	   The culture ministry is one of two portfolios held by the Left
Wing Alliance in the five-party coalition government.
	   Siimes, 35, is an economics researcher and has held various
teaching posts at the University of Helsinki and other institutes
of higher education. She has never been a member of Parliament.
	   Andersson has led his party for eight years. He has been a
lawmaker since 1987 but does not plan to run for another term.
	   Andersson is popular among Finnish artists. He likes jazz and
often plays jam sessions on the piano with other musicians. He also
has published several collections of poetry, novels and plays.

McGrath out of Commonwealth Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: adds McGrath quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Australian cricketer Glenn McGrath
has suffered a new injury which will keep him out of this month's
Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur and possibly the following tour
of Pakistan.
	   McGrath missed most of last season, including tours of India and
New Zealand, with a stomach injury and he strained a groin muscle
in a warmup match Friday.
	   Australia's leading strike bowler broke down after 5.5 overs in
a match against the Australian Cricket Academy.
	   ``It's only a minor strain but it is a strain,'' McGrath said.
``It's one of those things that fast bowlers go through at the
beginning of a season. If we had another week until the
Commonwealth Games I think I would have been fine.
	   ``I'm sure that everything will be fine for Pakistan.''
	   McGrath's troubles last summer started in November when scar
tissue from a hernia operation contracted and pinched a nerve. He
then suffered a stomach muscle tear.
	   Australia has brought in Queenslander Andrew Bichel for the
Games, leaving McGrath at home to try and recover in time for
Pakistan.
	   The test players leave Australia on Sept. 22 to join up with
those at the Games. Australia is in a pool with Canada, Antigua and
India for the Games' cricket competition, which starts Sept. 9.

German court overturns deportation order for Turkish family
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ A Bavarian state court on Friday
overturned orders to have a juvenile delinquent and his parents
deported to Turkey, saying the teen-ager had never been convicted
and the parents had done nothing wrong.
	   The case _ the focus of much election-year attention _ came amid
a growing clamor in Germany to crack down on foreigners who commit
crimes here. It was the first time a German state had sought to
expel an entire family because of a child's offenses.
	   The boy, known as ``Mehmet,'' started getting in trouble at age
10, but children in Germany cannot be prosecuted until age 14. This
summer, after his 14th birthday, Mehmet was jailed pending a
robbery charge.
	   The alleged robbery was No. 62 on a rap sheet that includes
offenses ranging from breaking someone's nose and choking a
counselor to snatching the hat off a schoolmate's head and
demanding money for its return.
	   On July 28, a city court in Munich upheld the deportation order
for Mehmet and for his parents, whom Bavarian authorities accused
of endangering public safety by failing to properly raise their
son.
	   But the state administrative court said a minor cannot be
deported unless he or she has been convicted of a serious crime or
the parents are here illegally _ neither of which applies in
Mehmet's case.
	   It also voided the deportation order for Mehmet's parents,
saying they could not be punished for the crimes of their son.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea on Friday said it has
successfully launched its first artificial satellite into earth
orbit.
	   The satellite was launched Monday on a three-stage, domestically
developed rocket, according to the North's official Korean Central
News Agency.
	   That timing would coincide with the test-firing of a newly
developed ballistic missile, Taepo Dong I, that crossed over Japan
and crashed into the Pacific.
	   North Korea has not confirmed it conducted the missile test, and
Friday's report appeared to be an attempt to deny Japanese,
American and South Korean claims of the missile launch.
	   ``Our scientists and technicians have succeeded in the first
artificial satellite aboard a multi-stage rocket into orbit,'' KCNA
said.
	   The three-stage rocket, the report said, blasted off from a
launching station at 12:07 p.m. on Monday and put the satellite
into orbit about five minutes later.
	   The first stage was separated from the rocket 95 seconds after
the launch and fell in open seas 253 kilometers (158 miles) off the
launching station, the report said.
	   The second stage fell in the Pacific Ocean, 1,646 kilometers
(1,028 miles) from the launching station and the third stage put
the satellite into orbit 27 seconds after the separation of the
second stage, it said.
	   ``The satellite is now transmitting the melody of the immortal
revolutionary hymns `song of General Kim Il Sung' and `Song of
General Kim Jong Il' and the morse signals `Juche Korea' in
27MHZ,'' the report said.
	   Juche, or self-reliance, is North Korea's guiding philosophy.

IMF hopeful Pakistan to get bailout package for ailing economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AMIR ZIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ It seems likely that cash-strapped
Pakistan will get the international financial help it needs to
stave off economic collapse, an International Monetary Fund
official said Friday.
	   But the final decision will be made after a six-member global
banking team visits Islamabad next week to review Pakistan's ailing
economy, made even worse because of international sanctions that
followed a series of nuclear tests.
	   ``The purpose of this visit is to identify the resource gap so
that we can finance it,'' Ahsan Mansur, IMF's resident director
told The Associated Press.
	   The United States last month promised not to block IMF money to
Pakistan, removing the only major hurdle to giving Pakistan the
international aid it needs.
	   Both Pakistan and India were hit with economic sanctions after
the two hostile neighbors conducted tit-for-tat nuclear tests last
May.
	   Mansur said the IMF team and Pakistani economic managers would
identify the financial needs and put together a program in two
weeks for approval by the IMF's board, which will meet in October
in Washington.
	   ``If a package is agreed upon there will be support from
international institutions. ... We are very hopeful,'' he said. But
he said it was difficult to say how much money will be involved in
the package.
	   After the nuclear tests and sanctions, the IMF stopped an
installment on an already agreed upon dlrs 1.56 billion three-year
loan to Pakistan. It's not immediately clear whether the IMF will
agree to keep it on schedule or renegotiate a whole new package for
Pakistan.
	   Pakistan says the IMF money is critical for its balance of
payment support. It also was counting on the money to service its
external debt of dlrs 32 billion.
	   Pakistan earlier said it may seek a moratorium on its debt
repayment if the international financing was not available.
	   The IMF says Pakistan has made progress in some areas of
financial reform and has reduced inflation and slashed its
administrative expenses.
	   But Mansur said the IMF wants further improvements, for example
it wants the tax base broadened, agricultural income tax imposed
and increased privatization of national industries. The big
problem, he said, is that the government spends more than it makes.
	   Mansur said that while sanctions hurt the perception of
Pakistan's economy, in real terms sanctions have so far caused very
little change.
	   ``We haven't seen a meltdown. The agriculture crop is good this
year, industrial base has not been wiped out, exports are likely to
rise because of the devaluation. ... We have to work to restore the
perception, so that the private sector is not skeptical,'' he said.

American embassy received bomb threat; building evacuated
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The American Embassy was evacuated
last week following a bomb threat made by an anonymous telephone
caller, a police spokesman said Friday.
	   The incident occurred on Aug. 24 in the evening, when most of
the staff had already left the building.
	   Embassy officials searched the building but found nothing, said
Hague police spokesman Jan Karel Nube. During the search, local
police were alerted by an embassy employee that a man was standing
outside the building.
	   Police took him in for questioning, but he was later released.
	   ``We had no reason to believe he had committed any crime,'' said
Nube, adding the man explained he was only studying a nearby
statue.
	   The Hague incident came just weeks after the Aug. 7 bombings of
American embassies in the capitals of Kenya and Tanzania in east
Africa.
	   Those bombings killed 258 people, including 12 Americans, and
injured more than 5,000. Security since has been tightened at U.S.
embassies worldwide.

Ethnic Albanian leader welcomes interim agreement for Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Rugova quotes; TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The top ethnic Albanian leader
Friday welcomed a tentative, U.S.-mediated formula for ending the
Kosovo crisis and indicated he would try to win over hardliners to
a peace process rather than continue the battle for full
independence.
	   Speaking to reporters, Ibrahim Rugova said ``the possibility of
an interim and temporary accord is under consideration,''
confirming U.S. and Belgrade statements issued over the past few
days.
	   Such an agreement, Rugova said, would last for a period of three
years and its principal objective would be to ``normalize life'' in
the embattled province and ``create conditions for a lasting
solution.''
	   ``We have to do something to end the negative trends and prevent
an imminent tragedy for Kosovo, '' Rugova said, adding this can
only be achieved with the help of the Americans and Europeans.
	   In Vienna, Austria, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
both Rugova and Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic had agreed in
principle on a formula for self-rule for the majority Albanian
province, subject to review after three years.
	   The agreement would fall short of Albanian demands for full
independence from Serbia, a part of Yugoslavia. Fighting is
continuing, and details will require months of negotiations, which
would break down if the violence does not end.
	   Still, Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel said the
framework offers the ``first glimmer of hope'' for a peaceful end
to more than six months of fighting.
	   The key to the success could be the Kosovo Liberation Army, many
of whose members oppose Rugova because of his disavowal of
violence. But Western diplomats hope that enough KLA members will
eventually accept the diplomatic process, leaving hard-liners
isolated politically within the Albanian community.
	   Asked whether he could win over the KLA to the formula, Rugova
said he represents ``all residents of Kosovo,'' indicating he would
take responsibility for building support among the Albanian
community, which makes up 90 percent of the 2 million Kosovo
population.
	   Fighting in Kosovo escalated in March after Milosevic launched a
crackdown to destroy the KLA, whom the Serbs describe as
``terrorists.''
	   As part of the U.S. diplomatic effort, John Shattuck, U.S.
assistant secretary of state for human rights, was expected in
Belgrade and Pristina later Friday. Former Sen. Bob Dole, who lost
the presidency to President Clinton in 1996, is also due here in
the area on the weekend.

Turkey gives go ahead for election of new Armenian Patriarch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ After a five-month delay, the government
gave the green light for the election of a new spiritual leader for
Turkey's Armenian Orthodox community, a church spokeswoman said
Friday.
	   Proceedings for the election started Tuesday after the
government gave its approval, said Luiz Bakar, the spokeswoman.
	   The proceedings were initially scheduled to begin after the
traditional 40-day mourning period for Karekin II, who died March
10 aged 71. But the Cabinet held up its approval for unspecified
reasons.
	   Unconfirmed reports suggested a rift between the interior
ministry, which was said to seek some control over the selection
process, and the foreign ministry, which opposed the move fearing
protests.
	   The Armenian Patriarch is to be elected by a mixed 89-member
delegation of clerics and lay people chosen by the community on
Oct. 14, the spokeswoman said.
	   There are an estimated 65,000 Armenians in Turkey, most living
in Istanbul. The community dissociates itself from the Armenian
diaspora, which has demanded that Turkey acknowledge the massacre
of millions of Armenians between 1915 and 1923.
	   Turkey denies that a genocide took place, insisting the deaths
were the result of a civil war.

Clinton highlights Irish economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Clinton meeting with Ahern at 1015 GMT; will be led &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ President Bill Clinton turned Friday from
the turmoil in Northern Ireland to the Irish Republic's thriving
economy, holding it up as the prize of peace.
	   He was meeting with Irish business and political leaders as a
new anti-terrorist law took effect in Ireland and Britain Friday.
	   After talks with Prime Minister Bertie Ahern in central Dublin's
Government Buildings, Clinton was touring a Gateway 2000 computer
plant in order to highlight business opportunities in Ireland.
Attracting foreign investment and its stabilizing effects was
similarly a theme in Northern Ireland, which Clinton visited before
helicoptering to the Republic late Thursday.
	   ``Visit here and we will welcome you; invest here and we will
work with you. And if they didn't already know it, let the rest of
the world take note: Northern Ireland is back in business,'' David
Trimble, first minister designate of the province's new assembly,
declared on Thursday.
	   The president came to Dublin from Omagh, Northern Ireland, where
he walked the street where 28 people, mostly women and children,
were killed and hundreds wounded in an Aug. 15 attack.
	   The car bombing, Northern Ireland's worst terror attack, was
blamed on Irish Republican Army extremists trying to wreck Northern
Ireland's peace agreement.
	   The new anti-terrorist law, written in the wake of the attack,
became law in Ireland late Thursday while in Britain the
legislation was sent to the queen for her signature, a formality
for the measure to become law.
	   Both governments sought passage of the bills during Clinton's
visit.
	   The British measures would give more weight to police testimony
alleging a suspect belonged to a banned organization, and allow
judges to draw incriminating inferences from a suspect's refusal to
answer questions.
	   Clinton said the Omagh attack had backfired.
	   ``Out of the unimaginably horrible agony of Omagh, the people
said it is high time somebody told these people that we are through
with hate, through with war, through with destruction. It will not
work anymore,'' he said, after arriving from a two-day Moscow trip.
	   Following the meeting and lunch reception with Ahern, Clinton
was heading to Gateway's Dublin plant, which employs 1,300 people
primarily producing personal computers for the European market.
Gateway is considered a symbol of the decade-long economic boom
that has seen American corporations build facilities in Ireland to
service the European market.

Ethnic Vietnamese killed by Cambodian mobs in poisoning scare
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Cambodia-Protest
 &UR; By ROBIN McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Angry mobs linked to recent
political upheavals have killed as many as five ethnic Vietnamese
and severely beaten several others, accusing them of being behind a
wave of fatal poisonings.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights condemned the
killings Friday and urged opposition politicians who have whipped
up antipathy toward the much-hated Vietnamese minority to temper
their rhetoric.
	   The attacks follow the reported deaths of some 60 people in the
past week from poisoning, fueling rumors that ethnic Vietnamese
have tampered with food, water and rice wine.
	   The U.N. commission said it was ``particularly regrettable that
this food poisoning issue has begun to acquire racial and political
overtones.''
	   ``In the current volatile context, further statements by
irresponsible political leaders inciting racist actions may lead to
further violence and death,'' the commission said.
	   A couple was beaten to death Friday in front of the headquarters
of the opposition FUNCINPEC party by a group who claimed they
spotted the woman spiking rice and porridge in a street stall.
	   ``Many people started shouting at the couple, saying, `They are
Vietnamese, they are poisoning the food,''' and then attacked them,
said Interior Ministry spokesman Khieu Sopheak.
	   The attackers, said to be on their way to a demonstration
against Cambodian leader Hun Sen, whose opponents view him as a
puppet of Vietnam, claimed to have discovered a packet of brown
powder in the woman's bra.
	   Police and human-rights workers found no such evidence.
	   A third person, also ethnic Vietnamese, died Thursday on the way
to the capital's Calmette Hospital after he was attacked by a mob
on similar suspicions.
	   The U.N. human-rights office confirmed three deaths linked to
the poisoning scare, while Sok Phal, an Interior Ministry
spokesman, said their were five. No evidence supported claims any
were involved in poisoning.
	   The attacks follow 12 days of opposition protests against Hun
Sen, whose party was declared the victor in parliamentary elections
July 26. His opponents say he won through fraud and should resign.
	   FUNCINPEC leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh and his opposition
ally, Sam Rainsy, have frequently played on deep anti-Vietnamese
sentiments many Cambodians hold.
	   Sam Rainsy issued a statement following the attacks condemning
the attacks ``in the strongest terms possible.''
	   Though Vietnamese troops toppled the genocidal Rouge in 1979, a
harsh, decade-long occupation followed, and suspicion and hatred of
Vietnam runs deep. Last Sunday, the anti-Hun Sen demonstrators
smashed and burned an occupation-era statue.
	   The real cause of the recent poisonings is still being
investigated, but many of the deaths have been attributed to
insecticide-laced rice wine. Many Cambodians mistakenly believe
that pesticide increases the drink's potency.

Hong Kong shares close on a stronger yen and continued

short-covering &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A stronger yen and continued short-covering on
Friday pushed Hong Kong shares higher at the close, despite
overnight losses on Wall Street and an another possible downgrade
of the territory's creditworthiness.
	   The Hang Seng Index _ the market's key indicator of blue chips _
was up 169.88 points, or 2.3 percent, to close at 7,488.47.
	   The U.S. dollar fell against the yen due to worries over the
Russian economy, which ``lifted selling pressure'' on Hong Kong
stocks and improved market sentiment, said Jason Tang of South
China Brokerage Co.
	   Following a downgrade earlier this week by rival ratings agency
Standard and Poor's, the announcement that Moody's Investors
Service will review Hong Kong's long-term and short-term foreign
currency ceilings dampened share prices at the market's opening.
	   But overseas investors took advantage of the strong yen and
continued covering short positions, pushing the index up at the
close. Tightened regulations on short selling introduced this week
had intensified short-covering Wednesday afternoon, continuing
through to Friday's close, analysts said.
	   Short-covering is the buying back of borrowed stock. An investor
who short-sells sells borrowed stock hopes it will decline in value
before it is returned, allowing a profit to be made.
	   Trading volume was valued at 6.85 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 889.6 million).
	   The market's biggest gainers were Shanghai Industrial which
gained 2.65 to close at 13.85, Television Broadcasts which gained
1.75 to end at 17.95, and Hutchison Whampoa which gained 1.40 to
close at 35.50.
	   The day's losers were HSBC Holdings which shed 3.50 to close at
154.00, Sun Hung Kai Properties which lost 0.05 to end at 23.50,
and First Pacific which lost 0.07 to end at 2.70.
	   Hong Kong's flag-carrier Cathay Pacific gained 0.25 to end at
6.20.

Austrian interior minister backs off from controversial EU asylum
</HEADLINE>
proposal &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC;

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Austria's interior minister has disavowed
a controversial portion of an immigration discussion paper which
critics said would have undermined the 47-year-old right of
political refugees to seek shelter in other countries.
	   A discussion paper, drafted by the Austrian Interior Ministry
and circulated at European Union headquarters in Brussels, Belgium,
suggested that the universal right of asylum for those fleeing
oppression could be amended to become a ``political offer'' which
individual countries could make if they chose.
	   The ministry paper drew sharp criticism from left-leaning
Austrian politicians and European human rights groups. They accused
the ministry of trying to undermine the 1951 Geneva Convention on
Migration, which recognizes asylum as a universal human right.
	   ``We did not plan to change the Geneva Convention,'' Interior
Minister Karl Schloegel was quoted Friday by the newspaper Der
Standard. ``We did not intend to eliminate the right of asylum.''
	   Schloegel said he had ``no problem'' with eliminating the
controversial paragraph, which spoke of the possibility of amending
the 1951 convention, from the discussion paper.
	   The proposal was part of an ongoing debate within the EU on a
common policy toward asylum-seekers, who have been flocking in
increasing numbers to the 15 nations of the EU, just as they are
grappling with long-term economic, social and employment problems.
	   The 1951 convention was adopted in the wake of massive
dislocation during World War II and the Cold War division of Europe
into rival camps. However, most refugees have been seeking better
economic opportunities in wealthier countries.
	   As of Aug. 1, a total of 5,645 people had sought asylum in
Austria, surpassing the 5,500 figure for 1997. The majority were
ethnic Albanians from Kosovo fleeing fighting between Serb police
and secessionist rebels.
	   Many Austrians say their presence is an increasing burden in a
country of 7.8 million people. As the easternmost member of the
European Union, Austria is often the first EU state reached by
asylum-seekers from the Balkans and the Middle East.

Report: peace deal close after series of high-level meetings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Israel radio saying there has been a flurry of
top-level meetings and that draft agreement has been reached &QL; 
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) - Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
said Friday that a deal on an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West
Bank was still far off, contradicting Israeli reports that a flurry
of recent high-level meetings has resulted in a draft agreement.
	   The conflicting assessments came as the United States prepared
to resume its mediation efforts, with U.S. envoy Dennis Ross to
return to the region next week for meetings with Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Israel radio said Palestinian negotiator Ahmed Qureia met three
times in the past two weeks with Netanyahu and seven times with
Netanyahu's confidant, attorney Yitzhak Molcho.
	   The talks resulted in a draft agreement on key issues, including
the scope of a troop withdrawal, security cooperation, the
operation of a Palestinian airport and seaport and the release of
Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, the report said.
	   Qureia refused comment Friday. However, a senior Palestinian
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, denied there had
been top-level contact in the past two weeks.
	   Arafat said little progress has been made.
	   ``Actually, they (Israelis) are saying so but the gaps are still
wide,'' Arafat told reporters in Gaza City after returning from a
visit in South Africa.
	   On the table is an American proposal for an Israeli withdrawal
from 13 percent of the West Bank, to be met by a Palestinian
crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Asked whether he believed Ross would be able to persuade Israel
to agree to the U.S. initiative, Arafat said: ``I don't think so.''
	   ``This is not the first time that Ross is coming here,'' Arafat
said, in a reference to the envoy's previous unsuccessful missions.
	   White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Ross would meet with
Netanyahu and Arafat early next week ``on the chances of the
parties reaching agreement on the basis of the U.S. initiative.''
	   Israel originally rejected the U.S. initiative but recently
softened its position. It said it was ready to hand over 10 percent
in full. The remaining 3 percent would be set aside as a nature
reserve, with Israel retaining full security control and the
Palestinians observing building restrictions.
	   A senior Israeli official said a draft agreement had been
formulated on the scope of withdrawal, but that other sticking
points remained.

North Korea claims it has launched satellite into earth orbit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lede; UPDATES with North Korean Foreign Ministry
statement
 &UR; With Japan-NKorea Missile

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ In an apparent denial of a ballistic
missile launch this week, North Korea on Friday said it has
successfully fired its first artificial satellite into earth orbit.
	   The satellite was launched Monday on a three-stage, domestically
developed rocket, according to the North's official Korean Central
News Agency.
	   That timing would coincide with the test-firing of a newly
developed ballistic missile, Taepo Dong I, that crossed over Japan
and crashed into the Pacific.
	   North Korea has not confirmed it conducted the missile test, and
Friday's report appeared to be an attempt to deny Japanese,
American and South Korean claims of the missile launch.
	   ``Our scientists and technicians have succeeded in the first
artificial satellite aboard a multistage rocket into orbit,'' KCNA
said.
	   The three-stage rocket, the report said, blasted off from a
launching station at 12:07 p.m. on Monday and put the satellite
into orbit about five minutes later.
	   The first stage was separated from the rocket 95 seconds after
the launch and fell in open seas 253 kilometers (158 miles) off the
launching station, the report said.
	   The second stage fell in the Pacific Ocean, 1,646 kilometers
(1,028 miles) from the launching station and the third stage put
the satellite into orbit 27 seconds after the separation of the
second stage, it said.
	   ``The satellite is now transmitting the melody of the immortal
revolutionary hymns `song of General Kim Il Sung' and `Song of
General Kim Jong Il' and the morse signals `Juche Korea' in
27MHZ,'' the report said.
	   Juche, or self-reliance, is North Korea's guiding philosophy.
	   The North's claim of a successful launch of an artificial
satellite comes a day before the Marxist country's newly elected
parliament was to elect leader Kim Jong Il as its state head.
	   The launch of the rocket ``manifests the iron will and
indomitable spirit of our party, army and people who are working
hard for the greater prosperity of the country, pulling through
difficulties,'' the North Korean Foreign Ministry said in a
statement.
	   The statement heaped criticism on the United States and Japan
for making a ``fuss'' over the North's launch of a ``scientific
satellite.''
	   But the North also said that its rocket capacity can be used for
military purposes and warned the United States and Japan to stop
any hostile moves against it.
	   ``Particularly, the forces hostile towards the DPRK (North
Korea) must be mindful that their attempt to lead the DPRK to a
change will bring them nothing but destruction,'' the statement
said.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Grief-stricken families from Europe
and the United States headed to Nova Scotia's rocky coast Friday to
identify remains retrieved from the ocean waters where Swissair
Flight 111 crashed into pieces. As authorities drew up plans for
protecting the mourners' privacy, details emerged about the array
of distinguished professionals who were among the 229 people killed
in Wednesday night's disaster. Brilliant doctors, high-powered
executives, risk-taking relief workers were among the dead. Seven
of the victims were affiliated with the United Nations. Offshore
from the quaint fishing village of Peggy's Cove, an intensive
search continued Friday for bodies and remnants of the MD-11 jumbo
jet that crashed after its pilots reported smoke in the cockpit.
Officials estimated Thursday night that 60 bodies had been
recovered. (CANADA-PLANE CRASH)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin called
Friday for ``economic dictatorship'' to end Russia's crisis and
preserve market reforms as the hard-line opposition said it would
again block his confirmation. Outlining plans to stem the country's
economic crisis, Chernomyrdin said the government would allow the
ruble to float freely, allowing market forces to determine its
value. Russia has been plunged into crisis by the collapse of the
ruble and a power struggle between the Communist-dominated Duma, or
lower chamber of parliament, and President Boris Yeltsin. The Duma
was to vote for a second time Friday on whether to confirm
Chernomyrdin as premier, after rejecting him on Monday. His
approval could ease the political instability reigning over Russia,
though it would not end the nation's economic distress.
(RUSSIA-POLITICS)
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ In the first sentence by an
international court for genocide, a U.N. tribunal Friday ordered a
former Rwandan prime minister to serve life in prison for the
slaughter of more than 500,000 Rwandans in 1994. Jean Kambanda, the
highest-ranking former political leader in the tribunal's custody,
pleaded guilty on May 1 to six counts of genocide and crimes
against humanity, including responsibility for the murder and
extermination of civilians. As the first person to accept
culpability for genocide before an international court, Kambanda
had sought a lenient sentence. Kambanda was ordered to stand and
gazed without expression at Chief Judge Laity Kama of Senegal as
the judge announced the sentence. The sentencing of Kambanda, 42,
was the first sentencing since the tribunal was established more
than four years ago. (RWANDA-GENOCIDE TRIBUNAL)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The top ethnic Albanian leader
Friday welcomed a tentative, U.S.-mediated formula for ending the
crisis in Kosovo province and indicated he would try to win over
hardliners to a peace process rather than continue the battle for
full independence. Ibrahim Rugova said ``the possibility of an
interim and temporary accord is under consideration,'' confirming
U.S. and Belgrade statements issued over the past few days. In
Vienna, Austria, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
both Rugova and Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic had agreed in
principle on a formula for self-rule for the majority Albanian
province, subject to review after three years. The agreement would
fall short of Albanian demands for full independence from Serbia, a
part of Yugoslavia. Fighting is continuing, and details will
require months of negotiations, which would break down if the
violence does not end. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   SIMRI, India (AP) _ As flooding begins to recede in northern
India, aid workers are preparing for the tough task of saving
millions at risk from disease. ``The calamity is yet to come,''
Col. K.R. Lalotra said Friday. Lalotra has headed the relief
mission in the flood-hit area since the army set up a base with
doctors, engineers and other soldiers 10 days ago. Lalotra said
low-lying areas will remain under water for some time in Uttar
Pradesh, the most populous Indian state with 150 million people.
The worst flooding in decades has swamped over 3.2 million hectares
(8 million acres) in the last month. Outbreaks of diarrhea, cholera
and encephalitis are feared, due to the risk posed by decomposing
bodies and because floodwaters are spreading raw sewage throughout
many towns and villages. The government said 1,401 people drowned
and 169 died due to water-diseases and that the toll rise once the
water recedes enough to allow teams to count bodies. (INDIA-FLOODS)

	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ President Bill Clinton said Friday ``I'm
very sorry'' about his affair with Monica Lewinsky, which has drawn
sharp rebuke from even his closest Democratic allies.
	   Clearly uncomfortable using an international stage to address
the matter, Clinton spoke hours after Democratic Sen. Joseph
Lieberman of Connecticut called Clinton's actions immoral and
harmful. ``I can't disagree with anyone else who wants to be
critical of what I've already acknowledged is inappropriate,''
Clinton said in a photo session with Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern.

Amsterdam cable company pulls the plug on CNN

company. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Amsterdam became the only European
capital without CNN on Friday after the news channel refused to pay
what it called an exorbitant fee, prompting the city's cable TV
agency to pull the plug.
	   CNN International faded to black at midnight Thursday, replaced
by a message from cable agency A2000 apologizing to viewers but
saying the American broadcaster gave it no choice.
	   CNN eventually will be replaced by BBC World, Dutch media
reported Friday.
	   The switchoff ended a bitter standoff between Turner
Broadcasting System Europe, which operates CNN, and A2000, which
demanded a 725,000 guilder (dlrs 362,500) annual fee for CNN to air
its round-the-clock programming in the Amsterdam area.
	   TBS argued that the fee was far more expensive than anything it
had to pay in other cities. A2000 defended its charges, saying it
helped keep cable TV subscriptions low in Amsterdam.
	   ``Turner Broadcasting is very disappointed that Amsterdam's city
hall and A2000 could not come to a workable solution,'' Mathieu
Nagelkerke, a vice president of Turner Broadcasting System
Netherlands, said in a statement.
	   He said the financial demands remained unchanged and
``unacceptable,'' adding the company hopes its absence will only be
temporary.
	   But a defiant A2000 said it won't budge.
	   ``All commercial broadcasters need to pay this fee,'' said
Judith Huisman of A2000.
	   A consumer watchdog group intervened last week and brokered
talks between the two sides, but neither side was willing to
compromise.
	   Thousands of irate viewers have been calling A2000 to complain
about the loss of CNN, which is hugely popular among the Dutch and
widely watched by visiting businessmen and diplomats. CNN is still
available via satellite, but relatively few Dutch have the dishes
and decoders needed to watch it that way.
	   Hotels in and around the capital have said they'll install
rooftop dishes to ensure their guests still have access to CNN.
	   CNN follows MTV Europe, Eurosport and The Discovery Channel,
which have also pulled out of Amsterdam in protest over the fee.

he has been criticized for not directly apologizing or saying he
was sorry.
	   ``There's nothing that (Lieberman) or anyone else could say in a
personally critical way that I don't imagine I would disagree with
since I have already said it myself, to myself, and I'm very sorry
about it but there's nothing else I can say,'' the president said.
	   Asked about talk among some members of Congress that he should
be formally censured, Clinton appeared to grow testy. ``I shouldn't
be commenting on that while I'm here on this trip.
	   ``My understanding is that was not a decision that was made or
advocated clearly yesterday'' on the Senate floor, he went on.
	   ``If that's not an issue I don't want to make it one one way or
the other.''

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ The Sri Lankan cricket team returned
home Friday to a tumultuous welcome after defeating South Africa
and England in England.
	   Jubilant cricket officials, family members and fans cheered them
at the Colombo International airport.
	   ``Hail the conquerors,'' said a headline in a local newspaper.
	   Sri Lanka won a triangular cricket tournament which also
involved South Africa and England. It then scored an emphatic
10-wicket victory over England in a one-off test.
	   Offspinner Muttiah Muralitharan's rich haul of 16 wickets and
Sanath Jayasuriya's 213 helped Sri Lanka outplay England in the
test match.
	   ``While that win saw Sri Lanka add to its away-test triumphs, it
also significantly signaled to the cricketing world that Sri Lanka
had crossed the bridges where we could match any nation shoulder to
shoulder,'' The Island newspaper said.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Thousands of protesters demanding
the ouster of strongman Hun Sen marched Friday to the local offices
of the European Union, where they were confronted by riot police
armed with rifles and electric-shock batons.
	   The protesters denounced the EU, principal financier of the July
26 parliamentary elections, for what they described as rubber
stamping Hun Sen's declared victory despite opposition allegations
of hundreds of irregularities.
	   No violence was reported. The march by 3,000 people came on the
12th day of round-the-clock protests demanding that the complaints
of election fraud be seriously investigated. So far, Hun
Sen-controlled electoral authorities have rejected all of them.
	   The protests have been largely peaceful, but angry mobs linked
to the recent upheaval were reported Friday to have killed as many
as five ethnic Vietnamese and severely beaten others, accusing them
of being behind a wave of fatal poisonings.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights condemned the
killings and urged opposition politicians who have whipped up
antipathy toward the much-hated Vietnamese minority to temper their
rhetoric.
	   The U.N. commission said it was ``particularly regrettable that
this food poisoning issue has begun to acquire racial and political
overtones.''
	   The opposition leaders, Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy,
have both played up anti-Vietnamese sentiments.
	   Hun Sen, who came to power during the harsh Vietnamese military
occupation that followed the genocidal Khmer Rouge, is seen by many
Cambodians as a puppet of Hanoi.
	   The attacks follow the reported deaths of some 60 people in the
past week from poisoning, fueling rumors that ethnic Vietnamese
have tampered with food, water and rice wine.
	   Hun Sen received a major boost in his quest for international
legitimacy when the Association of Southeast Asian Nations endorsed
the election results Friday and urged Cambodia's politicians to
peacefully resolve their differences.
	   ASEAN postponed Cambodia's membership last year after Hun Sen
deposed Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a bloody coup. The vote
was seen as a necessary step toward finally bringing Cambodia into
the regional club.
	   King Norodom Sihanouk meanwhile expressed doubts that crisis
talks he will lead this weekend between the rival parties at his
palace in Siem Reap, near the historic Angkor monuments, will end
the current turmoil.
	   Hun Sen had planned to attend the weekend talks personally, but
a spokesman said Friday that he would instead dispatch three
Cabinet ministers after his opponents insisted they would only send
lower-level representatives.
	   ``I do not have much hope that the three-day meeting will have
the positive result that I want,'' Sihanouk, 75, said in a written
statement. ``The parties have deep conflicts with each other and
have not yet agreed to make any concessions or compromises.''
	   The weekend talks are expected to revolve around technical
issues, mainly the appellate process that the opposition says was
biased in favor of Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party.
	   The CPP won 64 of the 122 National Assembly seats, a slight
majority but short of the two-thirds needed to form a government
alone. Ranariddh, the king's son, and Sam Rainsy have refused to
lend their vital support when the assembly convenes for the first
time Sept. 24.

Gunfire breaks out outside Lesotho palace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Friday's gunfight involving police, soldiers; no

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Police and soldiers exchanged machine gun
fire outside the royal palace of this tiny mountain kingdom Friday,
a news agency said. A police officer reportedly died in the
gunfight.
	   The clash followed another Thursday night in which a man was
killed and 12 people injured, the South African Press Association
reported. The agency first said the victim was killed by police
firing on protesters, but then reported the death came during a
conflict between police and the military.
	   The circumstances of both shootings were unclear. Government
officials said they were investigating.
	   The violence came while protesters demonstrated outside the
palace gates.
	   Supporters of the three main opposition parties have regularly
protested outside the palace of King Letsie III since Aug. 4,
claiming the May election was rigged in favor of the ruling Lesotho
Congress for Democracy, which won 79 of 80 seats in the National
Assembly.
	   Surrounded by South Africa, Lesotho is a nation of 2 million
that has long been plagued by political upheaval.

Amsterdam cable company pulls the plug on CNN
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with comment from CNN and cable
company. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Amsterdam became the only European
capital without CNN on Friday after the news channel refused to pay
what it called an exorbitant fee, prompting the city's cable TV
agency to pull the plug.
	   CNN International faded to black at midnight Thursday, replaced
by a message from cable agency A2000 apologizing to viewers but
saying the American broadcaster gave it no choice.
	   CNN eventually will be replaced by BBC World, Dutch media
reported Friday.
	   The switchoff ended a bitter standoff between Turner
Broadcasting System Europe, which operates CNN, and A2000, which
demanded a 725,000 guilder (dlrs 362,500) annual fee for CNN to air
its round-the-clock programming in the Amsterdam area.
	   TBS argued that the fee was far more expensive than anything it
had to pay in other cities. A2000 defended its charges, saying it
helped keep cable TV subscriptions low in Amsterdam.
	   ``Turner Broadcasting is very disappointed that Amsterdam's city
hall and A2000 could not come to a workable solution,'' Mathieu
Nagelkerke, a vice president of Turner Broadcasting System
Netherlands, said in a statement.
	   He said the financial demands remained unchanged and
``unacceptable,'' adding the company hopes its absence will only be
temporary.
	   But a defiant A2000 said it won't budge.
	   ``All commercial broadcasters need to pay this fee,'' said
Judith Huisman of A2000.
	   A consumer watchdog group intervened last week and brokered
talks between the two sides, but neither side was willing to
compromise.
	   Thousands of irate viewers have been calling A2000 to complain
about the loss of CNN, which is hugely popular among the Dutch and
widely watched by visiting businessmen and diplomats. CNN is still
available via satellite, but relatively few Dutch have the dishes
and decoders needed to watch it that way.
	   Hotels in and around the capital have said they'll install
rooftop dishes to ensure their guests still have access to CNN.
	   CNN follows MTV Europe, Eurosport and The Discovery Channel,
which have also pulled out of Amsterdam in protest over the fee.

	   On the Senate floor Thursday, Lieberman and two other prominent
Democrats _ New York's Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Nebraska's Bob
Kerrey _ sternly denounced Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky and
his handling of the affair's aftermath.
	   Lieberman said the president had ``compromised his moral
authority,'' damaged his credibility and complicated the efforts of
parents seeking to instill ``values of honesty'' in their own
children.
	   Lieberman said Congress should hold off on any action before
receiving a report from independent counsel Kenneth Starr, but that
some form of ``public rebuke'' is warranted.
	   On Friday, Clinton twice used the plain language of apology.
	   ``Basically, I agree with what he said. I've already said
that,'' Clinton said. ``I made a bad mistake. It's indefensible,
and I'm sorry about it.''

overnight losses on Wall Street, political and financial
uncertainty in Malaysia, and another possible downgrade of Hong
Kong's creditworthiness. Shares in Singapore opened slightly lower
over Malaysia's political and financial confusion, with the
benchmark Straits Times Index shedding 0.59 percent to 807.86. In
Malaysia, shares opened sharply higher despite the political and
financial turbulence that came after Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim
lost all government positions when he appeared to challenge Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad's leadership. In Hong Kong, the blue-chip
Hang Seng Index slumped 1.4 percent to 7,216.19 at midday, tracking
a 1.3-percent decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the
United States. In Tokyo, share prices were lower on the overnight
drop in New York and worries about Japanese corporate earnings.

	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Moody's Investors Service Inc. may
downgrade the credit ratings of China and Hong Kong, citing Chinese
export weakness and worries about Hong Kong's financial markets.
The credit-rating agency said Friday it also was considering
downgrading the ratings of four major Chinese state-owned banks. A
downgrade could raise the cost of borrowing for the Chinese
government and banks and make foreign investors more reluctant to
put money into a country where many already are unhappy with low
profits. Even though Hong Kong maintains its own currency, China's
difficulties are also being considered as part of the territory's
review because of Hong Kong's extensive trade ties with the
mainland. While China has avoided a direct hit from the economic
turmoil sweeping Asia, its own problems are increasing, a point
noted by Moody's. (CHINA-MOODY'S)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The ruble tumbled some more Friday, inflation is
rising sharply and the government tried to placate angry Russians
by reversing an order to freeze personal accounts at the country's
largest retail banks. The official ruble rate fell to 16.99 to the
U.S. dollar, or 5.8 cents, down from 13.46 to the dollar, or 7.4
cents, on Thursday. The value on the street was even lower. Acting
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said the government would
continue to let market forces determine the currency's value _ even
though it will mean higher prices. When the economy stabilizes, the
government will press ahead with market reforms, he told the upper
house of parliament, the Federation Council. But in another sign
that the economy was still going downhill, the government announced
that inflation for August was 15 percent _ a sharp escalation from
July's 0.2 percent. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu
said Friday he expects the Philippines' gross national product will
expand 1.5 percent this year, indicating a further slowing of the
country's economy. Officially, the government continues to target
an economic growth rate of between 2 percent and 3 percent this
year, but many economists have been skeptical that even the low end
of the target can be reached. The present target was a downward
revision of an original goal for the GNP to expand by between 3
percent and 4 percent this year. But economic growth has slowed as
a result of Asia's financial crisis, which pushed interest rates
higher, and because of a severe drought which lowered agricultural
production. The government's growth target remains a sticking point
with the International Monetary Fund, which is poised to lend dlrs
1.4 billion under a precautionary loan arrangement.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Handing out their latest no-confidence votes in
Japan's economy, two credit agencies said they are considering
downgrading two more Japanese blue chip companies. Standard and
Poor's said Friday it has placed Hitachi Ltd. on ``CreditWatch'' _
meaning it may soon cut its assessment of the electronics giant's
ability to repay its debts. It currently gives Hitachi a ``double
A'' long-term rating, its third-highest rating. On the same day,
Moody's Investors Service said it has placed Nomura Securities Co.,
Japan's largest brokerage, on review for a downgrade of its credit
rating. Moody's now assigns Nomura a rating of A1, solid but five
ranks below its top rating. The moves are the latest in a series of
credit reviews and downgrades of top Japanese companies by the two
New York-based credit agencies. In all cases, they cited a stubborn
downturn by Japan's domestic economy as their key concern.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The United States considers North Korea's missile
launch over Japan earlier this week a serious threat to Japan's
security and has warned the North against carrying out any further
launches, a senior official said Friday.
	   U.S. officials say North Korea test fired a Taepo Dong 1
ballistic missile on Monday that flew across northern Japan and
crashed into the Pacific Ocean. The first stage, or booster, landed
in the Sea of Japan.
	   The firing was a threat to Japan's national security and the
United States would work with its Asian ally to formulate a
response to that threat, a senior U.S. Defense Official said during
a trip to Japan Friday.
	   One measure would likely be an agreement by Japan to join the
United States in developing a ballistic missile defense system,
said the official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.
	   Also on Friday, Japan's defense chief was quoted as saying Japan
would not rule out a military strike against North Korean bases if
it were under attack by the communist country.
	   In response to a reporter's question, Fukushiro Nukaga, director
general of the Defense Agency, said a government understanding
dating from 1956 permits Japan to carry out such an attack in
self-defense, but only as a last resort, if it were under attack,
Kyodo News reported.
	   Japan has long been wary of its communist neighbor and the
missile launch greatly increased fears here about the possibility,
however remote, of an attack on Japan.
	   In an apparent denial of U.S., Japanese and South Korean claims
that Monday's launch was a test of a military missile, North
Korea's official Korean Central News Agency said Friday that the
country had successfully put its first satellite in orbit.
	   The satellite ``will contribute to promoting scientific research
for peaceful use'' and was broadcasting revolutionary hymns
praising leader Kim Jong-il, KCNA said.
	   On Thursday, Japan placed its forces on increased alert when
signs emerged that North Korea could be preparing for another
launch. Russia's Interfax news agency on Friday quoted an
unidentified Russian military intelligence source as saying the
North was planning a second launch Saturday.
	   The U.S. defense official refused to say whether a second
missile launch was expected.
	   Japanese officials called Monday's launch the first test for the
Taepo Dong 1, a missile capable of striking any part of Japan,
including U.S. military bases that are home to some 50,000 American
troops.

Nurse freed by Saudis pleads innocent to theft and fraud
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUNDEE, Scotland (AP) _ A British nurse convicted in Saudi
Arabia in the murder of an Australian colleague pleaded innocent
Friday to charges of stealing from a dying patient and forging her
application for the Saudi job.
	   Lawyers for Lucille McLauchlan, who did not appear in court,
entered the not guilty plea.
	   The judge, James Scott, set a trial date of Dec. 17 and ordered
McLauchlan to appear in court personally then and for a preliminary
hearing Nov. 17.
	   The case has been adjourned several times since Saudi King Fahd
freed McLauchlan and another British nurse, 39-year-old Deborah
Parry, on May 20 as an ``act of clemency.'' They returned to
Britain and sold their stories to tabloid newspapers.
	   They were convicted in the December 1996 murder of Yvonne
Gilfford, who was stabbed, suffocated and beaten in her room at a
Saudi hospital where all three women worked on contracts.
	   McLauchlan faces charges of stealing 1,960 pounds (dlrs 3,200)
in March 1996 from a patient at Dundee's Kings Cross Hospital by
lifting a credit card and fraudulently using it.
	   She was fired from the Dundee hospital, applied for the Saudi
job and left the country.
	   Prosecutors in the murder case claimed McLauchlan used Gilford's
bank card to steal money after the nurse was killed.
	   Parry and McLauchlan said their confessions to Gilford's murder
were extracted under brutal treatment, and they later retracted
them.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Grief-stricken families from Europe
and the United States headed to Nova Scotia's rocky coast Friday to
confront the task of identifying remains retrieved from the ocean
waters where Swissair Flight 111 crashed into fragments.
	   As authorities drew up plans for protecting the mourners'
privacy, details emerged from far-flung places about the array of
distinguished professionals who were among the 229 people killed in
Wednesday night's disaster.
	   Brilliant doctors, high-powered executives, risk-taking relief
workers were among the dead. Seven of the victims were affiliated
with the United Nations.
	   On Thursday, 137 Americans were reported to be on the flight,
but a re-examination of the passenger list has found there were 132
Americans, Philippe Bruggisser, the head of the airline's parent
company SAir Group, said Friday.
	   Offshore from the quaint fishing village of Peggy's Cove, an
intensive search continued Friday for bodies and remnants of the
MD-11 jumbo jet that crashed after its pilots reported smoke in the
cockpit.
	   ``It's likely to be a bad week here,'' said Ray Boutilier, 72, a
lifelong seaman. ``You never know what you're going to bring up in
your nets.''
	   Officials estimated Thursday night that 60 bodies had been
recovered and taken to a morgue at a military base outside Halifax.
	   Examination of the first few bodies began Thursday. Officials
said none appeared to be burned, indicating that there was no
explosion or large fire.
	   About a dozen grieving family members, clutching one another for
support, silently filed through Halifax International Airport late
Thursday afternoon. Swissair said more than 110 relatives and
helpers were expected Friday on a special flight from Geneva and
Zurich, Switzerland, and others were coming from New York on a
flight arranged by Swissair's partner, Delta Airlines.
	   In a secluded area at Peggy's Cove, barricaded from journalists,
mourners will be able to look out over the ocean waters and watch
boats and aircraft pursue the search.
	   Bruggisser said Swissair would pay out dlrs 20,000 in immediate
financial aid to families who requested it.
	   The MD-11 dropped off radar screens about 90 minutes after
leaving New York's Kennedy International Airport late Wednesday on
its way to Geneva.
	   After a normal takeoff, the crew reported problems on board and
decided to turn back to Boston. They were told the Halifax airport
was closer, but never made it.
	   Keith Anderson, regional director of the Canadian Air Traffic
Association, said the plane's pilot communicated several times with
a control center in Moncton, New Brunswick, before the crash.
	   ``The initial call was to report smoke in the cockpit and the
captain indicated an abnormal situation,'' Anderson said. ``He used
the term PAN which implies an emergency situation, but not a
desperate situation.''
	   Bruggisser said Friday that the pilots put out a ``dense smoke''
call before the ``PAN'' call, but there was no indication whether
there was smoke in the passenger cabin, how dense it was or what
caused it.
	   Divers were preparing to search the sea floor for the plane's
flight recorders, which officials hope will shed light on the cause
of the crash.
	   Canadian and U.S. officials said there were no indications that
the crash resulted from sabotage or a terrorist act, but
investigators were not ruling anything out. The Royal Canadian
Mounted Police called in explosives experts to examine debris for
signs of a possible bomb blast.
	   Canada's Southam newspaper group reported Friday that the U.S.
Federal Aviation Authority had issued a directive in 1996
concerning a wiring problem with the MD-11 aircraft. The agency
said the flaw, if left uncorrected, could lead to a fire and impair
the pilot's ability to control the jet, according to the report.
	   While U.S. airlines were required to fix the problem, the
correction was optional for foreign carriers.
	   Among those on board the jetliner were Dr. Jonathan Mann, an
American who formerly headed the World Health Organization's
anti-AIDS program, and Dr. Roger R. Williams of the University of
Utah, a renowned expert in the field of cardiovascular genetics.
	   The U.N. officials on board included Yves de Roussan, 41, of
Canada, UNICEF's regional adviser for Central and Eastern Europe,
and Pierce Joseph Gerety Jr., 56, a Connecticut native who was in
charge of a U.N. program helping 1.2 million refugees in central
Africa.
	   ``He was constantly seeing death,'' said his brother, Tom,
president of Amherst College.
	   Another victim was John Mortimer, 75, a former senior vice
president of The New York Times.
	   Marc Rosset, Switzerland's top male tennis player and the 1992
Olympic gold medalist, was scheduled to fly on Flight 111, but
decided at the last minute to stay in New York one more night after
losing at the U.S. Open.
	   ``It was a strange feeling when you realize that for just
changing your mind you are still alive,'' Rosset said.

In southern Russia, residents give up explosives for amnesty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Residents of a southern Russian republic have
traded in more than 140 kilograms (300 pounds) of explosives in
exchange for amnesty, a Russian news agency said Friday.
	   Police in the republic of Dagestan guaranteed residents they
would not be punished if they turned in the explosive material, and
authorities received explosives that included foreign-made rocket
fuel, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   There was no word on how many people were involved in handing
over the explosives to authorities.
	   Dagestan has been wracked by violence and kidnappings in recent
months as various religious and ethnic groups battle for power. It
has also been hit by spillover violence from breakaway Chechnya, on
its western border.

Dozens of political groups condemn deputy's sacking
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Politics

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ After a day of stunned silence,
dozens of human rights and political activists on Friday began
denouncing Malaysia's prime minister for sacking his deputy.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar Ibrahim from his
posts of deputy prime minister and finance minister Wednesday after
months of pitched political infighting.
	   Anwar was then dumped as vice president of the ruling United
Malays National Organization late Thursday night.
	   ``The action illustrates the arrogance of the prime minister who
has completely disregarded fairness, due process and political
accountability to the public,'' said Tian Chua, a spokesman for
local human rights group SUARAM.
	   The hugely popular Muslim Youth Movement of Malaysia, founded by
Anwar in his student days, has also rallied behind their deposed
leader, who faces allegations of sexual misconduct and leaking
state secrets.
	   ``This is hypocrisy,'' said Ahmad Azam Abdul Rahman, president
of the youth group, a position occupied by Anwar for years until he
joined Mahathir's ruling party.
	   ``In the course of accusing America and her allies for arrogance
and high-handedness in ganging up on their avowed enemies, our own
political leaders are exactly doing the same thing,'' he said.
	   Dozens of human rights groups and opposition parties, including
Amnesty International, the opposition Democratic Action Party and
Malaysian Trade Unions Congress, issued a joint statement voicing
their protest.
	   ``The total lack of transparency in this episode is a reflection
of the utter contempt and disregard that the prime minister has for
the views of the people of the country,'' the statement said.
	   One of the signatories, Syed Husin Ali, president of the
Malaysian People's Party, said Anwar's ignominious dismissal would
throttle Malaysia's attempt to pull itself out of full-blown
recession.
	   ``In fact, it can cause deeper economic and political crisis,
more serious than what has been experienced by this country in its
short history since independence'' from Britain in 1957, said Syed
Husin.
	   ``Once again, it has exposed Dr. Mahathir's true self as an
authoritarian or even dictatorial leader.''
	   Despite the surging dissent from such groups, hundreds more
Cabinet ministers and senior government officials in the Southeast
Asian nation have chimed in their unwavering support for Mahathir's
``difficult'' decision.
	   ``Let's give the prime minister our full trust and remain
solidly behind him,'' advised Education Minister Najib Tun Razak.
	   Mahathir, after Anwar was expelled from UMNO, said he was
``saddened'' by the unfolding events.
	   ``I wish it hadn't happened, not at this point,'' he said. ``But
these things have gone out of my control.''

Iraq orders jail for butchers selling dog meat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq has ordered jail sentences of up to 10
years for butchers found selling dog or donkey meat in place of
mutton.
	   Some butchers have profited by selling cheap dog or donkey meat
to unsuspecting Iraqis and charging them for mutton.
	   A kilogram (2.2 pounds) of sheep meat costs 3,000 dinars (about
dlrs 2), about half the monthly salary of a government bureaucrat.
	   Meanwhile, smugglers have been spiriting sheep across the border
for sale in Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Syria.
	   Newspapers reported Friday that Iraq's top decision making body,
the Revolutionary Command Council, has ordered that offenders would
be jailed for up to 10 years for selling ``dog or donkey meat or
other sorts deemed unsuitable for human consumption.''
	   The profiteering has been going on for some time and it was
unclear why the government acted now.

Clinton says 'I'm very sorry' about Lewinsky affair
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ President Bill Clinton said Friday ``I'm
very sorry'' about his affair with Monica Lewinsky, which has drawn
sharp rebuke from even his closest Democratic allies.
	   Clearly uncomfortable using an international stage to address
the matter, Clinton spoke hours after Democratic Sen. Joseph
Lieberman of Connecticut called his actions immoral and harmful.
``I can't disagree with anyone else who wants to be critical of
what I've already acknowledged is inappropriate,'' Clinton said in
a photo session with Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern.
	   Clinton has said he regretted his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky
and the months that he misled his family and the American people.
But he has been criticized for not directly apologizing or saying
he was sorry.
	   ``There's nothing that he (Lieberman) or anyone else could say
in a personally critical way that I don't imagine I would disagree
with since I have already said it myself, to myself, and I'm very
sorry about it but there's nothing else I can say,'' the president
said.
	   Asked about talk among some members of Congress that he should
be formally censured, Clinton appeared to grow testy. ``I shouldn't
be commenting on that while I'm here on this trip.
	   ``My understanding is that was not a decision that was made or
advocated clearly yesterday'' on the Senate floor, he went on.
	   ``If that's not an issue I don't want to make it one, one way or
the other.''
	   On the Senate floor Thursday, Lieberman and two other prominent
Democratic senators _ New York's Daniel Patrick Moynihan and
Nebraska's Bob Kerrey _ sternly denounced Clinton's relationship
with Lewinsky and his handling of the affair's aftermath.
	   Lieberman said the president had ``compromised his moral
authority,'' damaged his credibility and complicated the efforts of
parents seeking to instill ``values of honesty'' in their own
children.
	   Lieberman said Congress should hold off on any action before
receiving a report from Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, but that
some form of ``public rebuke'' is warranted.
	   On Friday, Clinton twice used the plain language of apology.
	   ``Basically, I agree with what he said. I've already said
that,'' Clinton said. ``I made a bad mistake. It's indefensible,
and I'm sorry about it.''

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks plunged Friday
following Wall Street's steep overnight fall, with the main index
dropping 2.8 percent to a new six-year low.
	   The Dow Jones Industrial Average's 1.3 percent overnight loss
triggered a rush of foreign selling, traders said.
	   ``Investors feel the market has nowhere to go in the short
term,'' said Juanis Barredo, analyst for Citisecurities Inc.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 33.57 points,
or 2.8 percent, to 1,159.38. The last time the index ended below
that level was on April 13, 1992, when it closed at 1,139.665.
	   The index gave up 4.82 points on Thursday.
	   Edwin Siao, trader for institutional sales of Abacus Securities
Corp., said Wall Street's overnight loss gave foreign investors
more reason to punish Manila shares, which have already weakened
considerably in past sessions as a result of the global economic
slowdown.
	   Not even the peso's gain against the dollar Friday deterred
foreign selling, traders said.
	   The dollar averaged 43.489 pesos, down from 43.506 pesos on
Thursday, as the stronger Japanese yen supported the peso.
	   However, the peso's gains were tempered by a decision by the
Philippine Central Bank to limit the availability of its overnight
borrowing instrument.
	   The move triggered dollar buying at midday, with many banks
unable to place their pesos with the central bank. The dollar was
last traded at 43.760 pesos, near its intraday high of 43.940
pesos.
	   The central bank's move led to speculation that it is
comfortable with the peso's present level and could lower its
overnight rate next week.
	   It has primarily used its overnight borrowing rate to defend the
peso since the start of the year. The rate stands at 16 percent
after being raised from 13 percent when the peso hit a seven-month
low of 44.79 pesos against the dollar on Aug. 10.
	   The central bank has not actively sold dollars in the market to
preserve its foreign currency reserves, which stood at dlrs 10.4
billion at the end of July. A costly defense of the peso at the
height of the regional financial crisis last year caused the
central bank's reserves to fall from a record high of dlrs 12
billion in March last year.
	   Stock traders said Standard and Poor's announcement Thursday
that it has lowered ratings for nine Philippine banks also
contributed to Friday's stock-market selldown. S and P cited
deteriorating asset quality due to the weak economy for the ratings
downgrade.
	   Edison Yap, analyst for Philippine Commercial International Bank
Trust, said the S and P report confirmed fears that local banks
have been affected by the economic slowdown.
	   August inflation figures released Friday had little impact on
Manila shares, said Siao.
	   ``The 10.5 percent August inflation rate was on the better side
of expectations, but at this point, unless there's a big
improvement in inflation, it won't have much of an effect on market
sentiment,'' he said.
	   Inflation was 10.7 percent in July.

U.N. rights chief plays down expectations of China visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The United Nations' top human rights official
Friday played down expectations of her forthcoming trip to China,
giving few details of her program beyond meetings with authorities.
	   Mary Robinson said she hoped to ``interact as far as possible
with the civil society in China'' during her week-long official
visit starting Monday, but declined to elaborate on who she will
meet.
	   ``Clearly, part of not wishing to have unreal expectations is
that a visit of this kind cannot address all of the issues that are
issues of concern,'' the U.N. high commissioner for human rights
told a news conference.
	   Robinson will meet Chinese President Jiang Zemin and deputy
premier Qian Qichen on Sept. 14. Meetings with legal officials,
lawmakers, women's groups and academics are also on her program.
	   Next Thursday, she travels to Tibet. There is ``still some work
to be done'' on the planning of the visit, Robinson said.
	   She is expected to spend two days meeting authorities, local
officials and ``religious authorities and groups.''
	   For years China has been condemned by the West and human rights
groups for suppressing dissent.
	   In an attempt to blunt that criticism, the government this year
said it would sign the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights, meant to guarantee individual liberties. It has
also released some well-known political prisoners.
	   Human rights organizations are particularly concerned about the
clampdown on the independence movement in Tibet. The Chinese seized
the mountainous territory in 1950 and have ruled it as a province
of China ever since.
	   Given Chinese sensitivities over criticism of its rights record,
U.N. officials are anxious not to ruffle Beijing's feathers.
	   It is the first time the U.N. human rights chief has visited the
country. Officials hope it will mark the start of a gradual process
toward improved cooperation and understanding.
	   Robinson said her visit should be seen as such a beginning. She
will be encouraging the government to sign the civil and political
rights covenant and signing a memorandum on technical cooperation
with China.
	   ``One of my very clear objectives ... is that the visit will be
known about throughout China,'' she said.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to include Norinchukin, Kawasaki Steel and NKK being
downgraded or placed on review; Standard and Poor's takes an
ampersand

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Handing out their latest no-confidence votes in
Japan's economy, two credit agencies downgraded a pair of major
Japanese companies and said they are considering cutting the
ratings of three more.
	   Standard and Poor's said Friday it cut its rating of the
creditworthiness of Norinchukin Bank, one of Japan's largest
lenders, and may soon do the same to electronics giant Hitachi Ltd.
	   On the same day, Moody's Investors Service said it lowered the
credit rating of steelmaker NKK Corp. and placed Nomura Securities
Co. and Kawasaki Steel Corp. on review for possible downgrades.
	   The moves are the latest in a series of credit reviews and
downgrades of top Japanese companies by the New York-based credit
agencies. In most of the decisions, the agencies cited a stubborn
downturn by Japan's domestic economy as their key concern.
	   A credit rating reflects the agency's assessment of the
company's ability to repay its debts. A lower rating usually means
higher borrowing costs as the company is seen as a greater risk.
	   In lowering its rating of Norinchukin Bank, Standard and Poor's
cited the ``worsening economic conditions in Japan'' and worries
financial deregulation may rob the bank of its current market
niche, agricultural lending. It cut the bank's long-term rating
from ``double A'' to ``single A plus,'' solid but five ranks below
its top rating.
	   It also said it has placed Hitachi on ``CreditWatch'' _ meaning
it may soon cut its assessment of the electronics giant's ability
to repay its debts. It currently gives Hitachi a ``double A''
long-term rating, its third-highest rating.
	   Standard and Poor's, which downgraded Hitachi just two months
ago, said it may do so again a day after the maker of computers and
consumer electronics announced declining domestic demand will force
it to post its first ever loss in the current fiscal year, which
ends in March.
	   Moody's said it downgraded NKK's long-term debt from ``Baa 2''
to ``Baa3,'' one step above speculative, or ``junk,'' status. The
agency said it expects Japan's second-largest steelmaker to suffer
``a substantial loss'' from the collapse Thursday of affiliate Toa
Steel Co.
	   Moody's said it is considering cutting its rating of Kawasaki
Steel from ``Baa2'' because of losses a lending affiliate has
suffered with the collapse of Japan's land market.
	   And while giving a nod to Nomura Securities' healthy cash
reserves, Moody's said financial deregulation and the economic
slowdown will both eat into profitability at Japan's largest
brokerage. Moody's now assigns Nomura a rating of ``A1,'' its
fifth-highest rating.

U.N. tribunal sentences Rwandan to life for genocide

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ In the first sentence by an
international court for genocide, a U.N. tribunal Friday ordered a
former Rwandan prime minister to serve life in prison for the
slaughter of more than 500,000 of his countrymen in 1994.
	   Jean Kambanda, the highest-ranking former political leader in
the tribunal's custody, stood stoically as the three-judge panel
rejected his pleas for leniency to send a strong signal that
genocide will not be tolerated.
	   ``Jean Kambanda abused his authority and the trust of the
population,'' said Chief Judge Laity Kama of Senegal. ``Nor has he
expressed contrition, regret, or sympathy for the victims in Rwanda
even when given the opportunity.''
	   Gasps of relief rippled through the audience of many Rwandans
who survived the three-month killing frenzy. They had waited
impatiently nearly four years for the tribunal, troubled by
mismanagement and corruption, to sentence its first convict.
	   The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda said the
sentencing of Kambanda, 42, was the first for the crime of genocide
by an international court.
	   All those accused in the post-World War II Nuremberg trials
pleaded innocent to charges including murder and extermination. The
trials pre-dated the creation of the crime of genocide 50 years
ago.
	   Kambanda had sought two years or nothing in exchange for
recording 90 hours of incriminating evidence against other alleged
authors of bloodbath and for pleading guilty.
	   On May 1, the former banker confessed to six counts of genocide
and crimes against humanity, including responsibility for the
murder and extermination of civilians. He was the first person to
accept culpability for genocide before an international court.
	   Defense lawyer Oliver Michael Inglis, who had expected a
sentence of up to 15 years, said he would appeal. He contended
Kambanda was a puppet, manipulated by a powerful and evil military,
and afraid dissent would cost him his life.
	   Deputy Prosecutor Bernard Muna, who had argued that no amount of
evidence against others could offset such wrongdoing, said it was
an ``exemplary sentence. But I am afraid it might dissuade others
from coming forward to plead guilty.''
	   Muna said the prosecution pledged only to protect Kambanda's
wife and two children in exchange for his cooperation.
	   ``Justice has been done by imprisoning Mr. Kambanda,'' Joy
Makanyange, Rwanda's ambassador to Tanzania, said outside the
courtroom. ``This is a historic event.''
	   Kambanda, slight and bearded, is a reviled figure in Rwanda.
Many are haunted by memories of him dressed in fatigues and handing
out weapons to Hutu civilians to hunt down and kill ``Tutsi
cockroaches.''
	   The 42-year-old former banker's crimes ``carry an intrinsic
gravity, and their widespread, atrocious and systematic character
is particularly shocking to the human conscience,'' Kama said,
reading the judgment.
	   Kambanda committed those crimes knowingly and with
premeditation, and most gravely he betrayed his duties as prime
minister to protect Rwanda citizens, Kama said.
	   Kambanda is accused of inciting massacres, ordering roadblocks
to help round up of Tutsis, and presiding over meetings of his
hard-line Hutu government as it planned and tallied the massacres,
Kama sid.
	   More than 500,000 Rwandans, mostly minority Tutsis but also
moderate Hutus, were butchered with machetes and nail-studded clubs
in the carefully orchestrated genocide.
	   The killing that began April 7, 1994, the day after President
Juvenal Habyarimana plane's was shot down and two days before
Kambanda was named prime minister, replacing a woman who was
assassinated.
	   A life sentence is the maximum that can be imposed by the U.N.
tribunal, based in the northern Tanzania town of Arusha.
	   Rwanda has carried out its own prosecutions. In April, Rwandan
firing squads executed 22 people convicted of genocide, the first
executions in connection with the genocide.
	   Kambanda fled Rwanda when Tutsi rebels seized power in July
1994, and was arrested in Nairobi three years later with six other
high-level officials.
	   Kambanda was ordered held at a U.N. prison in the northern
Tanzanian town of Arusha until a final decision is rendered. The
judges have not yet determined where convicts should serve their
terms. At least four European countries have volunteered to take
prisoners, but the tribunal would prefer that they remain in
Africa.

U.N. rights chief plays down expectations of China visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The United Nations' top human rights official
played down expectations Friday of her forthcoming trip to China,
giving few details of her program beyond meetings with authorities.
	   Mary Robinson said she hoped to ``interact as far as possible
with the civil society in China'' during her week-long official
visit starting Monday but declined to elaborate on who she will
meet.
	   ``Clearly, part of not wishing to have unreal expectations is
that a visit of this kind cannot address all of the issues that are
issues of concern,'' the U.N. high commissioner for human rights
told a news conference.
	   Robinson will meet Chinese President Jiang Zemin and deputy
premier Qian Qichen on Sept. 14. Meetings with legal officials,
lawmakers, women's groups and academics are also on her program.
	   Next Thursday, she travels to Tibet. There is ``still some work
to be done'' on the planning of the visit, Robinson said.
	   She is expected to spend two days there meeting authorities,
local officials and ``religious authorities and groups.''
	   For years China has been condemned by the West and human rights
groups for suppressing dissent.
	   In an attempt to blunt that criticism, the government this year
said it would sign the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights, meant to guarantee individual liberties. It has
also released some well-known political prisoners.
	   Human rights organizations are particularly concerned about the
clampdown on the independence movement in Tibet. The Chinese seized
the mountainous territory in 1950 and have ruled it as a province
of China ever since.
	   Given Chinese sensitivities over criticism of its rights record,
U.N. officials are anxious not to ruffle Beijing's feathers.
	   It is the first time the U.N. human rights chief has visited the
country. Officials hope it will mark the start of a gradual process
toward improved cooperation and understanding.
	   Robinson said her visit should be seen as such a beginning. She
will be encouraging the government to sign the civil and political
rights covenant and signing a memorandum on technical cooperation
with China.

Malaysia's political brouhaha comes at crucial time
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Politics

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The sacking of Malaysia's deputy
prime minister Anwar Ibrahim this week amid lurid sexual
allegations couldn't come at a worse time.
	   The economy is in tatters and investors are skittish.
	   Malaysia will serve as the first Asian host of the Commonwealth
Games, which kick off next week after months of preparations and
billions of dollars spent.
	   Queen Elizabeth II is due to arrive in the former British colony
in two weeks for her first state visit in a decade.
	   Throw in the the foreign media who are coming en masse. They
will no doubt will be delighted at the opportunity to spice up
their staid royal and sports copy.
	   ``It's like a person inviting people to his home for a dinner
party, and then just before the party, he bashes his wife,'' said
Syed Husin Ali, president of the opposition Malaysian People's
Party. ``People will come for the dinner, but they'll be wondering
what's really been happening.''
	   Anwar on Wednesday was stripped of his Cabinet posts as deputy
and finance minister after months of bitter wrangling over economic
policy. Late Thursday, Anwar was expelled from the ruling United
Malays National Organization.
	   The ousters came after months of bitter economic policy
differences between Anwar and his one-time mentor, Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad. Many believe Anwar was sacked because he intended
to challenge the ``Old Man'' for leadership of UMNO during next
year's party elections.
	   In an affidavit filed in High Court on Thursday, Malaysia's
Inspector General of Police Rahim Noor said Anwar was under
investigation on charges contained in a book that has widespread
allegations about sexual trysts.
	   The lurid details include allegations by an unidentified man
that Anwar had sodomized him 15 times; that Anwar dressed in a wig
during one apartment rendez-vous; that a business associate rounded
up Chinese, Mexican and Eurasian women.
	   The affidavit regards the case of S. Nallakaruppan, who has been
detained on weapons charges. Nalla, as he is known, is Anwar's
tennis partner and in the book is alleged to have arranged the
ousted minister's sexual trysts.
	   In the document, Rahim said that Nalla was ``believed to have
access to national secrets through Anwar and he likely could leak
these national secrets.''
	   Anwar said Friday he fully expects to be arrested and that he
believes ``hundreds'' of other arrests will follow.
	   And he fully intends to fight.
	   ``True power is with those who are brave enough to demand the
right for reform and change,'' Anwar told some 2,000 worshipers at
his neighborhood mosque during Friday prayers. ``Remember, man can
plan, but God also has his plans.''
	   The protracted political battle could get ugly, with rumors of
mass protests against his ouster already flooding the capital, just
as hordes of tourists and thousands of athletes from around the
world are expected for the games, which begin next Friday.
	   Investors, meanwhile, are still reeling over the unprecedented
economic measures announced in recent days: The economy went into
recession for the first time in 13 years; the central bank's two
top officers resigned; Mahathir banned trading of the ringgit
outside the country and set limits on how much money can come in
and out.
	   Anwar, many feel, was market friendly. But he had been sidelined
for months as Mahathir disagreed with his tight monetary policy and
plans for economic recovery.
	   Now, Mahathir is acting finance minister.
	   ``I think the manner in which it's all been implemented runs the
risk of the country ending up in the belly of the tiger,'' said
Roger Rasiah, associate professor of economics at National
University of Malaya. ``For foreign investors, it further raises
the question of uncertainty and instability.''

	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ President Bill Clinton and his Irish
friends turned Friday from the turmoil in Northern Ireland to the
Irish Republic's thriving economy, holding it up as the prize of
peace.
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern credited Clinton and his role
in brokering the Good Friday peace accord, with holding out that
same promise of prosperity for Northern Ireland.
	   ``He's laid down for us _ for all of us _ that there is a path
to follow and if we are sensible, if we're brave and we follow that
path, then the reward is peace and stability and confidence. If we
don't, well, then the future is as gloomy as the past,'' Ahern said
at a picture-taking session with Clinton before their private
talks.
	   Clinton met with Ireland's business and political leaders as a
new anti-terrorist law took effect in Ireland and Britain Friday.
	   With this trip meant to nudge along the infant peace pact,
Clinton was asked whether he expected to be back in Ireland or
Northern Ireland.
	   ``For for the sake of the peace processs, I hope not. But for my
own sake, I hope so,'' he said, laughingly suggesting that next
time he would come more as tourist than enforcer.
	   Of the now-shaky peace process, Clinton said, ``I hope it will
be institutionalized and off and going.''
	   From central Dublin's Government Buildings, Clinton was heading
to a tour of the Gateway 2000 computer plant in order to highlight
business opportunities in Ireland. Attracting foreign investment
and its stabilizing effects was similarly a theme in Northern
Ireland, which Clinton visited before helicoptering to the Republic
late Thursday.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Grief-stricken families from Europe
and the United States headed to Nova Scotia's rocky coast Friday to
confront the task of identifying remains retrieved from the ocean
waters where Swissair Flight 111 crashed into fragments.
	   As authorities drew up plans for protecting the mourners'
privacy, details emerged from far-flung places about the array of
distinguished professionals who were among the 229 people killed in
Wednesday night's disaster.
	   Brilliant doctors, high-powered executives, risk-taking relief
workers were among the dead. Seven of the victims were affiliated
with the United Nations.
	   On Thursday, 137 Americans were reported to be on the flight,
but a re-examination of the passenger list has found there were 132
Americans, Philippe Bruggisser, the head of the airline's parent
company SAir Group, said Friday.
	   Offshore from the quaint fishing village of Peggy's Cove, an
intensive search continued Friday for bodies and remnants of the
MD-11 jumbo jet that crashed after its pilots reported smoke in the
cockpit.
	   ``It's likely to be a bad week here,'' said Ray Boutilier, 72, a
lifelong seaman. ``You never know what you're going to bring up in
your nets.''
	   Officials estimated Thursday night that 60 bodies had been
recovered and taken to a morgue at a military base outside Halifax.
	   Examination of the first few bodies began Thursday. Officials
said none appeared to be burned, indicating that there was no
explosion or large fire.
	   About a dozen grieving family members, clutching one another for
support, silently filed through Halifax International Airport late
Thursday afternoon. Swissair said more than 110 relatives and
helpers were expected Friday on a special flight from Geneva and
Zurich, Switzerland, and others were coming from New York on a
flight arranged by Swissair's partner, Delta Airlines.
	   In a secluded area at Peggy's Cove, barricaded from journalists,
mourners will be able to look out over the ocean waters and watch
boats and aircraft pursue the search.
	   Bruggisser said Swissair would pay out dlrs 20,000 in immediate
financial aid to families who requested it.
	   The MD-11 dropped off radar screens about 90 minutes after
leaving New York's Kennedy International Airport late Wednesday on
its way to Geneva.
	   After a normal takeoff, the crew reported problems on board and
decided to turn back to Boston. They were told the Halifax airport
was closer, but never made it.
	   Keith Anderson, regional director of the Canadian Air Traffic
Association, said the plane's pilot communicated several times with
a control center in Moncton, New Brunswick, before the crash.
	   ``The initial call was to report smoke in the cockpit and the
captain indicated an abnormal situation,'' Anderson said. ``He used
the term PAN which implies an emergency situation, but not a
desperate situation.''
	   Bruggisser said Friday that the pilots put out a ``dense smoke''
call before the ``PAN'' call, but there was no indication whether
there was smoke in the passenger cabin, how dense it was or what
caused it.
	   Divers were preparing to search the sea floor for the plane's
flight recorders, which officials hope will shed light on the cause
of the crash.
	   Canadian and U.S. officials said there were no indications that
the crash resulted from sabotage or a terrorist act, but
investigators were not ruling anything out. The Royal Canadian
Mounted Police called in explosives experts to examine debris for
signs of a possible bomb blast.
	   Canada's Southam newspaper group reported Friday that the U.S.
Federal Aviation Authority had issued a directive in 1996
concerning a wiring problem with the MD-11 aircraft. The agency
said the flaw, if left uncorrected, could lead to a fire and impair
the pilot's ability to control the jet, according to the report.
	   While U.S. airlines were required to fix the problem, the
correction was optional for foreign carriers.
	   Among those on board the jetliner were Dr. Jonathan Mann, an
American who formerly headed the World Health Organization's
anti-AIDS program, and Dr. Roger R. Williams of the University of
Utah, a renowned expert in the field of cardiovascular genetics.
	   The U.N. officials on board included Yves de Roussan, 41, of
Canada, UNICEF's regional adviser for Central and Eastern Europe,
and Pierce Joseph Gerety Jr., 56, a Connecticut native who was in
charge of a U.N. program helping 1.2 million refugees in central
Africa.
	   ``He was constantly seeing death,'' said his brother, Tom,
president of Amherst College.
	   Another victim was John Mortimer, 75, a former senior vice
president of The New York Times.
	   Marc Rosset, Switzerland's top male tennis player and the 1992
Olympic gold medalist, was scheduled to fly on Flight 111, but
decided at the last minute to stay in New York one more night after
losing at the U.S. Open.
	   ``It was a strange feeling when you realize that for just
changing your mind you are still alive,'' Rosset said.

	   KAWAGUCHIKO, Japan (AP) _ Chieko Nishida shot a 4-under-par 67
Friday for a one-stroke lead in the opening round of the 60 million
yen (dlrs 448,000) Fujisankei Ladies Classic.
	   Nishida, seeking her first victory in four years and sixth

(5,688-meter), par-71 Fujisaki Country Club course.
	   Taiwan's Tseng Hsui-feng was alone in second place at 68.
	   Another stroke back at 69 were kaori Higo and South Korean Shin

Virus forces track star to withdraw from Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Paula Radcliffe, one of England's best hopes for a
Commonwealth Games gold medal, withdrew from the team Friday
because of a virus.
	   Radcliffe, who placed fifth at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and
fourth in the World Championship a year later, has run the
second-best 5,000 meter time in the world this year. But she has
not been able to train due to illness since returning from a
disappointing European Championship campaign in Budapest two weeks
ago.
	   The 24-year-old athlete went into the Euros as a favorite for a
medal after dominating Irish rival Sonia O'Sullivan in a 3,000
meter race at the British Grand Prix in Sheffield.
	   She led most of 25 laps of the 10,000 meters at the Euros but
couldn't kick when it counted and finished fifth as O'Sullivan
claimed the first of her two gold medals for the championship.
	   Radcliffe said the virus made her feel very tired and unable to
train or compete at the highest level.
	   Her withdrawal is another blow for the England team travelling
to Kuala Lumpur, coming two days after triple-jump world-record
holder Jonathan Edwards pulled out after succumbing to a persistent
ankle injury.

Iraq tells Iran to normalize ties by shedding hostilities

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ An influential newspaper on Friday called
on Iran to normalize relations with Iraq by setting aside the
hostilities of their eight-year war.
	   But the comments in the Al-Thawra newspaper sounded less like an
olive branch and appeared more as a rebuke to the Persian nation
for allegedly meddling in the affairs of Iraq and other Arab
countries.
	   Also Friday, the remains of 700 Iranian soldiers killed during
the war were buried at a mass funeral in the Iranian capital,
Tehran.
	   Al-Thawra, the ruling Baath Party's mouthpiece, published the
comments as Iraq commemorated the 18th anniversary of what Baghdad
says was the first day of the 1980-88 war with Iran.
	   ``It is not for Iran's advantage nor the stability of the region
to interfere in other (countries') business,'' Al-Thawra said,
adding that Iran should stop sending its agents to Iraq or other
Arab countries for ``espionage and terrorist activities.''
	   Iraq says the war began Sept. 4, 1980 when Iran sent its
aircraft and army across the Iraqi border to attack checkpoints and
other government installations. More than 1 million people were
killed or wounded on both sides before a U.N.-brokered cease-fire
ended the war.
	   ``Iran is required to prove that Iran of 1998 is not Iran of
1980 and that it is serious in the way of peace, cooperation and
good neighborly principles,'' Al-Thawra said in an editorial.
	   The Iranian regime must ``overcome the results of (the) war and
its outcome, avoiding complications of the past, in order to
normalize relations between the two neighborly countries,''
al-Thawra said.
	   Meanwhile, at the mass funeral in Tehran, over a dozen trucks
laden with 700 coffins draped in Iranian flags carried the remains
of Iranian soldiers to the Behesht-e-Zahra cemetery.
	   A sea of men and women dressed in black and chanting ``God is
great'' followed the cortege, which set out after Friday Muslim
sabbath prayers.
	   Such mass burials are common in Iran where the ceremonies are
sometimes held on holy days after searchers have found and stored a
number of war dead from remote battle sites.
	   The latest remains were discovered during the past four months
by a committee set up to search for troops reported missing during
the war. The number of missing is not known but so far bodies or
remains of over 30,000 people have been recovered.

Congolese rebels study Zimbabwean call for peace talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels on Friday said they were
considering a proposal for all-party peace talks announced by
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, but appeared to have rejected
Zimbabwean mediation.
	   ``I have to discuss it with my movement,'' rebel leader Ernest
Wamba dia Wamba said. ``It's a subject of negotiations who should
be mediator. The peace process can't be dictated by one person.''
	   Wamba said the rebels will make a decision whether or not to
attend later Friday. So far, no invitation had been received, he
said.
	   Mugabe said on Thursday talks involving all those invovled in
the conflict would take place within the next three days.
	   Wamba said the talks must be held in a neutral country and not
Zimbabwe, which, along with Angola and Namibia have sent
reinforcements to bolster President Laurent Kabila's army.
	   The allied forces gave Kabila the military might needed to ward
off rebel advances on the capital Kinshasa, and have threatened to
support the government's drive against the rebels' eastern
strongholds.
	   Wamba suggested if such talks take place, they should be held in
either Tanzania or Zambia.
	   In the past, Kabila has rejected talks with the rebels and
instead demanded the withdrawal of Rwandan and Ugandan troops, whom
he accused of backing the revolt and invading the country.
	   The rebels _ ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of Kabila's
army and opposition politicians _ say the revolt is a Congolese
affair, and accuse Kabila of incompetence, nepotism and corruption
_ problems Kabila had promised to eradicate after ousting longtime
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in May 1997.
	   On Thursday, Arthur Zahidi Ngoma, vice president of the rebel
Congolese Democratic Coalition, said any negotiated settlement with
Kabila was unlikely.
	   ``Democracy cannot be negotiated. The only thing that can be
negotiated is Kabila's departure,'' Ngoma said. ``War will
accelerate, and we are hoping to finish it soon.''

President, lawmakers have limited choices in legal battle

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's national charter lays out strict
procedures for President Boris Yeltsin and parliament in their
battle over confirming a new prime minister.
	   If the State Duma, parliament's lower house, rejects Yeltsin's
candidate or candidates three times, the Constitution says the
president ``appoints the chairman of the Russian Federation's
government (the prime minister), dissolves the State Duma and calls
new elections.''
	   Legal experts say the wording means the president is obliged to
take such action.
	   The Constitution says a newly-elected Duma must be seated within
four months, and the first meeting must be held 30 days after the
election. That effectively gives the country three months to hold
elections.
	   The Duma can protect itself from being disbanded by initiating
impeachment proceedings against the president before voting down
his final candidate for prime minister.
	   It does not take much to initiate impeachment proceedings.
First, at least one-third of the Duma's 450 members vote to accuse
Yeltsin of committing ``state treason or other grave crime.'' A
Duma committee then draws up formal charges. All that has largely
been completed by the Duma.
	   The next step is another Duma vote. If the house votes by a
two-thirds majority to support the charges, it cannot be dissolved
until the upper chamber votes on the issue. This is the vote that
Duma deputies are trying to push onto the ballot next week.
	   However, a positive vote at that stage is still a long way from
actually impeaching the president.
	   The motion must be approved by both the Supreme Court and the
Constitutional Court, and then goes to the upper chamber, the
Federation Council, for a final vote.
	   If parliament's upper chamber, the Federation Council, fails to
hold a vote within three months, the charges are dismissed and the
procedure would have to begin all over again.
	   The courts and the Federation Council all have a large number of
Yeltsin supporters who are unlikely to oppose the president.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin called
Friday for ``economic dictatorship'' to end Russia's crisis and
preserve market reforms as the hard-line opposition said it would
again block his confirmation.
	   Chernomyrdin's hopes of being approved received a boost Friday
when the Federation Council, the upper chamber of Parliament,
passed a non-binding motion 91-17 expressing confidence in the
acting premier.
	   However, the vote that counts was to be held later Friday in the
Duma, the lower chamber of parliament. Communists and hardliners
who control the Duma had been counting on the upper house to reject
Chernomyrdin.
	   Outlining plans to stem the country's economic crisis,
Chernomyrdin said the government would allow the ruble to float
freely, allowing market forces to determine its value. He also said
the government would press ahead with market reforms as soon as the
situation was stabilized.
	   ``Starting in January the government will introduce an economic
dictatorship _ enterprises will be put in the conditions under
which they will not be able to fail under their obligations,'' he
told the Federation Council, which is composed of the country's
regional governors.
	   Russia has been plunged into crisis by the collapse of the ruble
and a power struggle between President Boris Yeltsin and the Duma.
	   The Duma rejected Chernomyrdin on Monday and appeared likely to
reject him again on Friday. His approval could ease the political
instability reigning over Russia, though it would not end the
nation's economic distress.
	   The opposition says it will never approve Chernomyrdin, accusing
him of creating many of the current problems during his previous
five years in the job. Yeltsin has said he will accept no one else.
	   The Federation Council vote to back Chernomyrdin was only
symbolic, but it was expected to increase pressure on the Duma to
find a compromise. The governors who make up the Council have huge
power in their regions and the vote signaled they would back
Yeltsin in any confrontation.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said the Duma would take note
of the upper chamber's vote. He indicated a compromise may be
possible, saying a prime minister should be installed within two or
three days.
	   Just last month, the ruble was trading at 6.2 to the dollar, or
about 16 cents. On Friday, two days after the government said it
was powerless to control the crashing currency, the U.S. dollar was
close to 18 rubles in street trading.
	   Russians were worried, but there was no sign of panic or unrest.
	   Chernomyrdin warned that a quick solution to the political
crisis must be found.
	   ``It may be our last chance to build a normal economy in Russia.
Yes, our actions will be unpopular. Everyone will assail us. But
don't tie the government's hands, give us time to step back from
the precipice. That refers to everyone from the president on
down,'' he said.
	   Chernomyrdin said his economic rescue package would concentrate
on meeting unpaid wages and pensions, closing down bankrupt and
inefficient businesses, getting rid of dishonest managers and
officials, and lowering taxes. He said the government would use
hard currency reserves to back the value of the ruble.
	   ``We will have prices rising. The ruble rate will be falling.
But since every ruble will be insured by our hard currency
reserves, the rate will stabilize,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin met briefly Friday with Chernomyrdin and said he would
not accept any other candidate for premier, Kremlin officials said.
The president may be willing to give the Duma more consultative
powers on appointing ministers, they added.
	   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said the military wanted a quick
end to the crisis and that nobody wanted a repeat of the 1993
confrontation between Yeltsin and parliament that ended with a tank
battle in Moscow.
	   ``We expect the relevant branches of government to make
decisions as soon as possible,'' he was quoted as saying Thursday
by the Interfax news agency, in an apparent warning to lawmakers.
	   ``The armed forces are not in a festive mood,'' he added.
	   The Defense Ministry issued a statement Friday denying that
troops were being moved in to Moscow because of the political
situation.
	   If the Duma again rejects Chernomyrdin, Yeltsin has the option
of proposing him a third time, or choosing a new candidate. If the
Duma votes no for a third time, Yeltsin can call new Duma
elections.
	   Some Duma members were trying to block any attempt by Yeltsin to
dissolve parliament by putting a motion to start impeachment
proceedings on the Duma's agenda for next week.
	   Once impeachment proceedings are under way, the Constitution
bars Yeltsin from disbanding the legislature. However, the
proceedings pose little actual threat to Yeltsin because the
procedures are lengthy and complex.
	   Russia has been operating with an interim government since
Yeltsin fired the previous prime minister on Aug. 23 and named
Chernomyrdin acting prime minister.

Czechs conservative in family role models, but reality is sometimes
</HEADLINE>
different &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Despite sweeping political changes
in public life, Czechs are still conservative in their own view of
the ideal family life: husbands should be moneymakers while wives
should cook, shop and clean house. But reality is sometimes
different.
	   A poll conducted by the state-sponsored IVVM agency found that
74 percent think the man should earn money for the family. Only 26
percent believe both partners should work outside the home and none
of those polled thought a woman should be the sole breadwinner.
	   On the other hand, 81 percent said the woman should do the
cooking as opposed to one percent saying husbands only should
perform that duty.
	   The agency surveyed 1,129 people above 15 years of age during
the first week of August. No margin of error was given.
	   Nevertheless, the survey also showed that personal beliefs are
often different from reality. Of those surveyed, 738 were married
or living with someone of the opposite sex.
	   Despite the overwhelming support for the notion that the man
should earn the money exclusively, only 48 percent of the men
surveyed said that was the case in their home.
	   Forty-six percent of the men said their partners were also
earning income. Twenty-one percent of the men said they do the
shopping, although only one percent thought it was a man's duty.
	   There was one consistency: none of the men thought they should
be primarily responsible for child-care. And none did.
	   ``Reality influences people more than they actually think,''
said Ester Weinholdova, author of the survey.
	   Czechs had been used to decades of communist rule which, despite
trumpeting equality, in fact preserved old stereotypes.
	   Women were often subjected to hard physical labor, but their
emancipation -- publicly promoted by the Communists -- was
virtually non-existent.
	   ``This society is still no used to discussing these issues
publicly, but as you see reality doesn't care and evolves in the
expected direction,'' says Weinholdova.

Asian markets mixed; Malaysian stocks skyrocket
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New thruout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian markets closed mixed Friday, with
Malaysia's key stock index skyrocketing 16 percent on
newly-introduced financial measures restricting trading by
foreigners.
	   Stock prices in Japan were dragged down by Wall Street's hefty
overnight decline, the dismal outlook on corporate profits and the
liquidation of Toa Steel Co. _ Japan's biggest manufacturing
failure since World War II.
	   Taiwanese stocks rallied on new market stabilizing measures.
	   In Malaysia, the Composite Index was at 363.44 points, up 16.1
percent. It has risen 38 percent since Tuesday, when the measures
were announced.
	   Dealers said local funds, retail investors, domestic
corporations and short-term players all poured money into equities,
expecting these measures to boost liquidity and drive down interest
rates.
	   To insulate the bleeding economy from regional ills, the
Malaysian government said its currency, the ringgit, will have no
value outside the country after Oct. 1, and it placed immediate
restrictions on foreigners' use of the currency in transactions and
exchange. It set a value of three ringgit to the U.S. dollar for
use inside the country.
	   It also effectively banned foreign trading of it's country's
shares.
	   While welcomed at home, the measures continued to create
confusion and uncertainty in neighboring markets Friday.
	   In Singapore, the stock exchange suspected trading of Malaysian
shares in the over-the-counter market, and Singapore banks set
their own rate for clearing transactions in the ringgit.
	   Singapore banks, which have large undeclared investments in
Malaysia and hold ringgit accounts, on Friday advised their
customers to settle all their ringgit transactions by Sept. 9.
	   The Straits Times Index fell 7.66 points to 805.04.
	   In Indonesia, the JSX Composite Index plummeted 2.8 percent at
325.556 points on profit-taking and fears that Indonesia may follow
Malaysia's lead by imposing currency restrictions.
	   In Japan, the Nikkei average of 225 selected issues fell 218.33
points, or 1.6 percent, to close at 14,042.91, after a 115.38-point
fall Thursday.
	   In currency trading, the U.S. dollar rose as high as 135.75 yen,
before settling back to 135.41 due to Russian financial woes in
late afternoon trading, down 0.18 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo
but above its late New York level of 134.70 yen overnight.
	   The stronger yen spurred buying in Hong Kong, despite U.S.
losses and another possible downgrade of the territory's
creditworthiness.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 2.3 percent to 7,488.47
points.
	   Following a downgrade this week by rival ratings agency Standard
and Poor's, Moody's Investors Service announced Friday it will
review Hong Kong's long-term and short-term foreign currency
ceilings.
	   In Taiwan, the key Weighted Price Index surged 3.4 percent to
6,463.15, recovering this week's hefty losses.
	   In the Philippines, the key PSE index plunged 2.8 percent to
1,159.30 points, a new six-year low, tracking the Dow Jones
Industrial Average 1.3-percent drop Thursday.
	   ELSEWHERE:
	   BANGKOK: Thailand' key SET index lost 0.09 points to 207.31
points.
	   SEOUL: The Kospi index finished 0.56 points lower at 314.22
points as the yen in Japan, its key export competitor,
strengthened.
	   SYDNEY: Resource and mining stocks enjoyed strong gains, but the
key All Ordinaries index closed 9.3 points lower at 2,504.0.
	   WELLINGTON: The NZSE-40 capital index finished 13.40 points
higher at 1,789.07, but investors remained nervous over global
uncertainty.

Dollar rebounds after tumultuous week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The Australian dollar climbed above 59
U.S. cents for the first time in two weeks Friday, buoyed from
stronger commodity prices and a recent report showing a robust
Australian economy.
	   The local currency gained more than three cents over the week to
close trading Friday at 59.06 U.S. cents from 55.99 last Friday.
	   The rebound in the domestic unit from its new record post-float
low of 55.30 U.S. cents, reached on Aug. 28, was assisted by higher
commodity prices, traders said.
	   Treasurer Peter Costello released figures during the week
showing that the Australian economy grew by 4 percent in 1997-98,
exceeding the budget forecast of 3.75 percent.

Taiwanese politicians buying votes with Viagra
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Impotence drug Viagra has become the gift
of choice of Taiwanese politicians looking to win support at the
polls from voters, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   Candidates in rural Taiwan, where vote buying has long been
rife, are offering influential figures in their local political
machines bottles of the little blue pills, the Independence Evening
News reported.
	   Viagra has not yet been approved for sale in Taiwan, and
smuggled pills _ in demand for the much vaunted boost they give to
sexual performance _ sell on the black market at up to four times
their U.S. price.
	   The higher value bestowed by their illicit status has made the
pills a favorite among those who control votes, pushing aside
imported liquor, cigarettes and good old fashioned cash, the report
said.
	   Viagra is already being smuggled in such quantities that
Taiwan's Health Department has been compelled to produce a public
service announcement reminding television viewers that the drug's
importation can be punished with up to seven years in prison and a
fine of 150,000 Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 4,285).
	   The department is still studying reports of the drug's side
effects from the United States and other countries where it is

Five executed in Beijing for murder, rape, armed robbery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Authorities in Beijing have executed five men
convicted of murder, rape, armed robbery and destruction of public
property, the state-run Beijing Evening News reported Friday.
	   The five were executed by gunshot on Wednesday after the city's
High Court upheld their death sentences, the newspaper said.
	   Mao Hui, a 27-year-old unemployed worker, preyed on young women
returning home at night from work. He raped three, killing one of
the women, and tried to hide her body by burning it, the report
said.
	   Chen Jincai, a farmer from eastern Zhejiang, was convicted of a
slew of armed robberies in the eastern suburbs of Beijing. The
other three men executed were found guilty of armed robbery and of
damaging public telecommunications facilities, the report said.
	   Human rights monitors say China's use of the death penalty has
dropped significantly, although it still executed more people last
year than the rest of the world combined _ some 3,000 people, or
more than eight people a day.
	   Critics say the death penalty is overused, particularly on
China's growing underclass.

Russian ruble falls again, government backs down on bank plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with currencies falling in Belarus, Moldova, scene at
banks. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The ruble tumbled some more Friday, inflation is
rising sharply and the government tried to placate angry Russians
by reversing an order to freeze personal accounts at the country's
largest retail banks.
	   The official ruble rate fell to 16.99 to the U.S. dollar, or 5.8
cents, down from 13.46 to the dollar, or 7.4 cents, on Thursday.
The street level was even lower.
	   Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said the government
would continue to let market forces determine the currency's value
_ even though it will mean higher prices.
	   When the economy stabilizes, the government will press ahead
with market reforms, he told the upper house of parliament, the
Federation Council.
	   ``It may be our last chance to build a normal economy in
Russia,'' Chernomyrdin said, appealing for support. ``Yes, our
actions will be unpopular. Everyone will assail us. But don't tie
the government's hands, give us time to step back from the
precipice. That refers to everyone from the president on down.''
	   But in another sign that the economy was still going downhill,
the government announced that inflation for August was 15 percent _
a sharp escalation from July's 0.2 percent.
	   Month-to-month inflation has been less than 1 percent this year,
and before the financial crisis hit, the annual rate was expected
to be in single digits this year for the first time since
free-market Reforms began in 1992. The inflation rate was 11
percent in 1997 and 22 percent in 1996.
	   The Russian financial chaos was also hurting neighboring
countries. The Belarusian ruble fell to 260,000 to the dollar from
160,000 to the dollar earlier in the week, The Moscow Times
reported. The Moldovan leu fell from 475 to the dollar to 490, the
Interfax news agency said.
	   Meanwhile, the government backed down on its hugely unpopular
plan to prevent the collapse of Russia's banking system by freezing
personal accounts at six of the country's biggest private banks,
news agencies said.
	   The Central Bank ordered the six banks on Wednesday to close
their branches temporarily and transfer all personal accounts to
the national savings bank, Sberbank, where deposits are fully
guaranteed by the government.
	   It said depositors would regain access to their money no later
than Nov. 15, but that they could only withdraw rubles, not foreign
currency, and at the unfavorable exchange rate of 9.33 rubles to
the dollar.
	   Many Russians have both ruble and dollar accounts in commercial
banks.
	   On Friday the government said Russians could retain access to
any accounts opened before Sept. 1 at the six affected banks _
Mosbusinessbank, Inkombank, Most Bank, Menatep, SBS-Agro and
Promstroibank.
	   Most Bank resumed operations Friday, allowing customers to
withdraw both rubles and up to dlrs 2,000 a day.
	   ``We believe this bank. It is the only organization that pays
out money to people, the only bank that pays out foreign
currency,'' said a woman who only gave her first and middle names,
Galina Ivanovna.
	   ``The movement is slow, but at least it continues,'' she added,
as she waited in line to get to a teller.
	   Many in line said they wanted to leave their foreign currency in
the bank and withdraw only as many rubles as they needed for that
day's shopping _ since whatever they don't spend will likely lose
value overnight.

Thai prime minister orders probe on rogue army officer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
has demanded and received a report from the military on how an
officer convicted of heroin trafficking in Australia was reinstated
into the Thai army.
	   The report was handed to Chuan personally by the military's
Supreme Commander Gen. Mongkol Ampornpisit on Friday, said Akaphol
Sorasuchart, the government spokesman.
	   The prime minister is worried that there may be other criminals
who have been allowed into the armed forces, Akaphol said, adding
Chuan had not yet read the report.
	   The criminal background of the officer under investigation,
Capt. Patchara Prompao, came to light earlier this week after he
was arrested on charges of murdering an academic working for
Thailand's top think tank.
	   He allegedly raped the male researcher before killing him after
they got into a dispute at a local discotheque.
	   Upon his arrest, officials at the National Security Council
released information that Patchara's real name was Manas and he had
served as lieutenant in the Thai navy until he was arrested and
imprisoned in 1993 in Australia for heroin trafficking.
	   After he was released, he changed his name and was admitted into
the Thai army as a captain and assigned to the office of the
supreme command.
	   An official with the office said last week that Patchara's
hiring was a mistake that he could not explain, but the story has
raised suspicions that some form of corruption may have been
involved.
	   Thailand's armed forces once had the reputation of being
involved in drug trafficking, but that has diminished in recent
years.
	   However, as recently as last year, Gen. Chetta Thanajaro, army
commander in chief, transferred several high-ranking officers after
a junior officer presented a letter to Chuan alleging that his
commanders were involved in drug dealing.
	   The junior officer alleged that Chetta himself was profiting
from drug money. After he was arrested by the military, he
retracted his statements about high-ranking officers and apologized
to Chetta.
	   Chetta has also periodically warned troops and officers not to
engage in illicit activities such as selling arms or working as
enforcers for criminal bosses.
	   Chuan, who is the first civilian defense minister in 22 years,
has been trying to rein in and clean up the military.
	   One academic who advises the administration on cleaning up
corruption in the Thai police, said, however, that he had been
warned by government officials not to press them to clean up the
military.
	   ``They said it was still to dirty and too dangerous,'' he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.

After summer break, EU foreign ministers find Russia topping
</HEADLINE>
crowded agenda
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) _ European Union foreign ministers, back
from their summer break, open a two-day meeting Saturday with an
agenda featuring Russia's economic chaos and a ``glimmer of hope''
for ending the Kosovo crisis.
	   The 15 European ministers will discuss an analysis of the
Russian turmoil, written by the European Commission, that describes
Russia as a bottomless pit and cautions against pouring money into
it unless Moscow gets its political, economic and financial houses
in order first.
	   ``Anything we would discuss on giving assistance to Russia
cannot yield any results unless the political problems are
addressed,'' EU Foreign Affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek
told reporters in Brussels on rsday.
	   Since Russia represents only 4 percent of the EU's overall
trade, Moscow's economic collapse is expected to have only a
limited impact on the EU economy as a whole.
	   ``Economic prospects in the European Union remain quite good,''
said European Commission President Jacques Santer. The EU economy
has been forecast to grow by 2.8 percent this year, the highest
rate in eight years.
	   Santer said Russia's economic mess was no reason to amend the EU
growth forecast downward, adding, ``All the economic fundamentals
of Europe are sound and stable.''
	   EU officials said German banks are most exposed to Russia's
financial turmoil. Though they have dlrs 30 billion in loans in
Russia, these represent only 8 percent of their overall foreign
exposure.
	   EU governments have granted 1.6 billion in development aid
programs since 1991. The European Commission suggests these be
``retargeted'' to focus on areas crucial to a successful reform of
the Russian economy such as know-how in restructuring companies and
writing sound banking and other laws.
	   The commission's assessment did not include a judgment on what
the Russian crisis means for the political stability in Russia.
	   The foreign ministers will also return to the situation in
Kosovo where, though fighting continues, U.S. special envoy
Christopher Hill has won an agreement in principle from Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and the main Kosovo Albanian leader,
Ibrahim Rugova, for an interim accord granting self-rule to
Kosovo's Albanian majority.
	   The accord, which could still take months to finalize, falls
short of the Albanian Kosovars' demand for full independence but
would be reviewed after about three years.
	   Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel, chairman of the EU
meeting, said this week, ``For the first time there is a glimmer of
hope'' in Kosovo.
	   On Friday, Rugova said he would try to win over hardliners _
notably the Kosovo Liberation Army, many of whose members oppose
Rugova because of his disavowal of violence _ to a peace process.
``The possibility of an interim and temporary accord is under
consideration,'' he said.
	   He added it would ``normalize life'' during the interim period
and ``create conditions for a lasting solution.''

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ President Bill Clinton said Friday ``I'm
very sorry'' about his affair with Monica Lewinsky, which has drawn
sharp rebuke from even his closest Democratic allies.
	   Clearly uncomfortable using an international stage to address
the matter, Clinton spoke hours after Democratic Sen. Joseph
Lieberman of Connecticut called his actions immoral and harmful.
``I can't disagree with anyone else who wants to be critical of
what I've already acknowledged is inappropriate,'' Clinton said in
a photo session with Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern.
	   Clinton has said he regretted his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky
and the months that he misled his family and the American people.
But he has been criticized for not directly apologizing or saying
he was sorry.
	   ``There's nothing that he (Lieberman) or anyone else could say
in a personally critical way that I don't imagine I would disagree
with since I have already said it myself, to myself, and I'm very
sorry about it but there's nothing else I can say,'' the president
said.
	   Asked about talk among some members of Congress that he should
be formally censured, Clinton appeared to grow testy. ``I shouldn't
be commenting on that while I'm here on this trip.
	   ``My understanding is that was not a decision that was made or
advocated clearly yesterday'' on the Senate floor, he went on.
	   ``If that's not an issue I don't want to make it one, one way or
the other.''
	   White House spokesman Mike McCurry, asked if Clinton had made a
calculated decision to use the phrase ``I'm sorry,'' insisted
that's what the president has been trying to convey since his Aug.
17 address to the nation when he said he deeply regreted his

	   ``He believes that's what he has been saying all along, and that
I'm sorry means I'm sorry,'' McCurry said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Duma began debating Friday the confirmation of
acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin for a second time with
hard-line lawmakers saying he would not be approved.
	   President Boris Yeltsin nominated Chernomyrdin to head the

	   Yeltsin must dissolve the Duma and call new elections if his

Congolese rebels study Zimbabwean call for peace talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES the rebels object to, not reject, Zimbabwean
mediation in 1st graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels on Friday said they were
considering a proposal for all-party peace talks announced by
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, but appeared to have objected
to Zimbabwean mediation.
	   ``I have to discuss it with my movement,'' rebel leader Ernest
Wamba dia Wamba said. ``It's a subject of negotiations who should
be mediator. The peace process can't be dictated by one person.''
	   Wamba said the rebels will make a decision whether or not to
attend later Friday. So far, no invitation had been received, he
said.
	   Mugabe said on Thursday talks involving all those invovled in
the conflict would take place within the next three days.
	   Wamba said the talks must be held in a neutral country and not
Zimbabwe, which, along with Angola and Namibia have sent
reinforcements to bolster President Laurent Kabila's army.
	   The allied forces gave Kabila the military might needed to ward
off rebel advances on the capital Kinshasa, and have threatened to
support the government's drive against the rebels' eastern
strongholds.
	   Wamba suggested if such talks take place, they should be held in
either Tanzania or Zambia.
	   In the past, Kabila has rejected talks with the rebels and
instead demanded the withdrawal of Rwandan and Ugandan troops, whom
he accused of backing the revolt and invading the country.
	   The rebels _ ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of Kabila's
army and opposition politicians _ say the revolt is a Congolese
affair, and accuse Kabila of incompetence, nepotism and corruption
_ problems Kabila had promised to eradicate after ousting longtime
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in May 1997.
	   On Thursday, Arthur Zahidi Ngoma, vice president of the rebel
Congolese Democratic Coalition, said any negotiated settlement with
Kabila was unlikely.
	   ``Democracy cannot be negotiated. The only thing that can be
negotiated is Kabila's departure,'' Ngoma said. ``War will
accelerate, and we are hoping to finish it soon.''

Suharto son to testify about alleged misconduct at troubled bank
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with police denying they issued an arrest
warrant for Suharto son and that he had already testified; ADDS
security tightened at airport

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Police have summoned a son of former
President Suharto to testify about allegations of misconduct at a
troubled bank he partly owns, a senior police official said Friday.
	   Indonesia's chief of police intelligence, Maj. Gen. Da'i
Bachtiar, denied newspaper reports that an arrest warrant had been
issued for Bambang Trihatmodjo and that the tycoon had already
testified. The newspapers cited a high-ranking police official.
	   Ten Bank Andromeda commissioners and directors, including
Bambang, face summonses to respond to accusations that the bank,
now closed, had allegedly violated lending limits.
	   ``We'll only issue arrest warrants on them if they ignore our
summons,'' Da'i said.
	   He said arrest warrants had been prepared. He did not say when
Bambang was scheduled to testify.
	   Some 96 bankers are currently under investigation as Indonesia
tries to clean up its banking system. Police have tightened
security at a Jakarta airport where some bankers keep private
planes, fearing they might try to flee abroad, Justice Minister
Muladi said Friday.
	   The companies of Suharto, his children and associates have come
under scrutiny since the former army general quit in May following
riots and student protests. The Suharto clan erected a huge
business empire during the 32 years that the autocrat held sway
over Indonesia.
	   Suharto's downfall stemmed largely from public discontent over
Indonesia's worst economic crisis in decades. Critics allege
widespread corruption by the Suharto family contributed to the
turmoil, and the reform-minded government has pledged to curb
graft.
	   There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy in
reports about Bambang's legal situation.
	   Most of Indonesia's national newspapers, published in Jakarta,
carried big headlines announcing that an arrest warrant had been
issued for Bambang. They cited Brig. Gen. Togar Sianipar, the
national police spokesman.
	   Suharto has three sons and three daughters. Bambang is his
second son.
	   Bank Andromeda is one of 21 banks that have been referred to the
police by the central bank, Bank Indonesia, for investigation into
possible violations of the country's banking laws.
	   Suharto's own enterprises are also being investigated.
	   Earlier this week, the government said evidence indicates
charities set up and controlled by Suharto misused their funds.
Critics have alleged that funds from the charities were funneled
into companies owned by the Suharto family.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A thief stole retired Portuguese soccer
star Eusebio's luggage Friday when he arrived at Lisbon airport for
a flight to join the national team for its Euro 2000 game against
Hungary in Budapest.
	   ``I opened the trunk while my wife went to get a trolley. Before
I knew it, my bag was gone,'' the former Benfica striker told
Lisbon radio TSF.
	   His travel plans were delayed while he waited for another plane
ticket and visa to be issued.
	   Eusebio, who is Portugal's official ``soccer ambassador,'' was
on his way to meet the Portuguese team which is due to play in

Clinton highlights Irish economy as prize of peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW throughout with meeting details,  &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ President Bill Clinton and his Irish
friends turned Friday from the turmoil in Northern Ireland to the
Irish Republic's thriving economy, holding it up as the prize of
peace.
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern credited Clinton and his role
in brokering the Good Friday peace accord with boosting the promise
of prosperity for Northern Ireland.
	   ``He's laid down for us _ for all of us _ that there is a path
to follow and if we are sensible, if we're brave and we follow that
path, then the reward is peace and stability and confidence. If we
don't, well, then the future is as gloomy as the past,'' Ahern said
at a picture-taking session with Clinton before their private
meeting.
	   Clinton said the Irish can set an example for warring peoples in
the Middle East and elsewhere. ``The potential impact of resolving
this could wash over many more people than live on this island,''
he said.
	   His talks with Ahern focused on the momentum in Northern Ireland
to work out a new governing formula for parties there and on the
province's ties to Britain and the Irish Republic, White House
spokesman Mike McCurry said.
	   From central Dublin's Government Buildings, Clinton was heading
to a tour of the Gateway 2000 computer plant in order to highlight
business opportunities in Ireland.
	   Clinton met with Ireland's business and political leaders as new
anti-terrorist laws took effect in Ireland and Britain Friday. The
legislation is expected to bolster political efforts by Protestants
and Catholics to make peace in Northern Ireland after 30 years of
conflict.
	   With this trip meant to nudge along the infant peace pact,
Clinton was asked whether he expected to visit the Irish again.
	   ``For for the sake of the peace processs, I hope not. But for my
own sake, I hope so,'' he said, laughingly suggesting that next
time he would come more as tourist than enforcer.
	   Of the fragile peace process, Clinton said, ``I hope it will be
institutionalized and off and going.''
	   The showers of Irish praise for Clinton on this tour were
briefly interrupted with a jolt this morning as Clinton again faced
criticism about his handling of the Monica Lewinsky affair.
	   Standing before news cameras with Ahern at his side, Clinton was
peppered with reporters' questions about Democratic Sen. Joseph
Lieberman's call for a formal ``public rebuke.'' For the first time
since admitting an inappropriate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky,
Clinton publicly used the words ``I'm sorry'' in expressing regret
for his actions.
	   U.S. investment has been a major factor in the growth of the
Irish economy. Trade between the two countries last year was worth
about dlrs 12 billion, a 19 percent increase over 1996.
	   Attracting foreign investment and its stabilizing effects was
similarly a theme in Northern Ireland, which Clinton visited before
traveling to the Republic late Thursday.
	   ``Visit here and we will welcome you; invest here and we will
work with you. And if they didn't already know it, let the rest of
the world take note: Northern Ireland is back in business,'' David
Trimble, first minister designate of the province's new assembly,
declared.
	   The president came to Dublin from Omagh, Northern Ireland, where
he was ``very touched'' by his walk down the street where 28
people, mostly women and children, were killed and hundreds wounded
in an Aug. 15 attack.
	   The car bombing, Northern Ireland's worst terror attack, was
blamed on Irish Republican Army extremists trying to wreck Northern
Ireland's peace agreement.
	   The new anti-terrorist law, written in the wake of the attack,
became law in Ireland late Thursday while in Britain the
legislation was sent to the queen for her signature, a formality
for the measure to become law.
	   Both governments sought passage of the bills during Clinton's
visit.
	   Following the meeting with Ahern and a lunch reception at the
Royal College of Surgeons, Clinton was heading to Gateway's Dublin
plant, which employs 1,300 people primarily producing personal
computers for the European market. Gateway is considered a symbol
of the decade-long economic boom that has seen American
corporations build facilities in Ireland to service the European
market.

Pope criticizes use of force in Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy (AP) _ Pope John Paul II criticized
Friday the attempt at achieving a ``military solution'' in the
Congo, telling bishops from Zimbabwe that such use of force will
only cause further grievances and injustice.
	   Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe has sent 3,000 troops into the
Congo, backing President Laurent Kabila in a war against rebels.
Angola and Namibia have also sent troops to help Kabila.
	   John Paul decried the spread of armed conflict ``in various
parts of Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo.''
	   ``Yours is a peaceful nation,'' he told the visiting Roman
Catholic bishops from Zimbabwe. ``You must work to keep it so by
reminding your people that a military solution to profound social
and economic problems will always be an illusion and will be the
cause of further grievances and injustices.''
	   Discussing Zimbabwe's problems, one of the bishops said that
AIDS is expected to create more than a million orphans by 2000.
	   ``It is more than just a medical problem. It indeed needs a more
radical approach of instilling moral values in our people,'' said
Bishop Alexio Churu Muchabaiwa in his address during the meeting at
the pope's vacation palace in the Alban Hills south of Rome.

Ethnic Albanian leader welcomes interim agreement for Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The top ethnic Albanian leader
Friday welcomed a tentative, U.S.-mediated formula for ending the
Kosovo crisis and indicated he would try to win over hardliners to
a peace process rather than continue the battle for full
independence.
	   Fighting continued for a third day Friday near Orahovac, 55
kilometers (34 miles), southwest of Pristina. American and European
leaders have urged an end to the violence so that U.S.-led
diplomacy can prevent a humanitarian disaster among tens of
thousands of refugees left homeless by the conflict.
	   Speaking to reporters, Ibrahim Rugova said ``the possibility of
an interim and temporary accord is under consideration,''
confirming U.S. and Belgrade statements issued over the past few
days.
	   Such an agreement, Rugova said, would last for a period of three
years and its principal objective would be to ``normalize life'' in
the embattled province and ``create conditions for a lasting
solution.''
	   ``We have to do something to end the negative trends and prevent
an imminent tragedy for Kosovo, '' Rugova said, adding this can
only be achieved with the help of the Americans and Europeans.
	   As part of that international effort, Russian Deputy Foreign
Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky was to meet Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade later Friday, Belgrade's independent
radio B-92 reported.
	   The radio said Russian official would brief Milosevic on the
U.S.-Russia summit, in which both President Clinton and Russian
President Boris Yeltsin called for a diplomatic solution in Kosovo.
	   In Vienna, Austria, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
both Rugova and Milosevic had agreed in principle on a formula for
self-rule for the majority Albanian province, subject to review
after three years.
	   The agreement would fall short of Albanian demands for full
independence from Serbia, a part of Yugoslavia. Fighting is
continuing, and details will require months of negotiations, which
would break down if the violence does not end.
	   Still, Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel said the
framework offers the ``first glimmer of hope'' for a peaceful end
to more than six months of fighting.
	   The key to the success could be the Kosovo Liberation Army, many
of whose members oppose Rugova because of his disavowal of
violence. But Western diplomats hope that enough KLA members will
eventually accept the diplomatic process, leaving hard-liners
isolated politically within the Albanian community.
	   Asked whether he could win over the KLA to the formula, Rugova
said he represents ``all residents of Kosovo,'' indicating he would
take responsibility for building support among the Albanian
community, which makes up 90 percent of the 2 million Kosovo
population.
	   Fighting in Kosovo escalated in March after Milosevic launched a
crackdown to destroy the KLA, whom the Serbs describe as
``terrorists.''
	   As part of the U.S. diplomatic effort, John Shattuck, U.S.
assistant secretary of state for human rights, was expected in
Belgrade and Pristina later Friday. Former Sen. Bob Dole, who lost
the presidency to President Clinton in 1996, is also due here in
the area on the weekend.

England boss given one last chance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ David Lloyd's popularity among the England cricket
players and the team's recent test-series win over South Africa
saved him from being fired as national coach. But he is on his last
chance.
	   Lloyd was Friday concentrating on England's preparations for its
visit to Bangladesh and the subsequent Ashes tour of Australia but
only after escaping with another warning about his conduct from the
English Cricket Board.
	   The ECB summoned Lloyd to explain his criticism of Sri Lankan
off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan's bowling action and his public
spat with television commentator and former batting star Geoffrey
Boycott during the one-off test at the Oval.
	   Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga attributed Muriltharan's
remarkable 16-wicket haul in the tourists' 10-wicket win over
England on Monday to Lloyd's attack on the spinner's unusual
bowling action.
	   Muralitharan, the leading international bowler this year with 68
wickets, has a rare condition which means he cannot straighten his
arm and his action has been cleared by the International Cricket
Council.
	   His action caused some controversy two years ago in Australia
but medical tests have proved his action does not breach the rules
of cricket, which do not allow deliberately throwing the ball with
a bent arm.
	   Lloyd's confrontation with Boycott, a former England captain,
came after the team's disastrous loss when he reacted to the
pundit's comment that ``England should get a coach who keeps his
mouth shut.''
	   As the Sri Lankan team left England Thursday, Ranatunga said he
didn't care if Lloyd was fired.
	   He wasn't fired but he was given every indication by the ECB
that he will get no more warnings.
	   ``David Lloyd has been severely reprimanded, warned again about
his conduct and left in no doubt as to the responsibilities which
go with such a high-profile position,'' ECB chief executive Tim
Lamb said.
	   Lloyd, who was given a warning for his conduct after making
accusations about the tied test between England and Zimbabwe two
years ago, issued an apology after his meeting with Lamb.
	   ``I am sorry for the offense that I have caused,'' he said.
	   ``I am glad this whole business is over and I am looking forward
to the Wills International Cup and to the Ashes tour.''

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Duma postponed Friday a vote on approving the
acting prime minister, avoiding a confrontation with President
Boris Yeltsin as pressure mounted on hard-line lawmakers to
compromise.
	   Lawmakers voted 294-54 to postpone the vote after parliament
leaders said Yeltsin had called for more talks. The Duma had been
expected Friday to reject acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
for a second time.
	   The decision to postpone a vote indicated the hardliners were no
longer confident of winning their confrontation with Yeltsin and
were looking for a way out.

	   The dramatic turnabout came after Chernomyrdin's hopes of being
approved received a boost Friday when the Federation Council, the
upper chamber of Parliament, passed a non-binding motion 91-17
expressing confidence in the acting premier.
	   The Duma's agreement to more talks with Yeltsin boosted
Chernomyrdin's hopes of approval. Yeltsin still retains enormous
power and had appeared to regain the political initiative in the
past few days.
	   Russia had been plunged in to crisis by the collapse of the
currency. the ruble, and a power struggle between the Duma and
Yeltsin. Russians have been deeply worried, but there has been no
sign of panic or unrest.
	   Speaking earlier, Chernomyrdin outlined measures to stem the
country's economic crisis, Chernomyrdin said the government would
allow the ruble to float freely, allowing market forces to
determine its value. He also said the government would press ahead
with market reforms as soon as the situation was stabilized.

	   ``Starting in January the government will introduce an economic
dictatorship _ enterprises will be put in the conditions under
which they will not be able to fail under their obligations,'' he
told the Federation Council, which is composed of the country's
regional governors.
	   The Duma rejected Chernomyrdin on Monday in a first vote. His
approval could ease the political instability reigning over Russia,
though it would not end the nation's economic distress.
	   The opposition says it will never approve Chernomyrdin, accusing
him of creating many of the current problems during his previous
five years in the job. Yeltsin has said he will accept no one else.
	   The Federation Council vote to back Chernomyrdin was only
symbolic, but it may have increased pressure on the Duma to find a
compromise. The governors who make up the Council have huge power
in their regions and the vote signaled they would back Yeltsin in
any confrontation.
	   Just last month, the ruble was trading at 6.2 to the dollar, or
about 16 cents. On Friday, two days after the government said it
was powerless to control the crashing currency, the U.S. dollar was
close to 18 rubles in street trading.
	   Chernomyrdin warned that a quick solution to the political
crisis must be found.
	   ``It may be our last chance to build a normal economy in Russia.
Yes, our actions will be unpopular. Everyone will assail us. But
don't tie the government's hands, give us time to step back from
the precipice. That refers to everyone from the president on
down,'' he said.
	   Chernomyrdin said his economic rescue package would concentrate
on meeting unpaid wages and pensions, closing down bankrupt and
inefficient businesses, getting rid of dishonest managers and
officials, and lowering taxes. He said the government would use
hard currency reserves to back the value of the ruble.
	   ``We will have prices rising. The ruble rate will be falling.
But since every ruble will be insured by our hard currency
reserves, the rate will stabilize,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin met briefly Friday with Chernomyrdin and said he would
not accept any other candidate for premier, Kremlin officials said.
The president may be willing to give the Duma more consultative
powers on appointing ministers, they added.
	   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said the military wanted a quick
end to the crisis and that nobody wanted a repeat of the 1993
confrontation between Yeltsin and parliament that ended with a tank
battle in Moscow.
	   ``We expect the relevant branches of government to make
decisions as soon as possible,'' he was quoted as saying Thursday
by the Interfax news agency, in an apparent warning to lawmakers.
	   ``The armed forces are not in a festive mood,'' he added.
	   The Defense Ministry issued a statement Friday denying that
troops were being moved in to Moscow because of the political
situation.
	   If the Duma again rejects Chernomyrdin, Yeltsin has the option
of proposing him a third time, or choosing a new candidate. If the
Duma votes no for a third time, Yeltsin can call new Duma
elections.
	   Some Duma members were trying to block any attempt by Yeltsin to
dissolve parliament by putting a motion to start impeachment
proceedings on the Duma's agenda for next week.
	   Once impeachment proceedings are under way, the Constitution
bars Yeltsin from disbanding the legislature. However, the
proceedings pose little actual threat to Yeltsin because the
procedures are lengthy and complex.
	   Russia has been operating with an interim government since
Yeltsin fired the previous prime minister on Aug. 23 and named
Chernomyrdin acting prime minister.

Yemen executes two for murder

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Two men were executed for murder in the
northern town of Taiz Friday and their bodies nailed to a wooden
board in a public square, the prosecutor's office said.
	   Fadl Ahmad Sakra and Zeid Sultan Iyoon were executed in the main
town square by a firing squad at dawn, said a statement by the
prosecutor's office. The execution was attended by a large crowd
including government officials and the victim's relatives, it said.
	   Their bodies were then impaled on the board and left in the
square for the next three days.
	   Sakra and Iyoon were convicted of murdering and robbing Nassr
Ali Himsan in February, 1997.
	   Yemen, an impoverished country at the tip of the Arabian
Peninsula, applies the death penalty for rape and murder. Most
executions are carried out in public to set an example.

Muslim's candidates for the presidency canceled to participate in

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The televised pre-election
debate of candidates for the Muslim slot in the collective
presidency was called off late Thursday because four of the five
candidates canceled their participation.
	   Alija Izetbegovic, the current chairman of Bosnia's three-member
presidency, backed out of the debate Thursday morning. The
spokesman of his party, Ismet Grbo, said Izetbegovic's opinion is
``well known to the public'' and that an interview with him will be
broadcast by two independent stations, Studio 99 TV and Radio Free
Europe.
	   Fikret Abdic, a war-time opponent of Sarajevo's Muslim-led
government, dropped out after failing to receive special security.
Forces loyal to Abdic fought alongside the Bosnian Serbs against
the Muslim-led Bosnian Army in the west of the country.
	   Abdic lives in Rijeka, Croatia, and is considered a traitor by
many of the Muslim population, especially those in Sarajevo. He
asked for a direct TV link from his headquarters in Rijeka with the
other participants in the studio or special security measures,
which the Organization for Security and Cooperation could not
provide.
	   The third candidate, Hajrija Rahmanovic, from the Bosnian Party,
a minor opposition party, canceled her participation claiming an
exchange of opposite opinions would not be achieved since
Izetbegovic wasn't part of the discussion.
	   The only one that was ready to appear Thursday evening was
former Bosnian Army general Sefer Halilovic as head of the Bosnian
Patriotic Party.
	   Nicole Szulc, the spokeswoman for the OSCE, said Friday that
Izetbegovic's refusal to debate was depriving the voters of an
opportunity to see the potential presidential candidates discussing
issues the country is facing.
	   ``We, of course, think it's a great pity ... that that
opportunity was denied to them,'' she added.
	   Before the Sept. 12-13 national election, the OSCE will organize
debates of candidates for the Bosnian Croat and Serb members of the
three-member presidency.

Tokyo prosecutors raid electronics giant NEC in defense scandal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with arrest of a former top defense official

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo prosecutors arrested a former Defense Agency
official Friday in a widening scandal involving alleged shady ties
between Japan's military officials and defense equipment
contractors.
	   Masuo Morodomi, former chief of the Defense Facility Agency, was
arrested for allegedly helping a supply company keep profits it
made from overcharging the government for military equipment,
prosecutors said.
	   Earlier Friday, prosecutors raided NEC headquarters to
investigate any role it may have played in the scandal involving
Defense Agency officials and an NEC-affiliate Toyo Communication
Equipment Co.
	   Prosecutors were searching NEC's Tokyo headquarters but the
company would make no comment until more was known about the
investigation, said NEC spokesman Aston Bridgeman.
	   On Thursday, prosecutors arrested a retired former senior
Defense Agency official and three executives from NEC-affiliate
Toyo Communication Equipment Co. in connection with the procurement
scandal. Prosecutors also raided the central Tokyo headquarters of
the Defense Agency on Thursday.
	   Toyo Communications had been ordered to repay 2.5 billion yen
(dlrs 18.2 million) to the government in 1994 for having sold
overpriced equipment over a five-year period. But it wound up
having to return only 874 million yen (dlrs 6.4 million) to
government coffers.
	   Defense officials allegedly went along with the deal in exchange
for private-sector jobs after retirement from the agency.
	   Prosecutors on Thursday arrested Kenichi Ueno, a former deputy
director of the procurement department at the Defense Agency.
	   Ueno is suspected of reducing the amount of money Toyo had to
reimburse the government after overcharging for military supplies.
	   Prosecutors also arrested Toyo Communication President Shinichi
Ito and Sales Director Yasunori Nagamoto, along with Hideo Arai, a
former defense project promotion chief at NEC _ the largest
shareholder in Toyo Communications _ and the current head of
another NEC affiliate.

Iraq tells Iran to normalize ties by ending hostilities

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ An influential newspaper on Friday called
on Iran to normalize relations with Iraq by setting aside residual
hostilities from their eight-year war.
	   But the comments in the Al-Thawra newspaper sounded less like an
olive branch than a rebuke to the Persian nation for allegedly
meddling in Iraq's internal affairs.
	   In Iran, meanwhile, the remains of 700 Iranian soldiers killed
during the war were buried Friday at a mass funeral in the capital,
Tehran.
	   Al-Thawra, the mouthpiece of Iraq's ruling Baath Party,
published its call for normal relations as Iraq commemorated the
18th anniversary of what Baghdad considers the first day of the
1980-88 war with neighboring Iran.
	   ``It is not for Iran's advantage nor the stability of the region
to interfere in other (countries') business,'' Al-Thawra said,
adding that Iran should stop sending its agents to Iraq or other
Arab countries for ``espionage and terrorist activities.''
	   Iraq says the war began Sept. 4, 1980 when Iran sent its
aircraft and army across the Iraqi border to attack checkpoints and
other government installations. More than 1 million people were
killed or wounded on both sides before a U.N.-brokered cease-fire
ended the war.
	   ``Iran is required to prove that Iran of 1998 is not Iran of
1980 and that it is serious in the way of peace, cooperation and
good neighborly principles,'' Al-Thawra said in an editorial.
	   The Iranian regime must ``overcome the results of (the) war and
its outcome, avoiding complications of the past, in order to
normalize relations between the two neighborly countries,''
al-Thawra said.
	   At the mass funeral in Tehran, more than a dozen trucks laden
with 700 coffins draped in Iranian flags carried the remains of
Iranian soldiers to the Behesht-e-Zahra cemetery.
	   A sea of men and women dressed in black and chanting ``God is
great'' followed the cortege, which set out after Friday's Muslim
sabbath prayers.
	   Mass burials have been common in Iran, where the ceremonies are
sometimes held on holy days after searchers locate the remains of
soldiers killed at remote battle sites.
	   The latest remains were discovered during the past four months.
The total number of Iranian and Iraqi soldiers still missing from
the war is not known, although Iran says it has recovered the
bodies or remains of 30,000 missing Iranians.

	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Two men were executed for murder in the
northern town of Taiz Friday and their bodies left in a public
square for the next three days, the prosecutor's office said.
	   Fadl Ahmad Sakra and Zeid Sultan Iyoon were executed in the main
town square by a firing squad at dawn, said a statement by the
prosecutor's office. The execution was attended by a large crowd
including government officials and the victim's relatives, it said.
	   Their bodies were then tied with ropes to a wooden board in the
square where they will remain for three days, the statement said.
	   Sakra and Iyoon were convicted of murdering and robbing Nassr
Ali Himsan in February, 1997.
	   Yemen, an impoverished country at the tip of the Arabian
Peninsula, applies the death penalty for rape and murder. Most
executions are carried out in public to set an example.

Jones et al need one more win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Now would not be a good time for Marion Jones,
Bryan Bronson or Hicham El Guerrouj to finish second.
	   Those young stars, along with long-distance king Haile
Gebrselassie, can earn a share of a dlrs 1 million jackpot at the
IAAF Grand Prix Finals Saturday by winning their races to complete
perfect seasons.
	   ``I'm not counting my money before I have it,'' said Bronson,
25, who needed a photo finish earlier this week to edge world
champion Stephane Diagana in Berlin and keep his 400-meter hurdles
streak alive. ``My goal is to win the Grand Prix Final, so I
came.''
	   He was among the athletes who had suggested moving the event
elsewhere because of Russia's economic and political crisis.
	   And the American still has some misgivings.
	   ``The people here have other things to worry about. I wouldn't
feel bad if the stadium was empty, if nobody was there,'' Bronson
said Friday. ``If people pay their last dollar for a track meet ...
it seems very indecent.''
	   But officials said only 2,000 of the 80,000 tickets for the meet
are for sale, at 70 rubles (about dlrs 4.10) each. The others are
being distributed for free, mainly to school children, according to
Oleg Kurbatov, press officer for the local organizing committee.
	   There will be 17 reigning Olympic or world champions competing
at the refurbished Luzhniki Olympic Stadium.
	   Among them is Jones, 22, the former college basketball star who
has taken the athletics world by storm since switching sports
full-time.
	   The 100 meters world champion has won all 32 events she's
entered this year, including seven in the long jump. Only Florence
Griffith Joyner _ whose world record of 10.49 seconds in 1988 was
once thought untouchable _ has run faster than the 10.71 Jones has
clocked twice.
	   Jones leads Russian middle-distance runner Svetlana Masterkova
88-83 in the women's overall Grand Prix standings. El Guerrouj
holds a six-point edge on Bronson, 94-88, by virtue of the bonus
the Moroccan received for breaking the 1,500 meters world record at
Rome in July.
	   El Guerrouj, 23, is unbeaten in 11 races this season, while
Bronson is 16-for-16.
	   Gebrselassie, who set marks for the 5,000 and 10,000 meters in
June, has won all 12 races of at least 1,500 meters he's run in
1998. The one blemish on his record is a sixth-place finish in the
800 at Dortmund, Germany, in January.
	   The IAAF has put up about dlrs 3.7 million in prize money, with
dlrs 200,000 going to each overall Grand Prix winner. The winner of
each individual event will take home dlrs 50,000, and there is a
dlrs 100,000 bonus for a new world record.
	   The collapse of the ruble and the political power struggle in
Russia prompted about 50 athletes, including El Guerrouj, to sign a
petition last week urging the IAAF to move the event.
	   ``I signed that because others were signing,'' El Guerrouj said.
``I was told there was crime in the country, so I was afraid. But I
see things are okay.''
	   Of the top qualifiers for Saturday's Finals, only Michael
Johnson, Maurice Greene and Ato Boldon pulled out, for what the
IAAF said were personal reasons.
	   The athletes' biggest concern now appears to be the weather.
There were occasional sprinkles and temperatures hovered around 10
degrees Celsius (50 F) Friday, conditions not conducive to fast
times on the track.

French bear-handler mauled to death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ A veteran bear-handler was mauled to death
while feeding two bears he had considered having put down because
of their increasingly aggressive behavior.
	   Daniel Deforges, 55, was attacked Thursday after he fell down
while feeding Kaline and Olga, sister bears who'd been playing with
a pair of shoes.
	   Police said Kaline pounced first. As Deforges called for help,
Olga attacked. The bears weighed 300 and 250 kilos (660 and 550
pounds) respectively.
	   Deforges had handled bears since the age of 17, and had
performed with the Moscow, Zavatta and Medrano circuses.
	   Police shot the two bears, who were a cross between Russian
bears and American grizzlies.
	   Earlier, Deforges, from Saint-Etienne-sur-Reyssouze, had said he
was worried about the bears' increasingly aggressive behavior and
thought about having them put down.
	   Deforges and his son were slated to appear at the 1999 Circus
Festival in Monaco.

Castro tells South Africans to avoid revolution
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Cuban President Fidel Castro,
famed for his revolutionary rhetoric, on Friday told South Africans
they could only heal economic divisions through patience and
moderation.
	   Addressing Parliament on a two-day state visit, the Communist
leader noted the was a huge gap between rich and poor in South
Africa, with a white minority enjoying jobs and education while
many poor blacks struggled to make ends meet.
	   But Castro, who described his speech as a ``love letter,'' said
racial labels had no place in the new South Africa and everyone
should work together peacefully to overcome gradually the wrongs of
white rule.
	   ``Such a dreadful legacy cannot be changed overnight,'' he told
lawmakers ``I reject demagoguery and I would never say a word here
to incite discontent.''
	   Castro's visit has sparked controversy. Blacks remember him as a
firm ally of the African National Congress, who backed the fight
against apartheid and helped win their freedom in all-race
elections in 1994.
	   Many whites, however, recall a bitter war in Angola in the 1970s
and 1980s when South African soldiers backing anti-communist rebels
fought bloody battles with Cuban troops sent by Castro to support
Angola's Marxist government.
	   As Castro entered the parliamentary chamber, ANC politicians
jumped to their feet, clapping and chanting ``Fidel! Fidel!
Fidel!''. Lawmakers from the former ruling National Party stood in
silence.
	   Politicians from two small opposition parties boycotted Castro's
speech. Tony Leon, head of the mostly white liberal Democratic
Party, said Castro was an oppressor of human rights and ``no friend
of democracy.'' The right-wing Freedom Front also stayed away.
	   But President Nelson Mandela has frequently stated the ruling
ANC will not desert friends who backed it in exile -- including
Cuba and Libya.
	   He called Castro ``one of my greatest friends'' in an aside
while the two greeted onlookers at the presidential palace.
	   Since the ANC took power links with Cuba have grown, especially
in health. More than 400 Cuban doctors are working here to combat a
shortage of medical staff.
	   Outside Parliament about 80 supporters from labor unions and the
Communist Party held up banners welcoming the Cuban leader and
condemning United States' sanctions against the island nation.
	   ``Workers say no to blockade,'' read one, while another stated
``Cuba si! Yankee no!''.
	   During a full ceremonial welcome by Mandela, Castro inspected an
honor guard as President Nelson Mandela and senior Cabinet
ministers watched.
	   A band played the Cuban national anthem, and a 21-gun salute was
fired. Mandela planned a state banquet for Castro Friday evening
after a trip to his former island jail of Robben Island, now a
tourist attraction. Castro visits Johannesburg on Saturday.

Russian parliament postpones vote on Chernomyrdin

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Duma postponed a confirmation vote on the
acting prime minister Friday, avoiding a confrontation with
President Boris Yeltsin as pressure mounted on hard-line lawmakers
to back down.
	   Lawmakers voted 294-54 to postpone the vote after parliament
leaders said Yeltsin had called for more talks. The Duma had been
expected Friday to reject acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
for a second time.
	   The decision to postpone the vote until Monday indicated the
hard-liners were no longer confident of winning their confrontation
with Yeltsin and may be looking for a way out. The postponement was
likely to boost Chernomyrdin's chances of approval.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov insisted his faction would
never approve Chernomyrdin and would not agree to a compromise with
Yeltsin. But the Communists abstained from the vote, indicating
their position might be crumbling.
	   ``We are not going to vote for Viktor Stepanovich (Chernmyrdin).
We believe he won't be able to handle this job,'' Zyuganov said.
	   The dramatic turnabout came after Chernomyrdin's hopes of being
approved received a boost Friday when the Federation Council, the
upper chamber of Parliament, passed a non-binding motion 91-17
expressing confidence in the acting premier.
	   The Duma's agreement to more talks with Yeltsin boosted
Chernomyrdin's hopes of approval. Yeltsin still retains enormous
power and had appeared to regain the political initiative in the
past few days.
	   Russia had been plunged in to crisis by the collapse of the
currency, the ruble, and a power struggle between the Duma and
Yeltsin. Russians have been deeply worried, but there has been no
sign of panic or unrest.
	   Speaking earlier, Chernomyrdin outlined measures to stem the
country's economic crisis, Chernomyrdin said the government would
allow the ruble to float freely, allowing market forces to
determine its value. He also said the government would press ahead
with market reforms as soon as the situation was stabilized.
	   ``Starting in January the government will introduce an economic
dictatorship _ enterprises will be put in the conditions under
which they will not be able to fail under their obligations,'' he
told the Federation Council, made up of the country's regional
governors.
	   The Duma rejected Chernomyrdin on Monday in a first vote. His
approval could ease the political instability reigning over Russia,
though it would not end the nation's economic distress.
	   The opposition says it will never approve Chernomyrdin, accusing
him of creating many of the current problems during his previous
five years in the job. Yeltsin has said he will accept no one else.
	   The Federation Council vote to back Chernomyrdin was only
symbolic, but it may have increased pressure on the Duma to find a
compromise. The governors who make up the Council have huge power
in their regions and the vote signaled they would back Yeltsin in a
showdown.
	   Just last month, the ruble was trading at 6.2 to the dollar, or
about 16 cents. On Friday, two days after the government said it
was powerless to control the crashing currency, the U.S. dollar was
close to 18 rubles in street trading.
	   Chernomyrdin warned that a quick solution to the political
crisis must be found.
	   ``It may be our last chance to build a normal economy in Russia.
Yes, our actions will be unpopular. Everyone will assail us. But
don't tie the government's hands, give us time to step back from
the precipice. That refers to everyone from the president on
down,'' he said.
	   Chernomyrdin said his economic rescue package would concentrate
on meeting unpaid wages and pensions, closing down bankrupt and
inefficient businesses, getting rid of dishonest managers and
officials, and lowering taxes. He said the government would use
hard currency reserves to back the value of the ruble.
	   ``We will have prices rising. The ruble rate will be falling.
But since every ruble will be insured by our hard currency
reserves, the rate will stabilize,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin met briefly Friday with Chernomyrdin and said he would
not accept any other candidate for premier, Kremlin officials said.
The president may be willing to give the Duma more consultative
powers on appointing ministers, they added.
	   The Defense Ministry issued a statement Friday denying that
troops were being moved in to Moscow because of the political
situation.
	   If the Duma rejects Chernomyrdin on the second time, Yeltsin has
the option of proposing him a third time, or choosing a new
candidate. If the Duma votes no for a third time, Yeltsin can call
new Duma elections.
	   Russia has been operating with an interim government since
Yeltsin fired the previous prime minister on Aug. 23 and named
Chernomyrdin acting prime minister.

Thai health activists ask U.S. to permit drug deregulation

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Health activists on Friday presented
the U.S. Embassy with a petition calling for the United States to
stop measures which keep Thailand from producing low-price generic
drugs for victims of AIDS and other chronic diseases.
	   Some 20 members of the Thai NGO Coalition on AIDS chanted and
waved banners in front of the U.S. Embassy to publicize demands for
the free trade of pharmaceuticals to bring about competition and
affordable prices.
	   The activists want the United States to stop pressuring Thailand
to cut important provisions on compulsory licensing of
pharmaceuticals. Compulsory licensing allows Thailand to issue
product licenses to more than one company for a patented drug.
	   They also want the U.S. government to allow competition by
giving drug makers other than the original manufacturers the right
to make and sell low-priced generic equivalents of important
expensive patented drugs.
	   The group noted that six years ago, the Thai government _ under
U.S. pressure _ banned the parallel importing of drugs, which had
allowed the import of pharmaceuticals from drug makers in third
countries who charged less than the original manufacturer.
	   ``This is a huge burden to the country and the suffering
population,'' said Samlee Jaidee, a medical adviser to the group.
	   A drug used to treat cryptococcal meningitis, a fungal infection
of the brain which occurs in HIV-AIDS patients, was given by the
activists as an example of a high-price patented drug with a
low-cost alternative.
	   There are an estimated 900,000 people infected with HIV-AIDS in
Thailand, and it is estimated that 15-20 percent will be struck by
cryptococcal meningitis.
	   Diflucan, manufactured by the U.S. drug company Pfizer, cost 230
baht (dlrs 5.75) per 200 mg capsule, the group said, making the
cost of a year of treatment about 100,000 baht (dlrs 2,500), beyond
the means of most Thai families.
	   However, fluconozole, the active ingredient, is available on the
international market and the drug could probably be produced in
Thailand for 4 percent of the current price.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Grief-stricken families from Europe
and the United States flew to the rocky coast of Nova Scotia Friday
to face the task of identifying remains pulled out of the Atlantic,
where Swissair Flight 111 crashed into fragments.
	   Canadian officials on Friday brought in the 200-foot (60-meter)
submarine HMCS Okanagan, signaling that they were preparing to
shift gears from a massive rescue operation into a search and
salvage mission.
	   While rescue boats searched through the inky blackness all night
in stormy conditions, the submarine began scouring the area with
sonar at 5 a.m. So far, authorities reported no results.
	   ``We have not yet received any signal yet from the body of the
aircraft,'' Benoit Bouchard, head of the Transportation Safety
Board of Canada, said Friday. ``Last night, investigators did not
have much to look at. That should come soon, today or tomorrow, if
we get the black boxes.''
	   Nothing larger than the size of a car has been found so far, Lt.
Cmdr. Jacques Fauteux, a spokesman for the rescue operation, said.
	   As authorities drew up plans to protect the mourners' privacy,
details emerged from far-flung places about the array of
distinguished professionals who were among the 229 people killed in
Wednesday night's disaster.
	   Brilliant doctors, high-powered executives, risk-taking relief
workers were among the dead. Seven victims were affiliated with the
United Nations.
	   On Thursday, 137 Americans were reported to be on the flight,
but Swissair said Friday that a re-examination of the passenger
list has found there were only 132 Americans.
	   Offshore from the quaint fishing village of Peggy's Cove, an
intensive search continued for bodies and remnants of the MD-11
jumbo jet that crashed after its pilots reported smoke in the
cockpit.
	   ``It's likely to be a bad week here,'' said Ray Boutilier, 72, a
lifelong seaman. ``You never know what you're going to bring up in
your nets.''
	   Officials estimated Thursday night that 60 bodies had been
recovered and taken to a morgue at a military base outside Halifax.
They said none appeared to be burned, indicating there was no
explosion or large fire.
	   About a dozen grieving family members, clutching one another for
support, silently filed through Halifax International Airport late
Thursday. Swissair said more than 110 relatives and helpers were
expected Friday on a special flight from Switzerland, and others
were coming from New York.
	   A secluded area at Peggy's Cove, barricaded from journalists,
was set up so mourners could look out over the ocean and watch
boats and aircraft search.
	   Swissair also announced it would pay dlrs 20,000 in immediate
financial aid to families who requested it.
	   In Dublin, Ireland, U.S. President Bill Clinton pledged U.S.
support Friday for Canadian rescue workers and said the 229 victims
and their families ``are very much in our thoughts and prayers.''
	   The MD-11 dropped off radar screens about 90 minutes after
leaving New York's Kennedy International Airport late Wednesday on
its way to Geneva.
	   After a normal takeoff, the crew reported smoke in the cockpit
and decided to turn back to Boston. They were told the Halifax
airport was much closer, but they never made it, crashing into the
ocean 30 miles (50 kilometers) south of Halifax after dumping much
of their fuel.
	   Keith Anderson of the Canadian Air Traffic Association said
Swissair pilot Urs Zimmermann talked several times with a control
center in Moncton, New Brunswick, before the crash.
	   ``The initial call was to report smoke in the cockpit and the
captain indicated an abnormal situation,'' Anderson said. ``He used
the term PAN which implies an emergency situation, but not a
desperate situation.''
	   Swissair said Friday that the pilots put out a ``dense smoke''
call before the ``PAN'' call, but nothing indicated whether there
was smoke in the passenger cabin, how dense it was or what caused
it.
	   Divers were preparing to search the sea floor for the plane's
flight recorders, which officials hope will shed light on the cause
of the crash.
	   Canadian and U.S. officials said there were no indications that
the crash resulted from sabotage or a terrorist act, but
investigators were not ruling anything out. The Royal Canadian
Mounted Police called in explosives experts to examine debris for
signs of a possible bomb blast.
	   Vernon Grose, a former National Transportation Safety Board
investigator, told NBC-TV Friday that the size of the debris being
found may indicate that Flight 111 hit the water at a small angle,
instead of plunging headfirst.

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ An Italian citizen who was beaten by
police died of internal bleeding Thursday in a southern Croatian
hospital, according to police officials Friday.
	   Ricardo Cetina, 44, of Udine, was apparently beaten by police at
a restaurant Wednesday night in the coastal town of Sibenik after
he resisted arrest on charges of disturbing the peace and
endangering traffic, police spokesman Slavko Rako said in a press
statement.
	   Cetina was immediately rushed to nearby Split county hospital,
suffering from contusions all over his body and a brain hemorrhage.
He died Thursday morning after several hours in a coma.
	   A special police investigation of the incident was under way.
	   The Italian Embassy was notified of the incident. An official
told The Associated Press they would be following the case very
closely.
	   Southern Croatia is a popular tourist region, visited by many
foreigners, especially Italians.

German firm MAN denies employing Nazi-era slave workers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ German truck and bus manufacturer MAN on
Friday denied employing slave labor during World War II and
insisted it was accused falsely in a U.S. lawsuit seeking
retribution for Nazi victims.
	   The company's World War II-era director, Otto Meyer, ``staunchly
and successfully resisted requests to employ (concentration camp)
prisoners at its plants in the face of considerable threat,'' MAN
said in a statement.
	   MAN said it had received no official word about the lawsuit,
which U.S. lawyer Ed Fagan filed last week against a number of
major German companies, including auto makers BMW and Daimler-Benz
and steel conglomerate Krupp.
	   The lawsuit seeks compensation for former concentration camp
inmates forced into working at German companies for the Nazi war
machine.
	   MAN's board of directors discussed the suit at a board meeting
Friday and was scrutinizing its pre-1945 files. If necessary, the
statement said, MAN will employ independent investigators.

Trial goes on with almost no defendants or lawyers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FLEURY-MEROGIS, France (AP) _ On its third day, a trial of 138
suspected Islamic extremists resumed Friday with most of the
defense lawyers missing and nearly all of the defendants, too.
	   The defendants, all arrested in 1994-95, are accused of
belonging to three separate but overlapping networks that served as
support bases for Islamic insurgents in Algeria.
	   Since the trial's first day, lawyers and defendants have
protested the size of the mass trial as well as its site _ a
renovated prison gymnasium at Fleury-Merogis, outside Paris.. They
feel several smaller trials should be held.
	   In a statement read at the beginning of Friday's proceedings,
the lawyers demanded ``the halting of this inequitable and shameful
trial, which does not befit a democratic nation.''
	   Only 27 of the defendants have been jailed since their arrests,
and only three of them agreed to leave their cells on Friday. Out
of 70 defense lawyers, only three showed up.
	   On Wednesday, defendant Karim Chelamat refused to respond to
Presiding Judge Bruno Steinmann, saying he didn't ``recognize the
legitimacy of the court.''
	   The suspects are accused of sending arms and medicine,
recruiting fighters, and providing funds and safe havens in France
for Algerian insurgents.
	   Charged with ``criminal association with a terrorist
enterprise,'' they face up to 10 years in prison if convicted.
	   The Islamic insurgency in Algeria began in 1992. Some 75,000
people have been killed since then.

Iranian pilgrims say they denied entry to Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Hundreds of Iranian pilgrims arived in
Damascus Friday after being turned away by Iraqi authorities at a
border crossing with Syria.
	   The Iranians waited two days at the al-Walid checkpoint for
permission to enter Iraq but were told to go back, said some of the
pilgrims interviewed in the Syrian capital.
	   They said they had hoped to visit Najaf and Karbala in Iraq,
among the holiest sites for Shiite Muslims who form an overwhelming
majority in Iran.
	   After being refused visas by the Iraqi Embassy in Amman, Jordan,
the pilgrims decided to go to Syria and try their luck at the
al-Walid border crossing, about 350 kilometers (215 miles) east of
Damascus.
	   Under a July agreement between Iran and Iraq, 3,000 Iranian
pilgrims are being allowed to visit Iraq every week, mostly through
the al-Muntheriya checkpoint at the Iran-Iraq border.
	   The first group of 750 Iranians to make the pilgrimage since the
start of the 1980-88 war between the two countries crossed into
Iraq from the al-Muntheriya on Aug. 15.
	   One of the stranded pilgrim in Damascus, Kamel Muradi, 40, told
reporters that he and the others decided to go via Syria because
Iranian authorities give priority to the elderly and disabled to go
to Iraq from al-Muntheriya.

Clinton highlights Irish economy as prize of peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW throughout with lunch speech &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ President Bill Clinton turned Friday from
the turmoil in Northern Ireland to the Irish Republic's thriving
economy, holding it up as the prize of peace and a model for other
nations. ``I hope that success will whet your appetite for working
together,'' the president said.
	   Ireland, with the highest economic growth rate of any country in
Europe, is a ``truly astonishing'' model for other nations, Clinton
said at a reception for Ireland's business and political leaders at
the Royal College of Surgeons.
	   ``There has literally never been a better time, I don't suppose,
to be Irish _ because of the economic success, because of the
renaissance in writing, filmmaking, because of what so many people
are doing in so many ways to advance the cause of peace.''
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, in turn, credited Clinton and
his role in brokering the Good Friday peace accord with holding out
to Northern Ireland the same promise of prosperity.
	   ``He's laid down for us _ for all of us _ that there is a path
to follow and if we are sensible, if we're brave and we follow that
path, then the reward is peace and stability and confidence. If we
don't, well, then the future is as gloomy as the past,'' Ahern said
at a picture-taking session with Clinton before their private
meeting this morning.
	   Clinton said the Irish can set an example for warring peoples in
the Middle East and elsewhere. ``The potential impact of resolving
this could wash over many more people than live on this island,''
he said.
	   But the president warned against complacency. ``I hope that
success will whet your appetite for working together instead of
causing _ as success sometimes does _ people to forget what brought
them to the point of success.''
	   His talks with Ahern focused on the momentum in Northern Ireland
to work out a new governing formula for formerly warring parties
there and on the province's ties to Britain and the Irish Republic,
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said.
	   From his official hobnobbing in Dublin, Clinton was heading to
the northern suburb of Santry and a tour of the Gateway 2000
computer plant in order to highlight business opportunities in
Ireland.
	   Clinton met with business and political leaders as new
anti-terrorist laws took effect in Ireland and Britain today. Both
governments sought passage of the bills during Clinton's visit. The
legislation is expected to bolster political efforts by Protestants
and Catholics to make peace in Northern Ireland after 30 years of
conflict.
	   With this trip meant to nudge along the infant peace pact,
Clinton was asked whether he expected to visit the Irish again.
	   ``For the sake of the peace process, I hope not. But for my own
sake, I hope so,'' he said, laughingly suggesting that next time he
would come more as tourist than enforcer.
	   Of the fragile peace process, Clinton said, ``I hope it will be
institutionalized and off and going.''
	   The showers of Irish praise for Clinton on this tour were
briefly interrupted with a jolt as Clinton again faced criticism
about his handling of the Monica Lewinsky affair.
	   For the first time since admitting an inappropriate relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky, Clinton on Friday publicly used the words ``I'm
sorry'' in expressing regret for his actions.
	   U.S. investment has been a major factor in the growth of the
Irish economy. Trade between the two countries last year was worth
about dlrs 12 billion, a 19 percent increase over 1996.
	   Gateway's Dublin plant employs 1,300 people, mostly producing
personal computers for the European market. Gateway is considered a
symbol of the decade-long economic boom that has seen American
corporations build facilities in Ireland to serve the European
market.
	   The president came to Dublin from Omagh, Northern Ireland, where
he said he was ``very touched'' by his walk down the street where
28 people, mostly women and children, were killed and hundreds
wounded in an Aug. 15 attack.
	   The car bombing, Northern Ireland's worst terror attack, was
blamed on Irish Republican Army extremists trying to wreck Northern
Ireland's peace agreement.
	   Clinton said Friday he was ``just overwhelmed by the dimension
of the tragedy and the grim, cruel nature of the violence.'' He
added he was heartened by the spirit of the survivors. ``Even the
people who have suffered the most from the test of peace don't want
to give into it.''

China says detained CBS producer broke law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China said Friday that a television producer
employed by CBS who was taken from her home in handcuffs was
detained because she had broken the law.
	   There has been no contact from Natalie Liu, a Chinese citizen,
since she was detained Wednesday as her children watched, CBS staff
said.
	   ``As a Chinese citizen, she has taken part in activities that
broke the law,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. ``This
is a matter of course.''
	   It did not elaborate.
	   Although Liu had worked for CBS in Beijing, she was not
officially registered as a journalist with the government. China
requires that journalists with foreign news organizations first get
approval and press credentials from the Foreign Ministry.
	   Liu's detention came just before the arrival Sunday of Mary
Robinson, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights. The weeklong
visit, the first by a U.N. human rights chief, is expected to focus
attention on China's still secretive judicial system and its
continued restrictions on basic freedoms, which include strict
controls on the media.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Beijing raised Liu's case with high-level
Chinese officials on Thursday, said Bill Palmer, an embassy
spokesman.
	   He said he did not know what was said or how the Chinese
responded, but he did say that the embassy was concerned about her
case.
	   Reporters Without Borders, a Paris-based organization for the
defense of media freedom, protested Liu's detention in an open
letter Thursday to President Jiang Zemin, and urged him to secure
Liu's release.
	   The group assumed that she was arrested because she worked for
CBS without government approval. This ``is not a crime that merits
arrest, according to international standards,'' the group
protested.

Jake LaMotta's second son dies in Swissair crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Former middleweight champion Jake LaMotta lost
his second son this year, among the 229 people who died Wednesday
night in the Swissair crash off Nova Scotia, the New York Post
reported Friday.
	   Joe LaMotta, 49, president of LaMotta Foods Inc., was headed to
Geneva to promote the family business' new line of LaMotta Tomatta
Sauce. His brother, Jake Jr., died at age 51 in February of cancer.
	   ``My only two sons died in the same year,'' Jake LaMotta told
the Post. ``What is God trying to tell me?''
	   LaMotta, who was portrayed by Robert DeNiro in Martin Scorsese's
1980 film, ``Raging Bull,'' has four daughters with his ex-wife,
Vicki. The 76-year-old former boxer held the middleweight title
from 1949 to 1951.
	   Joe LaMotta inherited his father's love for the sport, entering
a number of Golden Gloves competitions.
	   ``He was like me, rugged and tough,'' the former champion said.

Indonesian authorities tighten security at airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian authorities have tightened
security at a Jakarta airport, fearing that dozens of bankers
suspected of misusing state money may try to flee abroad.
	   Justice Minister Muladi was quoted Friday by the official Antara
news agency as saying the step was taken because most of 96 bankers
banned from leaving the country have their own private planes.
	   Muladi said immigration officers have been deployed at Halim
Perdanakusuma airport, to check the ownership of every private
plane taking off from the airstrip in the eastern Jakarta
outskirts.
	   Muladi said the measures were needed ``because it will be
difficult to regain the state money if they are able to flee.''
	   Some 96 bankers are currently under investigation as Indonesia
tries to clean up its banking system.
	   They include Bambang Trihatmodjo, a son of former President
Suharto and Mohamad ``Bob'' Hasan, a former trade minister and
longtime associate of Suharto.
	   Hasan has already testified Thursday about allegations of
misconduct at his troubled Bank Umum Nasional.
	   Police have summoned Bambang to testify on his partly owned
Andremoda Bank, which has been closed.

Ethnic Albanian leader welcomes interim agreement for Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fighting continuing near Orahovac; Russian envoy
en route to Belgrade; EDITS to conform. &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The top ethnic Albanian leader
welcomed on Friday a tentative, U.S.-mediated formula for ending
the crisis in Kosovo province, and he indicated he would try to
persuade hard-liners to accept peace efforts rather than continue
battling for full independence.
	   Fighting continued for a third day Friday near Orahovac, 55
kilometers (34 miles) southwest of Pristina, Kosovo's capital.
American and European leaders have urged an end to the violence so
that U.S.-led diplomacy can prevent a humanitarian disaster among
tens of thousands of refugees left homeless by the conflict in the
breakaway Serbian province.
	   Speaking to reporters, Ibrahim Rugova said ``the possibility of
an interim and temporary accord is under consideration,''
confirming U.S. and Belgrade statements issued over the past few
days.
	   Such an agreement, Rugova said, would last for a period of three
years and its principal objective would be to ``normalize life'' in
the embattled province and ``create conditions for a lasting
solution.''
	   ``We have to do something to end the negative trends and prevent
an imminent tragedy for Kosovo, '' Rugova said, adding this can
only be achieved with the help of the Americans and Europeans.
	   Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population of the 2
million. They are seeking greater autonomy from Serbia, the
dominant Yugoslav republic, but Serbs have used a heavy military
presence to retain control of the province.
	   As part of the international peace effort, Russian Deputy
Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky was to meet Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade later Friday, Belgrade's
independent radio B-92 reported.
	   The radio said Russian official would brief Milosevic on the
U.S.-Russia summit, in which both U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin called for a diplomatic solution in
Kosovo.
	   In Vienna, Austria, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
said both Rugova and Milosevic had agreed in principle on a formula
for self-rule for the majority Albanian province, subject to review
after three years.
	   The agreement would fall short of Albanian demands for full
independence from Serbia. Fighting in Kosovo was continuing, and
details of the deal will likely require months of negotiations that
will break down if the violence does not end.
	   Still, Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel said the
framework offers the ``first glimmer of hope'' for a peaceful end
to more than six months of fighting.
	   The key to the success could be the Kosovo Liberation Army, many
of whose members oppose Rugova because of his disavowal of
violence. But Western diplomats hope that enough KLA members will
eventually accept the diplomatic process, leaving hard-liners
isolated politically among the ethnic Albanians.
	   Asked whether he could win over the KLA to the peace formula,
Rugova said he represents ``all residents of Kosovo.''
	   Fighting in Kosovo escalated in March after Milosevic launched a
crackdown to destroy the KLA, whom the Serbs describe as
``terrorists.''
	   As part of the U.S. diplomatic effort, John Shattuck, U.S.
assistant secretary of state for human rights, was expected in
Belgrade and Pristina later Friday. Former Sen. Bob Dole, who lost
the presidency to Clinton in 1996, is also due in the area this
weekend.

Ousted deputy PM stripped of party post, awaits arrest

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's ousted deputy prime
minister told supporters during Friday prayers that he not only
expected to be arrested, but that ``there will be hundreds who will
follow me.''
	   Anwar Ibrahim, stripped from his deputy and finance minister
posts on Wednesday, told some 2,000 worshipers at his neighborhood
mosque that he would demand justice against allegations of sexual
misconduct and leaking state secrets.
	   ``True power is with those who are brave enough to demand the
right for reform and change,'' Anwar said. ``Remember, man can
plan, but God also has his plans.''
	   Anwar was expelled from the ruling United Malays National
Organization Thursday, after months of bitter differences over
economic policy with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Anwar, 51, lashed out at the 72-year-old Mahathir, who has led
the Southeast Asian nation for 17 years.
	   ``For how long do you want power? Do you want to run with a
walking stick?'' Anwar said. ``How much longer do you want to
monopolize wealth? How much longer do you want to cheat the
people?''
	   Anwar for years was seen as Mahathir's heir to the prime
minister's post. Many believed he would be given the nod from his
one-time mentor during next year's UMNO elections.
	   But now, the conservative Muslim who once spearheaded the drive
for stronger Islamic influence over the secular government, has
been accused of having sexual trysts and of leaking state secrets.
	   In an affidavit filed in High Court on Wednesday, Malaysia's
Inspector General of Police Rahim Noor said Anwar was under
investigation on charges contained in a book that has widespread
allegations about sexual misconduct.
	   On Thursday, Rahim filed an affidavit at the High Court in the
case of S. Nallakaruppan, who has been detained on weapons charges.
Nalla, as he is known, is Anwar's tennis partner and in the book is
alleged to have arranged the ousted minister's sexual trysts.
	   In the document, Rahim said that Nalla was ``believed to have
access to national secrets through Anwar and he likely could leak
these national secrets.''
	   The affidavit said that Nalla and Anwar could face charges under
the Internal Security Act and the Official Secrets Act.
	   Anwar said that if he were arrested under the country's Internal
Security Act, which allows for detention without trial, ``there
will be hundreds who will follow me.''
	   He also said that he would go on a nationwide tour on a campaign
for political reform.
	   ``People are getting sick and tired of the manner in which we've
been repressed,'' he said. ``The reformation has begun. I can sense
it.''
	   Anwar's detractors note that Anwar did little to voice his
desire for reform while in power and often kow-towed to Mahathir's
tough controls over the media and opposition.
	   Mahathir, who made his first public comments after Anwar was
ousted from UMNO, told reporters he was ``saddened'' by events.
	   ``I wish it hadn't happened, not at this point,'' he said. ``But
these things have gone out of my control.''
	   Mahathir said he would serve as acting finance minister for now
and wait until next year's UMNO party elections before appointing a
new deputy.
	   Anwar had been left out of economic decisions for months after
differing with his boss on the course for economic recovery.
	   Malaysia's currency, the ringgit, and the markets have plummeted
since the Asian economic crisis broke out in July 1997. The
country's economy, which boasted 8 percent growth for the last
decade, formally went into recession last week after its economy
shrank another 6.8 percent.

IOC Coordination Commission pleased with Athens progress

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ An International Olympic Committee
commission said Friday it was happy so far with preparations for
the 2004 Games, but added it was too early to tell what problems
could arise.
	   ``You can only build a house if the foundations are solid. You
don't discuss the color of the tiles when you are still pouring the
concrete,'' said Jacques Rogge, president of the IOC Coordination
Committee.
	   The coordination committee, which received its first progress
report on work for the 2004 Olympics, ended its visit to Athens one
day before the first anniversary of the city being awarded the
Games.
	   ``We are glad to report that preparations are progressing
well,'' Rogge said. ``We leave Athens with feelings of
satisfaction.''
	   The coordination committee president dismissed numerous media
reports of bureaucratic wrangling and red tape hampering
organizational efforts.
	   Stratis Stratigis, president of the Athens 2004 organizing
committee founded four months ago, complained in June of ``the
faceless state and its bureaucracy,'' although he had insisted
projects were not being delayed.
	   ``There is no evidence of bureaucratic delays,'' Rogge said,
adding that a new committee ``can't be founded overnight. ... We
have been given assurances of no red tape.''
	   The IOC is also examining proposals for changes in venue
locations from Athens' initial bid.
	   ``We are not opposed to changes in venues. ... This is not the
first time in the Olympic Games,'' Rogge said, noting that 20
percent of venues in Sydney, which will host the Olympics in 2000,
were changed from the ones proposed in that city's bid.
	   Athens has no major changes planned as it has completed more
than two-thirds of the facilities necessary to stage the Games. Key
projects _ including a new subway and a new airport _ are due for
completion by 2001.
	   ``We want a long-term legacy for your city,'' Rogge told
reporters, adding that facilities constructed for the games must be
such that Athens will be able to use them after the Olympics are
over.
	   In order to combat any possible terrorist attacks during the
Games, Greek officials have already begun discussing security
issues with countries that have hosted Olympics in the past, Rogge
noted.
	   ``We are extremely pleased with the progress of discussions,''
he said. ``This is an international issue, I stress that.''
	   The IOC Coordination Committee is scheduled to return to Athens
next May and again in October 1999, in order to assist the Greek
organizing committee.
	   ``We're not there as an auditing company,'' Rogge said. ``We're
not there as spies, we're not there to control and we're not there
to command.''

 &UR; Nebiolo defends lucrative series &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ IAAF president Primo Nebiolo defended the Golden
League series Friday and left the door open to expanding beyond
Europe in the future.
	   ``It is based on a simple formula: athletes must compete and win
in order to be rewarded,'' the head of track and field's world
governing body said. ``We realize the current system may not be
perfect, but because of its success we will definitely continue the
same format next year.''
	   Some athletes, notably 200 meters world champion Ato Boldon,
have complained about the six-meet circuit which started this year,
arguing it is too top-heavy in prize money.
	   The Golden League guarantees money for the top finishers in
certain events at each meet, and offers a dlrs 1 million jackpot to
be split by athletes who win in all six cities plus at the Grand
Prix Finals.
	   Nebiolo said the Golden League was created ``with the idea of
reducing the importance of appearance fees.''
	   Marion Jones (100 meters), Hicham El Guerrouj (1,500), Haile
Gebrselassie (long distance) and Bryan Bronson (400 hurdles) are in
contention for the jackpot heading into Saturday's Finals here.
	   This season's Golden League meets were in Oslo, Rome, Monaco,
Zurich, Brussels and Berlin, but ``there is no obligation to hold
the Golden League only in Europe,'' Nebiolo said. ``It could be
held in other continents.''

Clinton highlights Irish economy as prize of peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Ahern comment &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ President Bill Clinton turned Friday from
the turmoil in Northern Ireland to the Irish Republic's thriving
economy, holding it up as the prize of peace and a model for other
nations. ``I hope that success will whet your appetite for working
together,'' the president said.
	   Ireland, with the highest economic growth rate of any country in
Europe, is a ``truly astonishing'' model for other nations, Clinton
said at a reception for Ireland's business and political leaders at
the Royal College of Surgeons.
	   ``There has literally never been a better time, I don't suppose,
to be Irish _ because of the economic success, because of the
renaissance in writing, filmmaking, because of what so many people
are doing in so many ways to advance the cause of peace.''
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, in turn, credited Clinton and
his role in brokering the Good Friday peace accord with holding out
to Northern Ireland the same promise of prosperity.
	   ``He's laid down for us _ for all of us _ that there is a path
to follow and if we are sensible, if we're brave and we follow that
path, then the reward is peace and stability and confidence. If we
don't, well, then the future is as gloomy as the past,'' Ahern said
at a picture-taking session with Clinton before their private
meeting this morning.
	   At the reception later, Ahern noted that American firms employ
400,000 people in Ireland and dominate electronics, pharmaceuticals
and other industries.
	   ``Ireland is really an American economic tiger with a green
face,'' he said with a smile.

Decision to free spy on humanitarian grounds signals new climate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANN S. KIM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A court's decision to overrule the Shin Bet
security service and grant early release to an ailing Soviet spy
marks a change in Israel where security arguments once reigned
supreme, a leading human rights activist said Friday.
	   The spy, 80-year-old Marcus Klingberg, on Thursday was ordered
released into house arrest after having served 15 years of a
20-year term for passing biological weapons secrets to the Soviet
Union. An Israeli newspaper described Klingberg as the spy who
caused the greatest damage to Israel in its 50-year history.
	   The three judges of the Beersheba District Court had been told
by Shin Bet agents that Klingberg still posed a threat to security
and must not be allowed to leave prison. However, the judges said
humanitarian considerations in this case had greater weight.
	   Klingberg has suffered from several strokes.
	   ``It's a question of values which goes to the core of Israel as
a Jewish and democratic country which gives weight not only to
security considerations and does not think it's desirable that a
sick and elderly man spend his final days behind bars,'' the judges
wrote in their decision.
	   Legislator Dedi Zucker, a leading human rights activist, said
the court decision signaled a change of climate in Israel.
	   ``Five years ago, let alone 10 years ago, I cannot think of a
court that would have dared to argue with the security arguments,''
Zucker of the opposition Meretz Party told The Associated Press.
	   Zucker noted that Klingberg was one of several spies who had
been tried by Israel in secrecy.
	   Klingberg was arrested and tried in 1983 and was imprisoned
under a false name until foreign media reports forced Israel to
acknowledge the case in the late 1980s.
	   In a nod to the Shin Bet, the Beersheba court said Klingberg
must be escorted by a Shin Bet-approved private guard, may not
leave his house for more than two hours each day and only have
contact with 11 people. His phone will be tapped by Shin Bet.
	   Klingberg reportedly began spying for the Soviet Union in 1957,
at a time when he already was working at Israel's secretive
Institute for Biological Research in the Tel Aviv suburb of Nes
Ziona. The institute reportedly develops chemical and biological
weapons and their antidotes. The Haaretz daily said Klingberg broke
off contact with the KGB in 1976.
	   Zucker, who visited Klingberg in prison several times, said the
scientists told him he spied for the Soviets because he felt he had
to repay a debt. The Polish-born Klingberg fled to the Soviet Union
after Germany's 1939 invasion and all his relatives remaining in
Nazi-occupied Poland perished in the Holocaust.
	   Later during World War II, Klingberg joined the Red Army to
fight the Germans.
	   During his imprisonment, the Soviets made several efforts to
free Klingberg as part of East-West spy swaps, but to no avail.
	   Klingberg will have to remain in jail for at least two more
weeks. During this time, the state will have to decide whether to
appeal.

Swiss mourn dead as grieving relatives leave for crash site

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Swiss flags flew at half staff and U.N. offices
observed a minute of silence Friday as stricken relatives departed
for the site of the Swissair disaster in Canada.
	   Swissair acknowledged that the U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration had issued a directive in June 1997 concerning a
wiring problem in the cockpit of the MD-11 aircraft which, if left
uncorrected, could cause a fire and make it difficult to pilot the
craft. The directive, which applied to all MD-11s, set a six-month
deadline for the necessary modifications to be made.
	   Philippe Bruggisser, chief of the SAirGroup parent company, said
Swissair had made the necessary changes _ which he described as
minor _ in its MD-11 fleet in March 1997 _ before the directive was
issued.
	   The pilot of Swissair Flight 111 reported ``dense smoke'' in the
cockpit just before issuing a ``Pan, Pan, Pan,'' distress signal.
The plane subsequently crashed off the Canadian coast near Nova
Scotia.
	   However, Bruggisser refused to speculate on the causes of the
smoke or the accident pending the recovery of the plane's flight
recorder.
	   ``It could take days, weeks _ or in the worst case _ months,''
Bruggisser said.
	   He said the remaining 15 MD-11s would stay in service, subject
to stringent checks before each takeoff.
	   Friday's daily flight from New York to Geneva _ hastily renamed
SR 115 _ arrived 30 minutes early after an uneventful
trans-Atlantic crossing.
	   Poignantly, the piece of paper asking relatives awaiting
Thursday's doomed Flight SR 111 to ``contact the Swissport desk''
was still attached to one of the arrival screens.
	   As passengers disembarked from the New York flight, about 80
bereaved relatives and trained counselors prepared to fly in the
opposite direction to mourn at the crash site.
	   A sobbing family with a small child clutching a teddy bear made
its way through the control barriers toward the plane. A grim
looking middle aged man followed behind. Reporters were kept at
bay.
	   In a restaurant overlooking the airport tarmac, an elderly
couple sat forlornly and watched the Airbus readying to leave.
	   ``Please leave us alone in our grief,'' said the woman, her
composure faltering, when asked if they had family who perished.
	   Swissair gave everyone on the relatives' flight dlrs 3,000 for
expenses in Canada, in addition to dlrs 20,000 to families in need,
said Bruggisser.
	   Swiss authorities announced that a national mourning service
would be held in Geneva's St. Pierre cathedral late Saturday. Flags
throughout the country were at half staff.
	   The U.N.'s European headquarters in Geneva observed a minute's
silence in memory of U.N. staff killed. The flight was popular with
members of the international organization shuttling between New
York and Geneva.
	   The World Health Organization was stunned by the loss of Dr.
Jonathan Mann, a leading AIDS expert on his way with his wife to a
series of expert meetings on the disease.
	   Spokesman Philippe Stroot said a WHO meeting about hereditary
factors and high cholesterol linked to heart disease would go ahead
despite the death of its chairman, Dr. Roger Williams, a professor
of internal medicine at the University of Utah.
	   Kris Janowski, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, described the mood at the refugee agency as ``very, very
grim'' after the death of two senior members of staff, Catherine
Calvet-Mazy and Pierce Gerety, both veterans of war zones.
	   ``There's a bitter irony in the fact that both worked in very
dangerous places,'' said Janowski. ``Pierce Gerety had been to the
roughest places of the earth. He was often exposed to considerable
dangers, shot at, held up at various checkpoints and yet he was to
die flying on a Swissair plane.''

Manning and Leaf get started as pros
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY WILNER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Indianapolis Colts and San Diego Chargers
might get a glimpse of just how good their prize rookie
quarterbacks will be when the American National Football League
season opens Sunday. Maybe they will be left shuddering at just how
unprepared the youngsters are.
	   Or, more likely, Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf will fall
somewhere in between All-Pro and awful in their professional
gridiron debuts.
	   ``I'm anxious right now,'' Leaf said as he prepared for a home
game with Buffalo. ``I think the nervousness and a lot of the
anxiety is gone. Preseason did it for me because it was my first
opportunity to play.''
	   Added Manning, who gets to go up against one of the game's
greatest quarterbacks, Dan Marino, and the Miami Dolphins, ``It's
unique, we're playing against Dan Marino, one of the best all-time
players, playing as long as he has with the consistency at such a
high level.
	   ``I've grown up around football, and I had kind of a role model
in my own house. I've always watched Marino on TV, Elway and those
guys, kind of study those guys, and watch how they compete.''
	   Manning knows he can't try to compete with a future Hall of
Famer such as Marino. The son of Archie Manning, whose pro career
never matched his stardom in college, Peyton isn't planning to get
in a duel with Dan.
	   ``My dad told me that he got to play against Johnny Unitas and
Bart Starr. ... I feel honored to get a chance to play against a
guy like Dan,'' he said. ``At the same time, you've got to still
play football. You can't go out there and get caught up in the
hype.''
	   But the hype always is there for the top two picks in the draft,
particularly when they are high-profile quarterbacks from
successful college programs.
	   Both of their teams are rebuilding and have too many holes to be
considered contenders. They will be interesting, though, as
American football fans keep track of which passer progresses
quicker.
	   The Bills are hoping Leaf continues to show an abundance of
faith in his arm, regardless of the situation.
	   ``I think we can take advantage of the fact that sometimes he
has a little too much confidence as far as throwing some balls in
there when they shouldn't be thrown,'' safety Kurt Schulz said.
``Hopefully, we'll get a few.''
	   Leaf isn't the only quarterback making a new start to his
career. Buffalo's Rob Johnson, whose only previous start _ and
extended action _ was a victory in the 1997 opener for Jacksonville
when Mark Brunell was hurt, will play for the Bills.
	   ``It's always exciting to come back home, and very exciting for
my first start with the Bills,'' said Johnson, who was born in
Newport Beach and went to Southern Cal.
	   Elsewhere, one of the game's great quarterbacks, John Elway,
returns for his 16th and almost certainly last season, and he does
it as a champion for the first time. Denver is at home Monday night
against New England.
	   Last year's Most Valuable Player Award co-winners, Brett Favre
and Barry Sanders, meet in Green Bay as the Packers play Detroit.
	   Also, it's Atlanta at Carolina, Jacksonville at Chicago, New
Orleans at St. Louis, Pittsburgh at Baltimore, Seattle at
Philadelphia, Tampa Bay at Minnesota, Tennessee at Cincinnati,
Washington at the New York Giants, Arizona at Dallas, the New York
Jets at San Francisco, and Oakland at Kansas City.
	   The Ravens unveil their new dlrs 223 million stadium. It could
be an intense setting.
	   ``They're coming off a 4-0 preseason, it's the first
regular-season game in a new stadium and we're the Pittsburgh
Steelers,'' Steelers coach Bill Cowher said. ``We're aware of the
kind of arena we're going to step into Sunday afternoon.''
	   Baltimore looked great in the preseason, going 4-0 and
outscoring opponents 89-26. They looked potent with the ball and
dominant without it.
	   ``The preseason means absolutely nothing,'' Ravens defensive
tackle Tony Siragusa said. ``It's a whole new ballgame. But this
defense has had a year together and Rod Woodson is a big plus in
the backfield. So we don't think teams can dominate us the way they
did last year.''

Finance official commits suicide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ An inspector of Japan's newly established financial
industry watchdog committed suicide after completing an
investigation into the financial health of Fuji Bank Ltd, an
official said Friday.
	   Hitoshi Higuchi, a 44-year-old inspector in the Financial
Supervisory Agency, hanged himself Thursday in his room in the
agency's dormitory, an FSA spokesman said.
	   A colleague found Higuchi after he failed to turn up for work,
the spokesman said.
	   He said the agency had no explanation for Higuchi's suicide.
	   A former Finance Ministry official who joined the FSA when it
was started three months ago, Higuchi was part of a team checking
the books at Fuji Bank for undisclosed bad loans.
	   Higuchi was in charge of investigating the bank's lending
practices and checking its borrowers.
	   The death comes on the heels of a spate of recent suicides due
to bribery scandals implicating finance officials.
	   A former official at the Bank of Japan committed suicide in May
and a Finance Ministry bureaucrat overseeing bank inspections
killed himself in January after two other inspectors were arrested
on suspicion of taking bribes.

Russia cuts gas supplies to Ukraine over unpaid debt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Russia's Gazprom has reduced gas supplies
to Ukraine by 30 percent because of the country's huge debt, a top
industry official said Friday.
	   Ukraine's gas debt to Russia currently stands at dlrs 640
million, said Ihor Bakai, who heads Ukraine's state gas monopoly
Naftogaz Ukrainy. Of the total, the government owes Gazprom dlrs
480 million and private gas traders owe dlrs 160 million.
	   Bakai pledged earlier this week that Ukraine would fully repay
its gas debt to Russia by October. He said most of the debt would
be covered by supplying various commodities and paying some dlrs 90
million in cash to Russia.
	   The reduction in supplies began Friday, Bakai said.
	   Ukraine's mounting gas debt to Russia has been among the
thorniest issues in the two countries' relations over the past few
years.
	   The former Soviet republic, which relies on Russia for 80
percent of its oil and gas supplies, has sought to diversify its
energy sources, but with little success.

Clinton says he's sorry about Lewinsky affair
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout to insert additional Lieberman quotes,
Clinton's previous comments about Lewinsky affair &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ President Bill Clinton said on Friday he
was sorry about his affair with Monica Lewinsky, apologizing for
the first time in the face of growing criticism among even close
Democratic allies who are pressing for a public reprimand of his
conduct.
	   The president has been under increasing pressure to apologize
for his actions since his Aug. 17 remarks where he did not do so.
	   ``I made a bad mistake,'' Clinton said. ``It's indefensible and
I'm sorry about it.''
	   Clearly uncomfortable addressing the matter on an international
stage, Clinton spoke hours after Democratic Sen. Joseph Lieberman
of Connecticut, in a stern speech on the Senate floor, called the
president's actions immoral and harmful to the nation.
	   ``The transgressions the president has admitted to are too
consequential for us to walk away and leave the impression for our
children and our posterity that what President Clinton acknowledges
he did within the White House is acceptable behavior for our
nation's leader,'' said Lieberman, whose words drew praise from
other Democrats.
	   Some sort of ``public rebuke'' is called for, he added, noting
Congress at some point should express its disapproval through a
resolution, censure or reprimand. But he said any such action is
premature until Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr reports on his
assessment of whether Clinton had committed any impeachable
offenses and the White House has a chance to respond to it.
	   Clinton, in an Aug. 17 speech to the nation, said he regretted
his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House intern
half his age, and the months that he misled his family and the
American people. Lawmakers of both parties criticized Clinton for
not directly apologizing.
	   At a Moscow news conference Wednesday with Russian President
Boris Yeltsin, Clinton for the first time said publicly that he had
made a mistake by engaging in an affair with the former White House
intern. He also was more direct than previously in admitting that
he had sought forgiveness.
	   During a photo session with Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern,
Clinton was asked day to respond to Sen. Leiberman's remarks. ``I
can't disagree with anyone else who wants to be critical of what
I've already acknowledged is inappropriate,'' he said.
	   ``There's nothing that he (Lieberman) or anyone else could say
in a personally critical way that I don't imagine I would disagree
with since I have already said it myself, to myself, and I'm very
sorry about it but there's nothing else I can say,'' Clinton said.
	   Asked about talk among some members of Congress that he should
be formally censured, Clinton appeared to grow testy. ``I shouldn't
be commenting on that while I'm here on this trip.
	   White House spokesman Mike McCurry, asked if Clinton had made a
calculated decision to use the phrase ``I'm sorry,'' insisted
that's what the president has been trying to convey since his Aug.
17 address to the nation when he said he deeply regreted his
actions.
	   ``He believes that's what he has been saying all along, and that
I'm sorry means I'm sorry,'' McCurry said.
	   On Friday, Clinton used the plain language of apology twice.
	   ``Basically, I agree with what he said,'' Clinton said of
Lieberman. ``I've already said that. I made a bad mistake. It's
indefensible, and I'm sorry about it.''
	   On the Senate floor Thursday, two other prominent Democratic
senators _ New York's Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Nebraska's Bob
Kerrey _ joined Lieberman in sternly denouncing Clinton's
relationship with Lewinsky and his handling of the affair's
aftermath.
	   Lieberman said Clinton had ``compromised his moral authority,''
damaged his credibility and complicated the efforts of parents
seeking to instill ``values of honesty'' in their own children.
	   ``It is hard to ignore the impact of the misconduct the
president has admitted to on our children, our culture and our
national character,'' Lieberman said.

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Cuban President Fidel Castro,
famed for his revolutionary rhetoric, on Friday told South Africans
they could only heal economic divisions through patience and
moderation.
	   Addressing Parliament on a two-day state visit, the Communist
leader noted the was a huge gap between rich and poor in South
Africa, with a white minority enjoying jobs and education while
many poor blacks struggled to make ends meet.
	   But Castro, who described his speech as a ``love letter,'' said
racial labels had no place in the new South Africa and everyone
should work together peacefully to overcome gradually the wrongs of
white rule.
	   ``Such a dreadful legacy cannot be changed overnight,'' he told
lawmakers ``I reject demagoguery and I would never say a word here
to incite discontent.''
	   Castro's visit has sparked controversy. Blacks remember him as a
firm ally of the African National Congress, who backed the fight
against apartheid and helped win their freedom in all-race
elections in 1994.
	   Many whites, however, recall a bitter war in Angola in the 1970s
and 1980s when South African soldiers backing anti-communist rebels
fought bloody battles with Cuban troops sent by Castro to support
Angola's Marxist government.
	   As Castro entered the parliamentary chamber, ANC politicians
jumped to their feet, clapping and chanting ``Fidel! Fidel!
Fidel!''. Lawmakers from the former ruling National Party stood in
silence.
	   Politicians from two small opposition parties boycotted Castro's
speech. Tony Leon, head of the mostly white liberal Democratic
Party, said Castro was an oppressor of human rights and ``no friend
of democracy.'' The right-wing Freedom Front also stayed away.
	   But President Nelson Mandela has frequently stated the ruling
ANC will not desert friends who backed it in exile -- including
Cuba and Libya.
	   He called Castro ``one of my greatest friends'' in an aside
while the two greeted onlookers at the presidential palace.
	   Since the ANC took power links with Cuba have grown, especially
in health. More than 400 Cuban doctors are working here to combat a
shortage of medical staff.
	   Outside Parliament about 80 supporters from labor unions and the
Communist Party held up banners welcoming the Cuban leader and
condemning United States' sanctions against the island nation.
	   ``Workers say no to blockade,'' read one, while another stated
``Cuba si! Yankee no!''.
	   During a full ceremonial welcome by Mandela, Castro inspected an
honor guard as President Nelson Mandela and senior Cabinet
ministers watched.
	   A band played the Cuban national anthem, and a 21-gun salute was
fired. Mandela planned a state banquet for Castro Friday evening
after a trip to his former island jail of Robben Island, now a
tourist attraction. Castro visits Johannesburg on Saturday.

Stock exchange to impose more restrictions on short-selling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong announced
Friday that it is reinstating a rule prohibiting short sales of
shares in three blue-chip companies at prices below the best
current ask prices.
	   The rule, which will be become effective on Monday, is
applicable to the top three market-heavyweight shares of HSBC
Holdings, Hong Kong Telecom and China Telecom, a statement said.
	   The restriction, which was abolished in March 1996, is aimed at
maintaining an orderly market, it said.
	   Short selling takes place when investors borrow stocks, usually
from mutual funds and banks, sell them, and buy them back later
before an agreed date, hoping share prices will go down and they
can pocket the difference.
	   The restriction will make it harder for speculators to profit
from such selling.
	   Hong Kong's stock market was rocked by speculators late last
month and short selling was blamed as a factor leading to a
dramatic slide in the blue-chip Hang Seng Index.
	   To the dismay of many economists, the government spent 15
percent of its U.S. dlrs 96 billion in foreign reserves on a
two-week stock buying spree, and successfully lifted share prices
to levels where speculators suffered heavy losses.
	   The government apparently stopped buying this week, and the
index has fallen 4 percent from last Friday's close.
	   The futures exchange also imposed restrictions on futures
short-selling this week.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Now would not be a good time for Marion Jones,
Bryan Bronson or Hicham El Guerrouj to finish second.
	   Those young stars, along with long-distance king Haile
Gebrselassie, can earn a share of a dlrs 1 million jackpot at the
IAAF Grand Prix Finals Saturday by winning their races to complete
perfect seasons.
	   ``I'm not counting my money before I have it,'' said Bronson,
25, who needed a photo finish earlier this week to edge world
champion Stephane Diagana in Berlin and keep his 400-meter hurdles
streak alive. ``My goal is to win the Grand Prix Final, so I
came.''
	   He was among the athletes who had suggested moving the event
elsewhere because of Russia's economic and political crisis.
	   And the American still has some misgivings.
	   ``The people here have other things to worry about. I wouldn't
feel bad if the stadium was empty, if nobody was there,'' Bronson
said Friday. ``If people pay their last dollar for a track meet ...
it seems very indecent.''
	   But officials said only 2,000 of the 80,000 tickets for the meet
are for sale, at 70 rubles (about dlrs 4.10) each. The others are
being distributed for free, mainly to school children, according to
Oleg Kurbatov, press officer for the local organizing committee.
	   There will be 17 reigning Olympic or world champions competing
at the refurbished Luzhniki Olympic Stadium.
	   Among them is Jones, 22, the former college basketball star who
has taken the athletics world by storm since switching sports
full-time.
	   The 100 meters world champion has won all 33 events she's
entered this year, including seven in the long jump. Only Florence
Griffith Joyner _ whose world record of 10.49 seconds in 1988 was
once thought untouchable _ has run faster than the 10.71 Jones has
clocked twice.
	   Jones leads Russian middle-distance runner Svetlana Masterkova
88-83 in the women's overall Grand Prix standings. El Guerrouj
holds a six-point edge on Bronson, 94-88, by virtue of the bonus
the Moroccan received for breaking the 1,500 meters world record at
Rome in July.
	   El Guerrouj, 23, is unbeaten in 12 races this season, while
Bronson is 17-for-17.
	   Gebrselassie, who set marks for the 5,000 and 10,000 meters in
June, has won all 13 races of at least 1,500 meters he's run in
1998. The one blemish on his record is a sixth-place finish in the
800 at Dortmund, Germany, in January.

Malta again ponders whether to anchor itself more to Europe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VALLETTA, Malta (AP) _ In its second election in two years, this
Mediterranean crossroads is again searching for direction: Whether
to head closer to the European Union or go it alone.
	   Saturday's voting pits socialist Prime Minister Alfred Sant,
whose Labor Party government froze Malta's EU bid, against veteran
Nationalist leader Eddie Fenech Adami, who wants the island nation
firmly anchored to a sea of EU economic advantages.
	   After nine years of leadership by the arch-rival Nationalists,
Labor was returned to power in October 1996 with a one-seat edge in
parliament. But Sant was virtually forced to call for a new mandate
three years early after a string of resignations and the defection
on some important votes by one of his own, ex-socialist Premier Dom
Mintoff.
	   Majorities of one or two seats are common in the 65-seat
parliament.
	   With most of the nation's 370,000 inhabitants either diehard
Nationalists or Labor supporters, island politics is heated
business. On Thursday night, closing campaign rallies by both
candidates each drew tens of thousands of deliriously cheering,
horn-honking, flag-waving boosters.
	   Sant ``promised a lot of things, like removing the value added
tax (10 percent sales-and-services tax),'' said Anthony Azzopardi,
a textile exporter who said the Labor leader's slick,
American-style campaign in 1996 convinced him to abandon years of
Nationalist voting.
	   But new taxes and steeply raised utility rates, which
Harvard-educated, management specialist Sant imposed to battle a
budget deficit, have angered many Maltese.
	   Looking down from the capital's chalky ramparts at Fenech
Adami's rally, Azzopardi said he was going back to the
Nationalists.
	   ``I wish to be in the EU. We haven't got anything here. Even if
the EU gives us a penny it's good for us,'' said the businessman.
	   ``European Union membership would be the shot in the arm the
Maltese economy needs,'' said Fenech Adami in an interview Friday.
	   Aides to Sant and other top Labor party figures said the
officials were too busy on the eve of the election to be
interviewed.
	   EU backers say membership would shower Malta with funds for
badly needed infrastructure such as roads and sewer lines.
	   But EU criteria would also mean tough medicine for many Maltese,
including manufacturers used to government subsidies and those who
work for the sprawling state sector.
	   Nationalist leaders were so confident about the 1990 membership
application, Maltese license plates were redesigned to carry the
circle-of-stars EU logo.
	   But after the 1996 Nationalist loss was widely attributed to
Maltese nervousness about sacrifices to join the Union, the party
called for a referendum to let the people say what they want.
	   Sant's party has maintained that joining the EU club could
compromise longstanding neutrality. But, sensing that the Maltese
might now be more open to membership, it is advocating a free trade
area agreement with Brussels.

Top opposition party wants immediate talks with Tamil rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka's biggest opposition party
said Friday the government should resume peace talks with the Tamil
Tigers even while its troops are fighting the rebels.
	   The government made no immediate reaction to the United National
Party's suggestion. But President Chandrika Kumaratunga has said
she is not averse to talking to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, known by its acronym of LTTE, provided the guerrilla group
first gives up its arms.
	   ``We believe there is no need for a cease-fire. The government
and the LTTE leadership can talk while their soldiers and cadres
fight. There is nothing wrong in it,'' said Tyronne Fernando, one
of the UNP's top leaders.
	   ``The initiative for the talks must come from the government and
we, as the main opposition party, are willing to help,'' Fernando
told The Associated Press.
	   Militants among Sri Lanka's Tamil minority say a separate state
is the only solution to what they see as discrimination by the
Sinhalese majority. A guerrilla war that broke out in 1983 has so
far left 54,000 people dead.
	   The government declared in January that it would not meet with
the LTTE after the group was accused of bombing the holiest shrine
of Sri Lanka's Buddhists, in an attack that killed 17 people.
Officials later said they would reconsider the ban on talks.
	   Several past rounds of peace talks have ended with the rebels
breaking off negotiations and staging surprise attacks on the
military. The last negotiations were held in April, 1995.
	   The opposition's proposal followed an unusual statement by the
LTTE.
	   ``The country is driven into this tragic and unstable condition
because the Sinhalese leadership lacks a genuine political will to
meet the aspirations of the Tamil people through negotiated
political settlement,'' the LTTE said in a statement to the
just-ended Nonaligned summit in South Africa.

Social Democrats' lead narrows in election poll
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Embargoed until 2015 GMT Friday, time set by source &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC;

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The opposition Social Democrats' lead over
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's party is slipping less than a month before
German elections, a poll showed Friday.
	   It was the second voter survey this week indicating that the
Christian Democrats are narrowing the gap as the Sept. 27
parliamentary election approaches.
	   And for the first time this year, Kohl's center-right coalition
had an edge when voters were asked who could best solve the
nation's economic problems, the latest poll said.
	   Kohl, seeking a fifth term after 16 years in power, has cited
recent polls as evidence that the public mood is shifting his way
after his younger challenger, Gerhard Schroeder, buoyed the Social
Democrats following his nomination last spring.
	   The new poll, conducted this week, gave the Social Democrats 41
percent of the vote, down from 42 percent in the last survey three
weeks earlier. The Christian Democrats were unchanged at 38 percent
in the Forschungsgruppe Wahlen poll.
	   This outcome would allow Schroeder to form a left-leaning
government with the small Greens party only if the former East
German communists drop out of parliament, the pollsters said.
	   Schroeder also lost five percentage points in the popularity
contest with Kohl, according to the survey. He still leads the
chancellor by 54 percent to 38 percent.
	   Voter support for the Greens was unchanged at 6 percent. The
Free Democrats, currently Kohl's junior partner, stayed at 5
percent.
	   One-third of voters remained undecided, the poll said.
	   The survey of 1,277 eligible voters had a margin of error of up
to 2.5 percent.
	   A poll published Wednesday showed the Social Democrats slipping
and slight gains for Kohl's party.
	   The Allensbach Institute survey gave Schroeder's party 41.1
percent of the vote, down from 42.7 percent a week earlier. The
Christian Democrats polled 35.5 percent, up from 35.2 percent. The
margin of error was 2.5 percent.

Zimbabwe to arrange all-party talks on Congo peace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Foreign Ministry officials said Friday
they are preparing for two days of all-party peace talks on the
Congo conflict at the northwestern Zimbabwe resort of Victoria
Falls, probably starting Monday.
	   Few details were available on the talks, called by Zimbabwe
President Robert Mugabe.
	   Officials declined to comment on reports the meeting would
consider a plan for a regional peace keeping force including South
Africa, Zambia and the forces of Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe
already in the Congo to help embattled President Laurent Kabila.
	   If South Africa joined such a force it would be the first
deployment of its troops outside its borders since President Nelson
Mandela came to power in the first all race elections in 1994.
	   Earlier Friday Congolese rebels said they were opposed to
Zimbabwe _ which has more than 2,800 troops in Congo _ mediating
the talks because Zimbabwe was not neutral in the conflict.
	   There was no information on whether Rwandan or Ugandan officials
would attend.
	   Kabila, a friend and ally of Mugabe, in the past has rejected
meeting with the rebels and demanded the withdrawal of Rwandan and
Ugandan troops he accuses of invading his territory before a cease
fire can by put in place. Uganda and Rwanda deny they are involved.
	   The rebels _ ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of Kabila's
army and opposition politicians _ say the revolt is a Congolese
affair, and accuse Kabila of incompetence, nepotism and corruption
_ problems Kabila had promised to eradicate after ousting longtime
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in May 1997.
	   Mugabe proposed the Victoria Falls talks after a meeting of
southern Africa's leaders at a summit of the nonaligned nations in
South Africa.

Mother Teresa's first death anniversary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CALCUTTA, India (AP) _ Rarely seen photographs of Mother Teresa
as a young girl in Albania were included in a book released Friday,
the eve of the first anniversary of her death.
	   ``Mother Teresa of Calcutta,'' a pictorial book on the life and
achievements of the Roman Catholic nun, was edited by Sunita Kumar,
a close friend for many years, and released by Mother Teresa's
successor as head of the Missionaries of Charity, Sister Nirmala.
	   ``May this coming in contact with the Mother rekindle the fire
of love in each heart, for God and his children, especially the
poorest of the poor,'' Sister Nirmala said.
	   On Monday, a week-long exhibition of 27 oil paintings depicting
Mother Teresa's work opened in an art gallery in Calcutta, which
was her home for nearly five decades.
	   Mother Teresa died last Sept. 5 at the age of 87. She had lived
in Calcutta's slums, caring for the destitute and dying.
	   The commemoration of her death will be simple, starting with a
special mass early Saturday at the Missionaries of Charity where
she is buried. The mass will be followed by hourly prayers
throughout the day, Sister Nirmala said.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ More than 70,000 people have been affected
by heavy flooding and more than 8,000 have lost their homes and
possessions because in northeastern Sudan, the U.N. World Food
Program said Friday.
	   WFP said the flooding in the town of Kassala, the capital of
Kassala state in northeastern Sudan, was worst hit after abnormally
heavy rains in Ethiopia caused the River Gash to burst its banks.
	   The agency said it began trucking 166 tons of emergency food
provisions Friday to Kassala, an important urban center in eastern
Sudan, enough to feed the 8,000 most at risk for one month.
	   The flooding swept away houses bridges and roads in the western
portion of Kassala, the less populated portion of the town. The
rural areas around Kassala have also been affected, the agency
said.
	   WFP said reports that rain continue to fall in the area raised
concern that more people could be at risk.
	   --
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ A younger brother of the late Nigerian
dictator Gen. Sani Abacha has been arrested trying to leave the
country, a Lagos-based newspaper reported.
	   Maj. Abdulkadir Abacha, who made millions of dollars selling
supplies to Nigeria's military and police, was arrested at Lagos'
international airport Aug. 26 as he tried to board a flight for
Switzerland, P.M. News reported Thursday.
	   His passport was seized and he was taken to Abuja, Nigeria's
capital.
	   Security officials are quizzing Abacha about reports he sold
dlrs 25 million worth of old, used training planes to Nigerian
aviation authorities. He was also being questioned about dlrs 10
million worth of uniforms he sold to the police that were rejected
as sub-standard.
	   The Abacha family has been closely watched by Nigerian
authorities since the sudden death in early June of Gen. Abacha,
who amassed an enormous fortune during his corrupt, five-year
dictatorship. The new government of Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar has
been trying to track down billions of dollars in missing money.
	   The late ruler's wife, Maryam, was reportedly stopped by
authorities at the Kano airport a few weeks ago, loaded down with
suitcases stuffed with cash.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Ivory Coast President Henri Bedie
will pay a five-day visit starting Monday, the Foreign Ministry
says.
	   Bedie will address Parliament, meet President Nelson Mandela and
visit the township of Soweto.
	   --
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ The government on Thursday signed an
agreement with the Industrial Development Corp. of South Africa and
with the U.S. company Enron for the establishment of a factory
producing steel slabs in the Maputo area.
	   The project is expected to be the largest investment in
Mozambique.
	   The factory is the long-awaited anchor project for natural gas
reserves around Pande in the southern province of Inhambane. Enron
signed an agreement with the government in November 1995 for the
exploitation of Pande gas - but this was highly dependent on
identifying an anchor project that would provide a market for the
bulk of the gas.
	   The steel project is expected to employ more than 5,000 people
during the construction phase, and provide about 1,000 permanent
jobs during its operational phase.
	   The project will require an investment of about dlrs 2 billion
dollars on the Mozambican side of the border -- dlrs 800 million in
the form of equity, and dlrs 1.2 billion in the form of debt.
	   Of this sum the IDC and Enron will each put up dlrs 200 million
dollars in equity.
	   The remaining dlrs 400 million dollars equity would come from
Japanese and European companies. Loans would then be sought from
banks.

North Korea claims it has launched satellite into earth orbit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Japan-NKorea Missile
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Japanese prime minister doubting rocket carried
satellite, grafs 7-8 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ In an apparent denial of a ballistic
missile launch this week, North Korea on Friday said it has
successfully fired its first artificial satellite into earth orbit.
	   The satellite was launched Monday on a three-stage, domestically
developed rocket, according to the North's official Korean Central
News Agency.
	   That timing would coincide with the test-firing of a newly
developed ballistic missile, Taepo Dong I, that crossed over Japan
and crashed into the Pacific.
	   North Korea has not confirmed it conducted the missile test, and
Friday's report appeared to be an attempt to deny Japanese,
American and South Korean claims of the missile launch.
	   ``Our scientists and technicians have succeeded in the first
artificial satellite aboard a multistage rocket into orbit,'' KCNA
said.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said he doubted the rocket
carried a satellite.
	   ``If it was launched, I guess Japan's technology could have
already picked it up,'' said Obuchi. ``What kind of satellite is
it?''
	   The three-stage rocket, the KCNA report said, blasted off from a
launching station at 12:07 p.m. on Monday and put the satellite
into orbit about five minutes later.
	   The first stage was separated from the rocket 95 seconds after
the launch and fell in open seas 253 kilometers (158 miles) off the
launching station, the report said.
	   The second stage fell in the Pacific Ocean, 1,646 kilometers
(1,028 miles) from the launching station and the third stage put
the satellite into orbit 27 seconds after the separation of the
second stage, it said.
	   ``The satellite is now transmitting the melody of the immortal
revolutionary hymns `song of General Kim Il Sung' and `Song of
General Kim Jong Il' and the morse signals `Juche Korea' in
27MHZ,'' the report said.
	   Juche, or self-reliance, is North Korea's guiding philosophy.
	   The North's claim of a successful launch of an artificial
satellite comes a day before the Marxist country's newly elected
parliament was to elect leader Kim Jong Il as its state head.
	   The launch of the rocket ``manifests the iron will and
indomitable spirit of our party, army and people who are working
hard for the greater prosperity of the country, pulling through
difficulties,'' the North Korean Foreign Ministry said in a
statement.
	   The statement heaped criticism on the United States and Japan
for making a ``fuss'' over the North's launch of a ``scientific
satellite.''
	   But the North also said that its rocket capacity can be used for
military purposes and warned the United States and Japan to stop
any hostile moves against it.
	   ``Particularly, the forces hostile towards the DPRK (North
Korea) must be mindful that their attempt to lead the DPRK to a
change will bring them nothing but destruction,'' the statement
said.

Fleeing uncertainty, Indonesian Chinese enrolling in Taiwan school
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Fleeing violence and uncertainty in
Indonesia, ethnic Chinese are traveling to Taiwan to enroll their
children in a middle school dedicated to teaching overseas Chinese.
	   Enrollment of Indonesians in the Overseas Chinese Middle School
in a Taipei suburb has jumped from 86 to 198 in the fall term and
continues to grow, the school's principal Chang Pi-chun said on
Friday.
	   Among those enrolled, 90 percent are girls, an indication of the
fear engendered by allegations of the mass rapes of ethnic Chinese
women and girls during May rioting in Jakarta, said Chang.
	   ``We have two and sometimes three sisters from one family. But
once they have their kids settled, most parents have to hurry back
to Indonesia,'' Chang said.
	   Resented for their relative wealth and control of commerce,
Indonesian Chinese are frequently scapegoated by the majority
Muslim population during times of economic hardship. Rioters in May
ransacked Jakarta's Chinatown, sending thousands of ethnic Chinese
fleeing for safety abroad, and more recent unrest has targeted
Chinese in other parts of the archipelago.
	   Students' families have almost all been badly affected by
Indonesia's economic collapse, forcing them to rely on grants from
Taiwan's Ministry of Education to pay school bills, Chang said.
Students live and eat on campus, and can earn spending money
through campus jobs, Chang said.
	   But despite much of the Indonesian population's perception of
them as outsiders, fewer than 10 percent of the students speak or
read any Chinese at all, Chang said.
	   Their first two years of study will be occupied primarily with
learning Mandarin, after which they have the option of testing into
high school or a polytechnic, Chang said.
	   Beyond that, an uncertain future awaits, she said.
	   ``Circumstances will have to determine where children end up.
All parents know is that under present conditions in Indonesia,
they want their kids to be here,'' Chang said.
	   The school has about 400 overseas Chinese students from as far
away as Brazil and England, Chang said.

Titanic discoverer urges tighter protection for sunken artifacts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The man who located the Titanic 13 years
ago is campaigning for international laws to stop treasure hunters
from plundering sunken vessels.
	   ``The question is: do we explore or do we plunder?'' Robert
Ballard told reporters in Lisbon. He said exploitation needs to be
controlled by the coastal state that has jurisdiction over the
water the vessel sank in, or the vessel's country of origin.
	   The Connecticut-based ocean explorer is an opponent of deep-sea
expeditions driven by commercial interests rather than exploration,
including salvage of the Titanic.
	   Ballard said last month museums were not interested in Titanic
relics because everything about the ship and its passengers is
already known. He said it is different when explorers find ancient
ships.
	   Only last month, George Tullock's RMS Titanic expedition brought
up a 20-ton steel slice of the British liner's hull, the largest
piece ever retrieved, in a dlrs 5-million salvage operation.
	   The Titanic sank in 12,000 feet of water after hitting a North
Atlantic iceberg in April 1912. Some 1,500 of the 2,200 passengers
aboard died.
	   Ballard suggested that UNESCO should add concerns about ``human
history and antiquity'' to international maritime law.
	   The existing legislation defines territorial waters up to 200
miles (240 kilometers) off the coast, but protects sunken wrecks
only up to 12 miles (14 kilometers). Ballard wants the wrecks
protected within the full extent of territorial waters.
	   Ballard is attending a NATO symposium on ``Emerging Maritime
Imperatives for the Next Millennium'' that began Thursday in
Lisbon.
	   The marine geologist has spent 35 years exploring the 43,400
mile-long (70,000 kilometers)Mid-Ocean Ridge, an underwater
mountain range which stretches from the Atlantic Ocean across the
Indian to the Pacific.
	   Among other achievements, he found the World War II German
battleship Bismarck; the carrier USS Yorktown, sunk in the Pacific
by Japanese bombers in the Battle of Midway; and the Roman merchant
ship Isis, which sank off the coast of Africa in 356 A.D.

Moldova hit hard by Russian crisis

<TEXT>
	   KISHINEV, Moldova (AP) _ Disabled by Russia's economic crisis,
Moldova's national currency tumbled against the dollar on the free
market Friday, as the government desperately infused millions of
dollars to stabilize the Moldovan leu.
	   Overnight, the leu dropped 35 percent _ from 4.8 lei to the U.S.
dollar, or about 21 cents to the leu, on Thursday, to almost 6.5
lei, or about 15 cents to the leu, on Friday afternoon.
	   In an unprecedented move, the National Bank of Moldova flooded
the market with some dlrs 3 million after hard currency dried up.
	   Dollars are the most traded currency in this country of 4.5
million wedged between Romania to the south and Ukraine to the
north.
	   Central Bank governor Leonid Talmaci told The Associated Press
that the bank would not allow a further devaluation of the leu.
	   ``We intend to keep the rate of 5 lei to one dollar,'' Talmaci
said.
	   Financial experts said dollars were scarce because most Moldovan
and Russian investors had bought huge amounts of foreign currency.
	   The handful of private banks on Friday were no longer selling
dollars, except to bank clients.
	   Moldovan exporters to Russia said they had lost dlrs 40 million
due to the Russian crisis. Some 60 percent of Moldova's exports _
wine, tobacco, meat and sugar _ go to Russia.
	   Ordinary people, scared that their money would turn to dust,
have invaded appliance shops, depleting them of television sets,
radios and washing machines. Most of these shops have shut this
week, waiting for the frenzy to pass.
	   ``This is my last solution for using money I have saved,'' said
worker Valeri Demedetchi, 40, who was buying a tape recorder.
``Tomorrow I might not be able to buy anything for lei.''
	   Deputy Premier Ion Sturza, who is in charge of the Economy and
Reforms Ministry, said Friday that the government would try to
protect Moldovans by supporting the national currency.
	   ``Over the next days, the leu's drop will slow down due to our
measures,'' Sturza said.

Dissident's wife urges Robinson to push for husband's release
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ An ailing dissident's wife is urging the U.N.'s
human rights chief, Mary Robinson, to press Chinese leaders during
a ground-breaking visit next week to release her husband.
	   Robinson, the first U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights to
visit China, will be aiming to promote human rights and human
rights education during her nine-day visit. She arrives Sunday.
	   She will meet China's president, Jiang Zemin, as well as other
senior leaders, court officials and members of China's legislature.
Meetings with women's groups and academics are also on her program,
as is a visit to Tibet.
	   Chu Hailan, wife of veteran labor activist Liu Nianchun, said
she hoped Robinson would use her meetings to secure her husband's
freedom for medical treatment. Liu, who has been in detention for
more than three years without trial, suffers high blood pressure,
stomach problems and other ailments, according to his wife.
	   ``If they won't let him out then his family should be able to
supply him medicines,'' she said in an interview with Associated
Press Television that was broadcast Friday.
	   But, she added, ``the best thing is still for them to let him
out.''
	   Liu, 50, is China's most prominent dissident still in jail
following the release in April of democracy campaigner Wang Dan.
Wang was sent into exile after his release, as was veteran
dissident Wei Jingsheng, who was freed last November. Chu said that
despite their releases, China's rights record has not shown ``any
improvement.''
	   ``Every day, they are out there watching me. Whenever I go out
they follow me. They have even kidnapped me, used force to drag me
away and detain me,'' she said of Chinese police.
	   ``Then you look at my husband's health. We've been asking for
treatment for more than three years, but nothing happens,'' she
said.

Rate declines for Thai bonds at weekly sale
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Bank of Thailand announced Friday
it had sold 17.5 billion baht (dlrs 427 billion) worth of one-year
government bonds to replenish its rescue fund for financial
institutions.
	   The bonds, which were the 11th in a weekly series of issues, had
a yield of 11.90 percent, the central bank said.
	   Friday's sale compares with 29.909 billion baht (dlrs 729.5
million) worth of bonds sold at a 12.50-percent yield last week.
	   The yield has been steadily declining since the first bond offer
on June 22, when it was 14.25 percent.
	   The central bank's Financial Institutions Development Fund has
been allocated a planned total of 500 billion baht (dlrs 12.2
billion). The money goes towards restoring the health of banks and
finance companies which went virtually bankrupt after an economic
downturn last year.
	   The fund has been auctioning off one-year bonds, which will
account for 150 billion baht (dlrs 3.7 billion) out of the 500
billion baht (dlrs 12.2 billion) total.
	   Central bank Governor Chatu Mongol said earlier that another 50
billion baht (dlrs 1.2 billion) will be allocated to ten-year
bonds, to be auctioned ``soon.''
	   Two-year, three-year and five-year bonds will be auctioned along
with one-year bonds from next week.
	   Chatu Mongol said at a news conference that the weekly bond
auctions will help Thailand set benchmarks for domestic one-year
bonds.
	   He said that in the first weekly auctions the central bank had
to buy a large amount of those offered.
	   Out of the 20 billion baht (dlrs 487.8 million) worth of bonds
sold in the first four auctions, the central bank bought a total of
13 billion baht (dlrs 317.1 million).
	   ``From the fifth offering, the central bank did not participate
in the bidding,'' Chatu Mongol said.
	   On Friday, bids increased to 47.68 billion baht (dlrs 1.2
billion), he said, because the central bank announced on Aug. 17
that it would allow more financial institutions to join in the
bidding.
	   Previously, only banks, finance companies, finance and
securities companies, securities companies, the Government Savings
Bank and the central bank could participate.

Clinton says he's sorry about Lewinsky affair

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with governor's comments &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ President Bill Clinton said on Friday he
was sorry about his affair with Monica Lewinsky, apologizing for
the first time in the face of growing criticism among even close
Democratic allies who are pressing for a public reprimand of his
conduct.
	   The president has been under increasing pressure to apologize
for his actions since his Aug. 17 remarks where he did not do so.
	   ``I made a bad mistake,'' Clinton said. ``It's indefensible and
I'm sorry about it.''
	   Clearly uncomfortable addressing the matter on an international
stage, Clinton spoke hours after Democratic Sen. Joseph Lieberman
of Connecticut, in a stern speech on the Senate floor, called the
president's actions immoral and harmful to the nation.
	   ``The transgressions the president has admitted to are too
consequential for us to walk away and leave the impression for our
children and our posterity that what President Clinton acknowledges
he did within the White House is acceptable behavior for our
nation's leader,'' said Lieberman, whose words drew praise from
other Democrats.
	   Some sort of ``public rebuke'' is called for, he added, noting
Congress at some point should express its disapproval through a
resolution, censure or reprimand. But he said any such action is
premature until Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr reports on his
assessment of whether Clinton had committed any impeachable
offenses and the White House has a chance to respond to it.
	   Clinton, in an Aug. 17 speech to the nation, said he regretted
his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House intern
half his age, and the months that he misled his family and the
American people. Lawmakers of both parties criticized Clinton for
not directly apologizing.
	   One of those critics, Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, the Democratic
Party chairman, said Friday that Clinton's most recent, most direct
statement about being sorry is ``helpful.''
	   ``I think he's been saying that with other words. He's had
difficulty getting it out,'' Romer said.

Russian ship escapes with Korean guards on board while in custody
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Maritime police said Friday they were
searching for a Russian ship which broke court-ordered custody and
escaped with four South Korean guards held captive.
	   The 4,475-ton Russian trawler ``Gerol Shronintsy'' sailed away
Thursday night with its 38 crewmen and the four Koreans on board,
said the police in the southern port city of Pusan.
	   Police declined to reveal details, but state-run Yonhap news
agency said the Russian trawler owed dlrs 1.45 million in ship
repair to Daewoo Heavy Industries in Keoje on the south coast.
	   Daewoo won a court order to auction off the ship.
	   Four court-hired private guards were posted on the ship to
enforce the court order when the ship ran away. Yonhap said the
ship was believed to be sailing to Vladivostok, a port on Russia's
Far East.
	   Officials at Daewoo were not immediately available for comment.
	   In June, a Russian refrigerator ship, Tibiya, broke similar
court-ordered custody and ran away with two South Korean guards on
board after failing to pay dlrs 1.5 million in repair debt.
	   The two Koreans were set free a week after the ship arrived in
Vladivostok.

Iran asks for Saudi help to free Iranians in Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran has asked Saudi Arabia to help secure
the release of Iranian diplomats held in Afghanistan, Iranian radio
reported Friday.
	   Iranian foreign minister Kamal Kharrazi put the request in talks
with his Saudi counterpart, Prince Saud al-Faisal, on the sidelines
of the Nonaligned Movement summit in South Africa on Thursday, the
radio said in a broadcast monitored by the British Broadcasting
Corporation.
	   ``Mr. Kharrazi asked Saudi Arabia to use its influence to secure
the freedom of the Iranian diplomats and the other Iranian
nationals detained by the Taliban,'' the radio said.
	   Saudi Arabia is regarded as a major supporter of the Taliban and
is one of only three countries to have recognized the group, which
controls most of Afghanistan.
	   The hard-line Taliban army released five Iranians, all truck
drivers, on Thursday in a goodwill gesture. Before their release,
Tehran had accused the Taliban of holding some 70 Iranians,
including 11 diplomats and a journalist for the official Iranian
news agency.
	   Iran, which borders Afghanistan to the west, has blamed the
Taliban for the disappearance of the diplomats.
	   The diplomats went missing after the Taliban captured the city
of Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan last month. The diplomats
were working at the local Iranian Consulate.
	   The Taliban have accused Iran of sending arms and money to their
opponents.
	   Iran has warned the Taliban it would consider all options to
retrieve its citizens. Iran has begun military exercises on its
border with Afghanistan, deploying more than 70,000 elite soldiers.

Authorities close roads to university campus in Yangon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS appeal from elder statesman in last 4 grafs

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military government closed all
roads leading to a university campus in Yangon after students began
chanting and demanding examinations be delayed.
	   Roads to the Hlaing campus of the Yangon Institute of Technology
were sealed off Thursday evening and remained closed Friday.
However, no heavy security presence was visible.
	   The military government is extremely wary of any activism on the
part of students, as they have historically played pivotal roles
Myanmar's political movements.
	   From outside the campus grounds, students could be heard
shouting and chanting Thursday evening. It is not known how many
students were protesting inside as access was not allowed.
	   The main demands concern what students see as problems relating
to their studies, though some have also called for an end to
military rule and convening of the parliament elected in 1990.
	   The political party of Nobel Peace Prize-winner Aung San Suu Kyi
won 82 percent of the seats in that assembly, but the military
refused to honor the result.
	   Suu Kyi and her colleagues have vowed they will convene
parliament sometime during September. The government has threatened
to arrest the opposition leaders and ban her party if they try.
	   Hundreds of students have demonstrated publicly at least three
times during the past two weeks, the first public protests in
Yangon in almost two years.
	   Students last demonstrated in December 1996. The military put
down the protests without excessive force, but sentenced dozens of
students to long prison terms. Universities have been shut since.
	   Some were reopened within the last few months so students could
prepare for and take long-delayed exams. Examinations are scheduled
for Monday, and students at the Hlaing campus said they wanted them
delayed.
	   They said they were given a seven-day crash course covering the
last two school years' curriculum, and that simply was not enough.
	   Students at Yangon Institute of Technology were also protesting
a government plan to break up the university into several smaller
campuses in far-flung locations.
	   Students in Myanmar, also known as Burma, have historically been
at the forefront of movements aimed at gaining independence or
democracy.
	   When the military took control of the country in 1962, one of
its first acts was to blow up the students union building at Yangon
University.
	   Students also led the early stages of the nationwide democracy
uprising in 1988. The military government gunned down thousands of
unarmed protesters.
	   One of the last surviving leaders of Myanmar's independence
movement meanwhile appealed to the government and the opposition to
negotiate an end to their differences, it was learned Friday.
	   The call was made by Bohmu Aung, an original member of the
Thirty Comrades, a group of Myanmar soldiers and students who led
the drive for independence from Britain in the 1940s.
	   He is believed to represent about 20 elderly politicians who
have made occasional efforts to promote a dialogue. Their previous
efforts have earned scoldings from the government, but they were
received warmly during a recnt call on the home minister.
	   In an apparent effort to play a role in the current political
situation, they also met about two weeks ago with leaders of Suu
Kyi's party. One of them reportedly urged the opposition members to
show more flexibility in dealings with the military regime.

Stock exchange to impose more restrictions on short-selling
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with investigation of those who failed to settle
transactions, grafs 6-8

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong announced
Friday it is reinstating a rule prohibiting short sales of shares
in three blue-chip companies at prices below the best current ask
prices.
	   The rule, which will be become effective on Monday, is
applicable to the top three market-heavyweight shares of HSBC
Holdings, Hong Kong Telecom and China Telecom, a statement said.
	   The restriction, which was abolished in March 1996, is aimed at
maintaining an orderly market, it said.
	   Short selling takes place when investors borrow stocks, usually
from mutual funds and banks, sell them, and buy them back later
before an agreed date, hoping share prices will go down and they
can pocket the difference.
	   The restriction will make it harder for speculators to profit
from such selling.
	   In a separate statement, the exchange also said it would
investigate members who failed to settle their short transactions
on time.
	   It said 16 members were responsible for more than 60 percent of
the trading on Aug. 27-28 when the government's buying spree
climaxed, and that five of them had failed to settle their
transactions on time with the local clearing house.
	   The clearing house also said 14 other members had failed to
settle transactions within the required two-day time limit, also
imposed recently to restrict short selling.
	   Hong Kong's stock market was rocked by speculators late last
month and short selling was blamed as a factor leading to a
dramatic slide in the blue-chip Hang Seng Index.
	   To the dismay of many economists, the government spent 15
percent of its U.S. dlrs 96 billion in foreign reserves on a
two-week stock buying spree, and successfully lifted share prices
to levels where speculators suffered heavy losses.
	   The stock exchange and the futures exchanage have imposed
various measures to discourage short selling.
	   The stock exchange said it would inspect those members next
week.
	   By law, short sellers must either hold the shares they are
shorting or reasonably believe they will obtain the shares in time
to settle.
	   The government apparently stopped buying this week, and the
index has fallen 4 percent from last Friday's close.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Thousands of protesters demanding
the ouster of strongman Hun Sen marched Friday to the local offices
of the European Union, where they were confronted by riot police
armed with rifles and electric-shock batons.
	   The protesters denounced the E.U., principal financier of the
July 26 parliamentary elections, for what they described as rubber
stamping Hun Sen's declared victory despite opposition allegations
of hundreds of irregularities.
	   Four student representatives and a chief monk met Sven Linder,
the E.U.'s chief election observer, for two hours.
	   ``If teachers don't know how to teach, it is better they just go
home,'' said one student, Saro Thyvatha. ``The same is true with
international observers. If they come to Cambodia, but they are not
serious, they do not look below the surface, then it's better they
don't come at all.''
	   No violence was reported. The march by 3,000 people came on the
12th day of round-the-clock protests demanding that the complaints
of election fraud be seriously investigated. So far, Hun
Sen-controlled electoral authorities have rejected all of them.
	   The protests have been largely peaceful, but angry mobs linked
to the recent upheaval were reported Friday to have killed as many
as five ethnic Vietnamese and severely beaten others, accusing them
of being behind a wave of fatal poisonings.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights condemned the
killings and urged opposition politicians who have whipped up
antipathy toward the much-hated Vietnamese minority to temper their
rhetoric.
	   The U.N. commission said it was ``particularly regrettable that
this food poisoning issue has begun to acquire racial and political
overtones.''
	   The opposition leaders, Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy,
have both played up anti-Vietnamese sentiments.
	   Hun Sen, who came to power during the harsh Vietnamese military
occupation that followed the genocidal Khmer Rouge, is seen by many
Cambodians as a puppet of Hanoi.
	   The attacks follow the reported deaths of some 60 people in the
past week from poisoning, fueling rumors that ethnic Vietnamese
have tampered with food, water and rice wine.
	   Hun Sen received a major boost in his quest for international
legitimacy when the Association of Southeast Asian Nations endorsed
the election results Friday and urged Cambodia's politicians to
peacefully resolve their differences.
	   ASEAN postponed Cambodia's membership last year after Hun Sen
deposed Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a bloody coup. The vote
was seen as a necessary step toward finally bringing Cambodia into
the regional club.
	   King Norodom Sihanouk meanwhile expressed doubts that crisis
talks he will lead this weekend between the rival parties at his
palace in Siem Reap, near the historic Angkor monuments, will end
the current turmoil.
	   Hun Sen had planned to attend the weekend talks personally, but
a spokesman said Friday that he would instead dispatch three
Cabinet ministers after his opponents insisted they would only send
lower-level representatives.
	   ``I do not have much hope that the three-day meeting will have
the positive result that I want,'' Sihanouk, 75, said in a written
statement. ``The parties have deep conflicts with each other and
have not yet agreed to make any concessions or compromises.''
	   The weekend talks are expected to revolve around technical
issues, mainly the appellate process that the opposition says was
biased in favor of Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party.
	   The CPP won 64 of the 122 National Assembly seats, a slight
majority but short of the two-thirds needed to form a government
alone. Ranariddh, the king's son, and Sam Rainsy have refused to
lend their vital support when the assembly convenes for the first
time Sept. 24.

Philippine government postpones resumption of peace talks with
</HEADLINE>
rebels &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government has
postponed the resumption of peace talks with Communist rebels
because of their insistence on implementing a human rights accord
according to their rules, officials said Friday.
	   Government negotiators decided to ``defer the resumption of
formal talks until this prejudicial issue is satisfactorily
resolved,'' said Howard Dee, chief of the government panel.
	   The talks were scheduled to resume in the Netherlands on Sept.
11 after being stalled in March because then President Fidel Ramos
did not approve a comprehensive agreement on human rights and
international humanitarian laws.
	   Ramos' successor, Joseph Estrada, approved the accord last
month, paving the way for the resumption of the talks on ending
nearly three decades of insurgency.
	   Dee said in a statement that the government wants to implement
the agreement in a way that will not impinge on the Philippine
constitution.
	   Earlier this week, Luis Jalandoni, chief negotiator for the
Marxist umbrella group, the National Democratic Front, issued a
statement instructing rebel forces to implement the human rights
agreement according to their own rules and practices in areas under
their control.
	   Dee said such a directive was a direct challenge to the
sovereignty of the republic and reflects the rebels' claim to their
own separate ``constitutional sovereignty.''
	   The government has maintained that the insurgency is an internal
conflict among Filipinos and that rebel forces should not be
granted a status of belligerency that would give them the rights of
a separate state.
	   Rebel spokesmen were not immediately available for comment.
	   The human rights agreement aims to ease the burden of the armed
conflict, particularly on children, women and the elderly.
	   The accord also supports the indemnification of 9,539 Filipinos
who won a class action suit for human rights abuses under the late
dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
	   When they resume the talks, the two panels are to craft an
agreement on economic and social reforms, the second of four
accords leading ultimately to a political settlement of the
29-year-old insurgency.
	   The two other agreements are to cover political and
constitutional reforms and the disposition of armed forces.

Moroccan gardener freed in high-profile murder case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A Moroccan gardener who spent seven years in jail
for allegedly murdering his wealthy employer was freed on Friday in
a controversial case that hinged on a grammatical error in a
message scrawled in blood.
	   Omar Raddad was sentenced to 18 years in prison for killing
Ghislain Marchal, 65, at her posh villa on the French Riviera in
June 1991.
	   The widow of a rich industrialist, Marchal was found at her home
lying in a pool of blood. A message written with her blood had been
scrawled on the wall next to her body saying that Raddad had killed
her.
	   The message seemed clear enough _ except for the glaring
grammatical error that a well-educated woman like Marchal would
have been unlikely to make.
	   But instead of saying ``Omar m'a tuee,'' it said ``Omar m'a
tuer,'' using the infinitive instead of the past participle.
	   The high-profile case gripped the nation, and Raddad's sentence
was reduced after a partial pardon by President Jacques Chirac in
1996.
	   He left the Muret prison near Toulouse with his lawyer, Jacques
Verges, who vowed to fight for the case to be re-opened.
	   The soft-spoken father of two had long claimed his innocence,
but was unable to provide an alibi for the time period in which
Marchal was killed.
	   Numerous citizens' groups came to Raddad's defense saying he was
made a scapegoat due to his Moroccan nationality.
	   Raddad will begin a factory job in Marseilles next week.
	   Verges said he wanted a new trial to clear Raddad's name,
comparing the affair to a ``syphilitic sore'' on the face of French
justice.

Defending champion Doohan turns in fastest time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   IMOLA, Italy (AP) _ Four-time 500cc world champion Michael
Doohan turned in the fastest lap Friday at the practice session of
the Imola Grand Prix motorcycling race.
	   The Australian posted a lap time of one minute, 49.950 seconds,
just 52 hundredths off the circuit's record. Doohan, who won the
event last year, is currently third in the overall standings.
	   Italy's Max Biaggi, who leads the 500cc standings, finished with
the fourth fastest time of 1:51.496. Biaggi won the latest Grand
Prix Aug. 23 in Brno, Czech Republic.
	   Both riders race on Hondas.
	   Japan's Tetsuya Harada, leader of the 250cc class, secured the
day's fastest lap time of one minute, 53.678 seconds. Harada, who
rides on Aprilia, finished fifth in last year's race.
	   Loris Capirossi of Italy, also on an Aprilia, completed the
practice session with the third-fastest lap. He sits in second
place in the overall standings.
	   In the 125cc class, Japan's Tomomi Manako was fastest on a
Honda. Manako, who was second here last year, posted a lap time of
two minutes, 1.636 seconds.
	   Winner of the Czech Republic Grand Prix, youngster Marco
Melandri of Italy finished 10th. Melandri, 16, is second in the
season standings.
	   In the same class, Federico Cerroni of Italy suffered a minor
crash 25 minutes into the race and escaped unharmed.
	   On Saturday, riders compete to qualify for Sunday's race.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Swiss flags flew at half staff, and U.N. offices
observed a minute of silence Friday while stricken relatives
departed for the site of the Swissair disaster in Canada.
	   Swissair acknowledged that the U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration had issued a directive in June 1997 concerning a
wiring problem in the cockpit of the MD-11 aircraft which, if left
uncorrected, could cause a fire and make it difficult to pilot the
craft. The directive, which applied to all MD-11s, set a six-month
deadline for the necessary modifications to be made.
	   Philippe Bruggisser, chief of the airline's SAirGroup parent
company, said Swissair had made the necessary changes, which he
described as minor, in its MD-11 fleet in March 1997 _ before the
directive was issued.
	   The pilot of Swissair Flight 111 reported ``dense smoke'' in the
cockpit just before issuing a ``Pan, Pan, Pan,'' distress signal.
The plane subsequently crashed off the Canadian coast near Nova
Scotia.
	   Bruggisser refused to speculate on the causes of the smoke or
the accident pending the recovery of the plane's flight recorder.
	   ``It could take days, weeks _ or in the worst case _ months,''
Bruggisser said.
	   He said the remaining 15 MD-11s would stay in service, subject
to stringent checks before each takeoff.
	   Friday's daily flight from New York to Geneva _ hastily renamed
SR 115 _ arrived 30 minutes early after an uneventful
trans-Atlantic crossing.
	   As passengers disembarked from the flight, about 80 bereaved
relatives and trained counselors prepared to fly in the opposite
direction to the crash site.
	   A sobbing family with a small child clutching a teddy bear made
its way through the control barriers toward the plane. A grim
looking middle-aged man followed behind. Reporters were kept at a
distance.
	   In a restaurant overlooking the airport tarmac, an elderly
couple sat forlornly and watched the Airbus readying to leave.
	   ``Please leave us alone in our grief,'' said the woman, her
composure faltering, when asked if they had loved ones who
perished.
	   Swiss authorities announced that a national mourning service
would be held in Geneva's St. Pierre cathedral late Saturday. Flags
throughout the country flew at half-staff.
	   The U.N.'s European headquarters in Geneva observed a minute's
silence in memory of seven U.N. staff who were killed. The flight
was popular with members of the world body shuttling between its
New York headquarters and Geneva.
	   Dr. Jonathan Mann, a leading AIDS expert, had been on his way
with his wife _ vaccine specialist Mary-Lou Clements-Mann _ to a
series of World Health Organization meetings on the disease.
	   ``I don't know of two people in the AIDS world who had more
friends worldwide,'' said Dr. Richard Marlink, director of the
Harvard AIDS Institute at the School of Public Health in Cambridge,
Massachusetts. ``They were warm and caring people totally committed
to their work in public health.''
	   Kris Janowski, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, described the mood at the refugee agency as ``very, very
grim'' after the death of two senior members of staff, Catherine
Calvet-Mazy and Pierce Gerety, both veterans of war zones.
	   A WHO meeting about heart disease was to go ahead in Geneva
despite the death of its chairman, Dr. Roger Williams, a professor
of internal medicine at the University of Utah.
	   In the United States, colleagues remembered Norman Scoular, the
Scottish-born director and chief operating officer of a
Massachusetts lighting manufacturer, SLI Inc.
	   ``He was one of the most dedicated professionals in the company
... the best salesman, best engineer and best banker, who put in
75-hour work weeks,'' said the firm's chief executive, Frank M.
Ward.
	   Victims from the state New Jersey included two pharmaceutical
company executives, a professional figure skater and her husband,
and the chief financial officer of a New York sugar trading
company.

Russian parliament postpones vote on Chernomyrdin

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Duma postponed a confirmation vote on the
acting prime minister Friday, avoiding a confrontation with
President Boris Yeltsin as pressure mounted on hard-line lawmakers
to back down.
	   Lawmakers voted 294-54 to postpone the vote after parliament
leaders said Yeltsin had called for more talks. The Duma had been
expected Friday to reject acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
for a second time.
	   The decision to postpone the vote until Monday indicated the
hard-liners were no longer confident of winning their confrontation
with Yeltsin and may be looking for a way out. The postponement was
likely to boost Chernomyrdin's chances of approval.
	   Yeltsin received news of the postponement ``calmly, with full
understanding that a longer pause for contemplation is better than
haste,'' according to presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky.
	   The president invited political leaders to a roundtable in the
Kremlin on Monday morning, hours before the delayed vote was
scheduled to take place.
	   Russia has been plunged into crisis by the collapse of the
currency, the ruble, and a power struggle between the Duma and
Yeltsin. Russians have been deeply worried, but there has been
little sign of panic or unrest.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov insisted his faction would
never approve Chernomyrdin and would not agree to a compromise. But
the Communists abstained from the vote, indicating their position
might be crumbling since they had earlier ruled out any more talks.
	   ``We are not going to vote for Viktor Stepanovich
(Chernomyrdin). We believe he won't be able to handle this job,''
Zyuganov said.
	   Russia appeared to face a weekend of hectic closed-door talks as
the two sides looked for a compromise. Yeltsin said he would allow
the Duma to consult on ministerial appointments, a minor
concession.
	   Yeltsin's representative in the Duma, Alexander Kotenkov, told
reporters that the president ``has taken enough steps to meet the
State Duma halfway. It's about time the Duma made a goodwill
gesture, too,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Chernomyrdin's hopes of being approved received a boost Friday
when the Federation Council, the upper chamber of Parliament,
passed a non-binding motion 91-17 expressing confidence in the
acting premier.
	   The Duma's agreement to more talks with Yeltsin boosted
Chernomyrdin's hopes of approval. Yeltsin still retains enormous
power and had appeared to regain the political initiative in the
past few days.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Grief-stricken families from Europe
and the United States flew to the rocky coast of Nova Scotia Friday
to face the task of identifying remains pulled out of the Atlantic,
where Swissair Flight 111 crashed into fragments.
	   Canadian officials brought in the 200-foot (60-meter) submarine
HMCS Okanagan, signaling they were preparing to shift gears from a
massive rescue operation into a search and salvage mission.
	   Rescue boats toiled all night in rough seas off the fishing
village of Peggy's Cove, scouring for bodies and remnants of the
MD-11 jumbo jet that crashed Wednesday night after its pilots
reported smoke in the cockpit.
	   The submarine began mapping the ocean floor with sonar at 5 a.m.
	   ``We have not yet received any signal yet from the body of the
aircraft,'' said Benoit Bouchard, head of the Transportation Safety
Board of Canada. ``Last night, investigators did not have much to
look at. That should come soon, today or tomorrow, if we get the
black boxes.''
	   Officials hope to find the plane's flight recorders to help them
determine the cause of the crash.
	   Benoit said large parts of the plane may still be intact
underwater, particularly since only about a fourth of the bodies
have been found.
	   However, nothing larger than the size of a car has been found so
far, said Lt. Cmdr. Jacques Fauteux, spokesman for the Canadian
rescue operation. The debris _ a sad array that included ripped
clothing, wallets, baby bottles and seat cushions _ was scattered
over seven square miles (18.13 square kilometers).
	   About 100 Canadian soldiers were being brought in today to
search 60 miles (100 kilometers) of rugged coastline near the
crash.
	   Authorities sealed off Peggy's Cove _ a village of 60 people _
and set up tents complete with food, drinks and counselors to
accommodate the hundreds of relatives flying in. A secluded area
was created so mourners could look out over the ocean and watch
boats and aircraft pursue the search.
	   Details emerged from around the world about the array of
distinguished professionals among the 229 people killed in the
crash.
	   Brilliant doctors, high-powered executives, risk-taking relief
workers were among the dead. Seven victims were affiliated with the
United Nations.
	   Swissair said Friday that a re-examination of the passenger list
has found there were only 132 Americans on board _ instead of the
137 reported Thursday.
	   Officials estimated Thursday night that 60 bodies had been
recovered and taken to a morgue at a military base outside Halifax.
They said none appeared to be burned, indicating there was no
explosion or large fire.
	   A dozen grieving family members, clutching one another for
support, silently filed through Halifax International Airport late
Thursday. More than 110 relatives and helpers were expected Friday
on a Swissair flight from Switzerland, and others were coming from
New York.
	   Swissair also offered dlrs 20,000 in immediate aid to each
family.
	   The MD-11 dropped off radar screens about 90 minutes after
leaving New York's Kennedy International Airport late Wednesday on
its way to Geneva.
	   After a normal takeoff, the crew reported smoke in the cockpit
and decided to turn back to Boston. They were told the Halifax
airport was much closer, but they never made it there, crashing
into the ocean 30 miles (50 kilometers) south of Halifax after
dumping much of their fuel.
	   Keith Anderson of the Canadian Air Traffic Association said
Swissair pilot Urs Zimmermann talked several times with a control
center in Moncton, New Brunswick, before the crash.
	   ``The initial call was to report smoke in the cockpit and the
captain indicated an abnormal situation,'' Anderson said. ``He used
the term PAN, which implies an emergency situation, but not a
desperate situation.''
	   Swissair said Friday the pilots put out a ``dense smoke'' call
before the PAN call, but it was not known if there was smoke in the
passenger cabin.
	   There were no indications that the crash resulted from sabotage
or a terrorist act, but investigators were not ruling anything out.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police called in explosives experts to
examine debris for signs of a possible bomb blast. FBI officials
were on the scene Friday, and U.S. crash experts were working on
the rescue boats.
	   Among those on board were Dr. Jonathan Mann, an American who
formerly headed the World Health Organization's anti-AIDS program,
and Dr. Roger R. Williams of the University of Utah, a renowned
expert in cardiovascular genetics.
	   U.N. officials on board included Yves de Roussan, 41, of Canada,
UNICEF's regional adviser for Central and Eastern Europe, and
Pierce Joseph Gerety Jr., 56, a Connecticut native in charge of a
U.N. program helping 1.2 million refugees in central Africa.
	   ``He was constantly seeing death,'' said his brother, Tom,
president of Amherst College in Massachusetts.
	   Another victim was John Mortimer, 75, a former senior vice
president of The New York Times.
	   Marc Rosset, Switzerland's top male tennis player and the 1992
Olympic gold medalist, was scheduled to fly on Flight 111, but
decided at the last minute to stay in New York one more night after
losing at the U.S. Open.
	   ``It was a strange feeling when you realize that for just
changing your mind you are still alive,'' Rosset said.

Strikers Andersson and Dahlin are gone after nine years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHAN NASSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Kennet Andersson and Martin Dahlin, who
scored a combined nine goals in the 1994 World Cup finals, are both
missing for the first time in a competitive match since 1990 as
Sweden opens its European Championship campaign Saturday against
England.
	   Andersson, who also plays for Bologna in Italy's Serie A,
sustained a thigh injury and will be sidelined for three weeks. The
tall striker had five goals in the '94 World Cup in the United
States tied for third in scoring.
	   Dahlin, who's been struggling with his form, didn't even play
for Blackburn in the Premier League against Leicester Saturday.
	   Henrik Larsson of Glasgow Celtic, Jorgen Pettersson of Borussia
Moenchengladbach and Andreas Andersson of Newcastle are candidates
for the two spots up front at Rasunda Stadium. Larsson and
Pettersson are consistent strikers for their club teams, but they
have no impressive goalscoring statistics for Sweden.
	   A veteran from the 1994 World Cup when the Swedes finished
third, Larsson has only scored seven goals on the national team and
only three in competitive matches.
	   Petterson notched five goals, all but one in friendlies.
	   And Andersson scored four goals for Sweden, all in friendlies.
	   ``But it doesn't matter if I've scored goals in competitve
matches or not,'' Pettersson said. ``What really is important is to
be concentrated against England. I know I'll get only two or three
(scoring ) chances and then I must be hundred percent focused.''
	   Pettersson, who scored three goals for Borussia this season and
three goals as a starter in his three last games for Sweden, would
love to face defender Tony Adams again.
	   ``I met him in the UEFA Cup two years ago,'' Pettersson
recalled. ``We eliminated Arsenal, but I didn't score. He (Adams)
was a very tough player.''
	   But England manager Glenn Hoddle said Adams picked up a new
ankle injury in training Thursday and rated the Arsenal star's
chances of playing as only 50-50.
	   ``Tony has an ankle problem, although not the long-term ankle
problem that he's had,'' Hoddle said.
	   England, with in-form Liverpool striker Michael Owen, still is
favored against the Swedes.
	   ``But Owen is only 18,'' Pettersson said. ``He can also get
nervous.''
	   Tomas Brolin, the 1994 World Cup FIFA All Star who retired three
weeks ago only to make a temporary (Swedish) second-division
comeback as goalkeeper last weekend, believes England is overrated.
	   ``It's not easy to perform well after a World Cup,'' said
Brolin, who will attend the sellout match. ``We have experienced
that. My guess is a draw or a Swedish victory. Sweden seldom loses
important matches at Rasunda Stadium.''
	   Brolin's 82nd-minute volley shot at Rasunda in 1992 gave Sweden
a 2-1 win against England in the European Championships. The loss
eliminated England. Host Sweden made the semifinals.
	   Sweden has not lost to England in 30 years. The teams drew four
times in their last six matches since 1979, two of them 0-0 ties
before the 1990 World Cup finals and the last one a 3-3 draw in
1995 in Leeds when the Swedes led 3-1 with two minutes left. Sweden
won the two other matches, 1-0 in 1986 and 2-1 in 1992.
	   Coach Tommy Soderberg, who replaced Tommy Svensson after Sweden
failed to qualify for both Euro *96 in England and this year's
World Cup in France, has been successful during his first season.
In pre-World Cup matches, Sweden beat two eventual quarterfinalists
in France, Italy and Denmark (both 1-0) and played a scoreless tie
against the to-be world champion France.
	   Hoddle also said Paul Merson picked up an injury during
Thursday's training. Merson and Adams will face fitness tests
Saturday.
	   Missing from Hoddle's original squad are Nicky Butt, Rio
Ferdinand and most recently Steve McManaman.
	   David Beckham is suspended for being red-carded against
Argentina in a second-round World Cup match that England lost after
a penalty shootout. David Batty and Gary Neville, two other World
Cuppers, are injured.

International officials complain about judicial rulings in fraud
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ International officials
overseeing Bosnia's reconstruction complained Friday that local
courts are undermining the anti-smuggling crackdown by
politically-motivated decisions.
	   ``We are worried that the judicial officials dealing with the
cases are not independent but act and rule in favor of criminal
companies that are bringing cigarettes, coffee and liquors into
Bosnia to sell them on the black market, naturally without paying
any customs duties and excises,'' said Simon Haselock, spokesman of
Bosnia's top international official, Carlos Westendorp.
	   With no reliable force controlling Bosnia's borders nationwide,
smugglers are able to bring goods into the country, often without
paying customs fees. As a result, Haselock said, the government
loses an estimated 200 million German marks a year in lost customs
revenues.
	   In an effort to combat fraud, the European Commission's Customs
and Fiscal Assistance Office, or CAFAO, organized an anti-smuggling
campaign in which rival Muslim, Serb and Croat officials cooperated
to an unprecedented extent.
	   But Westendorp's staff complains that defendants escape
punishment when the cases get to court.
	   With Bosnia divided in two parts, each with separate
administrations, the law requires companies to pay a deposit to the
Muslim-Croat Federation before they import goods into the country.
	   If the goods stay in the Federation, the deposit is considered a
customs fee. But if they are destined for the Bosnian Serb-ruled
part, the importer gets his deposit back.
	   The problem, however, is that it is difficult to determine
whether goods earmarked for the Bosnian Serb entity actually end up
there. Often, officials say, the goods end up sold on the black
market in the Federation area.
	   Haselock cited the example of a company based in the Bosnian
Croat-controlled town of Tomislavgrad.
	   Between November 1997 and March 1998, Haselock said the company
imported 42 high-tariff consignments of coffee and liquors, paying
2.53 million German Marks as deposit.
	   The company later presented papers to the Customs Administration
stating that the goods had been declared in various customs
stations in the Bosnian Serb part of the country and got its
deposit back.
	   ``However, CAFAO established that the papers were forged,''
Haselock said. Westendorp's office called Federation authorities to
hold the deposit pending resolution of the case.
	   But the company filed a civil suit in the Bosnian Croat-run town
of Livno against the Customs Administration for withholding their
money and won. Haselock said the verdict was ``very surprising
given that there is a clear evidence that the papers were false.''
	   The Customs Administration appealed the decision and reported
the case to the Prosecutor's Office in Livno. It received no
response.
	   In July, the Customs Administration submitted a followup report
with additional details to substantiate its allegations against the
firm. This time, the prosecutor's office referred the case to the
municipal court.
	   No final decision has been taken.

Sierra Leonean rebel leader charged with treason
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ The rebel leader who sparked
Sierra Leone's civil war in 1991 and whose soldiers continue to
brutalize this West African nation was charged Friday with treason.
	   Foday Sankoh, the head of the Revolutionary United Front, was
led handcuffed into a Freetown courtroom under heavy guard. He made
no plea in the brief court appearance.
	   Sankoh returned to Sierra Leone in July after being held for
more than a year in Nigeria on gun-smuggling charges. Hours after
his return, he pleaded with his soldiers on state-controlled
television to stop terrorizing civilians and lay down their
weapons.
	   The charges against Sankoh, who appeared in court wearing a
safari suit and a fez, include treason and assisting the enemy to
invade Sierra Leone. If convicted he could face the death penalty.
	   Government officials had earlier said Sankoh would also face
charges of crimes against humanity, but no such charge was
announced Friday.
	   The Revolutionary United Front was allied with Sierra Leone's
former military junta, which seized power last year and was ousted
10 months later by a Nigerian-led West African intervention force.
	   Sixteen civilians, including five journalists, were sentenced to
death by hanging last week for collaborating with the military
regime.
	   More than six months after the regime's ouster, rebels and
ousted junta soldiers are waging a ruthless war of terror against
civilians in pockets throughout Sierra Leone. Human rights groups
and aid workers say thousands of people have been killed, tortured
or disfigured by the rebel campaign of terror.
	   Earlier this week, rebels attacked a village in neighboring
Guinea, killing seven women Sierra Leonean refugees and three
Guineans and forcing other refugees to carry stolen food back over
the border into Sierra Leone, said Kris Janowski, spokesman for the
U.N. refugee agency.
	   Authorities have taken steps to seal the border, Janowski said
Friday.
	   The mysterious rebel group, which has issued few statements and
whose ultimate goals remain unclear, revolted in 1991 against a
corrupt dictatorship, but kept fighting even after a new government
took over in 1992.
	   Sankoh's case was adjourned until Sept. 11

Thai diplomats to seek help from 22 countries in bank fraud case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand has ordered its embassies in
22 countries to ask for help in tracking down more than dlrs 300
million believed to have been transferred overseas in a massive
bank fraud case, the foreign ministry said Friday.
	   The money was transferred by companies and individuals
associated with Rakesh Saxena, a one-time advisor to the Bangkok
Bank of Commerce who is now in Canada fighting extradition to
Thailand on charges of financial wrongdoing. The fraud case first
came to light two years ago.
	   On Wednesday, police in Switzerland said banking authorities
there had frozen dlrs 40 million in accounts linked to the case.
	   The sum was initially frozen in July 1996 by local judicial
authorities when a Zurich bank reported suspicions of money
laundering, spokesman Folco Galli said. Most of the money was
formally blocked last month.
	   The newspaper The Nation reported Friday that the Thai attorney
general's office believed suspects in the case had transferred
their ill-gotten gains to Switzerland, Russia, China, the United
States, Canada, Australia, England, Italy and some Eastern European
countries between 1992 and 1996.
	   Rakesh and other bank insiders allegedly set up dummy companies
which were granted bank loans with little or no collateral. The
suspects then allegedly used the funds to speculate in real estate
and the stock market.
	   Several politicians were also granted similar loans, reportedly
used for the same purposes.
	   In 1996, the bank's directors revealed that it had bad debts
approaching 75 billion baht (dlrs 3 billion at the time).
	   The bank's troubles were a early indicator of the poor lending
practices that were to lead to the near collapse of Thailand's
financial sector after an economic downturn last year.
	   Bangkok Bank of Commerce was kept alive by the government for
two years after its massive losses were revealed, but finally
closed last month as part of recent financial reforms.

Solana: Belgrade must stop Kosovo attacks to allow peace talks

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
said Friday Serbian forces must stop their military action in
Kosovo so that a U.S.-mediated formula for ending the conflict in
the breakaway Serbian province can progress.
	   ``It's very important that the Belgrade army and (Yugoslav)
President Milosevic stop their (military) actions still taking
place in Kosovo,'' Solana told a news conference in Lisbon.
	   Kosovo's top ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova, said Friday
he welcomed the U.S. initiative and indicated he would try to win
over hard-liners to a peace process rather than continue the battle
for full independence.
	   ``It will be very difficult for (the Albanians) to sit down at
the negotiating table if actions by the Belgrade army continue,''
Solana said.
	   Fighting continued for a third day Friday near Orahovac, 55
kilometers (34 miles) southwest of Pristina, Kosovo's capital.
	   Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population of 2
million, are seeking greater autonomy from Serbia, the dominant
Yugoslav republic, but Serbs have used a heavy military presence to
retain control of the province.
	   Solana said NATO had finalized a range of options for military
intervention in Kosovo. ``Political leaders must now decide if, and
how, they want to use those options,'' he said.
	   With the severe Balkan winter approaching, the humanitarian
situation in Kosovo, where tens of thousands of people have been
made homeless by more than six months of fighting, was
``dramatic,'' Solana said.
	   ``It's important to put maximum weight behind any initiative''
aimed at checking the conflict, he said.
	   Solana said that the general elections in Bosnia, scheduled for
Sept. 12-13, would play ``a decisive role'' in stabilizing the
Balkans.
	   Solana was in Lisbon to attend a NATO symposium on maritime
policy.

Turkey claims Saddam supporting Kurdish rebels; warns Iraq off

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey warned Iraq on Friday to stay out
of its fight with Kurdish rebels, saying it had gotten new evidence
that Saddam Hussein was supporting the Kurdish guerrillas.
	   ``We are receiving information that the Iraqi administration is
supporting the PKK,'' Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit said, referring
to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party. ``This will hurt Iraq more
than it hurts Turkey.''
	   Turkey has been at war against the PKK since 1984. The PKK is
fighting for autonomy for Kurds in Turkey's southeast.
	   Ecevit spoke after talks with Massoud Barzani, leader of an
Iraqi Kurdish faction that is opposed to both the PKK and to
Saddam's regime. Barzani's faction controls up to two-thirds of
northern Iraq.
	   Ecevit claimed the Kurdish leader confirmed that Saddam was
sponsoring the PKK. He did not elaborate. In the past, Turkey has
leveled the same accusation against Syria, Iran, Greece and
Armenia.
	   Barzani, head of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, is on his way
to Washington for talks with senior U.S. officials and possibly
with a rival Iraqi Kurd leader, Jalal Talabani.
	   The talks are part of efforts to end the conflict between the
two factions, which have been vying for control of the autonomous
Kurdish zone in northern Iraq since 1991. A fragile cease-fire has
been in place since May 1997.
	   The two leaders are expected to discuss the contentious issues
of border revenues, joint administration and the fate of thousands
of displaced people.

Festival &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VENICE, Italy (AP) _ The competition for the Golden Lion award
kicked off Friday at the Venice Film Festival with the showing of
German and Italian films, both focusing on youngsters dealing with
unusual situations and miserable family lives.
	   Germany's ``Lola Rennt,'' (``Lola runs'') is a colorful, comic
book-style movie about a girl who has 20 minutes to find the wads
of money her boyfriend loses just before he has to hand them over
to a local mobster.
	   Set in Berlin and shot in a style similar to a music video, Tom
Tykwer's movie was a huge success at home. German actress Franka
Potente, 24, stars in the leading role.
	   The Italian film, ``L'Albero delle Pere'' (``The Pear-Tree'')
centers on the chaotic Christmas holidays of a 14-year-old boy and
his family: a drug addicted mother and her new companion, the boy's
father and stepsister.
	   The film's director, Francesca Archibugi, described the
storyline as ``the struggle of a boy who doesn't want to give up
his right to happiness despite a difficult life.''
	   Also on the program Friday night, but not in competition, was
Spike Lee's ``He Got Game,'' featuring Denzel Washington and Milla
Jovovich. The movie is about a boy who faces the difficult choice
between pursuing his dreams of becoming a basketball star or
attending university.

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Denmark's two biggest
slaughterhouses, Danish Crown and Vestjyske Slagterier, said Friday
they intend to merge their activities into a single holding company
which would be become one of the world's largest slaughterhouse and
meat processing group.
	   The new company, with the working title DC-VJS Holding, will
control up to 80 percent of the Danish meat processing trade,
making it Europe's largest exporter of pork.
	   The companies have a total of 18,000 workers in Denmark,
Britain, the United States and Germany and combined annual revenues
of about 37 billion kroner (dlrs 5.6 billion).
	   ``The strategic cooperation is to ensure Danish meat's position
on the world market,'' the companies said in a joint statement.
Pork and bacon are among Denmark's major export products.
	   On Wednesday, Danish Crown fired 50 workers, citing the unstable
economic situation in Russia which is its main export market for
processed meat.

rights &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The center-left government on Friday
approved a plan to grant European Union citizens living in Belgium
municipal voting rights as of 2000, an important step in a long
legislative procedure.
	   The government plan will now go to parliament and it will need a
change in the constitution before the citizens of the 14 other
nations can vote in Belgium's municipal elections in two years
time.
	   Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene was able to push through the
proposal after the opposition French-speaking conservatives said
they would back the plan, making it possible to win the necessary
two-thirds majority in parliament.
	   Up to now, the constitution allows only Belgian nationals to
vote.
	   The plan also has provisions that could make it possible for
non-EU immigrants to vote in the 2006 elections.

Factory workers riot in West Java town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Thousands of workers from a textile
factory in West Java rioted Friday after a protest to demand higher
pay, the official Antara news agency reported.
	   It said about 8,000 workers of PT Indorama in Purwakarta, about
90 kilometers (56 miles) southeast of Jakarta, burned several
company cars and hurled stones at the company's office.
	   They damaged a managers' dormitory and attacked a fire truck
that came to the scene, Antara said.
	   A protester, injured by rocks from fellow workers, was rushed to
the hospital, Antara said.
	   The workers were demanding a monthly salary increase of 150,000
rupiah (dlrs 13), while the company only agreed to a 25,000 rupiah
(dlrs 2.2) raise, Antara said.

<TEXT>
	   AVDOTINO, Russia (AP) _ In a small village hidden behind a thick
curtain of trees already tinged with golden leaves, Viktor
Korzhavin is using his hands and a hoe to brave Russia's latest
economic crisis.
	   ``The land saves us. See this, it's goat's milk,'' said
Korzhavin, pointing to a chipped green metal pail. ``I'd rather
have a cow, but I can't afford one.''
	   Korzhavin and other Russians in this scraggly village 50
kilometers (30 miles) east of Moscow know they cannot count on the
state for help and must rely on themselves _ their labor and the
land _ to survive.
	   ``We're not sugar,'' said the retired mechanic, clutching his
precious pail of milk as he headed home on a muddy road under a
cold rain marking the end of summer. ``We won't melt.''
	   Russia has plunged into crisis by the collapse of its currency,
the ruble, and a power struggle between the Duma and President
Boris Yeltsin over his choice of prime minister.
	   The Duma, the lower house of parliament, on Friday postponed a
confirmation vote on acting prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
after parliament leaders said Yeltsin had called for more talks.
	   Most Russians always have lived in isolated small towns and
villages, where existence has never been easy. Now they are
weathering Russia's latest economic and political crisis, relying
on their land and wits to survive.
	   They don't expect help from the government or the politicians.
	   ``Things have gotten bad. We don't understand what's
happening,'' said Valentina Grigoryeva. ``We don't count on
politicians. We get through life one day at a time.''
	   It's tough, however, for the villagers to stand tall under the
weight of price increases, fear of rationing, worries of prolonged
instability and near total disdain for the politicians in power.
	   Sagging wooden houses surrounded by forest on one side and
fields on the other line the two roads in Avdotino, which has two
stores, a grocery store and a housewares shop called: Everything
For Your Home.
	   Prices on some items in the grocery store have already doubled
since the Russian government devalued the ruble nearly three weeks
ago, and villagers were stocking up on matches and soap at the
housewares store.
	   Grigoryeva's back swayed under a load of seven boxes of laundry
detergent, a bag of concentrated detergent, a bottle of dishwashing
soap, vinegar and a loaf of white bread.
	   ``I'm worried we'll have ration cards again, and prices will
surely go up,'' she said, explaining why she was stocking up even
though the store had plenty of everything on the shelves.
	   But except for staples like bread and soap, Grigoryeva almost
never goes to the local grocery. ``My pension is too small,''
explained the retired textile worker.
	   In her garden, she keeps her family from going hungry by growing
beets, potatoes and carrots. She's still angry about the loss of
her chickens. Thieves stole all 14 birds, depriving the family of
eggs and a valuable source of protein.
	   In the summer, she and other villagers collect berries to make
jams. Nettles are used for making soup. Fall is for hunting
mushrooms, which are then pickled to last throughout the winter.
	   Although she doesn't want to return to communism, Grigoryeva
says she misses the feeling of unity she says existed in the Soviet
Union, especially during the war. Now she takes solace in religion.
	   ``I am happy to be able to go to church,'' she said. ``That
brings people together.''
	   Despite rubbing a string of maroon worry beads nonstop, Andrei
Khromov, 23, seems to be one of the few people in Avdotino who
doesn't share the cloud of pessimism hanging over the village.
	   ``People are buying and building,'' said Khromov, who owns the
store. ``We have to go forward and not backward. I want the market
to continue. We should stick with Chernomyrdin. He made a lot of
reforms, you know.''
	   Alexander Dubin, a former army officer who works part time at
the store loading boards, doors and sheet metal, doesn't agree.
He's fed up with all politicians, even the Communists despite 15
years as a party member.
	   ``The Duma (parliament) doesn't do anything. They just vote and
vote. Who needs them,'' said Dubin. ``Let there be a dictator so at
least there will be sausage.''
	   Dubin, 41, his wife and two children came to Avdotino where his
mother lives and has a plot of land after he was mustered out of
the army two years ago due to military cutbacks.
	   ``I expected to be retired and relaxing in my own garden, not to
have to be working in one,'' he said.

Andersson, Dahlin gone after nine years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHAN NASSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ It hasn't happened in a competitive
match since 1990. But neither Kennet Andersson nor Martin Dahlin,
who combined for nine goals in the 1994 World Cup, will take the
field for Sweden when the Scandinavian nation opens its European
Championship campaign Saturday against England.
	   Andersson, who also plays for Bologna in Italy's Serie A,
sustained a thigh injury and will be sidelined for three weeks. The
tall striker had five goals in USA 94, third best.
	   Dahlin, who's been struggling, didn't even play for Blackburn in
the Premier League against Leicester last Saturday.
	   Henrik Larsson of Glasgow Celtic, Jorgen Pettersson of Borussia
Moenchengladbach and Andreas Andersson of Newcastle are candidates
for the two spots up front at Rasunda Stadium. Larsson and
Pettersson are consistent strikers for their club teams, but they
have no impressive scoring statistics for Sweden.
	   A veteran from the 1994 World Cup when the Swedes finished
third, Larsson has only seven goals for the national team and only
three in competitive matches.
	   Petterson has five goals, all but one in friendlies.
	   And Andersson has scored four goals for Sweden, all in
friendlies.
	   ``But it doesn't matter if I've scored goals in competitve
matches or not,'' Pettersson said. ``What really is important is to
be concentrated against England. I know I'll get only two or three
chances and then I must be 100 percent focused.''
	   Pettersson, who scored three goals for Moenchengladbach this
season and three goals as a starter in his three last games for
Sweden, would love to face defender Tony Adams again.
	   ``I met him in the UEFA Cup two years ago,'' Pettersson
recalled. ``We eliminated Arsenal, but I didn't score. He (Adams)
was a very tough player.''
	   But England manager Glenn Hoddle said Adams suffered an ankle
injury in training Thursday and rated the Arsenal star's chances of
playing as only 50-50.
	   ``Tony has an ankle problem, although not the long-term ankle
problem that he's had,'' Hoddle said.
	   England, with in-form Liverpool striker Michael Owen, still is
favored against the Swedes.
	   ``But Owen is only 18,'' Pettersson said. ``He can also get
nervous.''
	   Tomas Brolin, the 1994 World Cup FIFA All Star who retired three
weeks ago only to make a temporary (Swedish) second-division
comeback as goalkeeper last weekend, believes England is overrated.
	   ``It's not easy to perform well after a World Cup,'' said
Brolin, who will attend the sellout match. ``We have experienced
that. My guess is a draw or a Swedish victory. Sweden seldom loses
important matches at Rasunda Stadium.''
	   Brolin's 82nd-minute volley at Rasunda in 1992 gave Sweden a 2-1
victory against England in the European Championship. The loss
eliminated England. Host Sweden reached the semifinals.
	   Sweden has not lost to England in 30 years. The teams drew four
times in their last six matches since 1979, two of them 0-0 draws
before the 1990 World Cup finals and the last one a 3-3 draw in
1995 in Leeds when the Swedes led 3-1 with two minutes left. Sweden
won the two other matches, 1-0 in 1986 and 2-1 in 1992.
	   Coach Tommy Soderberg, who replaced Tommy Svensson after Sweden
failed to qualify for both Euro 96 in England and this year's World
Cup in France, has been successful during his first season. In
pre-World Cup matches, Sweden beat two eventual quarterfinalists in
France, Italy and Denmark (both 1-0) and played eventual champion
France to a goalless draw.
	   Hoddle also said Paul Merson picked up an injury during
Thursday's training. Merson and Adams will have fitness tests
Saturday.
	   Missing from Hoddle's original squad are Nicky Butt, Rio
Ferdinand and most recently Steve McManaman.
	   David Beckham is suspended for being his infamous red card
against Argentina in a second-round World Cup match that England
lost after a penalty shootout. David Batty and Gary Neville, two
other World Cuppers, are injured.

Malaria breaks out in Kyrgyzstan

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Kyrgyz Health Ministry has mounted an
anti-malaria campaign after the first outbreak of the disease in
the former Soviet republic in 20 years, a news agency reported
Friday.
	   At least four people have come down with malaria in the village
of Panfilovskoye in central Kyrgyzstan and 19 others with symptoms
of the disease are under medical supervision, the ITAR-Tass news
agency said.
	   Health care and sanitation have deteriorated throughout the
former Soviet republics, and outbreaks of cholera and once-rare
diseases have become increasingly common.

Ethnic Albanian leader welcomes interim agreement for Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with reported arrests, weapons surrender &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The top ethnic Albanian leader
Friday welcomed a tentative, U.S.-mediated formula for ending the
Kosovo crisis and indicated he would try to win over hardliners to
a peace process rather than continue the battle for full
independence.
	   Fighting continued for a third day Friday near Orahovac, 55
kilometers (34 miles), southwest of Pristina. American and European
leaders have urged an end to the violence so that U.S.-led
diplomacy can prevent a humanitarian disaster among tens of
thousands of refugees left homeless by the conflict.
	   The Serb Media Center said police Friday arrested 60 suspected
members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, who were rounded up in the
Prizren area near the scene of the latest fighting.
	   Speaking to reporters, Ibrahim Rugova said ``the possibility of
an interim and temporary accord is under consideration,''
confirming U.S. and Belgrade statements issued over the past few
days.
	   Such an agreement, Rugova said, would last for a period of three
years and its principal objective would be to ``normalize life'' in
the embattled province and ``create conditions for a lasting
solution.''
	   ``We have to do something to end the negative trends and prevent
an imminent tragedy for Kosovo, '' Rugova said, adding this can
only be achieved with the help of the Americans and Europeans.
	   As part of that international effort, Russian Deputy Foreign
Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky was to meet Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade later Friday, Belgrade's independent
radio B-92 reported.
	   The radio said Russian official would brief Milosevic on the
U.S.-Russia summit, in which both President Clinton and Russian
President Boris Yeltsin called for a diplomatic solution in Kosovo.
	   In Vienna, Austria, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
both Rugova and Milosevic had agreed in principle on a formula for
self-rule for the majority Albanian province, subject to review
after three years.
	   The agreement would fall short of Albanian demands for full
independence from Serbia, a part of Yugoslavia. Fighting is
continuing, and details will require months of negotiations, which
would break down if the violence does not end.
	   Still, Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel said the
framework offers the ``first glimmer of hope'' for a peaceful end
to more than six months of fighting.
	   The key to the success could be the KLA, many of whose members
oppose Rugova because of his disavowal of violence. But Western
diplomats hope that enough KLA members will eventually accept the
diplomatic process, leaving hard-liners isolated politically within
the Albanian community.
	   Asked whether he could win over the KLA to the formula, Rugova
said he represents ``all residents of Kosovo,'' indicating he would
take responsibility for building support among the Albanian
community, which makes up 90 percent of the 2 million Kosovo
population.
	   On Friday, the government-run Tanjug news agency said ethnic
Albanians in villages of the Prizren region were handing over
weapons in large numbers to Serb police.
	   Fighting in Kosovo escalated in March after Milosevic launched a
crackdown to destroy the KLA, whom the Serbs describe as
``terrorists.''
	   As part of the U.S. diplomatic effort, John Shattuck, U.S.
assistant secretary of state for human rights, was expected in
Belgrade and Pristina later Friday. Former Sen. Bob Dole, who lost
the presidency to President Clinton in 1996, is also due here in
the area on the weekend.

Congolese rebels study Zimbabwe's call for peace talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES Zimbabwe-Congo; ADDS byline.
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Despite objecting to Zimbabwe's mediation
effort, Congolese rebels said Friday they were evaluating a
proposal for all-party peace talks announced by Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe.
	   ``I have to discuss it with my movement,'' rebel leader Ernest
Wamba dia Wamba said. ``It's a subject of negotiations who should
be mediator. The peace process can't be dictated by one person.''
	   Wamba said the rebels will decide later Friday whether or not to
attend such peace talks. So far, no invitation had been received,
he said.
	   Mugabe said Thursday that talks involving all those engaged in
the Congo conflict would take place probably on Monday at the
Zimbabwean resort of Victoria Falls.
	   In Harare, officials declined to comment on reports the meeting
would consider a plan for a regional peace keeping force including
South Africa, Zambia and the forces of Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe
already in the Congo to help embattled President Laurent Kabila.
	   If South Africa joined such a force it would be the first
deployment of its troops outside its borders since President Nelson
Mandela came to power in the first all race elections in 1994.
	   Wamba said any talks must be held in a neutral country _ not
Zimbabwe _ which has 2,800 troops on Congo.
	   The allied forces gave Kabila the military might he needed to
blunt rebel advances on the capital, Kinshasa. Kabila's allies now
threaten to support his drive against the rebels' eastern
strongholds.
	   Wamba suggested that such talks, if they take place, should be
held in either Tanzania or Zambia.
	   In the past, Kabila has rejected talks with the rebels and
instead demanded the withdrawal of Rwandan and Ugandan troops, whom
he has accused of backing the revolt and invading the country.
	   The rebels _ ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of Kabila's
army and opposition politicians _ say the revolt is a Congolese
affair. They accuse Kabila of incompetence, nepotism and corruption
_ the same problems Kabila had promised to eradicate after ousting
longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in May 1997.
	   On Thursday, Arthur Zahidi Ngoma, vice president of the rebel
Congolese Democratic Coalition, said any negotiated settlement with
Kabila was unlikely.
	   ``Democracy cannot be negotiated. The only thing that can be
negotiated is Kabila's departure,'' Ngoma said. ``War will
accelerate, and we are hoping to finish it soon.''

Emergency landing for Royal Airlines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GOOSE BAY, Newfoundland (AP) _ A Royal Airlines plane en route
from Toronto to Glasgow, Scotland, made an emergency landing Friday
after the pilot discovered smoke in the cockpit.
	   The Boeing 757 with 225 people on board was near a Canadian
Forces Base when the pilot radioed that he would be making an
emergency landing, said Capt. David Muralt.
	   The incident came less than 36 hours after a Swissair jetliner
plunged into the Atlantic off Nova Scotia, killing all 229 people
aboard. Muralt said that tragedy weighed on the minds of people at
the Labrador airbase.
	   ``Everybody's really happy around here, I can tell you that
much,'' he said.
	   Muralt said Royal Airlines, a Montreal-based charter company,
was to send a repair team to the base by midmorning. It is not
known what went wrong.
	   Col. Doug Langdon said the passengers were coping with what
ended up being a relatively minor inconvenience.
	   ``I think mentally, you can imagine ... getting on a flight so
soon after what happened was probably a strain for some people and
then to have smoke in the cockpit of the airplane you're on,
they're pretty shaken up,'' he said.
	   The pilot of the Swissair flight reported smoke in the cockpit
before the plane crashed.

detention camps run by two armed Tamil groups opposed to the
secessionist Tamil Tiger rebels.
	   In a letter to President Chandrika Kumaratunga, the London-based
human rights organization said the two groups were helping Sri
Lanka's military fight the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, known
as the LTTE.
	   ``In the last few years, Amnesty International has repeatedly
raised concern about the persistent practice on the part of the
army and the police in the north and east to allow (if not
encourage) members of armed Tamil groups opposed to the LTTE to
carry out search operations or screen civilians,'' Amnesty
International said in a statement.
	   The statement said the People's Liberation Organization of Tamil
Eelam and the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization operated by more
than 20 detention camps.
	   Sri Lanka's government has introduced several measures to
safeguard the welfare of detainees, but Amnesty International said
the measures are enforced poorly, if at all.
	   The Tamil Tigers are fighting for a separate homeland in
northeastern Sri Lanka for the island country's minority Tamils.
They accuse the majority Sinhalese of discriminating against Tamils
in education and jobs.
	   More than 54,000 people have been killed in the fighting since
1983.

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Five men riding a boat through a
flooded street died Friday after a live electricity wire snapped
and fell on them, police said.
	   The accident occurred in Dhaka's southern Islambagh district,
where streets have been flooded by overflowing River Buriganga.
Local residents are using boats to commute.
	   More than 700 Bangladeshis have died lost their lives due to
floods and flood-related diseases and accidents in the past two
months. At least 25 of them died after hitting submerged power
lines.

Senior U.S. human rights official arrives in Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
for Human Rights, John Shattuck, arrived in Serb-led Yugoslavia
Friday, the U.S. embassy in Belgrade confirmed.
	   Shattuck was expected to travel straight to the southern
province of Kosovo, as part of U.S. diplomatic efforts to help
solve the crisis there .
	   Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, more than 90 percent of the
province's population, are fighting Serb-led government forces to
achieve independence from Serbia and Yugoslavia.
	   An estimated 260,000 people have been displaced by the fighting
and international aid organizations have warned of a catastrophe if
the fighting continues into winter.
	   Former Sen. Bob Dole, who lost the presidency to President
Clinton in 1996, is also due here in the area on the weekend.

Who killed 4-year-old might be kept secret under Swedish law
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The body of a 4-year-old boy is found
at a lakeside, beaten and sexually abused. It is the kind of death
that cries out for answers, but Swedish law may prevent the public
from ever hearing them.
	   The prime suspects in the death are also children. If police
determine that they are in fact the culprits, ``there is a great
risk that the investigation will be classified as secret,'' Rolf
Sandberg, the police commissioner in the town of Arvika, said
Friday.
	   The town some 300 kilometers (180 miles) west of Stockholm has
been the focus of intense media attention since the boy, identified
only as Kevin, was found dead on the evening of Aug. 16.
	   At first, authorities believed he had drowned in the lake
adjacent to a residential area. Then they found beating injuries on
the body, along with unspecified evidence of unspecified sexual
abuse.
	   The police have held near-daily news conferences about the case,
though with little to report. They said the investigation was
proceeding and declined comment on speculation that the killers
were other children rather than an adult molester.
	   Then on Thursday evening, police confirmed that other children
were the main suspects, raising the possibility of legal
complications unprecedented in the country.
	   Swedish law does not allow criminal charges to be filed against
anyone under the age of 15. If anyone under that age commits what
would otherwise be a criminal act, the child is dealt with not by
police but by social service agencies, whose proceedings are
confidential.
	   Sweden has no equivalent of the juvenile court system that
exists in the United States, such as the court in Chicago
considering the case of two boys aged 7 and 8 suspected of killing
an 11-year-old girl this summer.
	   In the Swedish case, police have not given details about the
children being investigated in the death.
	   ``If it is only children involved, then according to the secrecy
laws ... there is injury and detriment to those involved if the
information comes out,'' Sandberg said at the news conference.
	   Mikael Rying, a crime researcher at Stockholm University, said
there is no known case of a child killing another child in Sweden,
according to the Swedish news agency TT.
	   ``There are elements in this case such that if I had told them,
nobody would have believed that this had happened,'' Sandberg was
quoted as saying in the newspaper Aftonbladet.

Cavallo: Argentina's experience useful for Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Argentina's former economics minister said Friday
that his country's experience setting up a currency board could
help Russia in its economic distress.
	   Domingo Cavallo, architect of Argentina's economic reform plan,
said the most important tasks for Russia now are the stabilization
of the ruble, the renewal of the population's faith in the
currency, and the creation of an effective system of tax
collection.
	   He said he hadn't seen details of the plan announced Friday by
acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, but said that
Chernomyrdin's description of the plan indicated it was similar to
the program put into effect in Argentina.
	   Starting in 1991, Argentina implemented a strict monetary reform
plan that pegged the Argentine peso to the U.S. dollar and required
the government to keep an equivalent amount of dollars in reserve
to back up all local currency in circulation.
	   Cavallo is in Russia at the invitation of acting Deputy Premier
Boris Fyodorov, who is heading a working group charged with
resolving Russia's financial crisis.
	   Cavallo said he had held consultations with Fyodorov and other
government ministers, as well as with Chernomyrdin, and that he had
full confidence in the ``professionalism'' of Fyodorov's team.
	   He said he hadn't advised a particular reform program for
Russia. But he added that ``it would be hard for Russia to find a
more effective way of exiting from the crisis'' than the program
implemented by Argentina.
	   Chernomyrdin told parliament Friday that the government would
resist calls to print more rubles unless they are backed by a rise
in foreign exchange reserves.
	   He also said poorly-run businesses must be allowed to go
bankrupt, and taxes must be cut substantially.
	   Cavallo said that the government must act quickly to alleviate
the pressures on Russian consumers.
	   ``I want to add that the less the ruble depreciates, the less
the people will suffer,'' he said. ``So the sooner the government
stabilizes the ruble, the higher its value will be against the
dollar and the less inflation there will be.''

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea denied today that it
launched a ballistic missile this week, saying it successfully
fired into orbit its first artificial satellite, which it described
as ``scientific.''
	   U.S. officials say North Korea test fired a Taepo Dong 1
ballistic missile on Monday that flew across northern Japan and
crashed into the Pacific Ocean. The first stage landed in the Sea
of Japan.
	   A Foreign Ministry statement criticized the United States and
Japan for making a ``fuss'' over the North's launch of a
``scientific satellite.''
	   ``Some people ... are making a fuss, ignorant of this valuable
success of science and technology,'' the statement said. ``They
suspected it to be a ballistic missile launching test, expressed
some `apprehensions' and described it as `a serious event.'''
	   But the North also said that its rocket capacity can be used for
military purposes and warned the United States and Japan to stop
any hostile moves against it.
	   ``Particularly, the forces hostile towards the DPRK (North
Korea) must be mindful that their attempt to lead the DPRK to a
change will bring them nothing but destruction,'' the statement
said.
	   According to the North's official Korean Central News Agency,
the satellite was launched Monday on a three-stage, domestically
developed rocket. The timing and sites where the first two stages
of the rockets fell coincide with the American and Japanese times
and locations for what they described as a ballistic missile.
	   ``Our scientists and technicians have succeeded in the first
artificial satellite aboard a multistage rocket into orbit,'' KCNA
said.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said he doubted the rocket
carried a satellite.
	   ``If it was launched, I guess Japan's technology could have
already picked it up,'' said Obuchi. ``What kind of satellite is
it?''
	   The news agency said it would ``contribute to promoting
scientific research for peaceful use of outer space'' and be useful
in confirming calculations for future ``practical satellites.''
	   The satellite, it added, ``is now transmitting the melody of the
immortal revolutionary hymns `song of General Kim Il Sung' and
`Song of General Kim Jong Il' and the morse signals `Juche Korea'
in 27MHZ.''
	   Juche, or self-reliance, is North Korea's guiding philosophy.
	   The North's claim comes a day before the Marxist country's newly
elected parliament was to elect leader Kim Jong Il as its head of
state.
	   The launch of the rocket ``manifests the iron will and
indomitable spirit of our party, army and people who are working
hard for the greater prosperity of the country, pulling through
difficulties,'' the North Korean Foreign Ministry said in a
statement.

Romanian tennis star misses fatal Swissair flight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Except for an unexpected loss at the
U.S. Open, Romanian tennis star Dinu Pescariu would have been on
the Swissair flight which crashed off Canada, killing all aboard, a
Bucharest newspaper reported Friday.
	   But Pescariu was defeated Monday by Dutch player Jan Siemerink
6-4, 6-3, 6-0. So he left the United States a day earlier than
planned and returned to Romania.
	   ``I haven't gotten over the shock,'' Romanian tennis federation
official, Alexe Bardan, told the newspaper National. Bardan said
Pescariu had asked him to reserve a ticket on the Wednesday evening
Geneva-bound flight.
	   ``Pescariu should have been on the Wednesday evening flight,''
he told the paper. ``Who knows why, he got a ticket a day earlier.
Maybe it was meant to be.''
	   Pescariu, who has made no comment, was said to be in a state of
shock by the paper. He is due to play in an upcoming dlrs 50,000
Transylvanian tennis tournament.
	   Pescariu was not the only tennis star who was supposed to have
been on the Swissair flight SR111.
	   Swiss tennis star Marc Rosset and his coach were booked on the
flight. But Rosset changed his reservation at the last minute.
	   ``But when we were in the hotel, Marc said he wanted to stay an
extra day after all,'' his coach Pierre Simsolo said. ``I will be
eternally grateful to him,'' he told the Swiss sports agency.

 &UR; Wonder Boy Owen ready for Europe after taking on the World

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ England striker Michael Owen has
already wowed the World Cup with his electrifying pace and
individual goalscoring ability. He has backed it up in the Premier
League and now he is ready to take on Europe.
	   The 18-year-old Liverpool striker scored one of the goals of the
tournament at the France 98 World Cup and already leads the Premier
League scorers' table with four goals in three games, including
three in the first half against Newcastle last week.
	   He will make his European Championship debut for England on
Saturday against Sweden in Stockholm and has already been tipped to
lead England's charge, paired up front with captain Alan Shearer.
	   The Sweden match is England's first Euro 2000 qualifier and its
first international game since being eliminated from the World Cup
in the second round after a penalty shoot-out against Argentina.
	   England has not won in Sweden since 1965 and its recent run
against the Swedes has been less than spectacular, it's last
match-up ending in a 3-3 draw at Leeds in 1995 after England fought
back from 3-1 down.
	   Media attention in England in the week leading up the Sweden
game has focused on conflict within the English team caused by
coach Glenn Hoddle's World Cup Diary and defender Tony Adam's book
``Addicted''.
	   But in Sweden, all the attention is on Owen.
	   He was mobbed by fans, male and female, between the airport and
hotel when he arrived in Stockholm on Thursday night and has been
allocated a personal security guard to help him wade through the
adoring crowd.
	   But he takes it in his stride.
	   ``I've become used to it. It doesn't upset me,'' he said. ``It's
nice to be popular with football fans. It means you're doing the
right things on the pitch.''
	   Owen has also warned any team against focussing too much
attention on him.
	   ``We have a great England team but if people to pay special
attention to me, I can cope with it,'' he said.
	   ``If three players want to put me out of the game then that will
mean we've got two spare ones somewhere else and they can do the
business instead.''
	   Liverpool re-signed the young star for five years just before
the World Cup and had to put up the hands-off sign after the
tournament when clubs from all over the world tried to lure him
with multi-million dollar contracts.
	   The teenager who still lives at home with his parents and says
he still plays the game for the love of it, was reportedly the
subject of an unusual transfer offer this week.
	   Italian team Lazio reportedly offered to pay Liverpool 1.5
million pounds (dlrs 2.46 million) for the right to have first
option on Owen if he decides to leave Liverpool.
	   Lazio is banking on the fact that he will eventually leave
Anfield.

 &UR; Taiwanese ex-prostitutes vow to carry on struggle

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A year after Taipei closed the city's
licensed brothels, former prostitutes are continuing their campaign
for reinstatement _ and observers say the city's notorious sex
industry is more flourishing than ever.
	   Prostitutes and their supporters rallied in the city's former
red-light district on Friday accusing Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian
of attempting to gain points with voters by destroying their
livelihoods.
	   Holding candles and singing protest songs, the women mocked
Chen's announcement earlier in the week that he would extend
welfare for former sex workers for another year.
	   ``Degrading legal prostitutes to grandstand for elections,''
Wang Ping-fang, director of the women's group, said, describing
Chen's policy of offering 7,770 Taiwan dollar (U.S. dlrs 222)
monthly stipends as ``fake welfare.''
	   Of the 40 ex-prostitutes who have accepted benefits, about half
are still working illicitly as prostitutes. Most of the 128
formerly licensed prostitutes are facing severe economic hardships,
Wang said.
	   ``Why use taxpayers' money to subsidize these women when they're
perfectly able to support themselves legally,'' she said.
	   City officials claim the program to help the women into other
jobs has been a success, and accuse brothel owners and organized
crime of being behind the campaign to reinstate legal prostitution.
	   Chen, of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, closed the
brothels on September 1, 1997, claiming that ending legal
prostitution was the trend among advanced nations. The city council
later voted to overturn the order, but Chen ignored the move.
	   Former brothels have mostly been shuttered, and though residents
say property prices have risen with the departure of legal
prostitution, neighborhood businesses have suffered badly from a
decline in tourism and nightlife.
	   Elsewhere, the illegal sex trade thrives with a variety rarely
seen before, says Ku Yu-ling, a social worker with the Solidarity
Front for Women Workers.
	   ``Closing the brothels has done nothing to eliminate the sex
industry, it just forced it further down,'' Ku said. Throughout the
city, the sex business continues in karaoke parlors, topless tea
shops, saunas, secret home brothels and a host of other outlets, Ku
said.
	   Chen's decision to close the brothels has been seized on by his
Nationalist Party opponent Ma Ying-jeou as an example of the
mayor's ``misgovernment.''
	   But Ma himself came under fire when a campaign ally compared the
brothels to public toilets.

WBC titlist Woodhall eyes showdown with Calzaghe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TELFORD, England (AP) _ Richie Woodhall goes into his first WBC
super-middleweight defense against substitute opponent Glenn Catley
Saturday knowing his opponent is blocking the route to a lucrative
showdown with big-punching WBO titlist Joe Calzaghe.
	   ``A fight with Calzaghe is at the back of my mind and that
should be worth a million pounds (dlrs 1.65 million) to each of
us,'' the Englishman said.
	   ``But, in all fairness to Glenn, if I can't beat the British
middleweight champion, then I shouldn't really be a world
champion.''
	   Catley, who steps up a weight, replaces Italian southpaw
Vincenzo Nardiello, who pulled out with a calf muscle injury
suffered in training.
	   ``I've done all my training to face Nardiello, a southpaw, but
Catley is orthodox,'' said Woodhall, who won the title from South
African's Thulane ``Sugar Boy'' Malinga, in March.
	   ``He is certainly more powerful than Nardiello, and if I stand
toe-to-toe with him, I will come unstuck.
	   ``I have got to keep him at long range and make sure I don't get
drawn into a war with him,'' said Woodhall, whose only loss in 24
fights was a WBA challenge against American fighter Keith Holmes
two years ago. ``It's annoying that I'd prepared to face a southpaw
but I've just got to get on with it.''
	   Catley, at 5-foot-8 (1.72 meters) five inches (12.5 cms) shorter
than Woodhall, will have to deal with the champion's huge reach
advantage and could be an easy target for the titlist's accurate
jabs, which mesmerized Malinga.
	   But Catley, 22-2-0, says he has nothing to lose.
	   ``My British title and my world ranking as a middleweight are
not in jeopardy so I can only gain from the fight,'' he said. ``The
only person who can really lose in Richie.''

Ethnic Albanian leader welcomes interim agreement for Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reported arrests, weapons surrender. &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The top ethnic Albanian leader
welcomed on Friday a tentative, U.S.-mediated formula for ending
the crisis in Kosovo province, and he indicated he would try to
persuade hard-liners to accept peace efforts rather than continue
battling for full independence.
	   Fighting continued for a third day Friday near Orahovac, 55
kilometers (34 miles) southwest of Pristina, Kosovo's capital.
American and European leaders have urged an end to the violence so
that U.S.-led diplomacy can prevent a humanitarian disaster among
tens of thousands of refugees left homeless by the conflict in the
breakaway Serbian province.
	   The Serb Media Center said Friday that police arrested 60
suspected members of the ethnic Albanian guerrilla force called the
Kosovo Liberation Army. The fighters were rounded up in the Prizren
area near the scene of the latest fighting.
	   Speaking to reporters, Ibrahim Rugova said ``the possibility of
an interim and temporary accord is under consideration,''
confirming U.S. and Belgrade statements issued over the past few
days.
	   Such an agreement, Rugova said, would last for a period of three
years and its principal objective would be to ``normalize life'' in
the embattled province and ``create conditions for a lasting
solution.''
	   ``We have to do something to end the negative trends and prevent
an imminent tragedy for Kosovo, '' Rugova said, adding this can
only be achieved with the help of the Americans and Europeans.
	   Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population of the 2
million. They are seeking greater autonomy from Serbia, the
dominant Yugoslav republic, but Serbs have used a heavy military
presence to retain control of the province.
	   As part of the international peace effort, Russian Deputy
Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky was to meet Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade later Friday, Belgrade's
independent radio B-92 reported.
	   The radio said Russian official would brief Milosevic on the
U.S.-Russia summit, in which both U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin called for a diplomatic solution in
Kosovo.
	   In Vienna, Austria, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
said both Rugova and Milosevic had agreed in principle on a formula
for self-rule for the majority Albanian province, subject to review
after three years.
	   The agreement would fall short of Albanian demands for full
independence from Serbia. Fighting in Kosovo was continuing, and
details of the deal will likely require months of negotiations that
will break down if the violence does not end.
	   Still, Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel said the
framework offers the ``first glimmer of hope'' for a peaceful end
to more than six months of fighting.
	   The key to the success could be the Kosovo Liberation Army, many
of whose members oppose Rugova because of his disavowal of
violence. But Western diplomats hope that enough KLA members will
eventually accept the diplomatic process, leaving hard-liners
isolated politically among the ethnic Albanians.
	   Asked whether he could win over the KLA to the peace formula,
Rugova said he represents ``all residents of Kosovo.''
	   On Friday, the government-run Tanjug news agency said ethnic
Albanians in villages of the Prizren region were handing over large
numbers of weapons to Serb police.
	   Fighting in Kosovo escalated in March after Milosevic launched a
crackdown to destroy the KLA, whom the Serbs describe as
``terrorists.''
	   As part of the U.S. diplomatic effort, John Shattuck, U.S.
assistant secretary of state for human rights, was expected in
Belgrade and Pristina later Friday. Former Sen. Bob Dole, who lost
the presidency to Clinton in 1996, is also due in the area this
weekend.

Smith appeals FINA four-year drug ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Irish triple Olympic gold medalist
Michelle Smith has appealed against the four-year ban imposed on
her by swimming's world governing body after it found her guilty of
manipulating a doping test.
	   Smith, who filed the appeal with the International Court of
Arbitration for Sport on Thursday, could be swimming competitively
by Christmas if her appeal against the FINA ban is successful.
	   CAS spokesman Matthieu Reeb said the Swiss-based international
court would most likely be Smith's final instance for appeal.
	   ``The first step is an exchange of written statements between
the two parties and then we set a date for an arbitration hearing
in Lausanne,'' he said.
	   Reeb said it was CAS policy to settle disputes within four
months of the date that the relevant sporting body handed down its
original decision against an athlete.
	   He said Smith and FINA could each choose one arbitrator from a
list of 150 sports law and arbitration experts and CAS would
appoint a president to head a three-person panel to hear Smith's
appeal.
	   At a FINA doping panel hearing on Aug. 6, Smith was found guilty
of tampering with an out-of-competition urine test taken at her
home in Kilkenny, Ireland in January.
	   The panel said the sample contained a large quantity of alcohol,
probably whiskey.
	   The ban included the Sydney 2000 Olympics and the 2001 World
Championships, in effect ending the 28-year-old swimmer's career.
	   ``I am fighting for my reputation and for my right to go to
Sydney,'' Smith said after the FINA ban was handed down.
	   ``I know I have never done anything in the past to put myself or
my family or my country to shame. I am determined to follow this
through to the end. I look forward to doing my country proud
again.''
	   Smith said the alcohol in the sample hadn't prevented the IOC
drug testing laboratory in Barcelona, Spain, from determining that
no performance-enhancing drug or signs of drug use were present.
	   ``I had no motive for introducing alcohol or indeed any other
masking agent into my sample, as I have never tested positive for
the use of any banned substance throughout my career,'' she said.
	   Smith said FINA had produced no proof that she was to blame for
the added alcohol. She accused FINA of conspiring ``to ensure that
I did not swim again and to ensure that, by whatever method was
available to them, a ban was imposed.''
	   Smith had a mediocre record before capturing three gold medals
and a bronze at the Atlanta Games, three years after Erik de Bruin
became her coach.
	   Her marriage to de Bruin, the Dutch discus and shot put champion
banned for four years after testing positive to excessive
testosterone, stirred speculation that her own meteoric rise had
been aided by drugs.
	   However, Smith said she had been tested more often than any of
her rivals.
	   FINA said her original and backup drug tests, which were stored
and tested separately, both showed high-alcohol content. This, it
said, ruled out the possibility that anyone other than Smith had
tampered with the samples.

Pope meets with cardinal implicated in loan-sharking probe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ An Italian cardinal implicated in a
loan-sharking investigation met Friday with Pope John Paul II.
	   The Vatican described the meeting with Cardinal Michele
Giordano, the popular archbishop of Naples, as strictly private and
provided no details of the talks.
	   It was not clear whether the pope had summoned Giordano for
explanations or whether the meeting was arranged as a show of
support.
	   Giordano has denied any wrongdoing. While the Vatican has said
nothing about the substance of the allegations, it expressed
irritation over the methods used by prosecutors, which included the
tapping of the cardinal's telephone.
	   The Italian government has insisted it has not violated
church-state accords, but indicated it is prepared to update the
agreements to keep them in line with changes in Italy's criminal
code.
	   Giordano has not been charged, but has been formally placed
under investigation.
	   Prosecutors are investigating whether Giordano gave his brother,
who was arrested Aug. 20 in a massive loan-sharking scheme, money
for the illegal loans.
	   Giordano, known for his denunciations of usury, says he gave
blank checks on his personal account to his brother, who was having
financial problems.

the fifth inning Friday as the Orix BlueWave beat the Pacific

Clinton highlights Irish economy as prize of peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Gateway speech; trims &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ President Bill Clinton turned Friday from
the turmoil in Northern Ireland to the Irish Republic's thriving
economy, holding it up as the prize of peace. ``Ireland has moved
from nightmares to dreams,'' he declared.
	   Surrounded by computer equipment at a growing high-tech company,
Clinton saluted Ireland's 7.7 percent growth rate last year as the
highest of any country in Europe. Peace and stability can cement
the good times, he said.
	   ``Ireland has assumed great responsibilities. As a result you
are moving toward permanent peace, remarkable prosperity,
unparalleled influence and a brighter tomorrow for your children,''
he said.
	   Borrowing the cadence of a traditional Irish blessing, he added:
``May the nightmares stay gone, the dreams stay bright, and the
responsibilities wear easily on your shoulders because the future
is yours.''
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, in turn, credited Clinton and
his role in brokering the Good Friday peace accord with holding out
to Northern Ireland the same promise of prosperity.
	   ``He's laid down for us _ for all of us _ that there is a path
to follow and if we are sensible, if we're brave and we follow that
path, then the reward is peace and stability and confidence. If we
don't, well, then the future is as gloomy as the past,'' Ahern said
at a picture-taking session with Clinton before they met privately
this morning.
	   At a reception that gave Clinton a chance to meet business
leaders, Ahern noted that American firms employ 400,000 people in
Ireland and dominate electronics, pharmaceuticals and other
industries.
	   ``Ireland is really an American economic tiger with a green
face,'' he said with a smile.
	   Ahern proudly led Clinton on a tour of the Gateway 2000 computer
plant and highlighted business opportunities in Ireland. Seated at
laptops with ``smart cards'' and using personalized codes, Clinton
and Ahern digitally affixed their signatures to an agreement on
developing electronic commerce between their two nations.
	   Despite the levity and optimism, Clinton warned against
complacency. ``I hope that success will whet your appetite for
working together instead of causing _ as success sometimes does _
people to forget what brought them to the point of success.''
	   Clinton met with Irish leaders as new anti-terrorist laws took
effect in Ireland and Britain Friday. Both governments sought
passage of the bills during Clinton's visit. The legislation is
expected to bolster political efforts by Protestants and Catholics
to make peace in Northern Ireland after 30 years of conflict.
	   With this trip meant to nudge along the infant peace pact,
Clinton was asked whether he expected to visit the Irish again.
	   ``For the sake of the peace process, I hope not. But for my own
sake, I hope so,'' he said, laughingly suggesting that next time he
would come more as tourist than enforcer.
	   Of the fragile peace, Clinton said, ``I hope it will be
institutionalized and off and going.''
	   The showers of Irish praise for Clinton on this tour were
briefly interrupted with a jolt this morning. Standing before news
cameras with Ahern at his side, Clinton was peppered with
reporters' questions about his handling of the Lewinsky affair. For
the first time, Clinton publicly used the words ``I'm sorry'' in
expressing regret for his inappropriate relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.
	   U.S. investment has been a major factor in the growth of the
Irish economy. Trade between the two countries last year was worth
dlrs 12 billion, a 19 percent increase over 1996.
	   Gateway's Dublin plant employs 1,300 people, mostly producing
personal computers for the European market. Gateway is considered a
symbol of the decade-long economic boom that has seen American
corporations build facilities in Ireland to serve the European
market.

Report: Thousands of Russian companies controlled by criminals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Thousands of Russian companies that account for
about 40 percent of the country's gross national product are
controlled by criminal groups, the head of Russia's Federal
Security Service (FSB) said Friday.
	   Vladimir Putin also told the Federation Council, the upper house
of the Russian parliament, that the FSB is investigating about
2,500 officials suspected of corruption.
	   Former soldiers are particularly vulnerable to being drawn into
criminal activities, Putin said, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   Although it has frequently announced anti-corruption campaigns
in the past, Russian government has been unable to stem the tide of
crime in the economy.
	   Russia's Interior Ministry acknowledged Friday that strengthened
ties between criminals and authorities helped drive up Russia's
overall crime rate by 4 percent in the first half of 1998 from the
same period last year, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Kidnappings were up by a third and theft also rose. Much of the
growth resulted from tensions in Russia's Caucasus region, an area
plagued by ethnic, religious, and territorial violence, Interior
Minister Sergei Stepashin said, according to Interfax.
	   Corruption also has contributed to the country's present
economic crisis, and another crime wave was likely to follow the
present disorder, Stepashin said.
	   ``Criminal actions led to the crisis of non-payments in the coal
industry,'' Interfax quoted him as saying. ``The same applies to
the fuel and energy complex.''
	   Crime and corruption is often cited by foreign investors as one
reason they are reluctant to invest in Russia.

Indonesia, Thailand fined dlrs 40,000 each for bad match
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL ALEXANDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Indonesia and Thailand were fined the
maximum dlrs 40,000 each Friday by the ASEAN Football Federation
for failing to play to win a Tiger Cup match, officials said.
	   ``When you talk about the spirit of the laws of the game, you
play to win,'' Paul Mony Samuel, the AFF's honorary chairman, told
a news conference.
	   Both teams indicated they would seek to have the fines reduced
Saturday by an appeals committee comprised of Malaysia and two
representives from each Brunei and Cambodia, the two AFF members
not competing in the Tiger Cup.
	   Further sanctions could come when the Asian Football
Confederation meets Sept. 11 in Kuala Lumpur. Both the Tiger Cup
organizing committee and the match commissioner will submit reports
on the match.
	   When the two teams met in Ho Chi Minh City on Monday, Indonesia
already had clinched a spot in the semifinals. Only a blowout could
keep defending champion Thailand, the top-ranked team in the
region, from advancing.
	   But the winner of the group would have to travel to Hanoi to
face Vietnam on National Day, a huge home-field advantage.
	   So with an international audience watching on live TV, neither
team tried to score in the first half. There was not a single
whistle. The crowd had all but vanished within 15 minutes.
	   The second half was slightly more aggressive after match
officials talked with the coaches. But with the score tied 2-2 and
time running out, Indonesia scored an intentional own goal as their
goalkeeper got out of the way.
	   Mony said the fines are all that could be imposed at this time.
	   ``The rules do not provide anything else to be done,'' he said.
``The match was played according to the laws of the game. You
cannot do anything else for players not wanting to play the game.''
	   He pointed to a 1990 World Cup qualifying match in which Germany
needed to win to advance, and Austria would gain a spot as long as
it lost no worse that 1-0. After Germany got a goal, both teams
stopped trying to score. FIFA took no action at the time because
nothing could be proven.
	   Mony said the Asian Football Confederation would consider
changing competition rules.
	   ``We don't want such a thing to happen again,'' he said. ``The
AFC will make sure it has the rules and regulations to ensure that
teams go to a competition to win.
	   As it turned out, the strategy backfired when Indonesia lost 2-1
to Singapore in the semifinals Thursday. Thailand's fears proved to
be justified when they lost 3-0 to Vietnam.

Doctors restore eyesight to 240 people in Somali town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Eye doctors have restored the eyesight
of more than 240 people in the central Somalia town of Belet Huen
during a four-day campaign that ended Friday, a local official
said.
	   Dr. Mohamed Dhaqaneh Elmi, a physician at the town's hospital
said four opthamologists arrived Tuesday in Belet Huen to assist
residents with eye problems.
	   Elmi, who spoke by VHF radio Friday with reporters in the
capital Mogadishu, about 300 kilometers (186 miles) south, said the
doctors treated 240 people in four days.
	   The doctors, who work with the Italian agency COSV _ Commitato
Operazione Servicio Voluntare, which runs the Belet Huen hospital _
returned Friday to the Kikuyu Mission Hospital in the Kenyan
capital Nairobi, which specializes in eye treatment.
	   Elmi said most of those who had their eyesight restored were
elderly, suffering from cataracts. But an eight-year-old boy who
was blind from birth because of cataracts, was also cured, Elmi
said.
	   Another eight patients were treated for glaucoma, while six
others needed only minor surgery, Elmi said.
	   The campaign was third of its kind after doctors from Kikuyu
Mission Hospital restored the eyesight of 266 people in March, and
another 294 people in June 1997.
	   Belet Huen has been peaceful in recent months after local
authorities, businessmen and the Islamic court decided to
collaborate to restore security. Much of Somalia has been plagued
with violence since different factions ousted President Siad Barre
in 1991 and then turned on each other.
	   Somalia has been without a central government since then.
	   In March 1997, a COSV convoy was attacked in Belet Huen by
gunmen and at least one person was killed. An Italian doctor
travelling with the convoy was unharmed.

Official: Republic of Congo cabinet minister survives attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ A government minister
narrowly escaped armed attackers in a village where former
supporters of Republic of Congo's ousted president are taking
refuge, officials said Friday.
	   Minister of Industry and Mines Michel Mampouya was unharmed in
the August 28 attack by armed men in the village of Mindouli, about
200 kilometers (125 miles) south of the capital, Brazzaville,
government spokesman Francois Ibovi said.
	   Without giving details about the incident, Ibovi said Mindouli
is a stronghold of former supporters of former President Pascal
Lissouba, who was ousted last October after a four-month rebellion
by forces loyal to President Denis Sassou-Nguesso. As many as
10,000 people were killed in the fighting.
	   The nearby town of Kindamba, which is also ``infiltrated'' by
Lissouba's supporters, has experienced several attacks in recent
months by bandits trying to ``sabotage the infrastructure of the
country,'' Ibovi said.
	   ``Faced with the crisis, the government has deployed all legal
methods in its possession and the authors of this great banditry
have been severely punished,'' the government said, promising
severe retaliation against anyone who ``tries to mimic the
insanity.''

Censored film to be screened in Turkey after 17 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ An award-winning film about the ordeal
of Turkish prisoners finally hits Turkey's movie screens in
November, ending a 17-year ban.
	   The Cannes Film Festival's 1982 Golden Palm award winner ``Yol''
(Road), by Turkish film director Yilmaz Guney, had limited viewing
at a few recent film festivals but was never shown to large
audiences in Turkey.
	   At the time it came out, strict censorship banned anything that
might serve to undermine the Turkish state or portray it as
oppressive.
	   Under pressure from human rights groups, the government has
grown more lenient toward films in recent years. ``Midnight
Express,'' long banned, was even shown on television.
	   ``Yol,'' which follows a group of prisoners on family leave,
shows both prisoners and their families suffering at the hands of
authorities.
	   ``We hope that anyone who believes in the freedoms of thought,
art and the artist will support this film,'' said Fatos Guney, the
late director's wife and head of the Yilmaz Guney foundation, which
campaigned for the lifting of the ban.
	   Guney, a leftist activist, started directing the film while
still serving a 19-year prison sentence for murdering a prosecutor
after a quarrel in a coffeehouse.
	   He smuggled out sketches and instructions for the shots. He
escaped from prison in 1981 and finished the film in Switzerland
before dying in exile in 1984.
	   Mrs. Guney said the director's last film, ``The Wall,'' about a
revolt in a Turkish prison, would also be screened next year. The
film, released in Europe in 1983, was also banned in Turkey.
	   ``Yol'' shared the award with an American film, ``Missing.''

IMF, Latin American officials seek to stop spread of crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with remarks by Argentina's finance minister, edits to
tighten &QL; 
 &UR; By HARRY DUNPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Top finance officials from Latin America hope
to show world markets their economies are sufficiently healthy to
withstand the global financial crisis, Argentina's Finance Minister
Roque Fernandez said Friday.
	   He also said some of his colleagues attending the two-day
meeting at the International Monetary Fund thought that the crisis
might be eased if the U.S. Federal Reserve Board reduced interest
rates ``but would not be a definitive solution.''
	   As the ministers and central bank governors resumed their talks,
Fernandez told a news conference, '' Our (economic) situation is
not the same as Russia or Asia and we hope the way we described it
in our statement will help the markets make that differentiation''
	   He said the markets were behaving in a herd-like way in dealing
with Latin America's main economies and he hoped they would return
to normal in a few days.
	   After the first day of discussions, the nine countries the nine
countries issued a joint statement pledging to continue down the
path toward economic reform and to take further actions ``if
needed'' to foster economic stability in the region.
	   The statement said each country in the region needed to keep its
current exchange rate system in place, maintain open capital
markets and deepen structural reforms.
	   It also said countries needed to adopt ``strategies to better
manage risks'' from market volatility and called on the IMF, the
World Bank and other international financial institutions to look
at possible ways to respond to turbulence.
	   ``We expect to send out a message saying that Latin America is
doing its homework,'' Mexican Finance Minister Jose Angel Gurria
told reporters Thursday. ``We didn't come her to ask for money nor
did we come here to organize a large fund of support for Latin
America.''
	   Chilean Finance Minister Eduardo Aniant said the region wants
the United States and the six other major industrialized countries
to take a more active role in resolving the current global economic
crisis.
	   ``We will also ask G-7 countries for more leadership because
this is no longer a problem of Southeast Asia,'' Aniant said. ''
This is not a Russian problem. This is a global problem. Thus the
leadership must be at that level.''
	   Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and his deputy, Lawrence
Summers, took part in the talks before flying to San Francisco to
meet, along with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, Japanese
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.
	   Rubin said Japan's recovery is ``key and central to economic
well being in the world.''
	   He also said Latin America, destination for 21 percent of U.S.
exports, is profoundly important to the American economy. He said
these countries ``have been very forward looking in terms of
economic policy and reforms and have accomplished a great deal.''
	   Besides Chile and Mexico, officials came from Argentina, Brazil,
Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela. IMF Managing
Director Michel Camdessus called the meeting last week.
	   ``It (the meeting) is exactly as advertised,'' Martin said. ''
This is really a question of regional surveillance. I think it's a
step forward in the evolution of the international (financial)
architecture.''
	   Indicating pressure in emerging markets was spreading to Latin
America, Colombia became the first country in the region to devalue
its currency, the peso, by 9 percent on the eve of the meeting.
	   Colombia's central bank said one reason it took the step was
because it expected a devaluation by its neighbor and major trading
partner Venezuela, whose bolivar has been under pressure on
exchange markets for the past two weeks. But Venezuelan Finance
Minister Maritza Izaguirre said no devaluation was planned.

Report: peace deal close after series of high-level meetings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Palestinian official saying Ross arriving in
Mideast Wednesday,
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) - Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
said Friday that a deal on an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West
Bank was still far off, contradicting Israeli reports that a flurry
of recent high-level meetings has resulted in a draft agreement.
	   The conflicting assessments came as the United States prepared
to resume its mediation efforts, with U.S. envoy Dennis Ross to
return to the region next week for meetings with Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Israel radio said Palestinian negotiator Ahmed Qureia met three
times in the past two weeks with Netanyahu and seven times with
Netanyahu's confidant, attorney Yitzhak Molcho.
	   The talks resulted in a draft agreement on key issues, including
the scope of a troop withdrawal, security cooperation, the
operation of a Palestinian airport and seaport and the release of
Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, the report said.
	   Qureia refused comment Friday. However, a senior Palestinian
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, denied there had
been top-level contact in the past two weeks.
	   Arafat said little progress has been made.
	   ``Actually, they (Israelis) are saying so but the gaps are still
wide,'' Arafat told reporters in Gaza City after returning from a
visit in South Africa.
	   On the table is an American proposal for an Israeli withdrawal
from 13 percent of the West Bank, to be met by a Palestinian
crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Asked whether he believed Ross would be able to persuade Israel
to agree to the U.S. initiative, Arafat said: ``I don't think so.''
	   ``This is not the first time that Ross is coming here,'' Arafat
said, in a reference to the envoy's previous unsuccessful missions.
	   White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Ross would meet with
Netanyahu and Arafat early next week ``on the chances of the
parties reaching agreement on the basis of the U.S. initiative.''
	   However senior Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaeth told The
Associated Press Friday. that Ross would be arriving on Wednesday.

Precautionary landing for Royal Airlines
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout to CORRECT pilot smelled oil fumes sted
smoke; unscheduled sted emergency landing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GOOSE BAY, Newfoundland (AP) _ A Royal Airlines plane en route
from Toronto to Glasgow, Scotland, made an unscheduled landing
Friday after the pilot smelled fumes in the cockpit.
	   The Boeing 757 with 225 people on board was near a Canadian
Forces Base when the pilot radioed that he would be making an
unscheduled stop, said Capt. David Muralt.
	   The incident came less than 36 hours after a Swissair jetliner
plunged into the Atlantic off Nova Scotia, killing all 229 people
aboard. Muralt said that tragedy weighed on the minds of people at
the Labrador airbase.
	   ``Everybody's really happy around here, I can tell you that
much,'' he said.
	   The Royal jet was about 225 kilometers (140 miles) east of Goose
Bay when the pilot noticed low oil and high temperature levels in
one of its two engines, said Al Graham, chief executive officer of
Royal, a Montreal-based charter company. As a precautionary
measure, the pilot landed at the military airbase with both engines
fully functional.
	   ``There's no indication of a significant problem in any way,
shape or form. We've looked at all of the records on the engine and
everything is absolutely normal,'' he said.
	   Graham said the pilot reported smelling oil in the cockpit
before landing. A repair team was to examine the plane and
passengers were expected to reboard the aircraft to continue their
flight later in the day.

Kohl feels buoyed by face-off with his challenger
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Germany-Politics &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Friday he was
pleased after facing challenger Gerhard Schroeder in Germany's
version of a candidates' debate before Sept. 27 elections.
	   The two politicians sniped at each other and blatantly
campaigned in back-to-back speeches to parliament Thursday, their
only confrontation on the same stage before the national vote.
	   ``I am extremely satisfied with how the debate went,'' Kohl, who
trails Schroeder in the polls, said in an interview with ARD
television.
	   Sounding one of his campaign themes, he claimed that Schroeder's
outline of policies for a Social Democratic government in his
speech showed that he stood for a left-leaning alliance with the
Greens, a party with strong environmentalist traditions.
	   Schroeder's recent overtures to Kohl's Christian Democrats to
form a centrist government of the two major parties were exposed as
``silly talk,'' Kohl said.
	   Schroeder accused Kohl on German radio of trying to split the
nation into two camps purely to stay in power.
	   He kept up other criticism of the chancellor's 16-year reign in
the Deutschlandfunk interview, portraying Kohl as a spent force and
out of touch with present-day Germany.
	   German commentators differed in their assessment of Thursday's
showdown.
	   ``The winner, if anyone: Kohl on points,'' pronounced Bild, a
tabloid that is the nation's most-read daily.
	   Kohl was ``surprisingly fresh and quick-witted'' in his
80-minute speech, which centered on his diplomatic achievements,
Bild said.
	   The liberal Sueddeutsche Zeitung said Schroeder had the edge
although doubts remained about his leadership qualities.
	   ``Kohl was far from good enough to spark a comeback,'' the
newspaper said. ``By not losing, Schroeder won.''

Russian ruble falls again, government backs down on bank plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES with stock markets, details of Chernomyrdin's
economic plan, CORRECTS Moldovan currency changes in graf 12.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The ruble tumbled some more Friday, inflation was
rising sharply and the government tried to placate angry Russians
by reversing an order to freeze personal accounts at the country's
largest retail banks.
	   The official ruble rate fell to 16.99 to the U.S. dollar, or 5.8
cents, down from 13.46 to the dollar, or 7.4 cents, on Thursday.
The street level was even lower.
	   Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said the government
would continue to let market forces determine the currency's value
_ even though it will mean higher prices.
	   He vowed to implement austere monetary policies to save the
ruble, and said the government would resist calls to print more
rubles unless they are backed by a rise in foreign exchange
reserves.
	   Chernomyrdin said he would favor only ``controlled emissions''
of money as a means to bring Russia out of its economic crisis.
	   ``We have to strictly link money supply to the hard currency
reserves, Chernomyrdin said, adding that the reserves must be
boosted.
	   The acting prime minister also said it was necessary to let
poorly run businesses go bankrupt and to substantially cut taxes.
	   ``Starting in January, the government will introduce an economic
dictatorship: Enterprises will be put in conditions in which they
won't be allowed to fail in their obligations,'' he said.
	   ``Bankruptcy proceedings will be launched at full scale, but
that won't lead to cutting production _ only to the replacement of
bad managers and those who are prone to stealing.''
	   Russian stocks closed higher Friday after the parliament showed
signs of agreeing to confirm Chernomyrdin to his post. The Russian
Trading System Index closed at 63.13 points, up 2.8 percent from
Thursday's close at 61.43 points. The volume rose to dlrs 2.9
million from dlrs 1.2 million Thursday.
	   But in another sign that the economy was still going downhill,
the government announced that inflation for August was 15 percent _
a sharp escalation from July's 0.2 percent.
	   Russia's financial chaos was hurting neighboring countries. The
Belarusian ruble fell to 250,000 to the dollar from 160,000 to the
dollar earlier in the week. The Moldovan leu fell from 4.8 lei to
the U.S. dollar, or about 21 cents to the leu, on Thursday, to
almost 6.5 lei, or about 15 cents to the leu, on Friday.
	   Meanwhile, the government backed down on its hugely unpopular
plan to prevent the collapse of Russia's banking system by freezing
personal accounts at six of the country's biggest private banks,
news agencies said.
	   The Central Bank had ordered the six banks on Wednesday to close
their branches temporarily and transfer all personal accounts to
the national savings bank, Sberbank, where deposits are fully
guaranteed by the government.
	   It said depositors would regain access to their money no later
than Nov. 15, but that they could only withdraw rubles, not foreign
currency, and at the unfavorable exchange rate of 9.33 rubles to
the dollar.
	   One of the affected banks, Most Bank, resumed operations Friday,
allowing customers to withdraw both rubles and up to dlrs 2,000 a
day.

With crisis mounting, president and parliament seek compromise

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With the economy hanging in the balance, hard-line
lawmakers backed down Friday from confrontation with President
Boris Yeltsin, signaling they may be ready to compromise over who
will be Russia's next prime minister.
	   In a surprise move, the lower chamber of parliament voted 294-51
after just a brief discussion, postponing hearings on whether to
confirm acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin until Monday.
Opposition leaders said they would accept Yeltsin's invitation to
discuss the issue face to face before the vote.
	   ``A longer pause for contemplation is better than haste,''
Yeltsin's spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, said after the vote.
	   Yeltsin and the State Duma have been locked in battle for nearly
two weeks over Chernomyrdin's nomination while the economy has
decayed by the day.
	   The deterioration continued Friday, with the ruble dropping
another 21 percent and sharp price rises spurring consumer anxiety.
People were increasingly worried, but there no signs of unrest
	   ``I started to get worried today for the first time,'' said one
shopper, retired theater director Nina Vasilyeva. ``The idea of
stocking up hadn't even come into my head before. But groceries are
now twice as expensive. I'm buying things I don't need because
everybody's bought the rest.''
	   The political deadlock has deepened the economic crisis, with
the fear of instability eroding the ruble's value dramatically. The
official ruble rate fell Friday to 16.99 to the U.S. dollar, or 5.8
cents, down from 13.46 to the dollar, or 7.4 cents, on Thursday.
The street level was even lower.
	   The decision to postpone the vote on Chernomyrdin until Monday
indicated the hard-liners were no longer confident of winning their
confrontation with Yeltsin and may be looking for a way out. The
postponement was likely to boost Chernomyrdin's chances of
approval.
	   Chernomyrdin's position was strengthened Friday when the
Federation Council, the upper chamber of parliament, passed a
non-binding motion 91-17 expressing confidence in the acting
premier.
	   The vote was only symbolic, but it may increase pressure on the
Duma to find a compromise. The regional governors who make up the
Council have huge power and the vote signaled they would back
Yeltsin in a showdown.
	   Political leaders were expected to spend a second weekend trying
to reach a deal. A round of behind-the-scenes dealing a week ago
led to a pact in which Yeltsin agreed to cede some power to
parliament in return for lawmakers' confirmation of Chernomyrdin.
However, the deal was scuttled when the Duma's largest faction, the
Communists, backed out and the chamber then rejected Chernomyrdin
handily last Monday.
	   Since then the Communists and their hard-line allies have been
under pressure to compromise.
	   The Constitution gives Yeltsin the upper hand in choosing a
prime minister. He has three chances to propose a candidate, either
the same person or different people. If the Duma votes no three
times, the president can disband the legislature and call new
elections.
	   Yeltsin has said he will nominate no one other than
Chernomyrdin, whom he fired last spring after he served as prime
minister more than five years.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov kept up his party's rhetorical
pressure, insisting they will not deal with Yeltsin and will oppose
Chernomyrdin, whose failed leadership they say is to blame for the
crisis.
	   ``We won't consider any agreement. We're not going to sign
anything. And we will not vote for Viktor Stepanovich
(Chernomyrdin) because we think he's unable to handle this job,''
Zyuganov told the Duma before the vote.
	   Russia's troubles intensified last month when the currency
collapsed and Yeltsin decided to fire the previous premier and
bring back Chernomyrdin _ setting up another power struggle with
the Duma.
	   Before the upper house vote, Chernomyrdin tried to persuade them
that he knows how to cure Russia's economic ills _ and cure them
quickly.
	   ``It may be our last chance to build a normal economy in Russia.
Yes, our actions will be unpopular. Everyone will assail us. But
don't tie the government's hands, give us time to step back from
the precipice. That refers to everyone from the president on
down,'' he said.
	   Chernomyrdin said his economic rescue package would concentrate
on paying overdue wages and pensions, closing down bankrupt and
inefficient businesses, getting rid of dishonest managers, and
lowering taxes. He also said the government would resist calls to
print more rubles unless they are backed by a rise in foreign
exchange reserves.
	   The Defense Ministry issued a statement Friday denying that
troops were being moved in to Moscow because of the political
situation.

Clinton highlights Irish economy as prize of peace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ President Bill Clinton turned Friday from
the turmoil in Northern Ireland to the Irish Republic's thriving
economy, holding it up as the prize of peace. ``Ireland has moved
from nightmares to dreams,'' he declared.
	   Surrounded by computer equipment at a growing high-tech company,
Clinton saluted Ireland's 7.7 percent growth rate last year as the
highest of any country in Europe. Peace and stability can cement
the good times, he said.
	   ``Ireland has assumed great responsibilities. As a result you
are moving toward permanent peace, remarkable prosperity,
unparalleled influence and a brighter tomorrow for your children,''
he said.
	   Borrowing the cadence of a traditional Irish blessing, he added:
``May the nightmares stay gone, the dreams stay bright, and the
responsibilities wear easily on your shoulders because the future
is yours.''
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, in turn, credited Clinton and
his role in brokering the Good Friday peace accord with holding out
to Northern Ireland the same promise of prosperity.
	   ``He's laid down for us _ for all of us _ that there is a path
to follow and if we are sensible, if we're brave and we follow that
path, then the reward is peace and stability and confidence. If we
don't, well, then the future is as gloomy as the past,'' Ahern said
at a picture-taking session with Clinton before they met privately
this morning.
	   At a reception that gave Clinton a chance to meet business
leaders, Ahern noted that American firms employ 400,000 people in
Ireland and dominate electronics, pharmaceuticals and other
industries.
	   ``Ireland is really an American economic tiger with a green
face,'' he said with a smile.
	   Ahern proudly led Clinton on a tour of the Gateway computer
plant and highlighted business opportunities in Ireland. Seated at
laptops with ``smart cards'' and using personalized codes, Clinton
and Ahern digitally affixed their signatures to an agreement on
developing electronic commerce between their two nations.
	   Despite the levity and optimism, Clinton warned against
complacency. ``I hope that success will whet your appetite for
working together instead of causing _ as success sometimes does _
people to forget what brought them to the point of success.''
	   Clinton met with Irish leaders as new anti-terrorist laws took
effect in Ireland and Britain Friday. Both governments sought
passage of the bills during Clinton's visit. The legislation is
expected to bolster political efforts by Protestants and Catholics
to make peace in Northern Ireland after 30 years of conflict.
	   With this trip meant to nudge along the infant peace pact,
Clinton was asked whether he expected to visit the Irish again.
	   ``For the sake of the peace process, I hope not. But for my own
sake, I hope so,'' he said, laughingly suggesting that next time he
would come more as tourist than enforcer.
	   Of the fragile peace, Clinton said, ``I hope it will be
institutionalized and off and going.''
	   The showers of Irish praise for Clinton on this tour were
briefly interrupted with a jolt this morning. Standing before news
cameras with Ahern at his side, Clinton was peppered with
reporters' questions about his handling of the Lewinsky affair. For
the first time, Clinton publicly used the words ``I'm sorry'' in
expressing regret for his inappropriate relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.
	   U.S. investment has been a major factor in the growth of the
Irish economy. Trade between the two countries last year was worth
dlrs 12 billion, a 19 percent increase over 1996.
	   Gateway's Dublin plant employs 1,600 people, mostly producing
personal computers for the European market. Gateway is considered a
symbol of the decade-long economic boom that has seen American
corporations build facilities in Ireland to serve the European
market.

EU group to study ways of averting winter crisis in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The European Union will create a working group to
study ways of averting a humanitarian crisis in the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo this winter, the French Foreign Ministry said
Friday.
	   The working group, proposed by France and Germany, will meet in
Geneva and then Belgrade, the ministry's spokeswoman, Anne
Gazeau-Secret, told reporters at a daily news briefing.
	   It will comprise of officials from France, Germany, Austria,
Italy, Britain, and maybe Russia and the United States,
Gazeau-Secret said.
	   She said the working group's goal was to ``evaluate the
humanitarian needs'' of the refugees and to find ways to facilitate
their return to their homes.
	   Humanitarian agencies have warned of the dangers faced this
winter by an estimated 50,000 refugees living in the open after
fleeing villages destroyed in the six-month crackdown against
Kosovo Albanian separatists.
	   Gazeau-Secret also said France would give three million francs
(dlrs 500,000) towards humanitarian aid in Kosovo.

Illegal impotency pill depo raided, stock confiscated
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Hungarian officials seized 220 Viagra
pills during a raid Friday after a Hungarian-American advertised
the potency tablets which have not been certified for sale here,
the state news agency MTI reported.
	   The dual national, who was not identified, advertised the pills
for sale at 5,000 forints (dlrs 23) apiece, customs officers told
MTI. The average monthly salary in Hungary amounts to 70,000
forints, or dlrs 310.
	   The pill is already on the black market, but this was the first
time that such a significant stock was found. About one-third of
Hungary's male population over 40 are believed to potency
disorders.

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A year after Taipei closed licensed
brothels, former prostitutes rallied for reinstatement. Residents
say the city's sex industry is sitll flourishing.
	   Prostitutes and their supporters gathered in the city's former
red-light district on Friday to accuse Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian
of attempting to gain points with voters by destroying their
livelihoods.
	   Holding candles and singing protest songs, the women mocked
Chen's announcement earlier in the week that he would extend
welfare for former sex workers for another year.
	   ``Degrading legal prostitutes to grandstand for elections,''
Wang Ping-fang, director of the women's group, said, describing
Chen's policy of offering 7,770 Taiwan dollar (U.S. dlrs 222)
monthly stipends as ``fake welfare.''
	   Of the 40 ex-prostitutes who have accepted benefits, about half
are still working illicitly as prostitutes. Most of the 128
formerly licensed prostitutes are facing severe economic hardships,
Wang said.
	   ``Why use taxpayers' money to subsidize these women when they're
perfectly able to support themselves legally,'' she said.
	   City officials claim the program to help the women into other
jobs has been a success, and accuse brothel owners and organized
crime of being behind the campaign to reinstate legal prostitution.
	   Chen, of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, closed the
brothels on Sept. 1, 1997, claiming that ending legal prostitution
was the trend among advanced nations. The city council later voted
to overturn the order, but Chen ignored the move.

Russian officials hand Yeltsin's letter to Milosevic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Two top Russian foreign ministry
officials handed Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic a letter
Friday from Russia's president, Boris Yeltsin, Milosevic's office
said.
	   The statement, carried by the official Tanjug news agency, did
not reveal the contents of the letter.
	   Earlier in the day, B-92 Radio said deputy foreign ministers
Nikolai Afanasyevsky and Igor Ivanov would brief Milosevic on the
U.S.-Russia summit, in which both President Clinton and Yeltsin
called for a diplomatic solution in Kosovo.
	   The statement said that a joint Yeltsin-Milosevic declaration on
the situation in Kosovo earlier this year presented ``the most
important contribution so far'' in solving the crisis in Kosovo.
	   Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, more than 90 percent of the
province's population, are fighting Serb-led government forces to
achieve independence from Serbia and Yugoslavia.
	   The statement from the meeting spoke of ``belief that problems
in Kosovo will be solved by political means and that terrorism,
which jeopardizes life ... will be fully defeated and eliminated.''
	   Serb-led Yugoslavia refers to ethnic Albanian fighters in Kosovo
as ``terrorists.''
	   Referring to growing U.S. and other Western pressure on
Yugoslavia over Kosovo, Milosevic's statement called for
``abandoning the policies of pressure'' on Yugoslavia as the best
way to help achieve peace in the region and said Russia supported
the stand.
	   Russia and Serb-led Yugoslavia are traditional allies.
	   In the statement, Milosevic personally stressed the state
guaranteed safety to all Kosovo refugees who want to return to
their homes. An estimated 260,000 Kosovars have been displaced.
	   Milosevic also said that a U.N. aid agency and International
Committee of Red Cross are ``welcome'' to help the refugees,
together with the state.

Zimbabwe Labor leaders call off strike as government backs down on
</HEADLINE>
taxes &QL; 
 &UR; By ANGUS SHAW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Zimbabwe's main labor federation on
Friday called off a five-day nationwide strike after the government
bowed to demands to cut some taxes and set up a high-powered think
tank on the economy.
	   ``Everybody is breathing a sigh of relief,'' said Gibson
Sibanda, head of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions.
	   He said a series of meetings between labor and business leaders
and the government produced agreement to cut sales tax, drop a 5
percent ``development levy'' on incomes and scrap tax on pension
fund profits.
	   Lower income workers earning less than 2,000 Zimbabwe dollars a
month (dlrs 85) will also be exempt from income tax.
	   Friday's agreements appeared to be a major climb down by the
government.
	   Labor groups angered by raised taxes and economic mismanagement
called for a five-day strike that would have crippled the already
battered economy. No date had been set for the action.
	   Sibanda said the labor leaders, employers and government
officials also agreed to set up a regular body to study broader
economic issues including inflation, rising prices, corruption,
unemployment and government spending on its bureaucracy and the
cost of maintaining Zimbabwean intervention troops in Congo.
	   The think tank, to be called the National Economic Consultative
Forum, would also work out ways to earn state revenue lost by the
tax and levy cuts, Sibanda said.
	   Last year, the government raised sales tax on all purchased
goods and services by 2.5 percent to help pay increased pensions to
ex-guerrillas who fought in a seven-year bush war that ended white
rule in Rhodesia, as Zimbabwe was known before independence in
1980.
	   Sibanda's federation represents 90 percent of organized labor
groups.
	   Unrest over deteriorating economic conditions and government
corruption is posing the most serious threat to President Robert
Mugabe's hold on power.
	   In January, troops were deployed in Harare to quell food riots
that left at least six people dead.

Police find cyanide in tea that killed man
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Cyanide has been found in the poisoned tea that
killed a man in central Japan earlier this week, police said
Friday, as a string of poisoning cases continued to unnerve Japan.
	   Ichijuro Nakazawa, 58, collapsed after drinking canned tea at
breakfast on Monday. He died at a hospital in Obusecho, 180
kilometers (110 miles) northwest of Tokyo.
	   The amount of cyanide was more than enough to kill a person, a
Nagano police spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Nakazawa's wife Tsugiko reported his death to police Thursday,
the day after she heard on the news that cyanide-laced tea had been
discovered at a nearby supermarket.
	   In that case, the supermarket manager took the can off the shelf
because it was dented, drank from it but spat it out because of its
foul taste.
	   In both cases, there was a tiny hole on the bottom of the can
which was later closed up.
	   Also Friday, a 28-year-old man man in Osaka developed a sore
throat after sipping a yogurt-flavored drink laced with
hypochlorous acid, a chemical often used in bleach, police said.
	   The man, whose name is not disclosed, noticed a strange smell
when he drank the beverage at home after purchasing it at a nearby
convenience store, said a police spokesman, who declined to be
named.
	   The man was treated at a hospital, but his condition was not
serious, the spokeman said.
	   In July, four people died and dozens fell ill after eating curry
tainted with arsenic served at a community festival in Wakayama,
western Japan.
	   Last month, poisoned tea served at an office in northern Japan
made 10 people ill. Then a fake diet drink mailed to some Tokyo
homes sent a teen-ager to the hospital.
	   There have been no arrests in those cases.

Military says 760 people killed in Aceh during military operation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Indonesian Armed Forces said
Friday that a total of 760 people including soldiers and rebels
were killed during the eight-year military operation against
Islamic separatist rebels in the northernmost province of Aceh.
	   The death toll presented at a meeting with President B.J.
Habibie, was slightly different from the finding by the National
Commission on Human Rights.
	   Following a probe early this month, a fact-finding team of the
government-sponsored watchdog, said a total of 781 people were
killed. However, it did not provide any breakdown.
	   Attending the meeting at the presidential office were Armed
Forces Commander Gen. Wiranto, a six-member delegate from the
commission, and a number of cabinet ministers.
	   Speaking to the press after the four-hour meeting, commission
vice chairman Marzuki Darusman quoted Wiranto as saying that there
were 111 soldiers killed and 47 were injured by the rebels during
the 1990-98 period.
	   On the other hand, 406 rebels were killed, 79 injured, 421 were
captured and 514 surrendering.
	   According to Wiranto, the military lost 65 guns but was able to
confiscate 239 from the rebels.
	   The military, which has its own fact-finding team, claimed
further that 243 people were killed by the rebels, who also injured
56, burned 32 houses and nine school buildings.
	   In its report, the commission's team that has uncovered mass
graves of alleged victims of the military, said about 3,000 women
had been widowed.
	   It said at least 160 people were missing and as many as 368 were
tortured.
	   On a visit to Aceh early in August, Wiranto apologized for any
wrongdoing by the military during the operations and decided
withdrawal of troops from tip of Sumatra region.
	   Aceh, about 1,750 kilometers (1,100 miles) northwest of Jakarta,
is a predominantly Muslim province where separatist rebels fighting
for an Islamic state.

Ukraine's government announces new trading band for national
</HEADLINE>
currency &QL;

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Under increasing pressure from the
financial crisis in neighboring Russia, the Ukrainian government on
Friday announced a new, wider trading corridor for the national
hryvna currency.
	   As of Friday, the Ukrainian Central Bank will keep the hryvna
within a range of 2.5 to 3.5 to the dollar, the Cabinet and
National Bank said in a joint statement.
	   ``The devaluation of (the Russian) ruble and loss of stability
in neighboring markets have forced Ukraine to take adequate steps
in response,'' National Bank chief Viktor Yushchenko said.
	   He declined to say when the corridor would come into effect.
	   The old corridor, which the government originally announced last
January for the whole of 1998, set the hryvna rate limits at 1.8 to
2.25 to the dollar.
	   The government has struggled desperately in recent weeks to
withstand the spillover of Russia's crisis into Ukraine, calling on
Ukrainians to remain calm.
	   But few Ukrainians seemed to believe their leaders.
	   Prices in shops and markets have been rising steadily since the
Russian government's devaluation of the ruble on Aug. 17, and lines
of people trying to buy dollars at currency exchanges have been
growing every day.
	   Russia is by far Ukraine's largest trading partner. Ukraine's
tendency to follow Russia's lead in the economic sphere has only
increased public concern.
	   In an attempt to keep the hryvna within the old trading band,
the Central Bank has been extensively spending its reserves since
the start of the crisis in Russia and massively canceling dollar
purchases by banks to keep down the demand.
	   However, it could not stop the hryvna's steady fall, and the
currency fell to the upper limit of the corridor, 2.25 to the
dollar, last week.
	   The government is hoping for salvation from the International
Monetary Fund, which was scheduled to consider a 2.2 billion loan
to Ukraine on Friday.
	   The loan, widely expected to be approved, would be used to
replenish National Bank's reserves, which have contracted to about
dlrs 800 million by this week, down from about 1.75 billion a month
ago.

Britain's Schapiro, 89, wins seniors' world bridge title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ Sixty years after winning his first world
bridge title, Britain's Boris Schapiro was crowned champion again
on Friday _ this time in the senior category.
	   Schapiro, 89, collected the gold medal in the world senior
tournament which he won late Thursday with partner Irving Gordon,
his junior by more than 30 years.
	   The seniors' trophy is open to players over the age of 55.
	   Schapiro and Gordon easily won the four-day contest with a score
of 2,274.8 points, more than 100 points ahead of second-placed U.S.
pair Benito Garozzo and Lea DuPont.
	   Schapiro won his first gold medal at the 1938 World Bridge
Championships, though that title is unofficial because the
governing World Bridge Federation was not formed until 1958.
	   Poland's Michal Kwiecien and Jacek Pszczola Friday won the Open
Pairs, considered the most prestigious prize at the two-week
tournament, played in the north eastern French city of Lille.
	   They easily overcame the challenge of the second-placed pair,
the U.S.'s Larry Cohen and David Berkowitz, winning by 5,551.6
points to 5,465.6 points.
	   In the other major competition, European champion Italy easily
beat Brazil in the Rosenblum Cup, which is contested by teams
rather than pairs.
	   The Italians won the final by 155 points to 76 on Tuesday.
	   The championships, which finished Friday, are contested every
four years.
	   Overall, Italy won six medals in Lille, including four golds,
one silver and one bronze.
	   The United States came second, with one gold, one silver and two
bronze, with Denmark third, having picked up one silver and two
bronze.
	   More than 5,000 people from around the world took part, with
some contestants as young as eight years old.
	   The tournament was funded by French corporations Societe
Generale, Elf-Acquitaine and Louis Vitton. There was no prize
money.
	   Organizers hope to use the game's popularity to gain full
Olympic recognition.
	   On Monday, players from Brazil, China, France, Italy, Poland and
the United States will participate in a five-day tournament in
Lausanne, observed by officials from the International Olympic
Committee.
	   The winner will receive prize money of dlrs 20,000.

Malaysia asks visitors to ignore Internet rumors about Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia has advised athletes and
visitors, numbering about 75,000, not to be worried by rumors
spread on the Internet about their safety, a news report said
Friday.
	   The Minister of Youth and Sports, Muhyiddin Yassin said these
rumors were spread by irresponsible people.
	   Preparations are in full swing to make the 16th Commonwealth
Games here a great success, he told reporters after visiting the
Main Press Center for the Games.
	   Muhyiddin said some foreigners had become concerned over reports
on the Internet that the Games would be chaotic following the turn
of political events in the country.
	   He was referring to the sacking of the Deputy Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Wednesday.

USAID to provide food valued at 21.8 million dollars for displaced
</HEADLINE>
in Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A senior American official announced
late Friday that the U.S. Agency for International Development will
provide an additional dlrs 21.8 million in food aid for Kosovo's
displaced people.
	   Speaking to reporters in Belgrade at the end of his week-long
tour of the embattled Serbian Kosovo province, Hugh Q. Parmer of
USAID said this amount was over the 11 million dollars already
provided by the U.S. government.
	   ``This is not the beginning and it is certainly not the end,
USAID will continue to stand by those suffering in the conflict,''
Parmer said, adding the next five weeks are crucial in saving lives
of more than 200,000 diplaced.
	   Deeply distressed by what he saw in the outback hills and
villages, Parmer stressed that ``damage and destruction have
reached devastating proportions.''
	   ``Babies... being fed crumbled bred mixed with dirty water for
lack of any other... women and children living in home-made plastic
tents... houses and wheat fields burning... brothers crying at the
site of their destroyed home of thirty years,'' Parmer recalled
some of the harrowing sights.
	   He said he carried home to America a message from the displaced:
``Our hope is with God and the United States.''
	   ``We have heard their pleas for help and we will deliver. This,
I promise,'' Parmer said.
	   The only long-range solution is that dialogue and the political
process work and succeed in producing lasting peace, Parmer
admitted.
	   ``But, we can not wait for the diplomats and politicians to
finish _ we have a responsibility to produce on the ground so that
women, children and elderly do not die of starvation,'' he
concluded.
	   USAID will distribute over half a million of humanitarian food
packets to the diplaced and 22,000 of these emergency packages will
go to the 11 ditribution centers the Belgrade government has
promised to set up in Kosovo.
	   Holding one up in his hand, Parmer demonstrated the
bright-yellow humanitarian packets and said deputy prime minister
Nikola Sainovic had reassured him Friday they would pass freely
along with other relief supplies through police lines.
	   Asked whether relief would find its way into guerilla hands _
Serbian state television had aired footage of U.S. humanitarian
packets discovered in what they said was an overrun guerilla
stronghold in the province _ Parmer was adamant.
	   ``Whenever you feed anyone in a conflict, some of the food you
provide will slip into hands of combatants _ but the tiny amount
that does so is no excuse to deny the non-combatants these easily
accessible, easily delivered food,'' he said.

Iran asks for Saudi help to free Iranians in Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran has asked Saudi Arabia to help secure
the release of Iranian diplomats being held in Afghanistan, a
broadcast said Friday.
	   Iranian foreign minister Kamal Kharrazi made the request in
talks with his Saudi counterpart, Prince Saud al-Faisal, on the
sidelines of the Nonaligned Movement summit in South Africa on
Thursday, Iranian radio said, in a broadcast monitored by the
British Broadcasting Corporation.
	   ``Mr. Kharrazi asked Saudi Arabia to use its influence to secure
the freedom of the Iranian diplomats and the other Iranian
nationals detained by the Taliban,'' the radio said.
	   Saudi Arabia is regarded as a major supporter of the Taliban and
is one of only three countries to have recognized the hard-line
Islamic group, which controls most of Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban army released five Iranians, all truck drivers, on
Thursday in a goodwill gesture. Before their release, Tehran had
accused the Taliban of holding some 70 Iranians, including 11
diplomats and a journalist for the official Iranian news agency.
	   Iran, which borders Afghanistan to the west, has blamed the
Taliban for the disappearance of the diplomats.
	   The diplomats went missing after the Taliban captured the city
of Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan last month. The diplomats
were working at the local Iranian Consulate.
	   The Taliban have accused Iran of sending arms and money to their
opponents.
	   Iran has warned the Taliban it would consider all options to
retrieve its citizens. Iran has begun military exercises on its
border with Afghanistan, deploying more than 70,000 elite troops.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ At a central Moscow branch of the SBS-Agro bank,
where where personal accounts remained frozen Friday, half a dozen
anxious customers besieged an information officer.
	   ``What kind of guarantee do we have that our deposits will still
be here?'' asked Natasha, a 41-year-old construction company
employee who declined to give her last name.
	   ``The bank's agreement with customers says that all of the
bank's assets, including real estate, serve as guarantee of
deposits,'' the bank officer recites. She explains that a
bankruptcy would be publicly announced, and there would be an
auction of the bank's property.
	   That offered little consolation to the depositors.
	   ``But you, can't you give me some guarantee?'' Natasha asked.
	   ``How can she guarantee anything to you?'' another customer
chimed in.
	   On Wednesday, the Central Bank ordered six of Russia's largest
banks _ including SBS-Agro _ to close their branches temporarily
and offer customers two options: Wait for six weeks until the bank
reopens, or transfer hard-currency deposits to the national savings
bank, Sberbank, where deposits will be repaid in rubles.
	   On Friday the order was revoked, and the government said
Russians could regain access to any accounts at the six banks _
Mosbusinessbank, Inkombank, Most-Bank, Menatep, SBS-Agro and
Promstroibank.
	   But by late afternoon, many of the banks' branches still had not
received the formal authorization they needed to resume operations.
ATM machines were turned off, and tellers would not accept
transactions.
	   ``We have seen a photocopy of the (government's) order to resume
operations, but we still haven't received the proper papers from
our management,'' said Dmitry Yegorov, a teller at Inkombank.
	   At Most-Bank, dozens of customers lined up at each teller
window, some for hours. They were among the lucky ones: The bank
resumed operations as soon as the government lifted the order.
	   Panic has not set in yet, and many customers said they were only
clearing out their ruble accounts _ to spend the currency that is
quickly losing value _ but leaving their dollar deposits in the
bank.
	   ``We don't want to stash money under the mattress; the money
should be working,'' said a 35-year-old woman, who only gave her
first name, Yelena.
	   ``We want to believe that we are living in a civilized state,
and that our hard-currency deposits will help the bank to
survive,'' she said, expressing a rare optimism.
	   Not all lines were signs of distress. At exchange booths, many
customers were cashing in some of the dollars they keep at home,
converting small amounts to buy groceries.
	   ``Everybody is trading in just a few dollars at a time, because
everybody only wants to get the amount of rubles they will spend
today,'' said customer Irina Usharova.

Three foreign organizations to launch campaign against TB
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Three international health organizations plan to
launch a fund-raising drive to battle tuberculosis in Russia, a
news agency said Friday.
	   The three organizations said improper treatment in Russia due to
a severe money shortage is leading to a growth of drug-resistant
strains of the disease, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The organizations, the Belgium-based branch of Medecins San
Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders), the Britain-based Medical
Emergency Relief International, and New York-based Public Health
Research Institute, plan to raise dlrs 50 million to treat those
affected by the drug-resistant strains.
	   Between 15,000 and 20,000 Russians are infected with
drug-resistant tuberculosis, two-thirds of whom are inmates, the
groups estimate. An estimated 92,000 prisoners suffer from a common
form of the disease.
	   TB has re-emerged as a significant health problem around the
world. While Russia's infection rate is below that of many other
countries, health workers say the prevalence of drug-resistant
strains, especially in the prison system, is especially worrisome.
	   The tuberculosis bacteria is airborne and must be treated by
antibiotics for as long as six months. If a patient fails to
complete the treatment course, the bacteria can develop resistance
to the drug and people infected later will have a harder time
getting rid of it.

Land mine explodes under aid agency truck in Rwanda
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A local government official was killed when a land
mine exploded Friday under an International Organization for
Migration truck in northwest Rwanda, the Geneva-based agency said.
	   The IOM truck, accompanied by an escort, was carrying food on
behalf of the United Nations' World Food Program, a statement said.
The driver was injured.
	   The man killed in the explosion was to help with the
distribution of the food to returning refugees in Gatonde, just
outside the town of Ruhengeri. He was not identified.
	   A U.N. security team went to the scene, the IOM said. The rest
of the convoy returned to the capital, Kigali.
	   The agency temporarily suspended its transport operations in the
Rwandan interior.
	   The IOM, an intergovernmental agency, works closely with the
United Nations on refugee and related problems.

Iranian deputy president, culture minister assaulted by militants
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hard-line militants assaulted an Iranian
deputy president and the minister of culture and Islamic guidance
as they left a prayer service in central Tehran on Friday,
witnesses said.
	   About 80 militants chanting ``Death to liberals!'' scuffled with
Deputy President Abdullah Nouri and Culture Minister Ataollah
Mohajerani as they were leaving Tehran University after Friday
prayers at about 2 p.m. local time (0930 GMT), witnesses told The
Associated Press.
	   The militants knocked off Nouri's white cleric turban and tore
open Mohajerani's shirt.
	   Both officials were slapped in the face, but neither appeared to
be seriously injured, the witnesses said. They said Mohajerani was
taken to hospital with a suspected broken finger.
	   The militants also assaulted the officials' bodyguards, said the
witnesses, who had attended the prayer service. They spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   Mohajerani and Nouri are known to be close allies of President
Mohammad Khatami.
	   Hard-liners regard Mohajerani and Nouri, who was interior
minister until he was impeached in June, as liberals for their
relaxation of the strict social code that has been enforced in Iran
since the Islamic revolution of 1979.
	   The parliament, which is dominated by hard-liners, impeached
Nouri for allowing political gatherings and relaxing the Islamic
code.

Norman hits balls for first time since Augusta
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JACKSONVILLE, Florida (AP) _ For the first time since shoulder
surgery shortly after the U.S. Masters, Greg Norman returned to the
practice range Friday at his home course in Florida and said he
never felt better.
	   ``I know I'm going to come back physically stronger,'' Norman
told The Associated Press after hitting about 100 balls, but
nothing more than a 9-iron with a full swing.
	   ``I'm swinging the golf club without pain, and hopefully I've
got my power back.''
	   Norman had not taken a full swing since his weak approach into
No. 18 at Augusta National on April 10, where he missed the cut at
the U.S. Masters. He had arthroscopic surgery April 22, which
forced him to miss the rest of the American PGA Tour season and
stay away from the game for the longest stretch of his professional
career.
	   Saying he was in the best shape ``since I can remember,'' Norman
hit about 70 full shots with a 9-iron and wedges, the rest of the
pitch shots to loosen up. He finished his first day of practice by
hitting about 10 three-quarter shots with a 7-iron at The Medalist
in Hobe Sound, Florida.
	   ``It went OK,'' Norman said. ``There were no problems, and I
knew there wouldn't be anyway. I've done all the right things. I
don't expect any problems at all.''
	   He was joined by his caddie, Tony Navarro, who has been working
for Jeff Sluman this year, and Buddy Antonopoulus, the head pro at
The Medalist, who told Norman he looked like he could be ready for
a tournament in 10 days.
	   Still, Norman is not about to rush back to golf. He said he
would slowly work his way down to the longer clubs and won't return
until his Shark Shootout on Nov. 9 in Thousand Oaks, California.
	   Norman called this summer the best of his life because it
allowed him to spend time with his wife and two children, taking
them fishing in Colorado and shopping in New York.
	   ``When you stay out of something you've been doing for 20 years,
it's good for you,'' he said. ``I got my life back, and I really
enjoyed that. As I said to Tony, next year we're going to have fun
and enjoy the game again.''

Puccini's lavish Chinese opera dazzles in Beijing's Forbidden City
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Crickets chirp in hidden corners and bats the
size of sparrows flit in the humid night air over the Forbidden
City. Suddenly, ancient drums thunder, a palace hall goes ablaze
with light, and Puccini's ``Turandot'' takes life.
	   And an opulent life it is. The Italian opera about a Chinese
princess is being staged for the first time in Beijing's imperial
compound, with hand-embroidered silks in brilliant colors fit for a
Chinese imperial family and their retinue.
	   The dlrs 15 million opera, what its producers call the most
expensive ever, premiers on Saturday with conductor Zubin Mehta and
the orchestra and chorus of the Florence opera. The director is
Zhang Yimou, known for films such as the Oscar-nominated ``Raise
the Red Lantern.''
	   At a dress rehearsal Thursday, a Chinese audience filled the
3,500 seats in a courtyard of the Imperial Ancestral Temple, now
part of the Working People's Cultural Palace, a public park
alongside the main tourist track through the imperial grounds.
	   The temple, built in 1640, is a palace hall like many others in
the 720,000-square-meter (7.8 million-square-foot) Forbidden City.
Built on a stone platform, it has a gold ceramic tile roof sweeping
upward at the edges, eaves painted in an intricate design of faded
lavender and aqua, pillars and latticed doors a dark, earthy red.
	   Two smaller pavilions, precisely matched versions of the temple,
were built for the performance and wheeled across the 80-meter-wide
(260-foot) platform to provide for entries and exits.
	   In the first act, the doors slid open and a throne bearing the
haughty Turandot and her maidens glided forward.
	   Turandot, who hates men, orders all suitors who fail to guess
three riddles beheaded. Prince Calaf falls in love with her anyway
and wins her heart.
	   Sharon Sweet, Audrey Stottler and Giovanna Casolla rotate in the
role of Turandot; Sergej Larin, Kristjan Johansson and Lando
Bartolini as Calaf; and Barbara Hendricks, Barbara Frittoli and
Angela Maria Blasi as the slave girl Liu.
	   Turandot, sung by Ms. Casolla on Thursday, appeared in the final
act in a shimmering royal blue robe embroidered with a border of
phoenixes, a Chinese symbol of femininity, and large lotus flowers
and leaves.
	   All 800 sets of costumes used in the performance were made by
elderly female artisans and their daughters and granddaughters in
villages outside Suzhou that were the source of imperial silks for
centuries.
	   The emperor's yellow robe was elaborately hand-embroidered with
green dragons, gold ``shou,'' or longevity, characters, and other
symbols of Chinese royalty. It was the hardest of all, requiring
more than three months of work, costume and set designer Zeng Li
said in an interview.
	   ``This kind of silk embroidery is so much work that fewer and
fewer young women want to learn it,'' Zeng said. ``It's hard to say
whether it will even exist 20 or 30 years from now.''
	   Other famous operas also have been staged in famous settings.
Verdi's ``Aida'' was done in 1994 amid the temples of the Valley of
the Queens in Luxor, Egypt, and ``Tosca'' was performed in 1992 in
the church, palace and castle in Rome where the tragedy takes
place.
	   To stage Turandot in its authentic setting required some sleight
of hand. Hidden acoustical equipment was installed to ensure the
beauty of the singing would reach the audience rather than fading
into the expansive palace grounds.
	   Director Zhang Yimou, who cheerfully admits he knew nothing
about Western opera before he was asked to work on ``Turandot,''
said he added a Chinese point of view.
	   ``I wanted to set it in a splendid period of Chinese
civilization, showing our ancient arts,'' Zhang said.
	   His version brings references to Peking Opera in some aspects of
the costumes and performers' gestures; Zhang's signature attention
to bold colors_ especially reds and golds; and traditional Chinese
martial arts, dance and calligraphy.
	   The dancers and extras are Chinese, including soldiers played by
real members of the People's Armed Police.
	   The Chinese audience, however, has been restricted by the price
of tickets at dlrs 150 to 1,200, compared with an average annual
salary in Beijing of about 10,000 yuan (dlrs 1,200).
	   Tickets were sold at reduced prices to Chinese for the dress
rehearsal and one of the nine performances.
	   Only 70 percent of the full-price tickets have been sold, said
Joy Gong, a spokeswoman for the China Performing Arts Agency, which
is handling the Chinese side of the venture. Most went to
foreigners living in Beijing.
	   Producer Michael Ecker predicted no profit but a possibility of
breaking even.
	   The Thursday performance was filmed for distribution in China in
October and then worldwide.

<TEXT>
	   IMOLA, Italy (AP) _ Frenchman Jean Michael Bayle was nearly
four-tenths of a second faster than Brazil's Alex Barros and
grabbed the provisional pole with his Yamaha on Friday for the
Grand Prix of Imola.
	   Bayle, who was nearly seven-tenths of a second slower than
practice-session leader Michael Doohan of Australia earlier in the
morning, cut more than a full second off his time and took the 500
cc pole with a lap of 1 minute, 49.345 seconds on the
4.892-kilometer (3.04-mile) Enzo and Dino Ferrari Autodrome
circuit.
	   Barros was next with a time of 1:49.752 while fellow Honda rider
Doohan cut more than a tenth off his practice time and was third in
1:49.828.
	   In the 250 cc division, Japan's Tetsuya Harada was nearly a full
second faster than Italy's Loris Capirossi and took the early spot
out front with a time of 1:53.560. Fellow Aprilia rider Capirossi
finished his best lap in 1:54.399, just ahead of the Honda of
Frenchman Olivier Jacque (1:54.586).
	   The top three spots in the 125 cc class pole all went to Honda
riders. Italy's Marco Melandri led with 1:59.795, followed by
Japan's Tomomi Manako (2:00.239) and Roberto Locatelli of Italy
(2:01.004).

Doctors restore eyesight to 240 people in Somali town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Eye doctors have restored the eyesight
of more than 240 people in the central Somalia town of Belet Huen
during a four-day campaign that ended Friday, a local official
said.
	   Dr. Mohamed Dhaqaneh Elmi, a physician at the town's hospital
said four opthamologists arrived Tuesday in Belet Huen to assist
residents with eye problems.
	   Elmi, who spoke by VHF radio Friday with reporters in the
capital Mogadishu, about 300 kilometers (186 miles) south, said the
doctors treated 240 people in four days.
	   The doctors, who work with the Italian agency COSV _ Commitato
Operazione Servicio Voluntare, which runs the Belet Huen hospital _
returned Friday to the Kikuyu Mission Hospital in the Kenyan
capital Nairobi, which specializes in eye treatment.
	   Elmi said most of those who had their eyesight restored were
elderly, suffering from cataracts. But an eight-year-old boy who
was blind from birth because of cataracts, was also cured, Elmi
said.
	   Another eight patients were treated for glaucoma, while six
others needed only minor surgery, Elmi said.
	   The campaign was third of its kind after doctors from Kikuyu
Mission Hospital restored the eyesight of 266 people in March, and
another 294 people in June 1997.
	   Belet Huen has been peaceful in recent months after local
authorities, businessmen and the Islamic court decided to
collaborate to restore security. Much of Somalia has been plagued
with violence since different factions ousted President Siad Barre
in 1991 and then turned on each other.
	   Somalia has been without a central government since then.
	   In March 1997, a COSV convoy was attacked in Belet Huen by
gunmen and at least one person was killed. An Italian doctor
travelling with the convoy was unharmed.

Ukraine's government announces new trading band for national
</HEADLINE>
currency &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with inflation rate, other detail; CLARIFIES
Yushchenko's statement in 4th graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Under increasing pressure from the
financial crisis in neighboring Russia, the Ukrainian government on
Friday announced a new, wider trading corridor for the national
hryvna currency.
	   As of Friday, the Ukrainian Central Bank will keep the hryvna
within a range of 2.5 to 3.5 to the dollar, the Cabinet and
National Bank said in a joint statement.
	   ``The devaluation of (the Russian) ruble and loss of stability
in neighboring markets have forced Ukraine to take adequate steps
in response,'' National Bank chief Viktor Yushchenko said.
	   He declined to say how long the corridor would remain in effect.
	   The old corridor, which the government originally announced last
January for the whole of 1998, set the hryvna rate limits at 1.8 to
2.25 to the dollar.
	   The government has struggled desperately in recent weeks to
withstand the spillover of Russia's crisis into Ukraine, calling on
more than 50 million Ukrainians to remain calm.
	   But few Ukrainians seemed to believe their leaders.
	   Prices in shops and markets have been rising steadily since the
Russian government's devaluation of the ruble on Aug. 17, and lines
of people trying to buy dollars at currency exchanges have been
growing every day.
	   Russia is by far Ukraine's largest trading partner. Ukraine's
tendency to follow Russia's lead in the economic sphere has only
increased public concern.
	   In an attempt to keep the hryvna within the old trading band,
the Central Bank has been extensively spending its reserves since
the start of the crisis in Russia and massively canceling dollar
purchases by banks to keep down the demand.
	   However, it could not stop the hryvna's steady fall, and the
currency fell to the upper limit of the corridor, 2.25 to the
dollar, last week.
	   The government is hoping for salvation from the International
Monetary Fund, which was scheduled to consider a 2.2 billion loan
to Ukraine on Friday.
	   The loan, widely expected to be approved, would be used to
replenish National Bank's reserves, which have contracted to about
dlrs 800 million by this week, down from about 1.75 billion a month
ago.
	   The Russian crisis hit Ukraine in a period of relative price
stability. The August inflation figure was 0.2 percent, bringing
the total inflation for January-August 1998 to 2.3 percent, the
State Statistics Committee reported Friday.
	   The highest monthly inflation this year was 1.3 percent in
January and April, while the government reported zero inflation in
May and June.
	   Prior to the crisis, inflation in Ukraine has declined steadily
since reaching more than 10,000 percent in 1993, and the annual
rate dropped to about 10 percent in 1997.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna and sixth-seeded
Monica Seles moved into familiar territory on Friday, capturing
straight-set victories to advance to the fourth round of the U.S.
Open.
	   Novotna, seeded third and seeking her second straight Grand Slam
tournament title, defeated Sandrine Testud of France 6-2, 6-3.
	   Seles, who has won twice at the National Tennis Center, but not
since 1992, pounded her way past Annie Miller of the United States,
6-3, 6-3.
	   ``I've been able to turn my game a couple of notches to win,''
Seles said.
	   In another early women's singles match, Nathalie Dechy of France
defeated Spain's Gala Leon Garcia 6-4, 6-4. Dechy will next play
the winner of a later third-round match Friday pitting top-seeded
Martina Hingis, the defending champion, against Amelie Mauresmo of
France.

Author and sister of anti-Nazi students, Inge Aicher-Scholl, dead
</HEADLINE>
at 81 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LEUTKIRCH, Germany (AP) _ Inge Aicher-Scholl, champion of
non-violence and the sister of student activists Hans and Sophie
Scholl who were murdered by the Nazis in 1943, died Friday at her
home in the southern town of Leutkirch. She was 81.
	   Aicher-Scholl died of complications from a long bout with
cancer, a family spokeswoman said.
	   A tireless teacher and spokeswoman against violence,
Aicher-Scholl wrote several books in the years after the war
explaining the motives of the anti-Nazi student group known as the
``White Rose,'' that was led by her siblings in Munich against
Hitler.
	   After the Nazis murdered her brother and sister, Aicher-Scholl,
her parents and sister Elisabeth were also jailed by the Nazis for
several months.
	   After the war she and a group of friends, including her
husband-to-be Otl Aicher, a designer, founded a school in the
southern city of Ulm for adult education and art, which she headed
from 1946 to 1974.
	   In the 1980s, Aicher-Scholl gained notoriety through her work in
the peace movement resisting the stationing of U.S. nuclear
missiles in Germany.
	   In 1985 she was arrested along with other activists for taking
part in a sit-in blockade at the American Pershing II missile base
at the southern town of Mutlangen. She and other activists were
charged with disrupting public order and given suspended fines for
instigating the sit-in.
	   Aicher-Scholl is survived by four of her five children, Eva,
Florian, Julian and Manuel. Another child, Pia, died in a car
accident in 1975. Her husband died in 1991.
	   Funeral plans were incomplete.

Iranian deputy president, culture minister assaulted by militants
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hard-line militants assaulted an Iranian
deputy president and the country's minister of culture and Islamic
guidance while the two men were leaving a prayer service in central
Tehran on Friday, witnesses said.
	   About 80 militants chanting ``Death to liberals!'' scuffled with
Deputy President Abdullah Nouri and Culture Minister Ataollah
Mohajerani as they were leaving Tehran University after Friday
prayers at about 2 p.m. local time (0930 GMT), witnesses told The
Associated Press.
	   The militants knocked off Nouri's white cleric turban and tore
open Mohajerani's shirt.
	   Both officials were slapped in the face, but neither appeared to
be seriously injured, the witnesses said. They said Mohajerani was
taken to hospital for treatment of what appeared to be a broken
finger.
	   The militants also assaulted the officials' bodyguards, said the
witnesses, who had attended the same prayer service. They spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   Mohajerani and Nouri are known to be close allies of President
Mohammad Khatami, who is widely perceived as a moderate.
	   Hard-liners regard Mohajerani and Nouri, who was interior
minister until he was impeached in June, as liberals for their
relaxation of the strict social code that has been enforced in Iran

feared drowned. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ A boat carrying 125 flood victims sank
in a rain-swollen river in northern Bangladesh, and most of the
occupants were feared drowned, police said Friday.
	   Only 12 people had been rescued so far by fishermen in the
Sanjana River in Lalmonirhat district, 160 miles (255 kilometers)
north of Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, a police officer said in a
telephone interview. The officer spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Police and fire brigade members were searching for the missing
passengers.
	   In another flood-related accident, five men riding a boat
through a flooded street died Friday after a live electricity cable
snapped and fell on them, police said.
	   The deaths occurred in Dhaka's southern Islambagh district,
where streets have been flooded by overflowing River Buriganga.
Local residents are using boats to commute.
	   Bangladesh is experiencing devastating floods that are fed by
heavy monsoon rains.
	   More than 700 Bangladeshis have lost their lives due to the
floods and flood-related diseases and accidents in the past two
months. At least 25 of them died after hitting submerged power
lines.

Solana: Belgrade must stop Kosovo attacks to allow peace talks

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
said Friday Serbian forces must stop their military action in
Kosovo so that a U.S.-mediated formula for ending the conflict in
the breakaway Serbian province can progress.
	   ``It's very important that the Belgrade army and (Yugoslav)
President Milosevic stop their (military) actions still taking
place in Kosovo,'' Solana told a news conference in Lisbon.
	   Kosovo's top ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova, said Friday
he welcomed the U.S. initiative and indicated he would try to win
over hard-liners to a peace process rather than continue the battle
for full independence.
	   ``It will be very difficult for (the Albanians) to sit down at
the negotiating table if actions by the Belgrade army continue,''
Solana said.
	   Fighting continued for a third day Friday near Orahovac, 55
kilometers (34 miles) southwest of Pristina, Kosovo's capital.
	   Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population of 2
million, are seeking greater autonomy from Serbia, the dominant
Yugoslav republic, but Serbs have used a heavy military presence to
retain control of the province.
	   Solana said NATO had finalized a range of options for military
intervention in Kosovo. ``Political leaders must now decide if, and
how, they want to use those options,'' he said.
	   With the severe Balkan winter approaching, the humanitarian
situation in Kosovo, where tens of thousands of people have been
made homeless by more than six months of fighting, was
``dramatic,'' Solana said.
	   ``It's important to put maximum weight behind any initiative''
aimed at checking the conflict, he said.
	   Solana said that the general elections in Bosnia, scheduled for
Sept. 12-13, would play ``a decisive role'' in stabilizing the
Balkans.
	   Solana was in Lisbon to attend a NATO symposium on maritime
policy.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Commonwealth Games, which
launched Ben Johnson, Lennox Lewis and Daley Thompson onto
spectacular careers, has lost its gloss.
	   With so many big names missing from the '98 Games in Malaysia,
the medals are losing their value.
	   There's no Donovan Bailey, Canada's Olympic 100-meter champion
and world record holder who decided long ago he wan't taking part.
His Canadian rival Bruny Surin isn't here either.
	   When the Sept. 11-21, 70-nation ``Friendly Games'' start, there
will be no Cathy Freeman, Australia's 400-meter world champion, who
has a long-standing foot injury.
	   Missing too is Britain's Jonathan Edwards, the triple jump world
record holder who needs an ankle operation after a wearing season.
	   His compatriot, Paula Radcliffe, a strong candidate for the
women's 5,000 meters, pulled out Friday with a mystery virus while
England's Olympic silver medalist swimmer Paul Palmer, is suffering
from muscle fatigue syndrome and will miss his second Commonwealth
Games in a row.
	   The English cricket team isn't bothering to show up at all and
Pakistan and India are sending stronger lineups to play in Canada
in the Sahara Cup.
	   Games organizers still don't know whether the big names such as
Namibian sprint star Frankie Fredericks will take part and which of
the Nigerian sprinters and Kenyan middle- and long-distance runners
will be in Kuala Lumpur.
	   Scotland was looking forward to a gold medal on the track in the
200 meters but European campion Doug Walker, who led a British
medals sweep in Budapest, is limping round after surgery to his
knee and has run his last race of the season.
	   The newly crowned European 100-meter champion, Darren Campbell,
hailed as the ``new Linford Christie'', is struggling to get fit in
time and, in the absence of the Canadian stars, the Commonwealth
100 meters, won in the past by such stars as Don Quarrie, Allan
Wells, Johnson and Christie, could be won by a little-known
outsider.
	   At least in the pool, the Australians have sent a very strong
team and the arena is likely to hear the strains of ``Advance
Australia Fair'' three or four times a day.
	   Australia's 41-member swim team includes several world and
Olympic champions including Kieren Perkins, Susie O'Neill, Grant
Hackett, Ian Thorpe and Michael Klim and world records may come
under threat at the Bukit Jalil swim complex.
	   There's a good chance Australia will triumph in two of the six
new sports being contested this year _ cricket and 7-a-side rugby
union.
	   But even then the lineups are weaker than expected.
	   Shane Warne, the bewildering leg-spinner who is recovering from
shoulder injury, should be back in time for the Ashes series but
too late for Commonwealth Games. Paceman Glenn McGrath pulled out
of the Australian team Friday with a strained groin.
	   Batting star Sachin Tendulkar and spinner Anil Kumble are on
India's lineup but other standout players, such as Mohammed
Azharuddin, Saurav Ganguly and Navjot Singh Sidhu are going to
Toronto to play Pakistan in the exhibition Sahara Cup.
	   That event mean's Pakistan's lineup also is weakened and
therefore gives Sri Lanka, experts in one-day cricket, a chance to
collect a rare gold medal.
	   Star batsman Sanath Jayasuriya scored a double century in the
recent test victory in England, where spinner Muttiah Muralitharan
took 16 wickets.
	   Paceman Shaun Pollock leads a powerful South African team and
the West Indies islands of Antigua, Jamaica and Barbados compete
separately at the Commonwealth Games with stars such as paceman
Curtly Ambrose and batsman Richie Richardson lining up for Antigua.
	   Brian Lara won't play because Trinidad and Tobago doesn't have a
team in the competition.
	   The rugby tournament involves some of the biggest names in the
sport, including New Zealand's 1.96-meter (6-foot-5) 113-kilogram
(249-pound) winger Jonah Lomu, who has run 10.8 for the 100 meters,
and Australian winger David Campese, scorer of the most
international tries in history.
	   England initially said it wouldn't field a team but has sent a
squad which has only one senior international, back rower Chris
Sheasby.
	   While Sri Lanka could triumph in the cricket, World Cup Sevens
titlist Fiji will be a good bet to win the rugby gold medal.
	   As well as cricket and rugby, men's and women's field hockey,
netball, squash, and tenpin bowling are on the schedule in Kuala
Lumpur which means the number of participants has risen from 3,200
at Victoria, British Columbia four years ago to 6,000.
	   The six newcomers boosts to 15 the number of different sports
contested, a bonus for the first Commonwealth Games to be staged in
Asia. The atheltics competition will be staged in a
100,000-capacity Bukit Jalil stadium.

	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Denmark's two biggest
slaughterhouses, Danish Crown and Vestjyske Slagterier, said Friday
they plan to merge their activities into a single holding company
which would be become one of the world's largest slaughterhouses
and meat processing groups.
	   The new company, with the working title DC-VJS Holding, will
control up to 80 percent of the Danish meat processing trade,
making it Europe's largest exporter of pork.
	   The companies have a total of 18,000 workers in Denmark,
Britain, the United States and Germany and combined annual revenues
of about 37 billion kroner (dlrs 5.6 billion).
	   ``The strategic cooperation is to ensure Danish meat's position
on the world market,'' the companies said in a joint statement.
Pork and bacon are among Denmark's major export products.
	   On Wednesday, Danish Crown fired 50 workers, citing the unstable
economic situation in Russia which is its main export market for
processed meat.

 &UR; Ethnic Albanian leader welcomes interim agreement for Kosovo
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Russian envoys in Belgrade; US committs
dlrs 23 million in food aid; no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The top ethnic Albanian leader
signaled Friday he would try to win over hardliners to proposed
peace formula for Kosovo, as diplomatic efforts accelerated to end
the fighting before winter threatens thousands of refugees.
	   Despite those efforts, fighting between Serb forces and ethnic
Albanian secessionist rebels continued for a third day Friday in
the Orahovac area 55 kilometers (34 miles), southwest of Pristina.
	   The Serb Media Center said police Friday arrested 60 suspected
members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, who were rounded up in the
Prizren area near the fighting.
	   Serb authorities said those arrested would be released if an
investigation determined they were pressured into joining the
Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence from
Serbia, the dominant part of Yugoslavia.
	   The offer appeared to be part of campaign by the government to
isolate KLA hardliners, who oppose a negotiated settlement short of
full independence for the Albanian majority province.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has refused to grant
independence, which is also opposed by the United States and
European powers.
	   Both Milosevic and moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova have
agreed in principle to an interim formula granting Kosovo self-rule
but without independence.
	   The formula, however, would provide for the two sides to review
the plan in three to five years, leaving the door open to another
arrangement. But the KLA has not endorsed the plan, which diplomats
say could take months to finalize.
	   On Friday, Rugova said the U.S.-inspired formula ``is under
consideration'' as a way to ``normalize life'' and ``create
conditions for a lasting solution.''
	   Asked if the KLA would eventually accept the plan, Rugova said
he represents ``all residents of Kosovo,'' indicating he would seek
to build support among the Albanian community.
	   Albanians make up 90 percent of the 2 million Kosovo population.
	   ``We have to do something to end the negative trends and prevent
an imminent tragedy for Kosovo, '' Rugova said.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged Milosevic to call
off the crackdown he launched against Albanian extremists on Feb.
28 to give diplomacy a chance. Russia, a traditional Serb ally, has
made similar appeals.
	   On Friday, two top Russian foreign ministry officials _ Nikolai
Afanasyevsky and Igor Ivanov _ flew to Belgrade and met with
Milosevic. Milosevic's office said the Russians reaffirmed Moscow's
interest in a peaceful solution.
	   The advent of winter in less than two months time has added
urgency to efforts to end the conflict. More than 230,000 people
have been displaced by the fighting, and about 50,000 of them are
camped in woods and fields in appalling conditions.
	   On Friday, Hugh Parmer of the U.S. Agency for International
Development announced an additional dlrs 21.8 million in food aid
for Kosovo's refugees. This is in addition to the dlrs 11 million
already provided by the U.S. government.
	   Parmer, speaking in Belgrade after a visit to Kosovo, said the
next five weeks are crucial to saving thousands of lives. He
described having seen ``babies ... being fed crumbled bred mixed
with dirty water for lack of any other, women and children living
in home-made plastic tents... houses and wheat fields burning.''
	   ``But, we cannot wait for the diplomats and politicians to
finish,'' he added. ``We have a responsibility to produce on the
ground so that women, children and elderly do not die of
starvation.''

Sudan issues flood alert along the Nile
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MOHAMED OSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudanese radio issued a flood alert
Friday for citizens living along the Nile, saying the upper reaches
of the river had risen to unprecedented levels.
	   The state-run radio said people living along the Blue Nile and
the river north of Khartoum _ the confluence of the White and Blue
Niles _ should be ``alert and cautious.''
	   ``Water volumes in the upper parts of the river branches,
particularly the Blue Nile, have reached levels that exceeded all
previously recorded levels,'' the radio said.
	   Heavy rain and flooding have already destroyed 229 houses in
Khartoum and 118 houses in neighboring Omdurman, reports said here.
	   Minister of Interior Abdel-Raheem Mohamed Hussein and Finance
Minister Abdel-Wahab Osman are currently in the northern city of
Dongola to assess floods damage and the assistance required for
more than 20 villages that have been cut off by floods.
	   Meanwhile in Egypt, the state-run newspaper Al-Gomhuriya has
reported that the Nile water behind the High Dam at Aswan has
reached the maximum height permitted. The excess has been diverted
into the 22-kilometer-long (13.6-mile) Toshka channel which leads
to a reservoir.
	   It was the second time since the high dam was built in 1971 that
water has reached the maximum height of 178 meters (196 yards). The
first occasion was in October 1996.

North Korea claims it launched scientific satellite into orbit

 &UR; With Japan-NKorea Missile
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 10 grafs to raise comment by Japan's prime
minister &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea denied Friday that it
launched a ballistic missile this week, saying it fired its first
artificial satellite into orbit. Japan's prime minister disputed
the account.
	   U.S. officials say North Korea test fired a Taepo Dong 1
ballistic missile on Monday that flew across northern Japan and
crashed into the Pacific Ocean. The first stage landed in the Sea
of Japan.
	   A Foreign Ministry statement criticized the United States and
Japan for making a ``fuss'' over the North's launch of a
``scientific satellite.''
	   ``Some people ... are making a fuss, ignorant of this valuable
success of science and technology,'' the statement said. ``They
suspected it to be a ballistic missile launching test, expressed
some `apprehensions' and described it as `a serious event.'''
	   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said he doubted the rocket
carried a satellite.
	   ``If it was launched, I guess Japan's technology could have
already picked it up,'' said Obuchi. ``What kind of satellite is
it?''
	   The North also said that its rocket capacity can be used for
military purposes and warned the United States and Japan to stop
any hostile moves against it.
	   ``Particularly, the forces hostile towards the DPRK (North
Korea) must be mindful that their attempt to lead the DPRK to a
change will bring them nothing but destruction,'' the statement
said.
	   According to the North's official Korean Central News Agency,
the satellite was launched Monday on a three-stage, domestically
developed rocket. The timing and sites where the first two stages
of the rockets fell coincide with the American and Japanese times
and locations for what they described as a ballistic missile.
	   ``Our scientists and technicians have succeeded in the first
artificial satellite aboard a multistage rocket into orbit,'' KCNA
said.

Talbot's Aussies ready for gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australian swimming coach Don
Talbot whips up his team with one hand and beats down public
expectation with the other.
	   This contradiction between what Talbot demands from his swimmers
and what he tells the world they are capable of helps protect him
and the team when they fail.
	   So it's no surprise to hear Talbot talking down the Commonwealth
Games chances of his 41-member team, which includes several world
and Olympic champions including Kieren Perkins, Susie O'Neill,
Grant Hackett, Ian Thorpe and Michael Klim, and might threaten a
couple of world records.
	   Australia carved up their opposition four years ago in Victoria,
Canada, winning 53 medals including 25 golds. The closest anyone
got to the team was the hosts, who managed two gold out of 19
medals.
	   Despite Australia's efforts at this year's World Championships
in Perth, when it finished second in the medals table behind the
United States, Talbot believes the Canadians and English will
threaten his team's chances of emulating its 1994 haul.
	   ``They are making inroads into us,'' Talbot said before taking
the team to a training camp in Singapore. ``We caught the other
nations with their pants down before 1994 and their pride was
stung. And they want to do much better.''
	   Talbot's biggest concern is Australia's female distance
swimmers, who have failed to match the efforts of the men, such as
15-year-old Thorpe, the 400-meter freestyle world champion, and
1500-meter star Hackett.
	   Australia leads the Commonwealth rankings in seven of the 13
men's events going to the Bulit Jalil swimming complex.
	   Canada's 200- and 400-meter Olympic medley medalist Curtis Myden
will skip the Games because of education commitments.
	   Canadian backstroker Mark Versfeld, who holds the Commonwealth
record in the 100-meter event and is top ranked this year in the
200, claimed a silver and bronze at the World Championships and
should beat his Australian rivals in Kuala Lumpur.
	   English butterfly swimmers Stephen Parry and James Hickman are
expected to fight each other for gold in the 200-meter event, but
Klim is the world record holder in the 100-meter butterfly and
Australia has three of the top nine in the world.
	   While Australia is favored to win all the relays, there is more
hope for the other nations in the women's events.
	   South Africa's 100-meter breastroke world record holder Penny
Heyns was left out after missing the trials, but there have been
reports that she may be a late addition.
	   English freestyler Susan Rolph is favored to win the 50- and
100-meter freestyle double, although the latter will be one of the
tightest races of the Games.
	   Rolph equaled compatriot Karen Pickering's Commonwealth record
of 55.79 seconds at the Games trials but will face pressure from
Australia's Sarah Ryan and Susie O'Neill and Canadians Shannon
Shakespeare and Laura Nichols.
	   Breaststroker Lauren van Oosten and medley star Joanne Malar
could give Canada two more gold, while Jamaica's Janelle Atkinson,
in the 800-meter freestyle, is capable of winning the first
Commonwealth swimming medal by a Caribbean athlete.
	   Australia's men have some world records in sight and they take
this meet as seriously as the World Championships because of the
intensity of interest _ and possible sponsorship dollars _ at home.
Plenty of Australians have made a comfortable living in a country
which inflates the value of Commonwealth gold.
	   ``As an athlete, I wouldn't like to let slip an opportunity like
this,'' Klim said.
	   Klim has been hunting swimming's oldest men's mark, Italian
Giorgio Lamberti's 1989 200-meter record of 1 minute, 46.69
seconds, but Thorpe, whose foot size (16) is greater than his age,
holds the Commonwealth record at 1 minute, 47.24 seconds.
	   The pair will spearhead another world record attempt in the
800-meter freestyle relay, after the Australians beat the United
States at the Perth World Championships.
	   The swimming program will run Sept. 12-17.

Bus passenger shoots robbery suspect in Mexico City
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Riding the bus is increasingly dangerous in
the Mexico City area _ at least for would-be bandits.
	   When two young men tried to rob passengers aboard a bus in
northwest Mexico City on Thursday, a passenger pulled out a pistol
and shot one of them dead, the daily Reforma reported Friday.
	   It was at least the seventh time in two weeks that passengers
aboard buses or subway trains in the Mexico City area have killed
or captured would-be robbers _ evidence of public fury over
criminals' increasing use of buses as rolling targets.
	   Passengers told Reforma that Daniel Franco Moreno, 22, was
making his way down the aisle of the bus, demanding valuables, when
one passenger pulled out a gun instead of a wallet and shot him in
the face. The other alleged bandit fled.
	   Other passengers refused to give police the name of the man who
fired the shot _ variously describing him as an old, dark-skinned
man or a young, light-skinned man.
	   Possession of pistols, other than very small-bore weapons, is
usually illegal.
	   On Aug. 20, a policeman riding as a passenger killed two men
trying to rob a bus in the Indios Verdes area. On Aug. 24,
passengers overpowered two men trying to rob a bus in eastern
Mexico City. On both Aug. 26 and 27, bus passengers in Ecatepec
captured and beat men who tried to rob them.
	   Subway passengers chased and captured three robbers in western
Mexico city on Aug. 30, and bus passengers captured one of three
attackers in the La Era area on Aug. 31.
	   In a poll of 799 Mexico City residents published Friday by
Reforma, 24 percent said they had been victim of a crime, usually
robbery, in the first half of the year. Only 25 percent of those
reported the attack to police.
	   Ten percent of those polled said they had a good or excellent
opinion of the police _ a slight improvement from 6 percent in
March. The number of those with a bad impression fell to 43 percent
from 60 percent. The poll had a 3.5 percent margin of error.
	   Seventy-three percent of those polled said crime had forced them
to cut back trips at night, 45 percent said they avoided taxis, 40
percent avoided bank machines and 12 percent said they had
purchased a weapon.

Mixed bag for cricket's Commonwealth Games debut
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australia's first obstacle in the
inaugural Commonwealth Games cricket competition will come from a
brash left-hander from Trinidad who loves giving the ball a whack.
	   But unlike Brian Lara, the wealthy little West Indian who is one
of the world's greatest players, this new foe stands more than 1.80
meters (6 feet) tall and has barely made a dime from the game.
	   Ingleton Liburd, 27, is the main man standing between Canada and
embarrassment when Australia opens its Commonwealth Games cricket
campaign on Sept. 9, two days before the opening ceremony.
	   Liburd is Canada's captain and outstanding batsman who plays
with some flair.
	   ``He's much taller than Lara and I don't think he'll play the
Australians with the same disdain as Lara does,'' Canadian Cricket
Association president Dr. Geoff Edwards said.
	   Edwards, of course, is trying to keep his expectations in check
as cricket makes its Commonwealth Games debut with a mixed bag of
16 teams.
	   ``I don't think we're going to demolish Australia by any stretch
of the imagination,'' Edwards said. ``We're just hoping we can help
promote cricket across the Commonwealth.''
	   Players from all test nations except England, who refused to
play for no pay, will compete in the tournament and while Lara
won't be there, most of the world's best will be.
	   Jamaica, Barbados and Antigua will play as separate entities,
rather than under the banner of the West Indies, and Antigua looks
an imposing side with former captain Richie Richardson and chief
destroyer Curtly Ambrose plus five other internationals on hand.
	   Pakistan and India selectors had to choose two teams each at the
same time _ one for the Games and one for the lucrative Sahara Cup
exhibition matches in Canada between the two countries. While
Pakistan is sending a weaker side to Kuala Lumpur, India's board
blessed the Commonwealth Games with the leading batsman Sachin
Tendulkar.
	   Tendulkar's Indians are in the same group as Australia, and his
presence, after flogging the Aussies in a recent series, changes
the tone of their pool, which also includes Antigua and Canada.
	   Australian captain Steve Waugh has described Tendulkar's
inclusion as ``bad news.''
	   ``I guess he's only human like someone else and we've got him
out cheaply quite a few times but he has got a few good hundreds
against us,'' Waugh said.
	   Waugh will be without his two best bowlers. Shane Warne is
sidelined with a shoulder injury while paceman Glenn McGrath was to
make his competitive comeback at the Games but got injured Friday.
	   World champion Sri Lanka will be at full strength and, with one
team progressing through each group to semifinals, it is favored to
win the gold.
	   Star batsman Sanath Jayasuriya, fresh from his double century in
the recent test victory in England, and spinner Muttiah
Muralitharan, who took 16 wickets in that match, will lead the Sri
Lankan effort.
	   While the Games are just one in a long series of limited overs
competitions between the test nations each year, they also give the
lesser lights a chance in the spotlight.
	   ``We'll be hyped for sure,'' said Canadian spinner Barry
Seebaran. ``We have to keep track of cricket through short-wave
radio, the Internet, magazines and tapes our friends make, but we
know a lot about the Australians.''
	   The Australians say they are looking forward to marching in the
opening ceremony on Sept. 11 and enjoying the experience of the
athletes' village.
	   Shaun Pollock heads a youthful but skillful South African team,
including Adam Bacher, Jacques Kallis, Makhaya Ntini, Paul Adams
and wicketkeeper Mark Boucher, while Zimbabwe will also be at their
best.

President Emil Constantinescu appeals to parties to stop warring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Warning that political feuding was
imperiling Romania's shaky reforms, President Emil Constantinescu
on Friday called on ruling parties to cooperate in running the
country.
	   ``More than ever before, we need a common political will to
overcome our difficulties,'' Constantinescu said.
	   Earlier, the government said it might need to raise taxes to
keep down the budget deficit. The budget adjustment is to be
discussed Saturday.
	   The four ruling parties, who met with Constantinescu for several
hours Friday, were due to sign an agreement later in the day,
Constantinescu said in a statement, delivered live on television.
	   No details of the supposed agreement were announced, and it was
unclear if all four parties would sign.
	   Since it came to power almost two years ago, the ruling
coalition has been torn by rifts. Market and other reforms have
stagnated either because the government is incapable of carrying
out stringent market reforms or, as critics charge, it does not
want to.
	   Foreign investors have complained of corruption and red tape and
the slow pace of privatization and laws stimulating investment.
	   On Thursday, the party which represents the interests of ethnic
Hungarians withdrew its support of the government, accusing it of
not respecting minority education rights.
	   There was no word whether the Hungarians, who joined talks with
other parties, would sign the cooperation deal.
	   The main Peasant Party, which heads the coalition, is also split
into at least two camps. Almost every day, the Democratic Party,
criticizes government and the Peasant party over the pace of
reforms.
	   Although inflation is only at 1.3 percent in August and
unemployment at officially 8 percent, industrial output is down and
the trade deficit is growing.
	   In the past two weeks, a Dutch company and an American company
withdrew their bids to buy a stake of the state telecommunications
operator RomTelecom, the country's biggest ever sell-off.
	   Royal PTT Nedeland NV last week said the investment raised too
many uncertainties. Although Romania has little trade with Russia,
the turmoil in Russia has clouded the investment environment.

Iranian deputy president, culture minister assaulted by militants

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hard-line militants assaulted an Iranian
deputy president and the minister of culture and Islamic guidance
as they left a prayer service in central Tehran on Friday,
witnesses said.
	   About 80 militants chanting ``Death to liberals!'' scuffled with
Deputy President Abdullah Nouri and Culture Minister Ataollah
Mohajerani as they were separately leaving Tehran University after
Friday prayers at about 2 p.m. local time (0930 GMT), witnesses
told The Associated Press.
	   The militants knocked off Nouri's white cleric turban and tore
open Mohajerani's shirt.
	   Both officials were slapped in the face, but neither appeared to
be seriously injured, the witnesses said. They said Mohajerani was
taken to hospital with a suspected broken finger.
	   A passerby said he saw about 10 people stop Nouri to talk to him
as he approached the university's eastern gate.
	   ``Then about 50 people converged on him and attacked him,'' said
the witness, who stood about 25 meters (28 yards) away.
	   It is very rare for a clergyman, even a controversial one such
as Nouri who was impeached in June, to be physically assaulted in
Iran.
	   The militants also assaulted the officials' bodyguards, said the
witnesses, some of whom had attended the prayer service. They spoke
on condition of anonymity.
	   Mohajerani and Nouri are known to be close allies of President
Mohammad Khatami.
	   Hard-liners regard Mohajerani and Nouri, who was interior
minister until his impeachment, as liberals for their relaxation of
the strict social code that has been enforced in Iran since the
Islamic revolution of 1979.
	   The parliament, which is dominated by hard-liners, impeached
Nouri for allowing political gatherings and relaxing the Islamic
code.

Sjoland takes lead while Faldo misses cut
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CRANS-SUR-SIERRE, Switzerland (AP) _ Darren Clarke gave up a
one-stroke lead to Patrik Sjoland in the European Masters on Friday
but still looms as a strong chance to take over Lee Westwood's No.
1 spot on the European tour.
	   On a day when Nick Faldo missed the cut for the first time in
Europe for more than four years, Sjoland fired a 5-under par 66 to
go 11-under 131 after two rounds on the Crans-Sur-Sierre course.
	   He is one stroke ahead of Clarke, who carded a 68 on the back of
his first-round 64 to go to 10-under 132.
	   Sjoland hit four birdies and an eagle on the back nine, driving
to within eight feet of the flag on the 290-yard seventh hole to
secure his one stroke lead.
	   Clarke, currently No. 2 on the European tour money list 42,600
pounds (dlrs 69,864) behind Westwood, is tied for second with
Germany's Sven Struver and Switzerland's Christophe Bovet, who
carded 63 and 64 respectively.
	   The Northern Ireland golfer is in a three-way battle with
Westwood and five-time European No.1 Colin Montgomerie for the top
place on the tour this season and the 133,330 (dlrs 218,661)
Masters winner's purse has increased the stakes.
	   Clarke said he was hitting the ball better in the second round
but missed chances on the greens had let him down.
	   Westwood, returning from a hip injury which forced him out of
last week's BMW International, started his second round with five
birdies in six holes before settling for a 68 and 4-under aggregate
of 138.
	   His playing partner Montgomerie, who has missed the cut in his
last two tournaments, opened with three birdies and finished with
three more to move into a group of seven players on the 6-under
total of 136.
	   Montgomerie said he was happy with the start and finish of his
round but was concerned after twisting his ankle on the ninth hole.
He injured the same ankle when he tripped signing autographs in
July.
	   ``I'm lucky it didn't affect me more _ I really turned it again.
I can still feel it and it's weak anyway,'' he said.
	   Faldo continued his run of poor form, failing by one stroke to
make the cut with a 1-under 70 in the second round after his
level-par first round 71.
	   Faldo, who has not won a tournament in 18 months, said he will
again have to resort to the practise course.
	   ``I was struggling with my swing earlier on but I got some good
thoughts during the round. I'm trying to find a drill that unsticks
me,'' he said.
	   ``My putting routine is good but I need to work on my touch.
These greens were too new _ for me anyway.''
	   Justin Rose, hailed as a bright young star when he turned pro
after finishing equal-fourth in the British Open _ the best finish
by an amateur since 1953 _ missed his fifth successive cut since
turning pro.
	   The 18-year-old hit a second round 77, giving him a 5-over-par
total of 147.
	   He has two more tournaments, the British Masters and the German
Masters, to accrue 50,000 pounds (dlrs 82,000) or he will have to
play the nine-round qualifying school to earn a tour card for next
season.
	   ``It's not pressure that's making me play like this _ I'm just
fighting my game a bit at the moment,'' Rose said.
	   ``Every time I miss the cut it gets harder. I don't think it's
anything major. It's all to do with confidence.
	   ``There's no real reason why I'm playing so badly, but that's
golf.''
	   Seve Ballesteros and Jose Maria Olazabal just made the cut,
qualifying on the limit of 2-under with India's Jeev Milkha Singh
whoa was more concerned about events off the course.
	   His sister, Mona, a doctor in New York, was scheduled to fly on
the Swissair F111 to Geneva on Wednesday but rescheduled due to
work commitments and took another flight via Zurich.
	   The F111 crashed into the sea near Canada, killing all 229
people on board.
	   ``I could have been on (that flight) _ it's just destiny,'' she
said Friday.
	   As a mark of respect, Swissair, a tournament sponsor, has
removed its advertising and closed its hospitality unit.
	   Players, officials and spectators will observe a minute's
silence Saturday for the victims of the Swissair crash.
	   Tour organizers also sanctioned a minute's silence for the
victims of the Omagh bombing tragedy near Belfast in Northern
Ireland during a tournament in Ireland three weeks ago.

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Police Friday said they arrested a member
of a group of Iraqi Kurds that allegedly kidnapped fellow refugees
and extorted money for their release from relatives living in other
parts of Europe.
	   ``They kidnapped fellow Kurds and held them illegally in
apartments, forcing them to communicate with relatives abroad so
they could send them money through banks,'' said a police
announcement. ``After they received the money, they would release
them.''
	   Police said they arrested Hassan Hassan, 37, and issued warrants
for two other Iraqi Kurds that were members of the purported
extortion ring. All are Kurdish refugees.
	   Police did not release further details on the activities of the
group, which they say may number more than three people. They also
did not release any details on the number of people that had been
kidnapped or released.
	   ``The investigation is continuing,'' the announcement said.
	   But police did say the three members of the group had allegedly
made 31 million drachmas (dlrs 103,000) ``by using this method'' in
the past two months.
	   Hassan was initially detained along with 70 other Kurds late
Thursday during a police sweep in central Athens that was launched
as part of the police investigation into the kidnapping ring. The
other 69 were released.
	   When he was picked up, police said Hassan was at a financial
institution waiting for a dlrs 800 money order from Sweden.
	   ``The amount was destined for the release of one of their
illegally held compatriots,'' the announcement said. It did not say
who the kidnapped man was or elaborate further.
	   Police said Hassan was facing felony charges of kidnapping,
extortion, conspiracy and money laundering.
	   An estimated 50,000 Iraqi Kurds illegally enter Greece each
year, seeking political asylum or clandestine transport to other
points in Europe. Greece is a key stop along the refugee trail for
Kurds from northern Iraq, a semi-autonomous region protected from
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein since 1991 by a U.S.-led air force
based in Turkey.
	   There have been accusations that Kurdish criminal gangs operate
among the refugees, trying to cash in on the vast underground
economy from immigrant smuggling, where a voyage from northern Iraq
to Italy can cost up to dlrs 10,000 in travel and forged papers.
	   There are a number of refugee camps housing Kurds in Greece, but
many fend for themselves in Athens and the southern port of Patras,
where they hope to sneak aboard one of the dozens of ferry boats
that daily head for Italy and other European Union ports.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Grief-stricken families from Europe
and the United States flew to the rocky coast of Nova Scotia Friday
to face the task of identifying remains pulled out of the Atlantic,
where Swissair Flight 111 crashed into fragments.
	   Canadian officials brought in the 200-foot (60-meter) submarine
HMCS Okanagan, and by midmorning had shifted gears from a massive
rescue operation to a search and salvage mission.
	   Rescue boats toiled all night in rough seas off the fishing
village of Peggy's Cove, scouring for bodies and remnants of the
MD-11 jumbo jet that crashed Wednesday night after its pilots
reported smoke in the cockpit.
	   ``There's a lot more debris and apparently, unfortunately
partial human remains that were not evident yesterday coming to
light today,'' said Sgt. Keith McGuire.
	   The submarine began mapping the ocean floor with sonar at 5 a.m.
(0800 GMT).
	   ``We have not yet received any signal yet from the body of the
aircraft,'' said Benoit Bouchard, head of the Transportation Safety
Board of Canada. ``Last night, investigators did not have much to
look at. That should come soon, today or tomorrow, if we get the
black boxes.''
	   Officials hope to find the plane's flight recorders to help them
determine the cause of the crash, which killed 229 people,
including 132 Americans.
	   Investigators also plan to listen to a tape of the final
conversation between the pilot of Flight 111 and the air traffic
control tower in Moncton, New Brunswick.
	   Benoit said large parts of the plane may still be intact
underwater since only about a fourth of the bodies have been found.
	   However, nothing larger than the size of a car has been found so
far, said Lt. Cmdr. Jacques Fauteux, spokesman for the Canadian
rescue operation. The debris _ a sad array that included ripped
clothing, wallets, baby bottles and seat cushions _ was scattered
over seven square miles of oil-slicked ocean.
	   The plane apparently hit the water at a very high speed,
breaking the plane and its occupants into small parts, Swiss
officials said.
	   ``The condition of the bodies is such that the biggest body part
is a baby,'' said Philippe Bruggisser, head of Swissair's parent
company SAirGroup.
	   Officials estimated that 60 bodies had been recovered and taken
to a morgue at a military base outside Halifax. They said none
appeared to be burned, indicating there was no explosion or large
fire.
	   Body parts were washing up along a wide section of the rugged
coastline Friday and about 100 Canadian soldiers were brought to
search 60 miles (100 kilometers) of the coast.
	   Authorities sealed off Peggy's Cove _ a village of 60 people _
and set up tents complete with food, drinks and counselors to
accommodate the hundreds of relatives flying in. A secluded area
was created so mourners could look out over the ocean and watch
boats and aircraft pursue the search.
	   Between 200 and 300 family members were expected Friday on
flights from Switzerland and New York. Swissair has offered dlrs
20,000 in immediate aid to each family.
	   The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration had issue two
directives concerning possible wiring problems on MD-11 planes like
the one that crashed.
	   The FAA had warned in June 1997 about a wiring problem in the
cockpit of MD-11 planes that, if left uncorrected, could cause a
fire and make it difficult to fly the craft. It ordered that U.S.
airlines fix the problem in six months.
	   On Friday, Bruggisser said Swissair had made the necessary
changes _ which he described as minor _ in March 1997, months
before the FAA order.
	   A year earlier, in March 1996, the FAA called for a cable guard
to be installed to separate the plane's flight control cables from
the electrical wiring in the rear of the plane.
	   It was not immediately known how Swissair responded to that
directive, which was not mandatory for foreign airlines.
	   The MD-11 dropped off radar screens about 90 minutes after
leaving New York's Kennedy International Airport late Wednesday on
its way to Geneva.
	   After a normal takeoff, the crew reported smoke in the cockpit
and decided to turn back to Boston. When they spoke to aviation
authorities at Moncton, they were told the Halifax airport was much
closer. The plane never made it to Halifax, crashing into the ocean
30 miles to the south after dumping much of its fuel.
	   Swissair said Friday the pilots put out a ``dense smoke'' call
before their emergency call, but it was not known if there was
smoke in the passenger cabin.
	   There was no indication the crash resulted from sabotage or a
terrorist act, but investigators were not ruling anything out. The
Royal Canadian Mounted Police called in explosives experts to
examine debris for signs of a possible bomb blast. FBI officials
were on the scene Friday, and U.S. crash experts were working on
the rescue boats.
	   An array of distinguished professionals _ brilliant doctors,
high-powered executives, risk-taking relief workers _ were among
the dead. Seven victims were affiliated with the United Nations.
	   Swissair said Friday that only 132 Americans on board, instead
of the 137 reported Thursday.
	   A national mourning service was planned for Saturday at Geneva's
St. Pierre cathedral, and the U.N.'s European headquarters in
Geneva observed a minute of silence Friday in memory of U.N. staff
killed.

Headed for industry showcase, airplane makers worry about slowdown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The world's aerospace executives are about to
hobnob at the top air show of the year, but the popping champagne
corks and earsplitting roar of jets overhead won't be able to drown
out their worries.
	   Sales are soaring, which in the topsy-turvy world of commercial
aviation is often an ominous thing, since booms typically lead to
busts and analysts see no way around the next one.
	   ``We're seeing the peak actually hitting in 1999, at about 1,000
airplanes to be delivered,'' said Oliver Stuart, senior aviation
analyst at Avmark International Ltd. in London. ``In the year 2000,
we're estimating 750 airplane deliveries and in 2001, it drops into
the region of 500.''
	   Others don't have quite such a gloomy outlook ahead of the
Farnborough International 98 show that opens Monday just outside
London. But even Boeing Co.'s chairman, Phil Condit, has predicted
sales will fall by at least 10 percent in 2000.
	   The manufacturers' fortunes are determined by how well their
customers manage the air travel business. Some analysts say the
world's air carriers have not gotten nearly as overextended as they
did in the high-flying late 1980s _ good times that quickly turned
sour when the Gulf War curbed air travel and pushed airlines into
record losses or even bankruptcy.
	   ``It's not going to be as bad as last time, because we haven't
had a speculative bubble,'' said Nick Cunningham, a securities
analyst who follows aviation companies for the investment bank
Salomon Smith Barney in London. ``I don't think you will see the
market halved like you did in the early 1990s.''
	   But, Cunningham said, the economic troubles in Asia _ long
viewed as a major growth area for aviation in the next century _
are setting the stage for a leaner era that could sharply cut back
airplane orders. He predicts business could fall by as much as 15
percent to 20 percent in 2000.
	   While the Farnborough show gives aerospace companies a showcase
for all their new products, it is also the likely scene of a
slugfest between archrivals Boeing, the No. 1 maker of passenger
jets, and No. 2 Airbus Industrie, the European plane-making
consortium.
	   Their executives have often accused each other of lying as both
sides try to claim the most new sales.
	   Airbus is flying into this show boasting some significant recent
victories _ including its first-ever sale of jets to longtime
Boeing customer British Airways and a big deal with US Airways.
	   Boeing is limping in. This week, complaining of costly
production snarls, it fired the president of its commercial
airplane group, Ron Woodard. Alan Mulally, the executive who
directed development of Boeing's successful new 777 jets, is the
new head of the operation.
	   The boom in orders gave Boeing an ironic headache: Its
production lines couldn't handle all the work and the company has
written off some dlrs 3 billion trying to clean up the mess.
	   ``There is that rather embarrassing situation Boeing has gotten
into of not being able to build the planes anyway,'' said Clive
Forestier-Walker, an aviation analyst at Charterhouse Tilney
Securities.
	   The near-term problems facing the airplane makers are
traditional.
	   When times are good, airlines always end up buying more jets
than they need, only to throw the plane makers into crisis by
canceling and delaying orders once traffic dries up.
	   But if everything that goes up must come down in the air
industry, the busts are generally followed by booms.
	   Avmark predicts airplane orders will bounce back in 2003, and
the airplane makers paint a rosy picture for long-term demand.
	   Boeing has forecast that over the next 20 years, airlines will
buy an additional 17,650 airplanes, worth some dlrs 1.25 trillion.

Scottish lawyer for Lockerbie suspects says he expects decision on
</HEADLINE>
trial offer next week

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Scottish lawyer for two Libyans accused of
carrying out the Lockerbie bombing said Friday that he expected to
know by next week if his clients will consent to the U.S-British
plan to offer them a trial on neutral territory.
	   ``At this stage I have no agenda to make sure a trial takes
place _ my function is to represent my clients' interests and if
they decide they don't want a trial ever then my job will be to
make sure no trial ever happens,'' Alistair Duff said in an
interview with Britain's national news agency, Press Association.
	   On Aug. 17 the United Nations Security Council endorsed an
Anglo-American plan for U.N. sanctions against Libya to be
suspended once Libya turns over the two men suspected in the
bombing of the plane, which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, on
Dec. 21, 1988, killing 270 people.
	   Under the plan, the suspects, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and
Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, would be tried in the Netherlands by a panel
of three Scottish judges according to Scottish law. If convicted,
they would serve their sentences in a British prison.
	   Duff said he would be meeting the two suspects and their defense
team in Libya next week to examine the small print of the offer.
	   ``There are issues which require to be clarified and on which we
will have to be certain,'' said Duff, adding that the proposal ``is
not being rejected out of hand and we're going to be looking
carefully at it.''
	   Britain's Foreign Office said that Duff's statement ``was
entirely a matter for him.''
	   ``We are not negotiating with anyone on this, whether it is the
suspects or the Libyan authorities,'' said a spokesman for the
Foreign Office, speaking with customary anonymity.

President says `I'm sorry' about affair
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with censure possibility, other details;

 &UR; By TERENCE HUNT &QC; 
 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ President Bill Clinton said for the first
time Friday ``I'm sorry'' about his affair with Monica Lewinsky,
describing the episode as indefensible as he sought to calm the
growing storm that has shaken his presidency.
	   Less than 24 hours after a Democratic ally took to the Senate
floor to denounce Clinton's conduct as immoral and urge a public
rebuke, the president said, ``I can't disagree with anyone else who
wants to be critical of what I have already acknowledged was
indefensible.''
	   Clearly uncomfortable addressing the matter on an international
stage, Clinton would not discuss the possibility of a congressional
censure, saying, ``I don't want to get into that.'' A senior
presidential adviser said White House aides had come to the
conclusion that the situation was so bad that a censure was
probably the best outcome they could hope for.
	   White House press secretary Mike McCurry said there had been no
discussion of resignation in Clinton's conversations with
Democratic leaders and others. Clinton said Feb. 6 he would never
resign and McCurry commented, ``I am confident his attitude has not
changed on that.''
	   Clinton has been grappling to satisfy demands for a sincere
apology for having an affair with a 21-year-old intern and lying
about it. Friday's statement was the president's third attempt to
address the matter since his Aug. 17 address to the nation and he
used new wording _ even as he insisted he had said much the same
before.
	   ``I've already said that I made a bad mistake, it was
indefensible and I'm sorry about it,'' Clinton said, questioned at
a photo opportunity with Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern. It was
the first time he had used the word ``sorry.''
	   Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, Democratic Party chairman, said
Clinton's direct statement about being sorry was ``helpful.''
	   ``I think he's been saying that with other words. He's had
difficulty getting it out,'' Romer said.
	   The president desperately needs Democratic support to combat the
accumulated evidence in Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's report
to Congress on Clinton's behavior. But even senior Democrats are
distancing themselves from the president, unsure what Starr's
report will say and fearing Clinton will pull the party down in
November's mid-term elections.
	   The administration watched in dismay Thursday as Sen. Joseph
Lieberman said in a Senate speech, ``It is hard to ignore the
impact of the misconduct the president has admitted to on our
children, our culture and our national character.'' He said Clinton
had ``compromised his moral authority.''
	   Two fellow Democrats, Sens. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Daniel
Patrick Moynihan of New York, rose to praise their colleague.
	   White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles had implored Bowles to
``hold off until the president was back on U.S. soil,'' McCurry
said, but was unsuccessful.
	   White House aides debated late into the night how to respond and
decided not to issue a presidential statement. But he responded
when asked about Lieberman at his photo opportunity with the Irish
prime minister.
	   ``Basically I agree with what he said,'' Clinton responded.
	   The president said he would not judge Lieberman's remarks. ``But
there's nothing that he or anyone else could say in a personally
critical way that I _ that I don't imagine that I would disagree
with, since I have already said it myself, to myself. And I'm very
sorry about it. There's nothing else I could say.''
	   Lieberman said Clinton's behavior warrants public rebuke,
perhaps through a resolution, censure or reprimand _ a possibility
the president declined to discuss.
	   Clinton's remarks were the latest in a step-by-step
acknowledgment of wrongdoing. In a televised address Aug. 17,
Clinton said he had a relationship that was ``not appropriate'' and
he said ``it was wrong'' that he had misled people. ``I deeply
regret that,'' he said. But Clinton also went on to harshly attack
Starr's investigation _ a move that was widely believed to have
undermined his words of contrition.
	   Taking his comments further, Clinton said in a news conference
Wednesday in Moscow, ``I have acknowledged that I made a mistake,
said that I regretted it, asked to be forgiven.''

Israeli intelligence: Iran developing spy satellite
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli intelligence officials believe Iran is
developing a spy satellite as part of its ballistic missile
program, Israeli Channel 2 television reported Friday.
	   The officials reached this conclusion from their analysis of
Iranian television's video shots of Iranian ruler Ali Khamenei's
recent visit to the missile development plant, Channel 2 said.
	   In the video shots the analysts spotted a satellite launcher and
what could be the basis for a spy satellite which could cover the
entire Middle East including Israel, the TV said.
	   Iran is widely believed to be trying to obtain a nuclear weapons
capability with help from Russia and North Korea, and recently
tested a medium range missile based on North Korean technology.
	   Israel is very worried over Monday's test firing by North Korea
of the new Taepo Dong 1 ballistic missile which flew across
northern Japan before crashing into the Pacific Ocean, Channel 2
said.
	   The intelligence officials said the Taepo Dong 1 represents a
new generation of missile technology, Channel 2 said, and It would
not be long before Iran obtained it.
	   This would enable Iran to threaten not only Israel, but also
Europe, the officials said.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations sent a counselor and
security coordinator to Halifax, Nova Scotia on Friday to help the
families of U.N. victims of the Swissair crash, a spokesman said.
	   The United Nations, meanwhile, was preparing to hold a memorial
service in the middle of next week for the victims.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan was expected to attend.
	   The stress counselor will help console the families of the eight
U.N.-affiliated victims of Flight 111 traveling from New York to
Geneva. It is the most used flight for U.N. staffers traveling
between the two U.N. hubs. The security coordinator will help
identify the bodies, said spokesman Fred Eckhard.
	   In Geneva, the U.N. flag flew at half-staff and staffers
observed a minute of silence.
	   The Security Council sent condolences to the families of the
victims.
	   ``We were very deeply moved by what has occurred and wish the
friends and relatives and the organizations that the victims have
worked with in the past to know that they are in our thoughts,''
said Swedish Ambassador Hans Dahlgren, the current council
president.
	   Killed were two officials from the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, two from the World Intellectual Property Organization,
two from UNICEF, and a doctor affiliated with the World Health
Organization and his wife.

	   MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) _ A powerful blast struck the capital
of a troubled southern Russian region Friday, reportedly killing at
least one person and damaging the region's television tower,
officials said.
	   Angela Mamadibirova, a TV commentator, said the blast was
believed to be an attempt on the life of Mayor Said Amirov, who
lives near the site of the explosion in Makhachkala, the capital of
the region of Dagestan. The mayor was unhurt.
	   Appearing on local television, Mamadibirova said the mayor has
survived 10 assassination attempts this year. She said the blast,
which struck at 8:42 p.m. (1642 GMT), was equivalent to about 50
kilograms (110 pounds) of TNT.
	   About 10 private homes were destroyed by the blast, local
television reported. Police and rescue workers were searching for
people buried in the debris. At least one person was reported
killed, television said.
	   Many students living in a dormitory near the blast were injured
by glass shards, it said.
	   Dagestan has been wracked by violence and kidnappings in recent
months as various religious and ethnic groups battle for power. It
has also been hit by spillover violence from breakaway Chechnya, on
its western border.
	   In an attempt to control the flow of dangerous materials,
Dagestan police have implemented an amnesty program for explosives.
Residents have so far traded in more than 140 kilograms (300
pounds) of explosives, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
Authorities said the relinquished materials included foreign-made
rocket fuel.

Report: peace deal close after series of high-level meetings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report of new Israeli concessions, 5th-7th grafs &QL; 
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) - Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
said Friday that a deal on an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West
Bank was still far off, contradicting Israeli reports that a flurry
of recent high-level meetings has resulted in a draft agreement.
	   The conflicting assessments came as the United States prepared
to resume its mediation efforts, with U.S. envoy Dennis Ross to
return to the region next week for meetings with Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Israel radio said Palestinian negotiator Ahmed Qureia met three
times in the past two weeks with Netanyahu and seven times with
Netanyahu's confidant, attorney Yitzhak Molcho.
	   The talks resulted in a draft agreement on key issues, including
the scope of a troop withdrawal, security cooperation, the
operation of a Palestinian airport and seaport and the release of
Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, the report said.
	   Israeli Channel 1 television reported Friday that Israel has
made a series of concessions prior to Ross' visit. It no longer
insists that the Palestinians hand over Palestinians who have
killed Israelis, the TV said.
	   Israel was no longer making ``ultimative'' demands that the size
of the Palestinian police be reduced and that the Palestinian
authorities confiscate weapons held by Islamic militants.
	   However Israel still insists that the clauses in the Palestinian
covenant calling for Israel's destruction must be abrogated by the
Palestinian National Council (PNC). The Palestinians refuse,
maintaining that the PNC has already done this.
	   Qureia refused to comment Friday on the reports of the top-level
contacts. However, a senior Palestinian official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, denied there had been any in the past two
weeks.

Iranian deputy president, culture minister assaulted by militants

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hard-line militants assaulted an Iranian
deputy president and the minister of culture and Islamic guidance
as they left a prayer service in central Tehran on Friday,
witnesses said.
	   About 80 militants chanting ``Death to liberals!'' scuffled with
Deputy President Abdullah Nouri and Culture Minister Ataollah
Mohajerani as they were separately leaving Tehran University after
Friday prayers at about 2 p.m. local time (0930 GMT), witnesses
told The Associated Press.
	   The militants knocked off Nouri's white cleric turban and tore
open Mohajerani's shirt.
	   Both officials were slapped in the face, but neither appeared to
be seriously injured, the witnesses said. They said Mohajerani was
taken to hospital with a suspected broken finger.
	   A passerby said he saw about 10 people stop Nouri to talk to him
as he approached the university's eastern gate.
	   ``Then about 50 people converged on him and attacked him,'' said
the witness, who stood about 25 meters (28 yards) away.
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said some people tried
to protect Nouri from the militants and escorted him to a nearby
building.
	   ``I have nothing to say to those who attacked me. I apologize to
those who came to try to stop the attack,'' Nouri told the agency.
	   It is very rare for a clergyman, even a controversial one such
as Nouri who was impeached in June, to be physically assaulted in
Iran.
	   The militants also assaulted the officials' bodyguards, said the
witnesses, some of whom had attended the prayer service. They spoke
on condition of anonymity.
	   Mohajerani and Nouri are known to be close allies of President
Mohammad Khatami.
	   Hard-liners regard Mohajerani and Nouri, who was interior
minister until his impeachment, as liberals for their relaxation of
the strict social code that has been enforced in Iran since the
Islamic revolution of 1979.
	   The parliament, which is dominated by hard-liners, impeached
Nouri for allowing political gatherings and relaxing the Islamic
code.

Ethnic Albanian leader welcomes interim agreement for Kosovo

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The top ethnic Albanian leader
signaled Friday he would try to win hard-liners over to a proposed
peace formula for Kosovo, while diplomatic efforts accelerated to
end fighting in the Serbian province before winter endangers
thousands of refugees.
	   Despite those efforts, clashes between Serb forces and ethnic
Albanian secessionists continued for a third day in the Orahovac
area, 55 kilometers (34 miles), southwest of Pristina.
	   The Serb Media Center said police on Friday arrested 60
suspected members of the ethnic Albanian guerrilla force called the
Kosovo Liberation Army. The fighters were rounded up in the Prizren
area near the scene of the latest fighting.
	   Serb authorities said those arrested would be released if an
investigation revealed they had been pressured into joining the
KLA, which is fighting for independence from Serbia, the dominant
republic in Yugoslavia.
	   The offer appeared to be part of campaign by the government to
isolate KLA hard-liners, who oppose a negotiated settlement short
of full independence for the province.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population
of 2 million, are seeking greater autonomy. Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic has refused to grant independence, which is also
opposed by the United States and European powers. The Western
nations fear making Kosovo independent could spark conflict in
Macedonia and other neighboring areas that have large populations
of ethnic Albanians.
	   Both Milosevic and moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova have
agreed in principle to an interim formula granting Kosovo self-rule
without independence.
	   The formula, however, would provide for the two sides to review
the plan in three to five years, leaving the door open to another
arrangement. But the KLA has not endorsed the plan, which diplomats
say could take months to complete.
	   On Friday, Rugova said the U.S.-inspired formula ``is under
consideration'' as a way to ``normalize life'' and ``create
conditions for a lasting solution.''
	   Asked if the KLA would eventually accept the plan, Rugova said
he represents ``all residents of Kosovo,'' indicating he would seek
to build support among the Albanian community.
	   ``We have to do something to end the negative trends and prevent
an imminent tragedy for Kosovo, '' Rugova said.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged Milosevic to
call off the crackdown he launched against Albanian extremists on
Feb. 28. Russia, a traditional Serb ally, has made similar appeals.
	   On Friday, two top Russian foreign ministry officials _ Nikolai
Afanasyevsky and Igor Ivanov _ flew to Belgrade and met with the
Yugoslav president. Milosevic's office said the Russians reaffirmed
Moscow's interest in a peaceful solution.
	   The advent of winter in less than two months has added urgency
to efforts to end the conflict. More than 230,000 people have been
displaced by the fighting, and about 50,000 of them are camped in
woods and fields in appalling conditions.
	   On Friday, Hugh Parmer of the U.S. Agency for International
Development announced an additional dlrs 21.8 million in food aid
for Kosovo's refugees. This is in addition to the dlrs 11 million
already provided by the U.S. government.
	   Parmer, speaking in Belgrade after a visit to Kosovo, said the
next five weeks are crucial to saving thousands of lives. He
described having seen ``babies ... being fed crumbled bread mixed
with dirty water for lack of any other, women and children living
in homemade plastic tents ... houses and wheat fields burning.''
	   ``But, we cannot wait for the diplomats and politicians to
finish,'' he added. ``We have a responsibility to produce on the
ground so that women, children and elderly do not die of
starvation.''

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With the economy hanging in the balance, hard-line
lawmakers backed down Friday from confrontation with President
Boris Yeltsin, signaling they may be ready to compromise over who
will be Russia's next prime minister.
	   In a surprise move, the lower chamber of parliament voted 294-51
after just a brief discussion, postponing hearings on whether to
confirm acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin until Monday.
Opposition leaders said they would accept Yeltsin's invitation to
discuss the issue face to face before the vote.
	   ``A longer pause for contemplation is better than haste,''
Yeltsin's spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, said after the vote.
	   Yeltsin and the State Duma have been locked in battle for nearly
two weeks over Chernomyrdin's nomination while the economy has
decayed by the day.
	   The deterioration continued Friday, with the ruble dropping
another 21 percent and sharp price rises spurring consumer anxiety.
People were increasingly worried, but there no signs of unrest
	   ``I started to get worried today for the first time,'' said one
shopper, retired theater director Nina Vasilyeva. ``The idea of
stocking up hadn't even come into my head before. But groceries are
now twice as expensive. I'm buying things I don't need because
everybody's bought the rest.''
	   The political deadlock has deepened the economic crisis, with
the fear of instability eroding the ruble's value dramatically. The
official ruble rate fell Friday to 16.99 to the U.S. dollar, or 5.8
cents, down from 13.46 to the dollar, or 7.4 cents, on Thursday.
The street level was even lower.
	   The decision to postpone the vote on Chernomyrdin until Monday
indicated the hard-liners were no longer confident of winning their
confrontation with Yeltsin and may be looking for a way out. The
postponement was likely to boost Chernomyrdin's chances of
approval.
	   Chernomyrdin's position was strengthened Friday when the
Federation Council, the upper chamber of parliament, passed a
non-binding motion 91-17 expressing confidence in the acting
premier.
	   The vote was only symbolic, but it may increase pressure on the
Duma to find a compromise. The regional governors who make up the
Council have huge power and the vote signaled they would back
Yeltsin in a showdown.
	   Political leaders were expected to spend a second weekend trying
to reach a deal. A round of behind-the-scenes dealing a week ago
led to a pact in which Yeltsin agreed to cede some power to
parliament in return for lawmakers' confirmation of Chernomyrdin.
However, the deal was scuttled when the Duma's largest faction, the
Communists, backed out and the chamber then rejected Chernomyrdin
handily last Monday.
	   Since then the Communists and their hard-line allies have been
under pressure to compromise.
	   The Constitution gives Yeltsin the upper hand in choosing a
prime minister. He has three chances to propose a candidate, either
the same person or different people. If the Duma votes no three
times, the president can disband the legislature and call new
elections.
	   Yeltsin has said he will nominate no one other than
Chernomyrdin, whom he fired last spring after he served as prime
minister more than five years.
	   But late Friday, he also appeared prepared to make some
concessions. He sent a draft law to the Duma which would give them
a formal consultative role _ though not a veto _ over Cabinet
appointments. The law would require a Constitutional amendment, the
Interfax news agency reported.

China releases detained CBS producer

Chinese-born U.S. permanent resident STED Chinese citizen &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China released a CBS television producer Friday
after detaining her for two days, apparently because she was
working without government press credentials.
	   Natalie Liu, a Chinese-born U.S. permanent resident, was taken
in handcuffs from her home Wednesday as her children watched,
according to CBS staff members.
	   The Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Liu was
taken into custody because ``as a Chinese citizen, she has taken
part in activities that broke the law.'' It did not elaborate.
	   Liu, 32, had worked for CBS in Beijing for about a year, but she
was not officially registered as a journalist with the government.
China requires that journalists with foreign news organizations
first get approval and press credentials from the Foreign Ministry.
	   CBS spokeswoman in New York, Kim Achtar, said Liu had been kept
in good conditions and treated well before her release Friday
evening. She said Liu would return to the United States within the
next few days.
	   On Thursday, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing had raised Liu's case
with high-level Chinese officials, embassy spokesman Bill Palmer
said.
	   Reporters Without Borders, a Paris-based organization for the
defense of media freedom, protested Liu's detention in an open
letter Thursday to President Jiang Zemin, and urged him to secure
Liu's release.
	   The group said working without government approval ``is not a
crime that merits arrest, according to international standards.''
	   Liu's detention came before the arrival Sunday of Mary Robinson,
the U.N. high commissioner for human rights. The weeklong visit,
the first by a U.N. human rights chief, is expected to focus
attention on China's secretive judicial system and its restrictions
on basic freedoms, including strict controls on the media.

Iranian deputy president, culture minister assaulted by militants

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hard-line militants assaulted an Iranian
deputy president and the country's minister of culture and Islamic
guidance while the two men were leaving a prayer service in central
Tehran on Friday, witnesses said.
	   About 80 militants chanting ``Death to liberals!'' scuffled with
Deputy President Abdullah Nouri and Culture Minister Ataollah
Mohajerani as they were leaving Tehran University separately after
Friday prayers at about 2 p.m. local time (0930 GMT), witnesses
told The Associated Press.
	   The militants knocked off Nouri's white cleric turban and tore
open Mohajerani's shirt.
	   Both officials were slapped in the face, but neither appeared to
be seriously injured, the witnesses said. They said Mohajerani was
taken to hospital for treatment of what appeared to be a broken
finger.
	   A passerby said he saw about 10 people stop Nouri to talk to him
as he approached the university's eastern gate.
	   ``Then about 50 people converged on him and attacked him,'' said
the witness, who stood about 25 meters (28 yards) away.
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said some people tried
to protect Nouri from the militants and escorted him to a nearby
building.
	   ``I have nothing to say to those who attacked me. I apologize to
those who came to try to stop the attack,'' Nouri told the agency.
	   It is very rare for a clergyman, even a controversial one such
as Nouri, to be physically assaulted in Iran. Nouri was interior
minister until he was impeached in June.
	   The militants also assaulted the officials' bodyguards, said the
witnesses, who had attended the same prayer service. They spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   Mohajerani and Nouri are known to be close allies of President
Mohammad Khatami, who is widely perceived as a moderate.
	   Hard-liners regard Mohajerani and Nouri as liberals for their
relaxation of the strict social code that has been enforced in Iran
since the Islamic revolution of 1979.
	   The parliament, which is dominated by hard-liners, impeached
Nouri for allowing political gatherings and relaxing the Islamic
code.

Malta again ponders whether to anchor itself more to Europe

<TEXT>
	   VALLETTA, Malta (AP) _ In its second election in two years, this
Mediterranean crossroads is again searching for direction: Whether
to head closer to the European Union or go it alone.
	   Saturday's voting pits socialist Prime Minister Alfred Sant,
whose Labor Party government froze Malta's EU bid, against veteran
Nationalist leader Eddie Fenech Adami, who wants the island nation
firmly anchored to a sea of EU economic advantages.
	   After nine years of leadership by the arch-rival Nationalists,
Labor was returned to power in October 1996 with a one-seat edge in
parliament. But Sant was virtually forced to call for a new mandate
three years early after a string of resignations and the defection
on some important votes by one of his own, ex-socialist Premier Dom
Mintoff.
	   Majorities of one or two seats are common in the 65-seat
parliament.
	   With most of the nation's 370,000 inhabitants either diehard
Nationalists or Labor supporters, island politics is heated
business. On Thursday night, closing campaign rallies by both
candidates each drew tens of thousands of deliriously cheering,
horn-honking, flag-waving boosters.
	   Sant ``promised a lot of things, like removing the value added
tax (10 percent sales-and-services tax),'' said Anthony Azzopardi,
a textile exporter who said the Labor leader's slick,
American-style campaign in 1996 convinced him to abandon years of
Nationalist voting.
	   But new taxes and steeply raised utility rates, which
Harvard-educated, management specialist Sant imposed to battle a
budget deficit, have angered many Maltese.
	   Looking down from the capital's chalky ramparts at Fenech
Adami's rally, Azzopardi said he was going back to the
Nationalists.
	   ``I wish to be in the EU. We haven't got anything here. Even if
the EU gives us a penny it's good for us,'' said the businessman.
	   ``European Union membership would be the shot in the arm the
Maltese economy needs,'' said Fenech Adami in an interview Friday.
	   Sant's party, sensing that the Maltese might now be more open to
membership, is advocating a free trade area agreement with
Brussels.
	   Labor ``has not totally closed the door for any future
government to pursue full membership,'' the party's
secretary-general, Jimmy Magro, said. ``Malta is not ready''
economically to compete with full-fledged EU members for the common
market.
	   EU backers say membership would shower Malta with funds for
badly needed infrastructure such as roads and sewer lines.
	   But EU criteria would also mean tough medicine for many Maltese,
including manufacturers used to government subsidies and those who
work for the sprawling state sector.
	   Nationalist leaders were so confident about the 1990 membership
application, Maltese license plates were redesigned to carry the
circle-of-stars EU logo.
	   But after the 1996 Nationalist loss was widely attributed to
Maltese nervousness about sacrifices to join the Union, the party
called for a referendum to let the people say what they want.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Grief-stricken families from Europe
and the United States flew to the rocky coast of Nova Scotia Friday
to face the task of identifying remains pulled out of the Atlantic,
where Swissair Flight 111 crashed into fragments.
	   Canadian officials brought in the 200-foot (60-meter) submarine
HMCS Okanagan, and by midmorning had shifted gears from a massive
rescue operation to a search and salvage mission.
	   Rescue boats toiled all night in rough seas off the fishing
village of Peggy's Cove, scouring for bodies and remnants of the
MD-11 jumbo jet that crashed Wednesday night after its pilots
reported smoke in the cockpit.
	   ``There's a lot more debris and apparently, unfortunately
partial human remains that were not evident yesterday coming to
light today,'' said Sgt. Keith McGuire.
	   The submarine began mapping the ocean floor with sonar at 5 a.m.
(0800 GMT).
	   ``We have not yet received any signal yet from the body of the
aircraft,'' said Benoit Bouchard, head of the Transportation Safety
Board of Canada. ``Last night, investigators did not have much to
look at. That should come soon, today or tomorrow, if we get the
black boxes.''
	   Officials hope to find the plane's flight recorders to help them
determine the cause of the crash, which killed 229 people,
including 132 Americans.
	   Investigators also plan to listen to a tape of the final
conversation between the pilot of Flight 111 and the air traffic
control tower in Moncton, New Brunswick.
	   Benoit said large parts of the plane may still be intact
underwater since only about a fourth of the bodies have been found.
	   However, nothing larger than the size of a car has been found so
far, said Lt. Cmdr. Jacques Fauteux, spokesman for the Canadian
rescue operation. The debris _ a sad array that included ripped
clothing, wallets, baby bottles and seat cushions _ was scattered
over seven square miles of oil-slicked ocean.
	   The plane apparently hit the water at a very high speed,
breaking the plane and its occupants into small parts, Swiss
officials said.
	   ``The condition of the bodies is such that the biggest body part
is a baby,'' said Philippe Bruggisser, head of Swissair's parent
company SAirGroup.
	   Officials estimated that 60 bodies had been recovered and taken
to a morgue at a military base outside Halifax. They said none
appeared to be burned, indicating there was no explosion or large
fire.
	   Body parts were washing up along a wide section of the rugged
coastline Friday and about 100 Canadian soldiers were brought to
search 60 miles (100 kilometers) of the coast.
	   Authorities sealed off Peggy's Cove _ a village of 60 people _
and set up tents complete with food, drinks and counselors to
accommodate the hundreds of relatives flying in. A secluded area
was created so mourners could look out over the ocean and watch
boats and aircraft pursue the search.
	   Between 200 and 300 family members were expected Friday on
flights from Switzerland and New York. Swissair has offered dlrs
20,000 in immediate aid to each family.
	   The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration had issue two
directives concerning possible wiring problems on MD-11 planes like
the one that crashed.
	   The FAA had warned in June 1997 about a wiring problem in the
cockpit of MD-11 planes that, if left uncorrected, could cause a
fire and make it difficult to fly the craft. It ordered that U.S.
airlines fix the problem in six months.
	   On Friday, Bruggisser said Swissair had made the necessary
changes _ which he described as minor _ in March 1997, months
before the FAA order.
	   A year earlier, in March 1996, the FAA called for a cable guard
to be installed to separate the plane's flight control cables from
the electrical wiring in the rear of the plane.
	   It was not immediately known how Swissair responded to that
directive, which also was not mandatory for foreign airlines.
Spokesman Roland Breitler said the airline routinely complies with
all directives.

announced Friday.
	   The film festival is scheduled to begin Sept. 16 with 10 days of

Microelectronics plant to close with loss of 600 jobs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A Japanese-owned microchip plant in northeastern
England will close in December with the loss of 600 jobs, managers
said Friday. The Fujitsu plant in Newton Aycliffe opened in 1991 in
an area struggling with high unemployment.
	   ``The decision to close the ... plant is a painful one and we do
so soberly and with sincere concern for those who will be
affected,'' the company said in a statement.
	   Company officials blamed the worldwide ``tumultuous adverse
conditions'' in the high technology industrial sector, which also
led to the announcement six weeks ago that a Siemens microchip
plant in north England was to close with the loss of 1,100 jobs.
	   Fujitsu, which has 300 plants worldwide, has also been hurt by
the Asian financial crisis, officials said. The microchip industry
was one of the mainstays of the Japanese economy, but it has
suffered as Asian economies crumble.
	   British government officials are planning an aide package to
help market the plant and retrain workers. The plant is located in
Prime Minister Tony Blair's parliamentary constituency.

Bill proposing new rights for unmarried couples under fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The conservative Rally for the Republic party on
Friday expressed its ``most acute concern'' about a bill that could
lead to legal recognition for unmarried heterosexuals and
homosexuals.
	   In a statement, President Jacques Chirac's party described the
bill as ``a decisive step toward the creation of a substitute for
marriage and a parody of the family.''
	   The bill _ known as the Civil Solidarity Pact _ is due to go
before parliament on October 9.
	   Supporters of the bill, including several pressure groups, met
Friday with Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's advisers to discuss the
text. Spokesman Jean-Paul Pouliquen said the text _ which Jospin is
expected to unveil next week _ was satisfactory.
	   ``The government seems to agree to most of our demands that
we've been pushing for for seven years,'' Pouliquen said.
	   ``Rather than reaching a compromise, we're heading for the
adoption of a law that will concretely change the daily lives of
millions of people, among them homosexuals,'' he added.
	   Although the exact nature of the bill is not yet known, it is
expected to include tax and inheritance benefits. Some government
officials have said it could cost the state 4-6 billion francs
(dlrs 667 million-1 billion) per year.
	   The prospect of the bill prompted some 12,000 mayors, mainly
from the French right, to sign a petition in May, saying they
feared it would lead to the legalization of homosexual marriage.
	   Opponents of the bill, from both the left and the right, also
argue that it will be difficult to prove whether people applying
for the benefits are in fact living together as a couple, and not
simply as roommates.
	   French gay groups that backed the left's election victory in
June 1997 have complained that the Socialist-led government has
been dragging its feet on getting the legislation through
parliament.

Tajik opposition bodyguard found dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ A bodyguard for an opposition leader
was found dead Friday, seven days after he was kidnapped by
unidentified gunmen.
	   Mukhiddin Zamonov was shot to death, said Sulton Khamadov,
spokesman for the United Tajik Opposition. His body was found
Friday in a water reservoir in the capital Dushanbe.
	   One suspect has confessed to killing Zamonov and another is
wanted by police. Both suspects are officers in an Interior
Ministry brigade, said Khudoikul Khamrakulov, deputy minister of
security.
	   A former opposition fighter, Zamonov was among 40 bodyguards who
protected the opposition leader, Said Abdullo Nuri.
	   Tajikistan has been wracked by violence following the five-year
civil war that ended with a 1997 peace agreement. In spite of the
accord, there are periodic clashes between the hard-line
government's forces and the mostly Islamic opposition, as well as
turf battles between renegade fighters who do not recognize the
peace deal.

U.S.-Russian talks on plutonium to begin this month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ U.S. and Russian experts will open talks in Moscow
later this month to elaborate a bilateral agreement on ridding each
country of 50 tons of weapons-grade plutonium from old nuclear
warheads, the acting minister of atomic energy said Friday.
	   President Boris Yeltsin and his American counterpart Bill
Clinton signed a protocol on Wednesday that provided for the spent
plutonium to be withdrawn from each nation's military program,
processed and used for peaceful purposes in nuclear power plants.
	   ``A political decision came ahead of the technical readiness, so
specialists will have to quickly choose technologies for handling
the war plutonium,'' acting Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov
said Friday, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Adamov said that use of the plutonium in nuclear power plants
would require capital investment of far more than dlrs 1 billion.
	   He said that ``in this case, the financing will be done by the
American side.
	   ``The payment will be done by the one who thinks that the
political goal justifies the capital investments,'' ITAR-Tass
quoted him as saying.

Television reports accident at nuclear plant but spokesman plays
</HEADLINE>
down &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The Czech Institute for Nuclear
Safety said a worker received radioactive contamination Friday at a
Czech nuclear plant, a television station reported. A plant
spokesman said the dose was not serious.
	   TV Nova, citing an institute statement, said one man was
``contaminated and radiated'' in an ``internal control area'' of
the Dukovany nuclear plant, 250 kilometers (155 miles) east of
Prague.
	   The report gave no further details except to say there was no
leak of contaminated materials outside the plant.
	   Plant spokesman Betr Spilka said there was no accident but that
one of five men cleaning tanks used for holding radioactive water
showed radiation levels 15 times higher than the others.
	   But he said the levels on the worker were below those considered
normal for medical X-rays.
	   He said the dose received Friday amounted to 15 percent of the
level receivable in one year according to valid international
regulations for nuclear plant workers.
	   The nuclear safety institute was closed for the weekend by the
time the report was broadcast and officials could not be reached
for comment.

Brazilian auto makers shake slump
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's slumping car industry rallied
sharply in August to post its best month of the year, auto makers
said Friday.
	   Sales of Brazilian-made cars, trucks and buses rose to 133,900
in August, a 51 percent increase from July, the National
Association of Automobile Manufacturers said.
	   Thanks to higher sales, production also jumped in August to
144,400 units, up 5 percent from July, the association said.
	   Despite the increase, though, the industry still hasn't fully
recovered since a sudden rise in taxes and interest rates last
November, amid a crisis in Asian markets.
	   Compared to a year ago, August sales were down 12 percent. In
the first eight months, they were off 25 percent from the same
period in 1997.
	   Production also was down compared to last year _ 25 percent in
August and 17 percent over the first eight months.
	   Despite weak exports in August, due in part to a dockworkers
strike, foreign sales in the first eight months were 11.25 percent
higher than in the same period last year.
	   But the current global financial turmoil could hurt Brazilian
exports to Latin America, said Association president Jose Carlos da
Silveira Pinheiro Neto. He cited the threat of currency
devaluations in neighboring countries, while the Brazilian real is
tied to the dollar.
	   Pinheiro Neto wouldn't risk a prediction for September, but it
seems unlikely the industry can match its 2-million-unit output of
1997.

Sudan issues flood alert along the Nile
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudanese radio issued a flood alert
Friday for citizens living along the Nile, saying the upper reaches
of the river had risen to unprecedented levels.
	   The state-run radio said people living along the Blue Nile and
the river north of Khartoum _ the confluence of the White and Blue
Niles _ should be ``alert and cautious.''
	   ``Water volumes in the upper parts of the river branches,
particularly the Blue Nile, have reached levels that exceeded all
previously recorded levels,'' the radio said.
	   Heavy rain and flooding have already destroyed 229 houses in
Khartoum and 118 houses in neighboring Omdurman, reports said here.
	   Minister of Interior Abdel-Raheem Mohamed Hussein and Finance
Minister Abdel-Wahab Osman are currently in the northern city of
Dongola to assess floods damage and the assistance required for
more than 20 villages that have been cut off by floods.

Paraguay's Chilavert threatening to quit national team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) _ Upset over political developments at
home, Paraguay's Jose Luis Chilavert is threatening to quit his
country's national team.
	   Considered by some to be the best goalkeeper in the world,
Chilavert is upset over a decision which named former Paraguayan
general Lino Oviedo head of the organizing committee for the Copa
America, which Paraguay is hosting next year.
	   ``For now, I'm not sure if I will continue with the national
team,'' Chilavert told a local radio station late Thursday. ``I'm
very disappointed with the selection of Oviedo. Everyone knows he's
not exactly a democrat.''
	   Oviedo's release from jail several weeks ago sparked political
chaos in the country only three days into new President Raul Cubas'
term. He was convicted of rebellion by a military tribunal and
sentenced to 10 years in jail. Former President Juan Carlos Wasmosy
charged at the time Oviedo was attempting a coup.
	   ``I'm disappointed with President Raul Cubas and how he freed
Oviedo,'' Chilavert said. ``It's a bad example for the kids.''
	   Despite protest from members of his own party and the
opposition, Cubas signed a presidential decree to overturn the
sentence handed down to his former running mate.
	   Chilavert is known for his outspokeness, particularly when his
searing comments are directed at opponents. This isn't the first
time he's voiced his displeasure with his country's politicians.
	   Earlier this year, after firing off some disparaging remarks
about Wasmosy, Chilavert was left off the roster of several
national team friendly matches before the World Cup.

Brazil revamps soccer team after Cup loss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil has a brand new soccer
team, and Ronaldo isn't on it _ at least yet.
	   New coach Wanderley Luxemburgo unveiled a roster on Friday that
had little in common with the Brazilian World Cup team. Most of the
22 players have never played on the national team before.
	   Their first test will be against Yugoslavia on Sept. 23, in the
northeastern city of Sao Luis.
	   Only four players are back from the team that lost the World Cup
final 3-0 to France last July 12. The returnees are Denilson,
Rivaldo, Cafu and Emerson.
	   Ronaldo of Inter Milan wasn't called because he's out of shape
after vacation in Brazil. But Luxemburgo says he plans to call the
two-time FIFA Player of the Year in the future.
	   Defenders Roberto Carlos and Junior Baiano also may get another
chance. But Luxemburgo is looking for younger players to replace
veterans Taffarel, Aldair, Dunga, Cesar Sampaio and Bebeto.
	   His squad is heavy with promising youngsters from the Brazilian
first-division championship. The idea is to prepare a squad for the
2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia.
	   ``We mixed World Cup players and players just coming up,'' he
said at a news conference. ``We want to give priority to young
players.''
	   Newcomers Pedrinho, Felipe and Odvan are from Vasco da Gama of
Rio, the defending national and Copa Libertadores champion. Three
others _ Cris, Vampeta and Marcelinho _ play for Corinthians of Sao
Paulo, which is coached by Luxemburgo.
	   But Luxemburgo also gave a few veterans a new chance. Among them
are Muller, who played in the World Cups of 1986 and 1990, and
fullbacks Cleber and Antonio Carlos.
	   Only five players were called from abroad: Cafu and Antonio
Carlos of Roma; Denilson of Betis; Rivaldo of Barcelona and Emerson
of Bayer Leverkusen.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Roster &QC; 
	   Goalkeepers: Andre (Internacional), Rogerio (Sao Paulo)
	   Defenders: Cafu (Roma), Felipe (Vasco), Serginho (Sao Paulo),
Cris (Corinthians), Antonio Carlos (Roma), Cleber (Palmeiras),
Odvan (Vasco)
	   Midfielders: Alexandre (Sao Paulo), Alex (Palmeiras), Rogerio

Richardson pledges to hold up spare parts if requests are
</HEADLINE>
frivolous &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The head of the U.N. program that allows
Iraq to sell oil in return for humanitarian aid urged the Security
Council on Friday to quickly approve contracts to improve Iraq's
oil industry, saying failure to do so would seriously jeopardize
the program.
	   A U.N. report this week concluded that Iraq was only expected to
export a little more than half of the dlrs 5.2 billion in oil it's
allowed to sell over six months because of its outdated pumping
equipment and low oil prices.
	   Of that, only about dlrs 1.79 billion is expected to be spent on
humanitarian goods for the second half of the year.
	   Iraq has blamed the United States and Britain for holding up the
spare parts contracts to improve its oil infrastructure _ a charge
U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson acknowledged on Friday.
	   ``We're ready to approve oil spare parts contracts, provided
that they deal with improving the oil efficiency delivery system
for the Iraqi people to get humanitarian assistance,'' Richardson
said. ``For other purposes, we will not approve them, frivolous
purposes.''
	   Iraq has been barred from selling oil _ its economic mainstay _
on the open market since sweeping U.N. sanctions were imposed after
Baghdad invaded Kuwait in 1990. The Security Council established
the oil-for-food program in 1996 to provide food and medicine to
Iraq's 22 million people hurt by the sanctions.
	   In February, the council agreed to raise the amount of oil Iraq
could sell from dlrs 2.1 billion to dlrs 5.2 billion to better meet
its humanitarian needs. In the spring, it agreed to let Iraq buy
dlrs 300 million in spare parts to help it reach the new export
ceiling.
	   Benon Sevan, executive director of the oil-for-food program,
urged the council to approve spare parts contracts more quickly to
boost exports. If it fails to do so, the credibility and effective
implementation of the program could be affected.
	   Most spare parts contracts have been put on hold because the
purchase wasn't ``directly related to the repair of Iraq's oil
infrastructure for the purpose of increasing exports,'' Sevan said.
	   In remarks to reporters afterwards, Sevan noted that the
oil-for-food program was never intended to take care of all of
Iraq's humanitarian needs. Nor could it possibly overhaul Iraq's
entire oil industry _ a project that would require dlrs 1 or 2
billion, he said.
	   ``It's a temporary program to alleviate the situation of the
Iraqi civilians ... during a rather difficult and very rigorous
sanctions regime,'' he said. ``It was never meant to take care of
all the needs of the Iraqi people.''
	   Richardson blamed delays in implementing the program on
inefficiencies on the Iraqi side.
	   ``In many instances, (Iraq) does not cooperate with the U.N.
oil-for-food administrators and continues to use the humanitarian
issue as a political weapon,'' Richardson said.

Four more Spaniards ousted; Novotna, Seles advance

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Spanish flavor is radidly disappearing from
the U.S. Open.
	   Two of the four Spaniards seeded in the men's singles were
ousted earlier in the week. On Friday, four other Spaniards
followed them out of the year's final Grand Slam tournament in
second-round matches.
	   Felix Mantilla was beaten by 13th-seeded Tim Henman of Britain
6-3, 5-7, 7-5, 6-4; Francisco Clavet fell to Germany's Nicolas
Kiefer 6-4, 7-6 (7-3), 6-1; Sergi Bruguera lost to Germany's Oliver
Gross 6-1, 6-3, 6-4, and Fernando Vicente was defeated by Byron
Black of Zimbabwe 7-6 (7-4), 6-1, 7-5.
	   ``I was in a few difficult situations and was able to come
through,'' Henman said.
	   The Spanish slide extended into the women's singles, where Gala
Leon Garcia lost to Nathalie Dechy of France 6-4, 6-4 in the third
round.
	   ``I am not playing very good and my mind is not the same as it
used to be,'' said Bruguera, who once was ranked as high as No. 3
on the ATP Tour. ``I lose motivation a little bit and sense of
fight, but I want to recover this. I expect to recover.''
	   Not having any problems joining Dechy in the fourth round were
Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna and sixth-seeded Monica Seles.
Novotna, seeded third and seeking her second straight Grand Slam
tournament title, defeated Sandrine Testud of France 6-2, 6-3,
while Seles, who has won twice here at the National Tennis Center,
but not since 1992, pounded her way past Annie Miller of Midland,
Mich., 6-3, 6-3.
	   ``I've been able to turn my game a couple of notches to win,''
Seles said. ``I played some solid tennis out there today.''
	   In other men's second-round matches, No. 5 Richard Krajicek
eliminated Alex O'Brien of the United States 6-1, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2
and No. 11 Yevgeny Kafelnikov stopped Tommy Haas of Germany 7-5,
6-2, 1-6, 7-5.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hard-line militants assaulted an Iranian
deputy president and the minister of culture and Islamic guidance
as they left a prayer service in central Tehran on Friday,
witnesses said.
	   About 80 militants chanting ``Death to liberals!'' scuffled with
Deputy President Abdollah Nouri and Culture Minister Ataollah
Mohajerani as they were separately leaving Tehran University after
Friday prayers at about 2 p.m. local time (0930 GMT), witnesses
told The Associated Press.
	   The militants knocked off Nouri's white cleric turban and tore
open Mohajerani's shirt.
	   Both officials were slapped in the face, but neither appeared to
be seriously injured, the witnesses said.
	   A passerby said he saw Mohajerani's wife, who is a presidential
advisor, shouting at the militants ``Stop it! Leave him alone!
you're killing him!''
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said some people tried
to protect Mohajerani and called an ambulance to get him away.
	   Witnesses said the minister went to hospital with a suspected
broken finger. His condition could not be confirmed late Friday.
	   Another passerby said he saw about 10 people stop Nouri to talk
to him as he approached the university's eastern gate.
	   ``Then about 50 people converged on him and attacked him,'' said
the witness, who stood about 25 meters (28 yards) away.
	   People also tried to protect Nouri from the militants and
escorted him to a nearby building, the news agency reported.
	   ``I have nothing to say to those who attacked me. I apologize to
those who came to try to stop the attack,'' Nouri told the agency.
	   It is very rare for a clergyman, even a controversial one such
as Nouri who was impeached in June, to be physically assaulted in
Iran.
	   The militants also assaulted the officials' bodyguards, said the
witnesses, some of whom had attended the prayer service. They spoke
on condition of anonymity.
	   Mohajerani and Nouri are known to be close allies of President
Mohammad Khatami.
	   Hard-liners regard Mohajerani and Nouri, who was interior
minister until his impeachment, as liberals for their relaxation of
the strict social code that has been enforced in Iran since the
Islamic revolution of 1979.
	   The parliament, which is dominated by hard-liners, impeached
Nouri for allowing political gatherings and relaxing the Islamic
code.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia has advised athletes and
visitors, numbering about 75,000, not to be worried by rumors
spread on the Internet about their safety, a news report said
Friday.
	   The Minister of Youth and Sports, Muhyiddin Yassin said these
rumors were spread by irresponsible people.
	   Preparations are in full swing to make the 16th Commonwealth
Games in Malaysia a great success, he told reporters after visiting
the Main Press Center for the Games.
	   Muhyiddin said some foreigners had become concerned over reports
on the Internet that the Games would be chaotic following the turn
of political events in the country.
	   He was referring to the dismissal of the Deputy Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Wednesday.

Polish slave laborers who worked in Austria may receive

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Poles who worked as slave laborers for
the Nazis in Austria during World War II will be able to claim
pension benefits under an Austrian-Polish accord to be signed next
week, it was announced Friday.
	   Social Minister Leonore Hostasch told Austrian television that
the Social Insurance Agreement between the two countries will ``in
effect benefit this disadvantaged group.''
	   The accord is expected to be signed next week when Austrian
President Thomas Klestil visits Warsaw.
	   Under the agreement, she said Polish slave laborers or their
heirs will be able to claim benefits for the time they worked in
Austria if they were registered here.
	   Austrian television estimated that 130,000 Polish civilians and
28,000 prisoners of war were transported to Austria as slave
laborers during the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler.

Bucharest to host glittering festival of music and song
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIHAELA ARMASELU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Who says that Bucharest, in its heyday
the Paris of the East, has forgotten that life is a celebration of
music and song? Not Yehudi Menuhin, for sure.
	   And not Spanish mezzo-soprano Tereza Berganza, U.S. soprano
Barbara Hendricks or Israeli violinist Shlomo Mintz. All three will
perform at the two-week George Enesecu Festival which opens Sunday.
	   ``The great treasures and traditions of Eastern European music
are superbly represented by the Enescu Festival,'' Menuhin said in
a statement, shortly before the festival opened.
	   Menuhin, the famous American-born violinist comes to the
festival, his third time in Romania, as its director. He studied
the violin with Enescu and said the Romanian composer deeply
influenced his artistic development.
	   ``How delighted that most modest of men, my great teacher, would
have been to learn that there is a wonderful festival dedicated to
him!'' Menuhin raved.
	   This former Communist country long prided itself on its talented
artists and love of culture. On Friday, tickets were almost sold
out, despite their relatively high cost for Romania, where the
average monthly salary equals dlrs 110.
	   In a sign of their commitment to international culture,
Romania's cash-strapped government and national radio and
television spent lei 34 billion (almost dlrs 4 million) to host the
hundreds of soloists, choir singers and musicians.
	   Even Bucharest has been prettying itself up for the deluge of
international artists.
	   The Romanian Athenaeum, built in 1880 and featured in Olivia
Manning's Balkan trilogy and other books about Romania's glittering
period between the world wars, was battered by bullets during the
anti-communist revolt in 1989.
	   Now, after several years of costly restoration, its dome once
again gleams and its yellow sandstone facade stands in resplendent
harmony opposite Romania's former royal palace on a central
Bucharest square.
	   ``We had to re-offer this house to music because when hearing
music, we are closer to God,'' Culture Minister Ion Caramitru said.
	   Romanians are very proud of their cultural personalities,
including Romanian-born absurdist playwright Eugene Ionesco,
sculptor Constantin Brancusi, pianist Dinu Lipatti and the new
star, soprano Angela Gheorghiu.
	   Since February, when the tickets went on sale, Romanians have
almost exhausted the season-tickets which go for 900,000 lei (dlrs
100) or just short of the average monthly salary. A single ticket
costs from 40 to 90,000 lei (dlrs 4.4 to 10)
	   Enescu's opera Oedipe will open the festival. Romanian-born
American conductor Lawrence Foster will conduct France's national
orchestra.
	   Oedipe will be performed by the American bass-baritone Monte
Pederson and American soprano Karan Armstrong will play Iocasta.
	   George Enescu, also known as Georges Enesco, composed Oedipe in
1936. Considered one of the musical geniuses of this century,
Enescu began studying the violin at the age of 4 and entered the
Vienna Conservatory when he was 7.
	   Six years later he entered the Paris Conservatoire where he was
taught by French composers Jules Massenet and Gabriel Faure.
	   He made his debut as a conductor in 1923 in New York and between
1937-1938 he conducted New York Philharmonic Orchestra.
	   Enescu wrote two rhapsodies, a symphonic suite, three symphonies
and other chamber music works, in several musical styles.
	   Foster, who will conduct Paul McCartney's Standing Stone in its
Romanian debut, said in a recent news conference that musicians
will pay tribute ``not only to Enescu, (...) but to the spirit of
Enescu.''
	   The first edition of Enescu festival was in 1958 and the
Romanian government decided last year that it would take place
every three years.
	   Among the 12 orchestras, performing at the festival, are the
British Broadcasting Corporation Symphony Orchestra, the Chicago
Symphony Orchestra, and Orquestra Simfonica de Barcelona.
	   ``There is a huge effort but each second of work was worth it,''
said Mihai Constantinescu, head of Artexim, the company which
organized the festival.
	   Two days before the festival, some 30 Romanians braved rain and
stood in line for the remaining tickets.
	   Fittingly, for the genteel atmosphere of the festival, there
were no reports of tickets being sold on the black market.

Romanian tennis star misses fatal Swissair flight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ But for an unexpected loss at the U.S.
Open, Romanian tennis star Dinu Pescariu would have been on the
Swissair flight that crashed in Canada, killing all aboard, a
Bucharest newspaper reported Friday.
	   Pescariu was defeated Monday by Dutch player Jan Siemerink 6-4,
6-3, 6-0, and left the United States a day earlier than planned and
returned to Romania.
	   ``I haven't gotten over the shock,'' Romanian tennis federation
official, Alexe Bardan, told the newspaper National. Bardan said
Pescariu had asked him to reserve a ticket on the Wednesday evening
Geneva-bound flight.
	   ``Pescariu should have been on the Wednesday evening flight,''
he told the paper. ``Who knows why, he got a ticket a day earlier.
Maybe it was meant to be.''
	   Pescariu, who has made no comment, was reported as being in a
state of shock. He is due to play in an upcoming dlrs 50,000
Transylvanian tennis tournament.
	   Pescariu was not the only tennis star who was supposed to have
been on the Swissair flight SR111.
	   Swiss tennis star Marc Rosset and his coach were booked on the
flight. But Rosset changed his reservation at the last minute.
	   ``But when we were in the hotel, Marc said he wanted to stay an
extra day after all,'' his coach Pierre Simsolo said. ``I will be
eternally grateful to him,'' he told the Swiss sports agency.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Curiosity-seekers and journalists
were warned to not interfere Friday as authorities groped for clues
to the crash of Swissair Flight 111 and provided a somber welcome
for grieving relatives arriving from abroad.
	   The search for debris and bodies in grey waters off the rocky
Nova Scotia coast proved frustrating. A Canadian navy submarine
equipped with high-tech sonar failed to locate the jumbo jet's
vital flight-data recorders, and tides dispersed the debris over a
wide area, even washing up body parts on beaches.
	   Only at midday did search coordinators formally state what had
seemed clear since Wednesday night _ that there were no survivors
among the 229 people on board the New York-to-Geneva flight.
	   That announcement, coupled with the failure thus far to find the
plane's fuselage or flight recorders, gave authorities only
discouraging news to offer scores of family members arriving in
Halifax from Europe and the United States.
	   ``It was important for the victims' families, for whom it is
only natural to hold out one last hope, that we did everything
which could possibly be done to find survivors,'' said Rear Adm.
Dusty Miller, one of the search commanders. ``There is no longer a
last hope.''
	   The first chartered plane carrying mourners flew in from New
York with about 175 family members, grief counselors and airline
staff. Another plane was arriving from Switzerland.
	   At search headquarters in the fishing village of Peggy's Cove,
authorities set up a row of green army tents overlooking the ocean
to provide some privacy for family members if they visit the site.
	   Muriel Provost of the regional Red Cross said the relatives had
suffered a double trauma _ first learning of their loved ones'
deaths, then having to board a plane themselves.
	   ``That must have been a very painful experience for some of
them,'' she said.
	   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said it would help arrange
press briefings by relatives willing to make statements, but warned
journalists not to intrude on those who wished to be left alone.
	   ``If anyone forces themselves on family members, it won't be
tolerated,'' said Staff Sgt. Keith McGuire.
	   McGuire also said police were becoming exasperated with members
of the public, both on shore and in boats, venturing into the
search area to look for debris. He said such intruders faced arrest
and seizure of their boats if they disobeyed orders to stay out.
	   Officials have stopped the body count at estimates of about 60,
largely because they are recovering only parts of bodies, rather
than full corpses.
	   ``It's a very grisly scene out there,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Glenn
Chamberlain, one of the search coordinators.
	   He said debris from the plane was spreading steadily further
from the center of the search, around a buoy whose top was sheared
off as the plane crashed.
	   ``We can't contain the debris,'' he said. ``All we can do is try
to find it.''
	   Joining the search were divers, spotter planes, and about 100
Canadian soldiers combing the shoreline.
	   Searchers have yet to find any piece of wreckage larger than the
roof of a car, raising concern that a full reconstruction of the
MD-11 jumbo jet might be impossible.
	   ``If we do not find more than what we have today, there's no
talking about any kind of reconstruction,'' said Benoit Bouchard of
the Canadian Transportation Safety Board.
	   Investigators were reviewing a tape of the final conversation
between the pilot of Flight 111 and the air traffic control tower
in Moncton, New Brunswick.
	   The MD-11 dropped off radar screens about 90 minutes after
leaving New York's Kennedy International Airport on its way to
Geneva.
	   After a normal takeoff, the crew reported smoke in the cockpit
and decided to turn back to Boston. When they spoke to Canadian
controllers in Moncton, they were told the Halifax airport was much
closer. The plane never made it to Halifax, crashing into the ocean
30 miles (50 kilometers) to the south after dumping much of its
fuel.
	   Philippe Bruggisser, chief of Swissair's parent SAirGroup,
refused to speculate on the causes of the smoke or the accident
pending the recovery of the plane's flight recorder.
	   ``It could take days, weeks _ or in the worst case _ months,''
Bruggisser said.
	   The voice recorder beacon from the crashed jet was not emitting
signals in the water, meaning it will likely take longer to find
the device as well as the flight and flight-data recorders,
Bruggisser said.
	   There was no indication the crash resulted from sabotage or a
terrorist act, but investigators were not ruling anything out. The
RCMP called in explosives experts to examine debris for signs of a
possible bomb blast.

Back to work: Norman takes first swing since April

 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JACKSONVILLE, Florida (AP) _ The first full swing was nothing
like the last one 147 days ago.
	   Greg Norman quietly returned to golf Friday, hitting balls for
the first time since he missed the cut at the Masters and then had
shoulder surgery that caused him to miss three major championships
and the rest of the PGA Tour season.
	   Norman hit about 100 balls at Medalist Golf Club and reported no
pain in his left shoulder.
	   ``It went OK,'' the 43-year-old Australian said from his home in
Hobe Sound, Florida. ``There were no problems, and I knew there
wouldn't be anyway. I've been doing all the right things and I've
been disciplined in my rehabilitation. My body is stronger since I
can remember.''
	   On a hot, steamy morning in south Florida, Norman loosened up
with about 30 pitch shots, took about 70 full swings with nothing
more than a 9-iron, then finished his first day back at work with
10 three-quarter swings with a 7-iron.
	   ``It's like riding a bike,'' he said.
	   It was a sharp change from the last time Norman struck a ball,
when thousands lined the 18th fairway at Augusta National and
gasped when he barely got his tee shot airborne in the second round
of the Masters.
	   Norman, who had withdrawn from The Players Championship two
weeks earlier because of a sore shoulder, missed the cut after
rounds of 76-78. He had arthroscopic surgery on his shoulder April
22, which forced him out of the game for the longest time since he
was a 15-year-old beach bum on the Queensland coast of Australia.
	   ``I was excited this morning when I came back,'' Norman said.
	   Buddy Antonopoulos, the head pro at Medalist, and Tony Navarro,
Norman's longtime caddie who has been working for Jeff Sluman this
year, joined him for a practice session that lasted just more than
an hour.
	   Antonopoulos took one look at Norman's swing and pronounced him
fit for tournament play in 10 days.
	   Norman won't return until his Shark Shootout Nov. 9 in Thousand
Oaks, California. He plans to work himself back into shape slowly,
hoping to hit a 5-iron by next week and the driver in a couple of
weeks.
	   ``He looked great,'' Antonopoulus said. ``It doesn't look like
he has missed a beat. It was a good start, and it's great to have
him back in the game. The world of golf has missed him.''
	   But Norman says he didn't miss golf.
	   He spent the summer with his family, going to the Bahamas, fly
fishing in Colorado and shopping in New York, whatever they wanted
to do. It was the first time since his children were born _ Morgan
Leigh is 15, Gregory is 12 _ that they called the shots.
	   ``Every summer since they've been alive, they've been on the
road with me,'' Norman said.
	   While Lee Janzen was winning his second U.S. Open, Norman was
tending to his new golf course in northern California. When Mark
O'Meara was becoming the oldest player to win two majors in one
year at the blustery British Open, Norman was home watching on
television.
	   And while Norman penciled in Friday as his return to practice,
he wasn't counting the days.
	   ``I got my life back,'' Norman said. ``I looked back at what
happened on golf in television, and I don't want to go back to the
same old mundane routine. As I said to Tony, next year we're going
to have fun and enjoy the game again.''
	   Still, Norman says he expects his competitive juices to start
flowing next month when he starts playing full rounds at Medalist
and ringing up some 66s, knowing that his return to tournament golf
is drawing near with the Presidents Cup in Australia just around
the corner.
	   ``My passion is still high,'' he said. ``My competitive drive
and passion for golf has not diminished one bit.''
	   He has played just 19 1/2 competitive rounds this year, most of
that overseas. Norman began the year ranked No. 1 in the world and
has slipped to No. 12. He still feels he has more majors left in
him, and part of him can't wait to get started.
	   ``I know I'm going to come back physically stronger,'' said
Norman, who has added seven pounds (3.2 kilos) of muscle during the
layoff. ``I've gotten myself into a position I haven't been in
since the early '80s. I'm swinging the golf club without pain, and
hopefully I've got my power back.''
	   It won't be long before golf has Norman back.

Missionaries: Death toll in Congo massacre reaches 633
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Searchers have now recovered 633 bodies from an Aug.
24 massacre in warring eastern Congo, an Italian missionary news
service said Friday.
	   The killers attacked a Catholic mission and nearby villages in a
remote area near Uvira in Congo's South Kivu province. First
reports put the number of dead at 37 _ a priest, three nuns, a
seminary student and dozens of refugees crowded into the mission to
escape fighting in Congo's rebellion.
	   The toll as reported by missionary organizations topped 200 last
week; Friday, the Misna missionary service said 633 bodies had now
been found across a wide area.
	   Missonaries blamed Congo's rebels for the attack, which Pope
John Paul II publicly condemned. Misna said the victims were killed
for supporting government forces in the fight against rebels
battling to bring down President Laurent Kabila.
	   The rebel Congolese Democratic movement denied responsibility,
and said bandits were to blame.

 &UR; Crayola Boxes Feature Students' Art
	   JOHNSON CITY, Tennessee (AP) _ Artist Brittany Caldwell, a fan
of Vincent van Gogh, appreciates his use of color. And like van
Gogh, people can see her artwork across the country.
	   But it's not necessary to make a trip to a museum or gallery.
Brittany's creative vision can be found on boxes of Crayola colored
pencils.
	   ``I think it was pretty cool to see my artwork on a box,'' the
10-year-old said Friday.
	   Brittany, a fifth-grader at Andrew Johnson Elementary School, is
one of 10 students who were selected to help commemorate Crayola's
10th anniversary of the colored pencils.
	   She and her parents have already bought a case of the 12-pencil
boxes, which feature her jungle-themed drawing.
	   ``I think it's sort of fun to mix colors and make things,'' said
Brittany, who has been drawing since she was 4 or 5.
	   Brittany loves van Gogh and has traveled with her family to
Washington, Los Angeles and Chicago to see his exhibits.
	   ``It's pretty flattering when outside judges think she's
great,'' Jim Caldwell said. ``There's no artistic talent in either
my family or my wife's family.''
	   The Crayola contest was open to students nationwide from third
to sixth grades. More than 5,000 students sent in entries,
according to Crayola spokeswoman Stacy Gabrielle in Easton,
Pennsylvania.
	   The boxes have been on sale for a couple of weeks and Gabrielle
said they will be on shelves across the United States for about a
year.
	   As a winner, Brittany got Crayola products _ including plenty of
colored pencils _ as well as Silly Putty, markers and crayons.
	   Her art teacher got dlrs 1,000 which will go toward Crayola
products, as well as a television and videocassette recorder.

WFP: Somalia's harvest worst in five years, threatens thousands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Somalia's worst harvest in five years
threatens the lives of thousands over the coming months, the World
Food Program said Friday.
	   Maize yields will be 60,600 tons this year, compared to 110,000
last year, WFP said in a statement. Sorghum production will be
22,000 tons compared to 108,000 tons in 1997. The combined
production will mark the lowest annual yield in Somalia since 1993.
	   As a result, WFP will increase its food aid to Somalia to over
20,000 tons from August to March 1999, feeding about 630,000
people, WFP said. The U.N. agency urged international organizations
and donors to help fill the gap.
	   El Nino-driven floods, crop infestations by rats and other pests
and a lack of replacement seeds are to blame for the reduced
production in the agriculturally rich Juba and Shabelle river
areas, WFP said. In addition, renewed conflicts in the region are
affecting production.
	   ``The combination of these problems has completely destroyed the
ability of thousands of Somalis, particularly the small farmers, to
produce or access food for their families,'' said Burke Oberle, WFP
representative in Somalia.
	   The majority of families who will receive food are in the
southern part of the country, in the Juba, Shabelle, Bay, Bakool,
Gedo and Hiran regions. Flooding blamed on the El Nino weather
phenomenon was most severe in these areas during October and
December 1997. More than 2,000 people died and over 60,000 hectares
of farmland was ruined, WFP said.

Four killed by shell in Dagestan

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with at least 4 killed, 37 hospitalized, Emergency
Situations Ministry saying explosion caused by shell. &QL; 
 &UR; By NABI ABDULAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) _ A shell was fired in the capital of a
troubled southern Russian region Friday, killing at least four
people, the Interfax news agency reported, citing the Ministry of
Emergency Situations.
	   Thirty-seven people were hospitalized as a result, the ministry
said.
	   The shell was fired from a suburb on the eastern reaches of
Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan, the ministry said, according
to Interfax.
	   Angela Mamadibirova, a TV commentator, said the attack was
believed to be an attempt on the life of Mayor Said Amirov, who
lives near the site of the explosion in Makhachkala, the capital of
the region of Dagestan. The mayor was unhurt.
	   Appearing on local television, Mamadibirova said the mayor has
survived 10 assassination attempts this year. She said the
explosion, which struck at 8:42 p.m. (1642 GMT), was equivalent to
about 50 kilograms (110 pounds) of TNT.
	   Later, television reporters speculated that the explosion had
been intended to destroy the television center. The TV building was
badly damaged, and some 40 percent of its equipment destroyed, the
television report said.
	   A building housing an agricultural institute, and 10 buildings
nearby were damaged, the Interfax news agency said. Many students
living in a dormitory at the institute were injured by glass
shards, local television said.
	   Police and rescue workers were searching for people buried in
the debris. Four corpses were pulled out of the debris. Sixty
people, including eight children, were brought to the hospital with
injuries, said doctors at the Makhachkala hospital. Some were
released after treatment.
	   Headlights from fire engines and other emergency vehicles lit up
the search site, and rescuers occasionally paused for a moment of
silence to listen for human voices under the rubble, the ITAR-Tass
news agency said.
	   The explosion tore a 5-meter-wide (16.4-foot-wide), 3-meter-deep
(9.8-foot-deep) crater in the street in front of the TV building,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   Dagestan has been wracked by violence and kidnappings in recent
months as various religious and ethnic groups battle for power. It
has also been hit by spillover violence from breakaway Chechnya, on
its western border.
	   In an attempt to control the flow of dangerous materials,
Dagestan police have implemented an amnesty program for explosives.
Residents have so far traded in more than 140 kilograms (300
pounds) of explosives, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
Authorities said the relinquished materials included foreign-made
rocket fuel.

Iran asks for Saudi and UN help to free Iranians in Afghanistan

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Iran asking U.N. help; CHANGES overline; no
pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran has asked the United Nations and Saudi
Arabia for help in the case of the Iranians seized in Afghanistan,
state-run radio reported Friday.
	   Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi met U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Friday on the sidelines of the
Nonaligned Movement summit in South Africa and asked him to send a
U.N. delegation to Afghanistan to find out what has happened to the
Iranians, the radio said.
	   Kharrazi met his Saudi counterpart, Prince Saud al-Faisal, at
the same conference on Thursday.
	   ``Mr. Kharrazi asked Saudi Arabia to use its influence to secure
the freedom of the Iranian diplomats and the other Iranian
nationals detained by the Taliban,'' the radio said in a broadcast
monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation.
	   Saudi Arabia is regarded as a major supporter of the Taliban and
is one of only three countries to have recognized the group, which
controls most of Afghanistan.
	   The hard-line Taliban army released five Iranians, all truck
drivers, on Thursday in a goodwill gesture. Before their release,
Tehran had accused the Taliban of holding some 70 Iranians,
including 11 diplomats and a journalist for the official Iranian
news agency.
	   Iran, which borders Afghanistan to the west, has blamed the
Taliban for the disappearance of the diplomats.
	   The diplomats went missing after the Taliban captured the city
of Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan last month. The diplomats
were working at the local Iranian Consulate.
	   The Taliban have accused Iran of sending arms and money to their
opponents.
	   Iran has warned the Taliban it would consider all options to
retrieve its citizens. Iran has begun military exercises on its
border with Afghanistan, deploying more than 70,000 elite soldiers.

<TEXT>
	   JACKSONVILLE, Florida (AP) _ The first full swing was nothing
like the last one 147 days ago.
	   Greg Norman quietly returned to golf Friday, hitting balls for
the first time since he missed the cut at the Masters and then had
shoulder surgery that caused him to miss three major championships
and the rest of the PGA Tour season.
	   Norman hit about 100 balls at Medalist Golf Club and reported no
pain in his left shoulder.
	   ``It went OK,'' the 43-year-old Australian said from his home in
Hobe Sound, Florida. ``There were no problems, and I knew there
wouldn't be anyway. I've been doing all the right things and I've
been disciplined in my rehabilitation. My body is stronger since I
can remember.''
	   On a hot, steamy morning in south Florida, Norman loosened up
with about 30 pitch shots, took about 70 full swings with nothing
more than a 9-iron, then finished his first day back at work with
10 three-quarter swings with a 7-iron.

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ About 80 hard-line militants assaulted an
Iranian deputy president and the minister of culture and Islamic
guidance as they left a prayer service in central Tehran on Friday,
witnesses said.
	   Chanting ``Death to liberals!'' the militants scuffled with
Deputy President Abdollah Nouri and Culture Minister Ataollah
Mohajerani as they left Tehran University after Friday prayers at
about 2 p.m. (0930 GMT), said witnesses, who spoke to The
Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
	   The militants knocked off Nouri's white cleric turban and tore
open Mohajerani's shirt.
	   Both officials, who are considered liberals for having relaxed
Iran's strict social rules, were slapped in the face, but neither
appeared to be seriously injured, said the witnesses.
	   A passerby said he saw Mohajerani's wife, who is a presidential
advisor, shouting at the militants ``Stop it! Leave him alone!
you're killing him!''
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said some people tried
to protect Mohajerani and called an ambulance to get him away.
	   Witnesses said the minister went to hospital with a suspected
broken finger. His condition could not be confirmed late Friday.
	   Another passerby said he saw about 10 people stop Nouri to talk
to him as he approached the university's eastern gate.
	   ``Then about 50 people converged on him and attacked him,'' said
the witness, who stood about 25 meters (28 yards) away.
	   People also tried to protect Nouri from the militants and
escorted him to a nearby building, the news agency reported.
	   ``I have nothing to say to those who attacked me. I apologize to
those who came to try to stop the attack,'' Nouri told the agency.
	   It is very rare for a clergyman, even a controversial one such
as Nouri who was impeached in June, to be physically assaulted in
Iran.
	   The militants also assaulted the officials' bodyguards, said the
witnesses, some of whom had attended the prayer service. They spoke
on condition of anonymity.
	   Mohajerani and Nouri are known to be close allies of President
Mohammad Khatami.
	   Hard-liners regard Mohajerani and Nouri, who was interior
minister until his impeachment, as liberals for their relaxation of
the strict social code that has been enforced in Iran since the
Islamic revolution of 1979.
	   The parliament, which is dominated by hard-liners, impeached
Nouri for allowing political gatherings and relaxing the Islamic
code.

Iran asks for Saudi and UN help to free Iranians in Afghanistan

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran has asked the United Nations and Saudi
Arabia for help in the case of the Iranians seized in Afghanistan,
state-run radio reported Friday.
	   Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi met U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Friday on the sidelines of the
Nonaligned Movement summit in South Africa and asked him to send a
U.N. delegation to Afghanistan to find out what has happened to the
Iranians, the radio said.
	   Kharrazi met his Saudi counterpart, Prince Saud al-Faisal, at
the same conference on Thursday.
	   ``Mr. Kharrazi asked Saudi Arabia to use its influence to secure
the freedom of the Iranian diplomats and the other Iranian
nationals detained by the Taliban,'' the radio said in a broadcast
monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation.
	   Saudi Arabia is regarded as a major supporter of the Taliban and
is one of only three countries to have recognized the group, which
controls most of Afghanistan.
	   The hard-line Taliban army released five Iranians, all truck
drivers, on Thursday in a goodwill gesture. Before their release,
Tehran had accused the Taliban of holding some 70 Iranians,
including 11 diplomats and a journalist for the official Iranian
news agency.
	   Iran, which borders Afghanistan to the west, has blamed the
Taliban for the disappearance of the diplomats.
	   The diplomats went missing after the Taliban captured the city
of Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan last month. The diplomats
were working at the local Iranian Consulate.
	   The Taliban have accused Iran of sending arms and money to their
opponents.
	   Iran has warned the Taliban it would consider all options to
retrieve its citizens. Iran has begun military exercises on its
border with Afghanistan, deploying more than 70,000 elite soldiers.

Arafat denies peace deal close after series of high-level meetings

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) - Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said
Friday that a deal on an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank
was still far off, contradicting Israeli reports that a flurry of
recent high-level meetings has resulted in a draft agreement.
	   The conflicting assessments came as the United States prepared
to resume its mediation efforts, with U.S. envoy Dennis Ross to
return to the region next week for meetings with Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Israel radio said Palestinian negotiator Ahmed Qureia met three
times in the past two weeks with Netanyahu and seven times with
Netanyahu's confidant,
	   attorney Yitzhak Molcho.
	   The talks resulted in a draft agreement on key issues, including
the scope of a troop withdrawal, security cooperation, the
operation of a Palestinian airport and seaport and the release of
Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, the report said.
	   Israeli Channel 1 television reported Friday that Israel has
made a series
	   of concessions prior to Ross' visit. It no longer insists that
the Palestinians hand over Palestinians who have killed Israelis,
the TV said.
	   Israel was no longer making ``ultimative'' demands that the size
of the Palestinian police be reduced and that the Palestinian
authorities confiscate weapons held by Islamic militants.
	   However Israel still insists that the clauses in the Palestinian
covenant calling for Israel's destruction must be abrogated by the
Palestinian National Council (PNC). The Palestinians refuse,
maintaining that the PNC has already done this.
	   Qureia refused to comment Friday on the reports of the top-level
contacts.
	   However, a senior Palestinian official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, denied there had been any in the past two weeks.
	   Arafat said little progress has been made.
	   ``Actually, they (Israelis) are saying so but the gaps are still
wide,'' Arafat told reporters in Gaza City after returning from a
visit in South Africa.
	   On the table is an American proposal for an Israeli withdrawal
from 13 percent of the West Bank, to be met by a Palestinian
crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Asked whether he believed Ross would be able to persuade Israel
to agree to the U.S. initiative, Arafat said: ``I don't think so.''
	   ``This is not the first time that Ross is coming here,'' Arafat
said, in a
	   reference to the envoy's previous unsuccessful missions.
	   The Palestinian cabinet Friday night appointed three committees
to prepare for the establishment of an independent state on May 4
1999. the Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said late Friday.
	   Arafat has declared several times that he will establish an
independent state unilaterally if the negotiations with Israel
break down.
	   The three committees are to prepare economic, political and
legal aspects of independence, Erekat said.
	   White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Ross would meet with
Netanyahu and
	   Arafat early next week ``on the chances of the parties reaching
agreement on the basis of the U.S. initiative.''
	   However senior Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaeth told The
Associated Press Friday that Ross would be arriving on Wednesday.

Navy submarine maps airline wreckage
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Canada-Plane Crash &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia (AP) _ For 30 years, the HMCS Okonagan
has used its sonars to hunt for the enemy. On Friday, the day the
Canadian Navy submarine was to be decommissioned, rescuers used it
to search for the remains of Swissair Flight 111.
	   Officials with Canada's Transportation Safety Board said they
believed it was the first time any navy submarine had been used to
search for airline wreckage.
	   ``To my knowledge, this is a first,'' TSB Chairman Benoit
Bouchard said.
	   The 30-year-old craft, as long as three school buses, swept
along the ocean floor off Peggy's Cove, where the airplane and its
229 crew and passengers crashed Wednesday night.
	   The sub's sonar mapped a grid of the ocean floor to help find
larger chunks of the plane. So far, only small fragments of the
MD-11 have been pulled from the water.
	   Dana Doiron, a retired Canadian Navy commander who was hired by
the TSB to help in the search, said the submarine's sonar was
designed to find other subs. But he said it could be a valuable
tool in the airplane search.
	   Because the sonar is far beneath the surface, it can paint a
more accurate picture of the ocean floor. The ocean's temperature
gradients can distort images by sonars used on many boats, he said.
	   As of early Friday afternoon, officials said the submarine had
failed to locate a major portion of the aircraft or its flight
recorders.
	   In addition to the submarine, searchers are using a
torpedo-shaped sonar called an array that is dragged behind a boat,
about 50 feet (15 meters) above the ocean floor.
	   When the heavy sonar equipment is being used, divers cannot
search for wreckage because the powerful sound waves can be fatal.
	   ``It can fry your brain,'' Doiron said.
	   The HMCS Okonagan had just returned to Halifax, where it was due
to be decommissioned Friday in an elaborate ceremony attended by
more than 1,000 Navy officers and sailors. But the sub and its crew
of 77 were recalled Friday to begin another mission, Navy Lt.
Commander Dan Agnew said.
	   ``She'll get decommissioned someday,'' he said.

For clay-courters, life can be hard at Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Around tennis, Felix Mantilla has this
reputation as a clay-court player, the kind of specialist who ought
to be a soft touch on hardcourts.
	   So how come Tim Henman, seeded No. 13 at the U.S. Open, needed
four tough sets to subdue him 6-3, 5-7, 7-5, 6-4 on Friday?
	   Because, Henman explained, Mantilla's game is a lot less limited
than his reputation.
	   ``I think I play very well on hardcourts,'' the Spaniard said.
``I am improving my game.''
	   Henman agreed.
	   ``He's a guy in the top 20 who made the finals last week at Long
Island,'' Henman said. ``He's had a lot of good results on
hardcourts.''
	   Henman came in with glitzier credentials, though, including a
semifinal spot at Wimbledon, a result all the more impressive
because it came in his homeland under tough scrutiny.
	   ``It was a breakthrough, to get through to the semis,'' he said.
``I was very pleased with the way I'd played, and coming into the
hardcourt swing, I knew that at this time last year I didn't take
advantage of the opportunities that were available to me. So this
year, I was keen to play better than I had done and I think that is
definitely happening.''
	   After leaving the grass at Wimbledon, Henman reached the
quarterfinals or better in three of four hardcourt tournaments,
preparing for the concrete of Flushing Meadows.
	   Mantilla, meanwhile, perhaps yearning for his friendly clay,
lost early in hardcourt events at Cincinnati and Indianapolis
before his success in the Long Island warmup.
	   He gave Henman some problems, capitalizing on 40 unforced errors
by the British player. They split the first two sets before Henman
prevailed.
	   ``I was in a few difficult situations and able to come
through,'' Henman said.
	   The difference turned out to be exactly as Henman had planned _
in his serve. He produced 14 aces to just three for Mantilla.
	   ``I'm pretty happy with the way I played,'' he said. ``I've been
serving a lot more consistently. It's the key to my game and it's
something that has been coming on pretty strongly.''
	   The idea is to gain the advantage quickly and finish points off
the same way. It is a sound strategy, especially against clay
players, who prefer a slow, methodical pace.
	   ``You don't want long rallies,'' Henman said. ``That is favoring
him. That's trying to beat him at his own game.''
	   So Henman went for quick knockouts on every point. Sometimes it
worked and sometimes it didn't.
	   Each time out, however, Henman feels better about his game.
	   ``I think it is a comparison that is important,'' he said. ``At
times, I wasn't aggressive enough and the strength of my game is
playing attacking and at those times I think I was a little
cautious.''
	   Sort of like a clay-court player trying to win on hardcourts.

Nova Scotia has long ties to disaster at sea

	   PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Disaster and grim searches at
sea are nothing new for Nova Scotia. The crash of Swissair Flight
111 is part of a legacy that includes 5,000 shipwrecks and a role
as mortuary and burial ground for Titanic victims.
	   When the first alert was sounded that a jetliner had gone down
late Wednesday, dozens of fishermen along the coast rushed out in
their boats to join in a desperate search.
	   It wasn't the first such mobilization. Dan Conlin, marine
historian at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax, said a
similar rescue effort was mounted in 1873, when the steamship SS
Atlantic sank with almost 1,000 people on board, killing 560.
	   ``When the crash happened, 35 kilometers from where the Atlantic
sank, I thought of fishermen putting out in their boats in bad
weather because a whole lot of strangers were in peril,'' Conlin
said.
	   In 1912, when the Titanic sank, Halifax-based ships were sent to
retrieve bodies floating in the North Atlantic. More than 200
corpses were returned to the city, and most were buried in local
cemeteries.
	   In recent decades, Halifax has served as the base for Canada's
leading maritime rescue operation, the Rescue Coordination Center.
Housed in a six-floor brick building near Halifax Harbor, it is
essentially an emergency center for 3 million square miles (7.8
million square kilometers) of sea and coast stretching from the
south of Nova Scotia to Greeenland.
	   The staff of 36, both military and coast guard, are all veterans
of search and rescue operations, according to spokesman Dave
Bedell.
	   ``All of them have been at their share of rescues, so in
searching for and recovering the bodies you can tell that they've
been there before,'' he said. ``They know what the aircraft and
ships are doing and what the people are going through.''
	   Surrounded by computer and television monitors, the controllers
are set up to dispatch airplanes, helicopters, cutters with a phone
call. On Wednesday night, the center sounded the alarm after word
from air traffic control center in New Brunswick that Flight 111
had dropped off the radar screen.
	   The center was founded in 1947, to fill an unmet need made
obvious by the boat sinkings and plane crashes of World War II,
Bedell said.
	   It has sent rescuers to help at other large-scale disaster just
as hopeless as Flight 111: The Dec. 12, 1985 plane crash in Gander,
Newfoundland, that killed 256 people _ mostly American soldiers
returning home for Christmas _ and the toppling of the Ocean Ranger
oil rig in 1982 that killed 84 men.
	   John O'Brien, who has helped run the rescue center at Peggy's
Cove, said the people of Nova Scotia are well aware of the dangers
of the sea.
	   ``We're a maritime province,'' he said. ``When you live by the
sea, the sea calls the shots.''
	   Conlin, whose museum has documented 5,000 shipwrecks off Nova
Scotia over the past 400 years, said the province's location has
much to do with its link to disaster.
	   ``Look where we are,'' he said. ``We stick right out in the
Atlantic, in the busiest sea lanes and now the busiest aviation
route in the world.''
	   He said some outsiders, but not Nova Scotians, were surprised
that so many fisherman and coastal residents would mobilize so
quickly to help strangers in distress at sea. ``Just about every
family has some connection with someone who's lost their life on
their water,'' he said.

Carefree Novotna enjoys ride through Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout with new results, quotes; CHANGES byline;
will be UPDATED after Hingis-Mauresmo match &QL; 
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ No longer burdened by past failures, Jana
Novotna is a Wimbledon champion with a lot less on her mind these
days.
	   As she moves easily through the U.S. Open, along with most of
the other seeded men and women, Novotna finally is doing something
that once seemed so remote _ having fun.
	   Novotna, who beat Frenchwoman Sandrine Testud 6-2, 6-3 on Friday
to reach the fourth round, until this summer had been known mostly
for defeats in Wimbledon finals in 1993 and 1997 in which she
squandered big leads.
	   ``I think that after winning Wimbledon, yes, I have completed my
career,'' the Czech said. ``An enormous dream came true for me and
I am just looking forward to playing more and enjoying it more. I
am just feeling incredibly relieved and just happy of what I have
achieved.''
	   The Wimbledon title not only changed Novotna's attitude, it also
changed the way she is perceived by opponents.
	   ``I think now since I am Wimbledon champion, I feel more respect
from the other players while I am on the court,'' she said. ``Even
when I am losing, I see on the face of the other players that they
are not really sure if they can really win it.''
	   Also advancing with little trouble to the fourth round was No. 6
Monica Seles, who won 6-3, 6-3 over Annie Miller. Seles is one
victory from a probable encounter with top-seeded Martina Hingis in
the quarterfinals.
	   Steffi Graf reached the fourth round with a 6-1, 6-1 win in 43
minutes over Mirjana Lucic in which she won nine straight games.
Graf, the No. 8 seed, made just seven unforced errors to 33 for
Lucic.
	   Lucic had eight double faults, often missing serves by several
feet. At one point in the second set, she stood at the service line
and shrugged.
	   When Lucic whiffed on a serve by Graf in the final game of the
match, a fan yelled ``strike one.''
	   ``It was like a nightmare, that's what it was like out there
today,'' Lucic said. ``I totally missed the ball, that didn't
happen when I was 3{ years old.''
	   Novotna, Seles and Graf led a steady march of seeded players.
Only three seeded men have lost so far, and only two seeded women
have been eliminated.
	   No. 14 Dominique Van Roost lost 6-4, 6-2 to Kimberly Po. The
only other women's seed ousted so far is No. 16 Ai Sugiyama, who
pulled out in the second round with a sprained ankle.
	   Among the women advancing Friday was No. 11 Patty Schnyder, a
6-1, 7-6 (7-3) winner over Mary Joe Fernandez.
	   Winners among the men were No. 5 Richard Krajicek, No. 11
Yevgeny Kafelnikov and No. 13 Tim Henman.
	   The run of success by seeded men is in stark contrast to the
upsets that dominated the French Open and Wimbledon this year.
	   Seven of the top eight men's seeds have made it to the third
round at the U.S. Open. At Wimbledon, just three of the top eight
reached the third round. At the French Open, only one of the top
eight reached the third round.
	   ``Good seedings, I guess,'' explained No. 8 Andre Agassi.
	   The most intriguing match of the day promised to be the one at
night between Serena Williams and No. 9 Irina Spirlea, who collided
with Serena's older sister, Venus, during a changeover in their
U.S. Open match last year.

Seles remembers the past ... not so fondly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It was 1989, and across the net on center court
from 15-year-old Monica Seles was Chris Evert, playing the final
tournament of her career.
	   ``I grew up watching her and it was weird to be part of history
in that sense,'' Seles said. ``I didn't want to be remembered as
the last person to beat Chrissy in the fourth round.''
	   She wasn't. Evert won 6-0, 6-2.
	   ``She killed me,'' Seles said. ``Every point was long, but the
score line looked like it was very easy.''
	   What was then the main court is now the No. 2 court at the Open.
Seles was back there Friday, beating Annie Miller 6-3, 6-3 to reach
the fourth round.
	   Seles nudged Evert toward retirement when she beat her at
Houston earlier in 1989. Evert decided to make the U.S. Open that
year her final tournament.
	   ``She was just too consistent for that day,'' Seles said. ``I
was inexperienced and just missing way too many balls and that
decided the match.''
	   After beating Seles, Evert lost in the quarterfinals to Zina
Garrison.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; TENNIS EXECUTIVE REMEMBERED: The tennis community mourned
Friday for Pierre Babolat, chairman of a leading racket-stringing
company, who died in the crash of Swissair Flight 111.
	   Since 1985, Babolat expanded the company to also include
strings, accessories and rackets. Carlos Moya won the 1998 French
Open with a Babolat racket.
	   Babolat's death in the Wednesday night crash off Nova Scotia was
reported earlier by tennis players and officials, and confirmed by
Swissair Friday.
	   Meanwhile, another tennis player was reported to have just
missed the fatal flight. According to a Romanian tennis official,
Dinu Pescariu was scheduled to be on the flight but _ Swiss player
Marc Rosset _ decided to stay one more day in the United States
after a first-round loss.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; MCENROE NOMINATED: John McEnroe, winner of four U.S. Opens and
three Wimbledons, was among the nominees for next year's induction
into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.
	   McEnroe was the youngest player to reach the ATP's No. 1 ranking
and was No. 1 at the end of four consecutive years. He also won 10
career Grand Slam doubles titles.
	   He was on a list that included Australian Ken MacGregor, who won
a Grand Slam in doubles with Frank Sedgman in 1951; British tennis
writer Rex Bellamy; Britain's Derek Hartwick, a former tennis
official who was instrumental in the emergence of open tennis, and
Bob Kelleher, a former president of the U.S. Tennis Association.
	   The announcement of the inductees will be made early next year,
with ceremonies scheduled July 10-11 at Newport, R.I.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; JUST A TENNIS FAN: Former New York City Mayor David Dinkins was
just part of the crowd Friday, watching one of his favorites play
one of his favorite sports.
	   Dinkins was in the stands at Stadium 2 to see Monica Seles beat
Annie Miller in a third-round match. Dinkins is an avid tennis
player who lost a mayoral re-election bid to Rudolph Giuliani in
1993.
	   Dinkins was an instrumental force in the expansion of the
National Tennis Center, where the U.S. Open moved in 1978. One of
his last official acts in 1993 was to sign a lease for the new
stadium that was dedicated in 1997 as the Arthur Ashe Stadium.

King of Kings to go into stud at Ashmore
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEXINGTON, Kentucky (AP) _ King of Kings, the 3-year-old winner
of one of Europe's top races, will stand at stud in the United
States.
	   The Irish colt, who in May won the 2,000 Guineas in Newcastle,
England, by 1 1-4 lengths, will stand at Ashford Stud starting next
year, the farm said Friday.
	   The son of Sadler's Wells out of Zummerudd, King of Kings was
trained by Aidan O'Brien at Ireland's Ballydoyle Stables. He won
four of five starts as a 2-year-old before his win in the 2,000
Guineas.
	   But in June, while running in England's most prestigious race,
the Epsom Derby, King of Kings pulled up injured and was retired to
stud.
	   The colt is standing for the Southern Hemisphere season at
Coolmore Australia and is to arrive in Kentucky at the end of the
year, an Ashford spokeswoman said.

President, facing Democratic criticism, says `I'm sorry'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout with Lieberman comments, Gephardt/Gingrich
meeting, Ahern background; no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By TERENCE HUNT &QC; 
 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton said for the
first time Friday ``I'm sorry'' about his affair with Monica
Lewinsky, describing his behavior as indefensible as he sought to
calm the growing storm that has shaken his presidency.
	   Less than 24 hours after a Democratic ally took to the Senate
floor to denounce Clinton's conduct as immoral and urge a public
rebuke, the president said, ``I can't disagree with anyone else who
wants to be critical of what I have already acknowledged was
indefensible.''
	   Clearly uncomfortable addressing the matter on an international
stage, Clinton would not discuss the possibility of a congressional
censure, saying, ``I don't want to get into that.'' A senior
presidential adviser said White House aides had come to the
conclusion that the situation was so bad that a censure was
probably the best outcome they could hope for.
	   White House press secretary Mike McCurry said there had been no
discussion of resignation in Clinton's conversations with
Democratic leaders and others. Clinton said Feb. 6 he would never
resign and McCurry commented, ``I am confident his attitude has not
changed on that.''
	   Back home, officials said House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a
Republican, and Democratic leader Dick Gephardt would meet next
week to talk over plans to receive a report that prosecutor Kenneth
Starr is believed to be preparing on his investigation. Democrats
have complained about being excluded from planning a congressional
process that could lead to impeachment hearings.
	   Clinton has been grappling to satisfy demands for a sincere
apology for having an affair with a 21-year-old intern and lying
about it. Friday's statement was the president's third attempt to
address the matter since his Aug. 17 address to the nation and he
used new wording _ even as he insisted he had said much the same
before.
	   ``I've already said that I made a bad mistake, it was
indefensible and I'm sorry about it,'' Clinton said, questioned at
a photo opportunity with Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern. It was
the first time he had used the word ``sorry.''
	   The president desperately needs Democratic support to combat
accumulated evidence in Starr's report to Congress on Clinton's
behavior. But even senior Democrats are distancing themselves from
the president, unsure what Starr's report will say and fearing
Clinton will pull the party down in November's midterm elections.
	   Sen. Christopher Dodd, a former Democratic Party chairman, said
Clinton's ``I'm sorry'' is not enough and he needs to apologize to
the American people directly, perhaps in another address.
	   Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, the current party chairman, said
Clinton's direct statement about being sorry was ``helpful.''
	   ``I think he's been saying that with other words. He's had
difficulty getting it out,'' Romer said.
	   The administration watched in dismay Thursday as Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, a Democrat from Connecticut, said in a Senate speech,
``It is hard to ignore the impact of the misconduct the president
has admitted to on our children, our culture and our national
character.'' He said Clinton had ``compromised his moral
authority.''
	   Two fellow Democrats, Sens. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Daniel
Patrick Moynihan of New York, rose to praise their colleague.
	   On Friday, Lieberman said the president's latest comments were
``a substantial step forward for him and the country. I hope the
process continues.''
	   White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles had implored Lieberman
to ``hold off until the president was back on U.S. soil,'' McCurry
said, but was unsuccessful. Clinton had spoken with Lieberman
before leaving Washington on Monday.
	   White House aides debated late into the night how to respond and
decided not to issue a presidential statement. But Clinton
responded when asked about Lieberman at his photo opportunity with
the Irish prime minister.
	   ``Basically I agree with what he said,'' Clinton said, adding
that he had known Lieberman a long time and had worked with him on
many things.
	   The president said he would not judge Lieberman's remarks. ``But
there's nothing that he or anyone else could say in a personally
critical way that I _ that I don't imagine that I would disagree
with, since I have already said it myself, to myself. And I'm very
sorry about it. There's nothing else I could say.''
	   Democrats are openly discussing some sort of public rebuke,
possibly a congressional resolution, censure or reprimand _ options
the president declined to discuss.
	   ``I shouldn't be commenting on that while I'm on this trip,''
Clinton said. ``My understanding is that was not a decision that
was made or advocated clearly yesterday. So I don't want to get
into that. If that's not an issue, I don't want to make it, one way
or the other.''
	   Clinton's remarks were the latest in a step-by-step
acknowledgment of wrongdoing. In a televised address Aug. 17,
Clinton said he had a relationship that was ``not appropriate'' and
he said ``it was wrong'' that he had misled people. ``I deeply
regret that,'' he said.
	   Taking his comments further, Clinton said in a news conference
Wednesday in Moscow, ``I have acknowledged that I made a mistake,
said that I regretted it, asked to be forgiven.''
	   Clinton made his remarks Friday standing beside Ahern, who is
separated from his wife and admitted a year ago that he is living
with his former secretary.
	   McCurry said Clinton's remarks Friday were not the last on the
Lewinsky affair.
	   ``The president clearly does not believe that one conversation,
one statement, one speech is going to be sufficient in addressing
this matter the way he wants to,'' the spokesman said. ``And he
intends to keep addressing it both personally and, to the degree he
needs to publicly, as he sees fit.''

Time to worry, Notre Dame: Michigan's here
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JR ROSS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   INDIANOPOLIS (AP) _ For the past two months, Notre Dame coach
Bob Davie promised he wouldn't worry about things beyond his
control.
	   So an age discrimination suit brought by a former assistant
coach didn't bother him. Nor did an National Collegiate Athletic
Association investigation into two rules violations.
	   But No. 5 Michigan is in town. Now it's time to worry.
	   ``The things we can control start Saturday; the game is what we
can control,'' Davie said. ``That's what we need to focus on, is
our performance in that game.''
	   After months of talk about a tarnished image and a program in
turmoil, Davie and the No. 22 Irish finally get back to football
against the Wolverines on Saturday.
	   In other games involving Top 10 teams, it will be No. 1 Ohio
State at No. 11 West Virginia, The Citadel at No. 3 Florida,
Alabama-Birmingham at No. 4 Nebraska, Indiana State at No. 6 Kansas
State, No. 18 Washington at No. 8 Arizona State and No. 10
Tennessee at No. 17 Syracuse.
	   Also, it's Miami, Ohio, at No. 12 North Carolina, No. 21
Southern Mississippi at No. 13 Penn State, No. 15 Colorado State
vs. Colorado at Denver, Kent at No. 19 Georgia, No. 20 Wisconsin at
San Diego State and No. 23 Michigan State at Oregon.
	   No. 2 Florida, No. 7 University of California-LA, No. 9
Louisiana State University and No. 14 Texas A and M are idle.
	   Thursday night, No. 16 Virginia beat No. 25 Auburn 19-0 and No.
24 Arizona defeated Hawaii 27-6.
	   Davie knows that beating Michigan won't quiet all the questions
at Notre Dame. But it can prove the Irish still belong among the
elite after a 7-6 season.
	   ``It definitely crosses my mind ... the type of game that we
want to play to show people that Notre Dame football is back,''
said Irish quarterback Jarious Jackson, who will make his first
college start against one of the best defenses. ``More than
anything, we want to prove to ourselves that we're capable of
competing against anyone in the country.''
	   The job at hand includes trying to reestablish a running game
that averaged only 175 yards per game last season. Davie has
resurrected the option, hoping Jackson can use his playmaking to
offset his inexperience.
	   Michigan wants to make a statement of its own. The Wolverines
know a march to the national championship game in January begins at
Notre Dame.
	   ``You can't be satisfied, and if you are satisfied, you are
headed in a downward spiral,'' Michigan coach Lloyd Carr said.
``We've done all the preparation. Now it's time to see where we
measure up.''
	   Ohio State will enjoy the luxury of having three starters who
were uncertain as late as Thursday. Declared academically eligible
were Butkus Award-winning linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer, a first-team
All-American; offensive guard Rob Murphy; and strong safety Damon
Moore.
	   West Virginia has yet to beat a No. 1 team in six tries.
	   ``It's a big opportunity for us,'' wide receiver Shawn Foreman
said. ``Our team knows what we have in front of us. This is
probably one of the biggest games in the history of West Virginia.
	   The Arizona State-Washington game figures to be high scoring.
	   ``You've got two offenses that have a chance to move the ball
real well,'' Washington coach Jim Lambright said.
	   Two years ago, Arizona State beat Washington 45-42.
	   Tee Martin, who succeeds Peyton Manning at Tennessee, makes his
first start against a ranked team, Syracuse.
	   ``I like that type of challenge,'' he said. ``Our season is much
like this first game. We have a tough schedule. This will show us
what we have to look forward to the rest of the season.''
	   Penn State also is going with an untested quarterback against
Southern Mississippi. Except coach Joe Paterno doesn't know if it
will be Kevin Thompson or Rashard Casey. Paterno will decide
shortly before gametime.

British Foreign Office Minister to visit Caribbean islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DATELINE, (AP) _ British Foreign Office Minister Baroness Symons
will make her first visit to the Caribbean next week since her
appointment as Minister for Overseas Territories.
	   She is schueduled to meet with the executive councils of the
Turks and Caicos Islands on Sept. 8-10 and the British Virgin
Islands Sept. 10-11.
	   Symons will discuss a broad range of issues and will focus on
the efforts of the terriorial governments to combat drug
trafficking.
	   The drug trade has been a point of contention between Britain
and its territories. Many in the islands contend that London
focuses too much on drug trafficking and ignores issues of
importance to the islanders, such as citizenship and economic
assistance.
	   Baroness Symons has been Minister for the Caribbean since May
1997. She was appointed as Minister for the Overseas Territories in
February 1998.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Searchers had few answers to offer
the many relatives arriving Friday and wondering what went wrong
aboard Swissair Flight 111: Surging tides were quickly spreading
debris of the shattered jet, and high-tech sonar failed to locate
its vital flight data recorders.
	   Exasperated authorities also warned curiosity-seekers to keep
their boats away from the scene and journalists not to intrude on
the privacy of relatives of the 229 crash victims. Everyone aboard
died in Wednesday night's crash off Nova Scotia's rocky coast.
	   A Canadian navy submarine equipped with high-tech sonar was
unable to trace the MD-11's flight data recorders, which are hoped
to provide clues to the cause of the crash.
	   Finding the devices may take time because a beacon that sends a
tracking signal to guide searchers to them was not working in the
water, Philippe Bruggisser, chief of Swissair's parent SAirGroup,
said in Geneva.
	   Divers and spotter planes joined the recovery effort, but debris
was steadily spreading. Body parts were washing up on beaches.
About 100 Canadian soldiers were out combing the shoreline.
	   ``We can't contain the debris,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Glenn
Chamberlain, one of the search coordinators. ``All we can do is try
to find it.''
	   Searchers had yet to find any piece of wreckage larger than the
roof of a car, raising concern that fully reconstructing the jet _
a tool helpful to determining what happened _ might be impossible.
	   ``If we do not find more than what we have today, there's no
talking about any kind of reconstruction,'' said Benoit Bouchard of
the Canadian Transportation Safety Board.
	   Sgt. Andre Geurtin of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said the
most significant find during Friday's search was about 100 mostly
intact pieces of luggage, probably from the plane's cargo hold.
	   Only at midday Friday did search coordinators formally state
what had seemed clear since Wednesday night _ that there were no
survivors among those aboard the New York-to-Geneva flight.
	   That announcement, coupled with the failure thus far to find the
plane's fuselage or flight recorders, gave authorities only
discouraging news to offer family members arriving from Europe and
the United States.
	   ``It was important for the victims' families, for whom it is
only natural to hold out one last hope, that we did everything
which could possibly be done to find survivors,'' said Rear Adm.
Dusty Miller, one of the search commanders. ``There is no longer a
last hope.''
	   Officials have stopped the body count at estimates of about 60,
largely because they are not recovering full corpses. ``It's a very
grisly scene out there,'' search coordinator Chamberlain said.
	   The first chartered plane carrying mourners flew in from New
York with about 175 family members, grief counselors and airline
staff. Another plane with 80 people aboard was arriving from
Switzerland.
	   At search headquarters in the fishing village of Peggy's Cove,
authorities set up a row of green army tents overlooking the ocean
to provide some privacy for family members if they visit the site.
	   Muriel Provost of the regional Red Cross said the relatives
suffered a double trauma _ first learning of their loved ones'
deaths, then having to board a plane. ``That must have been a very
painful experience for some of them,'' she said.
	   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said it would help arrange
press briefings by relatives willing to make statements, but warned
journalists not to intrude on those who wished to be left alone.
	   ``If anyone forces themselves on family members, it won't be
tolerated,'' Staff Sgt. Keith McGuire said.
	   McGuire also said police were becoming exasperated with members
of the public, both on shore and in boats, venturing into the
search area to look for debris. He said such intruders face arrest
and seizure of their boats if they disobey orders to stay out.
	   Vic Gergen, who heads the Canadian Transportation Safety Board
investigation into the crash, said investigators have listened to
the tapes of the plane's last conversation with air traffic
controllers. He described the conversations as ``professional at
all times.''
	   The MD-11 dropped off radar screens 90 minutes after leaving New
York's Kennedy International Airport.
	   After a normal takeoff, the crew reported smoke in the cockpit
and decided to turn back to Boston. When they spoke to Canadian
controllers in Moncton, New Brunswick, they were told the Halifax
airport was much closer. The plane never made it to Halifax,
crashing into the ocean 30 miles (50 kilometers) to the south after
dumping much of its fuel.
	   According to Gergen, the plane descended rapidly while trying to
reach Halifax airport and made a couple of rough circles over the
coast while dumping fuel.
	   Bruggisser, of SAirGroup, said the initial investigation
indicated the plane hit the water at a very high speed, breaking it
and those aboard into small pieces. ``The condition of the bodies
is such that the biggest body part is (the size of) a baby,'' he
said, his voice breaking.
	   Bruggisser refused to speculate on the causes of the smoke. He
said Swissair had made the changes required last year by the
Federal Aviation Administration concerning a wiring problem in
MD-11 cockpits that, if left uncorrected, could cause a fire.
	   There was no indication the crash resulted from sabotage or a
terrorist act, but investigators were not ruling anything out. The
Royal Canadian Mounted Police called in explosives experts to
examine debris for signs of a possible bomb blast.

Hingis rallies to advance in U.S. Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Hingis, Rios victories; will be updates with
quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The predicament was familiar, and so was Martina
Hingis' response.
	   Down by a set against Amelie Mauresmo for the second time this
summer, the world's top player ran off an impressive streak again
Friday to reach the fourth round of the U.S. Open.
	   The top-seeded Hingis, who had not lost a set in the U.S. Open
since 1996, rallied to defeat Mauresmo 4-6, 6-2, 6-2 as most of the
seeded women and men continued moving easily through the
tournament.
	   Only two seeded women have been eliminated so far, and only
three seeded men have lost.
	   Hingis trailed Mauresmo by a set and 4-1 in the second set of a
Federation Cup match in Switzerland in July before rallying to win.
This time, Hingis was down by a set and tied 1-1 in the second
before winning 11 of the last 14 games.
	   Hingis had six double faults and was out-aced 5-1 by Mauresmo,
but never seemed worried. During a changeover early in the second
set, Hingis mentioned to a ballgirl that she liked her uniform.
	   Jana Novotna, no longer burdened by past failures, is a
Wimbledon champion with a lot less on her mind these days. As she
advances, Novotna finally is doing something that once seemed so
remote _ having fun.
	   Novotna, who beat Sandrine Testud 6-2, 6-3 to reach the fourth
round, until this summer had been known mostly for defeats in
Wimbledon finals in 1993 and 1997 in which she squandered big
leads.
	   ``I think that after winning Wimbledon, yes, I have completed my
career,'' she said. ``An enormous dream came true for me and I am
just looking forward to playing more and enjoying it more. I am
just feeling incredibly relieved and just happy of what I have
achieved.''
	   The Wimbledon title not only changed Novotna's attitude, but
also the way she is perceived by opponents.
	   ``I think now since I am Wimbledon champion, I feel more respect
from the other players while I am on the court,'' she said. ``Even
when I am losing, I see on the face of the other players that they
are not really sure if they can really win it.''
	   Also advancing with little trouble to the fourth round was No. 6
Monica Seles, who won 6-3, 6-3 over Annie Miller. Seles is one
victory from a probable encounter with Hingis in the quarterfinals.
	   Steffi Graf reached the fourth round with a 6-1, 6-1 victory in
43 minutes over Mirjana Lucic in which she won nine straight games.
Graf, the No. 8 seed, made just seven unforced errors to 33 for
Lucic.
	   Lucic had eight double faults, often missing serves by several
feet. At one point in the second set, she stood at the service line
and shrugged.
	   When Lucic whiffed on a serve by Graf in the final game of the
match, a fan yelled ``strike one.''
	   ``It was like a nightmare, that's what it was like out there
today,'' Lucic said. ``I totally missed the ball, that didn't
happen when I was 3{ years old.''
	   No. 14 Dominique Van Roost lost 6-4, 6-2 to Kimberly Po. The
only other women's seed ousted so far is No. 16 Ai Sugiyama, who
pulled out in the second round with a sprained ankle.
	   Among the women advancing Friday was No. 11 Patty Schnyder, a
6-1, 7-6 (7-3) winner over Mary Joe Fernandez.
	   Winners among the men were No. 2 Marcelo Rios, No. 5 Richard
Krajicek, No. 11 Yevgeny Kafelnikov and No. 13 Tim Henman.
	   The run of success by seeded men is in stark contrast to the
upsets that dominated the French Open and Wimbledon this year.
	   Seven of the top eight men's seeds have made it to the third
round at the U.S. Open. At Wimbledon, just three of the top eight
reached the third round. At the French Open, only one of the top
eight reached the third round.
	   ``Good seedings, I guess,'' explained No. 8 Andre Agassi.
	   The most intriguing match of the day promised to be the one at
night between Serena Williams and No. 9 Irina Spirlea, who collided
with Serena's older sister, Venus, during a changeover in their
U.S. Open match last year.

Canada signs Denmark to NATO pilot program

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Canada's defence minister will team up with his
Danish counterpart at a British airshow next week to officially
bring Denmark into Canada's pilot training program.
	   Denmark will become the first country to officially sign up for
the program on Monday when Canadian Defense Minister Art Eggleton
and Danish Defense Minister Hans Haekkerup sign an agreement at the
Farnborough International Air Show.
	   The NATO Flying Training Program in Canada, which was announced
more than a year ago, will be held at air force bases in Moose Jaw,
Saskatchewan, and Cold Lake, Alberta, beginning in 1999.
	   Under the program, Canada's air force instructors will train
foreign students.
	   Several countries, Norway and Britain among them, have indicated
they will also send pilots, though none have yet made it official.

President, facing Democratic criticism, says `I'm sorry'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS 2 grafs after 3rd graf pvs, Clearly uncomfortable ...
to UPDATE with talk of resignation from Democrats; trims to
shorten &QL; 
 &UR; By TERENCE HUNT &QC; 
 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ President Clinton said for the first time
Friday ``I'm sorry'' about his affair with Monica Lewinsky,
describing his behavior as indefensible as he sought to calm the
growing storm that has shaken his presidency.
	   Less than 24 hours after a Democratic ally took to the Senate
floor to denounce Clinton's conduct as immoral and urge a public
rebuke, the president said, ``I can't disagree with anyone else who
wants to be critical of what I have already acknowledged was
indefensible.''
	   Clearly uncomfortable addressing the matter on an international
stage, Clinton would not discuss the possibility of a congressional
censure, saying, ``I don't want to get into that.'' A senior
presidential adviser said White House aides had come to the
conclusion that the situation was so bad that a censure was
probably the best outcome they could hope for.
	   And Democratic leaders, fearing Clinton's legal troubles could
drag down their candidates in Nov. 3 midterm elections, were
talking openly about the prospect of a presidential resignation.
``If it becomes a problem for our candidates and our leadership,
then he really needs to assess where the party will be in the next
two years and take a long view of what's down the road, and look at
it from the party's view,'' said Philip Parington, chairman of the
Colorado Democratic Party. ``He's got the ball.''
	   One longtime Clinton confidant, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that because of party concerns the president should
consider leaving office.
	   White House press secretary Mike McCurry said there had been no
discussion of resignation in Clinton's conversations with
Democratic leaders and others. Clinton said Feb. 6 he would never
resign and McCurry commented, ``I am confident his attitude has not
changed on that.''
	   Back home, officials said House Speaker Newt Gingrich and
Democratic leader Dick Gephardt would meet next week to talk over
plans to receive a report that prosecutor Kenneth Starr is believed
to be preparing on his investigation.
	   Clinton has been grappling to satisfy demands for a sincere
apology for having an affair with a 21-year-old intern and lying
about it. Friday's statement was the president's third attempt to
address the matter since his Aug. 17 address to the nation and he
used new wording _ even as he insisted he had said much the same
before.
	   ``I've already said that I made a bad mistake, it was
indefensible and I'm sorry about it,'' Clinton said, questioned at
a photo opportunity with Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern. It was
the first time he had used the word ``sorry.''
	   The president desperately needs Democratic support to combat any
evidence Starr may report to Congress on Clinton's behavior. But
even senior Democrats are distancing themselves from the president,
unsure what Starr's report will say and fearing Clinton will pull
the party down in November's midterm elections.
	   Sen. Christopher Dodd, a former Democratic Party chairman, said
Clinton's ``I'm sorry'' is not enough and he needs to apologize to
the American people directly, perhaps in another address.
	   Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, the current party chairman, said
Clinton's direct statement about being sorry was ``helpful.''
	   ``I think he's been saying that with other words. He's had
difficulty getting it out,'' Romer said.
	   The administration watched in dismay Thursday as Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, a Democrat from Connecticut, said in a Senate speech,
``It is hard to ignore the impact of the misconduct the president
has admitted to on our children, our culture and our national
character.'' He said Clinton had ``compromised his moral
authority.''
	   Two fellow Democrats, Sens. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Daniel
Patrick Moynihan of New York, rose to praise their colleague.
	   On Friday, Lieberman said the president's latest comments were
``a substantial step forward for him and the country. I hope the
process continues.''
	   White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles had implored Lieberman
to ``hold off until the president was back on U.S. soil,'' McCurry
said, but was unsuccessful. Clinton had spoken with Lieberman
before leaving Washington on Monday.
	   White House aides debated late into the night how to respond and
decided not to issue a presidential statement. But Clinton
responded when asked about Lieberman at his photo opportunity with
the Irish prime minister.
	   ``Basically I agree with what he said,'' Clinton said, adding
that he had known Lieberman a long time and had worked with him on
many things.
	   The president said he would not judge Lieberman's remarks. ``But
there's nothing that he or anyone else could say in a personally
critical way that I _ that I don't imagine that I would disagree
with, since I have already said it myself, to myself. And I'm very
sorry about it. There's nothing else I could say.''
	   Democrats are openly discussing some sort of public rebuke,
possibly a congressional resolution, censure or reprimand _ options
the president declined to discuss.
	   ``I shouldn't be commenting on that while I'm on this trip,''
Clinton said. ``My understanding is that was not a decision that
was made or advocated clearly yesterday. So I don't want to get
into that. If that's not an issue, I don't want to make it, one way
or the other.''
	   Clinton's remarks were the latest in a step-by-step
acknowledgment of wrongdoing. In a televised address Aug. 17,
Clinton said he had a relationship that was ``not appropriate'' and
he said ``it was wrong'' that he had misled people.
	   Taking his comments further, Clinton said in a news conference
Wednesday in Moscow, ``I have acknowledged that I made a mistake,
said that I regretted it, asked to be forgiven.''
	   Clinton made his remarks Friday standing beside Ahern, who is
separated from his wife and admitted a year ago that he is living
with his former secretary.

Congolese rebels study Zimbabwean call for peace talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Wamba quotes, other details. &QL; 
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels are considering a proposal
to hold peace talks with the government and several neighboring
countries despite their objections to Zimbabwe's desire to host and
mediate the discussions, a rebel leader said Friday.
	   Zimbabwean officials said Thursday they were preparing for two
days of talks at the northwestern resort of Victoria Falls,
probably starting Monday.
	   However, Congolese rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba said the
discussions must be mediated by a neutral country, apparently
ruling out Zimbabwe, which has sent 2,800 troops to Congo to
bolster President Laurent Kabila's fight against the rebels. The
outside military support enabled Kabila to beat back rebel advances
on the capital, Kinshasa.
	   ``We're in favor of negotiations, but we haven't got formal
invitation yet,'' said Wamba. ``It's a subject of negotiations who
should be mediator. The peace process can't be dictated by one
person.''
	   After a day-long talks Friday with other rebel leaders at this
eastern strongold, Wamba refused to commit himself to traveling to
Zimbabwe.
	   ``I can answer that question when I have the full information,''
he said. ``I can't say yes or no. We have to know what is going to
happen at talks before deciding whether to go or not.''
	   Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, said Thursday that talks
involving all parties with some role in the conflict _ which could
mean representatives from as many as six nations _ would take place
within the next three days.
	   Earlier Friday, Wamba suggested peace talks should be held in
either Tanzania or Zambia.
	   Patrick Mazimhaka, Rwanda's minister of state, said the meeting
in Victoria Falls would be productive only if it includes Kabila
and the rebels.
	   ``Should one or two parties be missing, the summit will not
advance anything,'' he said from Kigali, Rwanda.
	   He said if the two parties agreed to a cease-fire, it was
possible that an African peace-keeping force would be involved to
monitor an agreement.
	   But he cautioned any such force would have to be expanded from
the troops already deployed _ Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia _ to
include neutral players, like South Africa and Tanzania.
	   If South Africa joined such a force, it would be the first
deployment of its troops outside its borders since President Nelson
Mandela came to power in all-race elections in 1994.
	   In the past, Kabila has rejected talks with the rebels and
instead demanded the withdrawal of Rwandan and Ugandan troops, whom
he accuses of backing the revolt and invading the country.
	   The rebels _ ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of Kabila's
army and opposition politicians _ accuse Kabila of incompetence,
nepotism and corruption _ problems Kabila had promised to eradicate
after ousting longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in May 1997.

Ethnic Albanian leader welcomes interim agreement for Kosovo

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The top ethnic Albanian leader
signaled Friday he would try to win hard-liners over to a proposed
peace formula for Kosovo, while diplomatic efforts accelerated to
end fighting in the Serbian province before winter endangers
thousands of refugees.
	   Despite those efforts, clashes between Serb forces and ethnic
Albanian secessionists continued for a third day in the Orahovac
area, 55 kilometers (34 miles), southwest of Pristina.
	   The Serb Media Center said police on Friday arrested 60
suspected members of the ethnic Albanian guerrilla force called the
Kosovo Liberation Army. The fighters were rounded up in the Prizren
area near the scene of the latest fighting.
	   Serb authorities said those arrested would be released if an
investigation revealed they had been pressured into joining the
KLA, which is fighting for independence from Serbia, the dominant
republic in Yugoslavia.
	   The offer appeared to be part of campaign by the government to
isolate KLA hard-liners, who oppose a negotiated settlement short
of full independence for the province.
	   In Washington, special U.S. envoy Christopher Hill said Friday
the United States will not allow negotiations over the Kosovo
crisis to drag forever.
	   ``If we can get this agreement, and we have many many miles
ahead of us before we can do that, I think we can then see if we
can establish democracy in Kosovo,'' said Hill at the Woodrow
Wilson International Center for Scholars.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population
of 2 million, are seeking greater autonomy. Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic has refused to grant independence, which is also
opposed by the United States and European powers. The Western
nations fear making Kosovo independent could spark conflict in
Macedonia and other neighboring areas that have large populations
of ethnic Albanians.
	   Both Milosevic and moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova have
agreed in principle to an interim formula granting Kosovo self-rule
without independence.
	   The formula, however, would provide for the two sides to review
the plan in three to five years, leaving the door open to another
arrangement. But the KLA has not endorsed the plan, which diplomats
say could take months to complete.
	   On Friday, Rugova said the U.S.-inspired formula ``is under
consideration'' as a way to ``normalize life'' and ``create
conditions for a lasting solution.''
	   Asked if the KLA would eventually accept the plan, Rugova said
he represents ``all residents of Kosovo,'' indicating he would seek
to build support among the Albanian community.
	   ``We have to do something to end the negative trends and prevent
an imminent tragedy for Kosovo, '' Rugova said.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged Milosevic to
call off the crackdown he launched against Albanian extremists on
Feb. 28. Russia, a traditional Serb ally, has made similar appeals.
	   On Friday, two top Russian foreign ministry officials _ Nikolai
Afanasyevsky and Igor Ivanov _ flew to Belgrade and met with the
Yugoslav president. Milosevic's office said the Russians reaffirmed
Moscow's interest in a peaceful solution.
	   The advent of winter in less than two months has added urgency
to efforts to end the conflict. More than 230,000 people have been
displaced by the fighting, and about 50,000 of them are camped in
woods and fields in appalling conditions.
	   On Friday, Hugh Parmer of the U.S. Agency for International
Development announced an additional dlrs 21.8 million in food aid
for Kosovo's refugees. This is in addition to the dlrs 11 million
already provided by the U.S. government.
	   Parmer, speaking in Belgrade after a visit to Kosovo, said the
next five weeks are crucial to saving thousands of lives. He
described having seen ``babies ... being fed crumbled bread mixed
with dirty water for lack of any other, women and children living
in homemade plastic tents ... houses and wheat fields burning.''
	   ``But, we cannot wait for the diplomats and politicians to
finish,'' he added. ``We have a responsibility to produce on the
ground so that women, children and elderly do not die of
starvation.''

Lundstrom shoots career-best 63 to lead Emerald Coast
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with Friday play &QL; 
 &UR; By BILL KACZOR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILTON, Florida (AP) _ David Lundstrom shot a career-best,
7-under 63 for the first-round lead Friday in the Emerald Coast
Classic, only two days after Hurricane Earl drenched the course.
	   The first-year Senior PGA Tour player led by two strokes over
defending champion Isao Aoki. Leonard Thompson was three back at
66.
	   Lundstrom, who earned medalist honors in the Senior National
Qualifying Tournament last year, made seven birdies on the par-70,
6,760-yard (6,179-meters) Scottish-style course at The Moors Golf
Club.
	   ``I made a couple of bombs during the round,'' Lundstrom said.
``It's a whole different world then.''
	   Lundstrom, who won only dlrs 68,991 during an on-and-off career
on the regular PGA Tour, was basking in his first-round success.
	   ``If you don't enjoy your good shots in your good rounds, don't
mess with this game because the bad shots in the bad rounds will
beat you up too badly,'' he said.
	   ``I'm going to enjoy this day and hope to take some of the
positiveness from the putts, and some nice irons and some nice tee
shots, away from it and hope to repeat it a little more often.''
	   David Graham withdrew with chest discomfort at the fifth hole,
but was reported to be bothered by indigestion.
	   Eight golfers tied at 67, four strokes back: senior money leader
Hale Irwin, Babe Hiskey, Ed Dougherty, Simon Hobday, Bruce
Summerhays, Gil Morgan, Bob Duval and Jim Dent.
	   Hurricane Earl canceled the tournament's pro-am event Wednesday,
dumping four inches (10 centimeters) of rain on the course but
leaving it unharmed. Golfers teed off under blue skies in 90-degree
(32 Celsius) weather.
	   The storm, however, kept Thompson, who lives near Jacksonville,
from getting across Florida to the Panhandle until late Thursday.
He had to begin tournament play without a practice round or
preliminary event for the first time in his 30-year career.
	   ``I thought about every shot a little more than I normally would
have,'' Thompson said.
	   Lundstrom got in only nine holes of practice Thursday.
	   ``Practice rounds are overrated,'' he said.

Muscle builders: Do they work, are they safe?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The dietary supplement that baseball's Mark
McGwire uses to boost his strength has never been well-studied,
leaving doctors unsure how it works or how safe it is.
	   But because the supplement, androstenedione, is essentially a
building block of the male hormone testosterone, some researchers
believe it has risks, especially for young people going through
puberty who could face stunted growth or even liver damage.
	   ``If you're going to take something, basically, you have to know
the consequences. Mark McGwire is certainly old enough to make his
own decision, but we worry about the role model,'' said Dr. Gary A.
Green of the University of California at Los Angeles, who heads the
National Collegiate Athletic Association's drug testing committee.
	   Although allowed by baseball, androstenedione is banned by the
NCAA, where athletes face a one-year suspension for using it, and
by the National Football League and the Olympics.
	   The supplement, a precursor of testosterone, is a body
energizer. It is much safer than direct use of testosterone, but
even so, young people should not take it, says an advocate of the
supplement, Dr. Ward Dean, director of research and development for
Vitamin Research Products in Carson City, Nevada, which sells it.
	   ``High school students ... should not be taking this and the
reason is because it may cause premature closure of the growth
plates in bone (stunting their growth),'' Dean said. ``For sure,
people under 21 or so should not take it,'' he said, noting that
those age groups have naturally high levels of testosterone anyway.
	   McGwire says he has used androstenedione for more than a year.
Both he and his team note the supplement is a natural, legal
substance and insist there is no evidence of side effects.
	   But few studies have been done on its safety, or even on how it
works. Major league baseball and the players union have asked a
panel of doctors to gather research on the safety of
muscle-enhancing supplements in general.
	   A sports medicine specialist at Yale University, Dr. Peter Jokl
said it isn't certain that using androstenedione improves McGwire's
performance.
	   ``I don't know much data that would supplement the idea that it
makes him hit the ball farther,'' Jokl said. ``It may make him
stronger ... but in a sport such as baseball a lot of it is skill
and speed, and I'm not sure that a lot of those attributes are
emanating from any type of drug.''
	   Dr. Peter Bruno, the New York Knicks basketball team's doctor,
believes it's likely the liver just destroys androstenedione and it
probably has no effect.
	   ``However, if it does have an effect ... it would have all the
same bad effects as steroids,'' Bruno said. ``Simple things like
just getting acne ... causing 'roid' rage where you get aggressive,
and then all the problems in terms of liver or whatever would occur
with this drug.''
	   Androstenedione is a steroid. Anabolic steroids are hormones
that can help increase muscle mass. Injectable steroids are either
prohibited or tightly regulated.
	   However, certain forms taken by mouth are considered dietary
supplements, and a 1994 law banned the Food and Drug Administration
from regulating supplements.
	   Androstenedione and another muscle builder called DHEA are
building blocks for testosterone, said UCLA's Green.
	   ``If you take a little of it, probably not a lot happens ...,''
he said. ``If you start taking a lot of it, though, and enough of
it gets converted to testosterone, that would be the same effect as
taking testosterone.''
	   Testosterone itself is available only by prescription.
	   The 1994 law removed the FDA's authority to demand that
manufacturers prove their products are safe. Instead, to take them
off the market, the FDA must prove them dangerous. The dosage and
purity of the products is also not regulated.
	   ``People think that natural equates with safety,'' said Green.
``But you know, there's ... a lot of poisonous plants out there
that are natural, nicotine is natural ... cocaine and marijuana,
all of those things are natural. I think natural doesn't always
equate with safety.''

	   LONDON (AP) _ A Royal Navy helicopter ditched into the North Sea
Friday near to the site where a RAF fighter bomber crashed the day
before, the Ministry of Defense said.
	   The helicopter ditched into the sea 15 miles (25 kms) off the
Norfolk, eastern England, coast, a spokesman for the ministry,
speaking on conditions of customary anonymity, said.
	   The four crew members escaped without serious injury and were
picked up by a civilian helicopter before being flown to hospital
for checks.
	   The ministry said that an investigation into the accident had
been launched.
	   ``It's too early to speculate on what the helicopter was
doing,'' the spokesman said.
	   On Thursday, a Jaguar fighter bomber had been taking part in a
routine training flight with other Jaguars when it crashed into the
sea. The pilot ejected and was unhurt.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Searchers had few answers to offer
the many relatives arriving Friday and wondering what went wrong
aboard Swissair Flight 111: Surging tides were quickly spreading
debris of the shattered jet, and high-tech sonar failed to locate
its vital flight data recorders.
	   Exasperated authorities also warned curiosity-seekers to keep
their boats away from the scene and journalists not to intrude on
the privacy of relatives of the 229 crash victims. Everyone aboard
died in Wednesday night's crash off Nova Scotia's rocky coast.
	   A Canadian navy submarine equipped with high-tech sonar was
unable to trace the MD-11's flight data recorders, which are hoped
to provide clues to the cause of the crash.
	   Finding the devices may take time because a beacon that sends a
tracking signal to guide searchers to them was not working in the
water, Philippe Bruggisser, chief of Swissair's parent SAirGroup,
said in Geneva.
	   Divers and spotter planes joined the recovery effort, but debris
was steadily spreading. Body parts were washing up on beaches.
About 100 Canadian soldiers were out combing the shoreline.
	   ``We can't contain the debris,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Glenn
Chamberlain, one of the search coordinators. ``All we can do is try
to find it.''
	   Searchers had yet to find any piece of wreckage larger than the
roof of a car, raising concern that fully reconstructing the jet _
a tool helpful to determining what happened _ might be impossible.
	   ``If we do not find more than what we have today, there's no
talking about any kind of reconstruction,'' said Benoit Bouchard of
the Canadian Transportation Safety Board.
	   Sgt. Andre Geurtin of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said the
most significant find during Friday's search was about 100 mostly
intact pieces of luggage, probably from the plane's cargo hold.
	   Only at midday Friday did search coordinators formally state
what had seemed clear since Wednesday night _ that there were no
survivors among those aboard the New York-to-Geneva flight.
	   That announcement, coupled with the failure thus far to find the
plane's fuselage or flight recorders, gave authorities only
discouraging news to offer family members arriving from Europe and
the United States.
	   ``It was important for the victims' families, for whom it is
only natural to hold out one last hope, that we did everything
which could possibly be done to find survivors,'' said Rear Adm.
Dusty Miller, one of the search commanders. ``There is no longer a
last hope.''
	   Officials have stopped the body count at estimates of about 60,
largely because they are not recovering full corpses. ``It's a very
grisly scene out there,'' search coordinator Chamberlain said.
	   Chartered planes from New York and Switzerland arrived about 20
minutes apart Friday, bringing more than 250 relatives, grief
counselors and airline staff. The family members quickly were
escorted to a private area at customs. Many wore black. One couple
hugged each other; another woman clutched her chest while a
companion held her arm.
	   At search headquarters in the fishing village of Peggy's Cove,
authorities set up a row of green army tents overlooking the ocean
to provide some privacy for family members if they visit the site.
	   Muriel Provost of the regional Red Cross said the relatives
suffered a double trauma _ first learning of their loved ones'
deaths, then having to board a plane. ``That must have been a very
painful experience for some of them,'' she said.
	   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said it would help arrange
press briefings by relatives willing to make statements, but warned
journalists not to intrude on those who wished to be left alone.
	   ``If anyone forces themselves on family members, it won't be
tolerated,'' Staff Sgt. Keith McGuire said.
	   McGuire also said police were becoming exasperated with members
of the public, both on shore and in boats, venturing into the
search area to look for debris. He said such intruders face arrest
and seizure of their boats if they disobey orders to stay out.
	   Vic Gerden, who heads the Canadian Transportation Safety Board
investigation into the crash, said investigators have listened to
the tapes of the plane's last conversation with air traffic
controllers. He described the conversations as ``professional at
all times.''
	   The MD-11 dropped off radar screens 90 minutes after leaving New
York's Kennedy International Airport.
	   After a normal takeoff, the crew reported smoke in the cockpit
and decided to turn back to Boston. When they spoke to Canadian
controllers in Moncton, New Brunswick, they were told the Halifax
airport was much closer. The plane never made it to Halifax,
crashing into the ocean 30 miles (50 kilometers) to the south after
dumping much of its fuel.
	   According to Gerden, the plane descended rapidly while trying to
reach Halifax airport and made a couple of rough circles over the
coast while dumping fuel.

Hingis rallies to advance in U.S. Open

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The predicament was familiar, and so was Martina
Hingis' response.
	   Down by a set against Amelie Mauresmo for the second time this
summer, the world's top player ran off an impressive streak again
Friday to reach the fourth round of the U.S. Open.
	   The top-seeded Hingis, who had not lost a set in the U.S. Open
since 1996, rallied to defeat Mauresmo 4-6, 6-2, 6-2 as most of the
seeded women and men continued moving easily through the
tournament.
	   Only two seeded women have been eliminated so far, and only
three seeded men have lost.
	   Hingis trailed Mauresmo by a set and 4-1 in the second set of a
Federation Cup match in Switzerland in July before rallying to win.
This time, Hingis was down by a set and tied 1-1 in the second
before winning 11 of the last 14 games.
	   ``The first set I guess I was still in practice,'' Hingis said.
``Then I said to myself, `Hey, girl, wake up. You don't want to go
back home.'''
	   Hingis had six double faults and was out-aced 5-1 by Mauresmo,
but never seemed worried. During a changeover early in the second
set, Hingis mentioned to a ballgirl that she liked her uniform.
	   Jana Novotna, no longer burdened by past failures, is a
Wimbledon champion with a lot less on her mind these days. As she
advances, Novotna finally is doing something that once seemed so
remote _ having fun.
	   Novotna, who beat Sandrine Testud 6-2, 6-3 to reach the fourth
round, until this summer had been known mostly for defeats in
Wimbledon finals in 1993 and 1997 in which she squandered big
leads.
	   ``I think that after winning Wimbledon, yes, I have completed my
career,'' she said. ``An enormous dream came true for me and I am
just looking forward to playing more and enjoying it more. I am
just feeling incredibly relieved and just happy of what I have
achieved.''
	   The Wimbledon title not only changed Novotna's attitude, but
also the way she is perceived by opponents.
	   ``I think now since I am Wimbledon champion, I feel more respect
from the other players while I am on the court,'' she said. ``Even
when I am losing, I see on the face of the other players that they
are not really sure if they can really win it.''
	   Also advancing with little trouble to the fourth round was No. 6
Monica Seles, who won 6-3, 6-3 over Annie Miller. Seles is one
victory from a probable encounter with Hingis in the quarterfinals.
	   Steffi Graf reached the fourth round with a 6-1, 6-1 victory in
43 minutes over Mirjana Lucic in which she won nine straight games.
Graf, the No. 8 seed, made just seven unforced errors to 33 for
Lucic.
	   Lucic had eight double faults, often missing serves by several
feet. At one point in the second set, she stood at the service line
and shrugged.
	   When Lucic whiffed on a serve by Graf in the final game of the
match, a fan yelled ``strike one,'' a derisive reference to
baseball.
	   ``It was like a nightmare, that's what it was like out there
today,'' Lucic said. ``I totally missed the ball, that didn't
happen when I was 3 1/2 years old.''

 &UR; Eds: SUBS lede and 7th graf pvs: McGwire says ..., to include his
reasons for taking androstenedione. &QL; 
 &UR; By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The dietary supplement that baseball's Mark
McGwire uses to recover from injuries and boost his strength has
never been well-studied, leaving doctors unsure how it works or how
safe it is.
	   But because the supplement, androstenedione, is essentially a
building block of the male hormone testosterone, some researchers
believe it has risks, especially for young people going through
puberty who could face stunted growth or even liver damage.
	   ``If you're going to take something, basically, you have to know
the consequences. Mark McGwire is certainly old enough to make his
own decision, but we worry about the role model,'' said Dr. Gary A.
Green of the University of California at Los Angeles, who heads the
National Collegiate Athletic Association's drug testing committee.
	   Although allowed by baseball, androstenedione is banned by the
NCAA, where athletes face a one-year suspension for using it, and
by the National Football League and the Olympics.
	   The supplement, a precursor of testosterone, is a body
energizer. It is much safer than direct use of testosterone, but
even so, young people should not take it, says an advocate of the
supplement, Dr. Ward Dean, director of research and development for
Vitamin Research Products in Carson City, Nevada, which sells it.
	   ``High school students ... should not be taking this and the
reason is because it may cause premature closure of the growth
plates in bone (stunting their growth),'' Dean said. ``For sure,
people under 21 or so should not take it,'' he said, noting that
those age groups have naturally high levels of testosterone anyway.
	   McGwire says he has used androstenedione for more than a year to
recover quicker from minor injuries. Both he and his team note the
supplement is a natural, legal substance and insist there is no
evidence of side effects.

	   ROAD TOWN, British Virgin Islands (AP) _ British Foreign Office
Minister Baroness Symons will make her first visit to the Caribbean
next week since her appointment as Minister for Overseas
Territories.
	   She is schueduled to meet with the executive councils of the
Turks and Caicos Islands on Sept. 8-10 and the British Virgin
Islands Sept. 10-11.
	   Symons will discuss a broad range of issues and will focus on
the efforts of the terriorial governments to combat drug
trafficking.
	   The drug trade has been a point of contention between Britain
and its territories. Many in the islands contend that London
focuses too much on drug trafficking and ignores issues of
importance to the islanders, such as citizenship and economic
assistance.
	   Baroness Symons has been Minister for the Caribbean since May
1997. She was appointed as Minister for the Overseas Territories in
February 1998.

 &UR; SURINAME: Dispute over appointments may set criminal suspects free &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ The attorney general faces a 1
billion guilder (dlrs 1.7 million U.S.) fine and 19 suspected
criminals, including nine accused of murder, may be set free
because of a dispute between the president and the courts.
	   The judicial system in this South American country has been
disrupted because the nation's high court has ruled that two
appointments by President Jules Wijdenbosch were done improperly.
Wijdenbosch insists he has done nothing wrong and refuses to submit
the nominations again.
	   Now, the standoff is beginning to have effects beyond the
political sphere.
	   The courts do not recognize Attorney General Heloise Rozenblad,
so they are not proceeding with criminal cases. When the time limit
for holding suspects expires, they must be released.
	   One suspect was ordered released this week by a judge, who
imposed a 5 million guilder (dlrs 8,500 U.S.) fine for every hour
Rozenblad delayed in releasing him. The fine added up to 1 billion
guilders (dlrs 1.7 million U.S.) before his release.
 &UR; BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS: British Foreign Office Minister to visit
	   ROAD TOWN, British Virgin Islands (AP) _ British Foreign Office
Minister Baroness Symons will make her first visit to the Caribbean
next week since her appointment as Minister for Overseas
Territories.
	   She is schueduled to meet with the executive councils of the
Turks and Caicos Islands on Sept. 8-10 and the British Virgin
Islands Sept. 10-11.
	   Symons will discuss a broad range of issues and will focus on
the efforts of the terriorial governments to combat drug
trafficking.
	   The drug trade has been a point of contention between Britain
and its territories. Many in the islands contend that London
focuses too much on drug trafficking and ignores issues of
importance to the islanders, such as citizenship and economic
assistance.
	   Baroness Symons has been Minister for the Caribbean since May
1997. She was appointed as Minister for the Overseas Territories in
February 1998.

Chile formally protests Swiss denial to extradite fugitive
</HEADLINE>
guerrilla

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ The Chilean government on Thursday filed
a protest with Switzerland after the European nation refused to
extradite a leftist guerrilla convicted in the assassination of a
police officer here.
	   The text of the protest handed by Foreign Minister Jose Miguel
Insulza to Swiss charge d'affairs Jean-Jacques Joris was not
immediately known, but officials said Chile was especially upset
because Swiss authorities said the safety of fugitive Patricio
Ortiz was not guaranteed if he was extradited to Chile.
	   President Eduardo Frei, talking to Chilean reporters during a
state visit to Panama, said his government strongly rejects that
claim. One day earlier Chile withdrew its ambassador to Switzerland
to express displeasure.
	   Ortiz was allowed to stay in Switzerland temporarily, according
to the Swiss Office for Refugees, but his appeal for political
asylum was turned down. The decision is valid for 12 months but may
be changed.
	   As he left the foreign ministry today, charge d'affaire Joris
said ``the commitment of Chile and its present government to
democracy and its respect of human rights is not in doubt.''
	   ``We expect this bad situation will be overcome soon, and our
relations will go back to its fruitful normalcy,'' he added.
	   Ortiz was one of four urban guerrillas who staged a daring
helicopter escape from a maximum security prison in Santiago on
Dec. 31, 1996, and then flew to Switzerland, where he was traced by
Chilean authorities. The whereabouts of the others remain unknown.
	   The four were members of a pro-communist guerrilla created in
the 80s to fight the dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
	   Rightist politicians also reacted angrily to the Swiss decision
and urged the government here to break diplomatic relations.

Lundstrom shoots career-best 63 to lead Emerald Coast
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES throughout with Graham taken to hospital, spokesman
comment &QL; 
 &UR; By BILL KACZOR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILTON, Florida (AP) _ David Lundstrom shot a career-best,
7-under-par 63 for the first-round lead Friday in the Emerald Coast
Classic, just two days after Hurricane Earl drenched the course.
	   David Graham, who withdrew with chest discomfort at the fifth
hole, was taken to Sacred Heart Hospital in Pensacola for
observation. Hospital spokesman Mike Burke said Graham ``underwent
a series of tests. He is feeling better, resting comfortably and he
will be released tomorrow.''
	   Despite reports of a heart attack, Burke said ``it appears he
did not'' suffer one.
	   Graham, 52, who had eight victories on the PGA Tour and four as
a senior, including the Royal Caribbean Classic in February, is
11th on this year's money list with dlrs 719,838.
	   Lundstrom, a rookie on the senior tour, led by two strokes over
defending champion Isao Aoki and three over Leonard Thompson.
	   Lundstrom, who earned medalist honors in the Senior National
Qualifying Tournament last year, made seven birdies on the
6,760-yard (6,179-meter) Scottish-style course at The Moors Golf
Club.
	   ``I made a couple of bombs during the round,'' Lundstrom said.
``It's a whole different world then.''
	   Lundstrom, who won only dlrs 68,991 during an on-and-off career
on the regular PGA Tour, was basking in his first-round success.
	   ``If you don't enjoy your good shots in your good rounds, don't
mess with this game because the bad shots in the bad rounds will
beat you up too badly,'' he said.
	   ``I'm going to enjoy this day and hope to take some of the
positiveness from the putts, and some nice irons and some nice tee
shots, away from it and hope to repeat it a little more often.''

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A late burst of bargain-hunting halted a sharp
decline for the second straight session Friday as Wall Street
seesawed into the conclusion of a volatile, bruising week. The Dow
Jones industrial average dropped 41.97 points _ or 0.5 percent _ at
7,640.25 after charging back over the final half hour from a
186-point slide. The small drop left the Dow almost exactly 1,700
points, or about 18 percent, below the July 17 record of 9,337.97.
(US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. unemployment rate held steady at 4.5
percent in August as other manufacturing job losses outweighed the
return to work of laborers affected by strikes at General Motors
earlier this summer. August's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate
was the same as in June and July, when about 150,000 workers in
automotive and other factories were either on strike or laid off
because of strike-related production slowdowns, the Labor
Department said Friday. Although most of the strike-idled workers
returned to work in August, the unemployment rate did not recover
to the 4.3 percent low of April and May _ the best since 1970.
``Overall, I still believe that the fundamental underpinnings of
this economy are very strong and very steady, but clearly we are
seeing the effects of the Asian situation,'' said Labor Secretary
Alexis Herman. (US-ECONOMY)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Top finance officials from Latin America hope
to show world markets their economies are sufficiently healthy to
withstand the global financial crisis, Argentina's Finance Minister
Roque Fernandez said Friday. He also said some of his colleagues
attending the two-day meeting at the International Monetary Fund
thought that the crisis might be eased if the U.S. Federal Reserve
Board reduced interest rates ``but would not be a definitive
solution.'' As the ministers and central bank governors resumed
their talks, Fernandez told a news conference, '' Our (economic)
situation is not the same as Russia or Asia and we hope the way we
described it in our statement will help the markets make that
differentiation'' (IMF-GLOBAL CRISIS)
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ With interest rates surging and demand
plummeting, Mexican bankers said Friday they had temporarily
stopped lending money to consumers for purchases of cars and homes.
``Under current market conditions, it's better to wait and see,''
said Araceli Espinosa of Grupo Financiero BBV-Probursa. Mexico's
financial markets have been battered by the turmoil that rattled
Asia and now Russia. The national currency, the peso, has been
tumbling to new lows almost daily. On Friday, it closed at a
midrate of 10.2200 to the dollar, off the 10.1350 of the previous
day. The stock market, too, has been shaken, and interest rates
have jumped. (MEXICO-BANK LOANS)
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's economic crisis is worsening and
the government must take another look at measures such as reducing
wages and other business costs, ministers told Parliament on Friday
as they revealed new figures on bad loans and unemployment.
Non-performing domestic loans rose from December to June totaled
5.4 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 3.07 billion), representing 3.9
percent of the six banking groups' domestic loans, Deputy Prime
Minister Lee Hsien Loong said. That is an increase of 2.3 percent
from December. Singapore banks have not made public the extent of
their exposure to bad loans in Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and
other countries going through various stages of financial collapse.
But many banks made provisions of more than 30 percent this year to
cover the foreign non-performing loans. (SINGAPORE-ECONOMY)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The ruble tumbled some more Friday, inflation was
rising sharply and the government tried to placate angry Russians
by reversing an order to freeze personal accounts at the country's
largest retail banks. The official ruble rate fell to 16.99 to the
U.S. dollar, or 5.8 cents, down from 13.46 to the dollar, or 7.4
cents, on Thursday. The street level was even lower. Acting Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said the government would continue to
let market forces determine the currency's value _ even though it
will mean higher prices. He vowed to implement austere monetary
policies to save the ruble, and said the government would resist
calls to print more rubles unless they are backed by a rise in
foreign exchange reserves. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Under increasing pressure from the
financial crisis in neighboring Russia, the Ukrainian government on
Friday effectively devalued its hryvna currency by announcing a
new, wider trading corridor. As of Friday, the Ukrainian Central
Bank will keep the hryvna within a range of 2.5 to 3.5 to the
dollar, the Cabinet and National Bank said in a joint statement.
``The devaluation of (the Russian) ruble and loss of stability in
neighboring markets have forced Ukraine to take adequate steps in
response,'' National Bank chief Viktor Yushchenko said.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Searchers had few answers to offer
the many relatives arriving Friday and wondering what went wrong
aboard Swissair Flight 111: Surging tides were quickly spreading
debris of the shattered jet, and high-tech sonar failed to locate
its vital flight data recorders. Exasperated authorities also
warned curiosity-seekers to keep their boats away from the scene
and journalists not to intrude on the privacy of relatives of the
229 crash victims. Everyone aboard died in Wednesday night's crash
off Nova Scotia's rocky coast. A Canadian navy submarine equipped
with high-tech sonar was unable to trace the MD-11's flight data
recorders, which are hoped to provide clues to the cause of the
crash. (CANADA-PLANE CRASH)
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton said for the
first time Friday ``I'm sorry'' about his affair with Monica
Lewinsky, describing his behavior as indefensible as he sought to
calm the growing storm that has shaken his presidency. Less than 24
hours after a Democratic ally took to the Senate floor to denounce
Clinton's conduct as immoral and urge a public rebuke, the
president said, ``I can't disagree with anyone else who wants to be
critical of what I have already acknowledged was indefensible.''
Clearly uncomfortable addressing the matter on an international
stage, Clinton would not discuss the possibility of a congressional
censure. A senior presidential adviser said White House aides had
come to the conclusion that the situation was so bad that a censure
was probably the best outcome they could hope for.
(CLINTON-LEWINSKY)
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ In the first sentence by an
international court for genocide, a U.N. tribunal on Friday ordered
a former Rwandan prime minister to serve life in prison for the
slaughter of more than 500,000 of his countrymen in 1994. Jean
Kambanda, the highest-ranking former political leader in the
tribunal's custody, stood stoically as the three-judge panel
rejected his pleas for leniency in order to send a strong signal
that genocide will not be tolerated. ``Jean Kambanda abused his
authority and the trust of the population,'' said Chief Judge Laity
Kama of Senegal. ``Nor has he expressed contrition, regret, or
sympathy for the victims in Rwanda even when given the
opportunity.'' Gasps of relief rippled through the audience, many
of whom were Rwandans who survived the three-month killing frenzy.
They had waited nearly four years for the tribunal to sentence its
first convict. (RWANDA-GENOCIDE TRIBUNAL)
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels are considering a proposal
to hold peace talks with the government and several neighboring
countries despite their objections to Zimbabwe's desire to host and
mediate the discussions, a rebel leader said Friday. Zimbabwean
officials said Thursday they were preparing for two days of talks
at the northwestern resort of Victoria Falls, probably starting
Monday. However, Congolese rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba said
the discussions must be mediated by a neutral country, apparently
ruling out Zimbabwe, which has sent 2,800 troops to Congo to
bolster President Laurent Kabila's fight against the rebels. The
outside military support enabled Kabila to beat back rebel advances
on the capital, Kinshasa. ``We're in favor of negotiations, but we
haven't got formal invitation yet,'' said Wamba. (CONGO)
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea denied Friday that it
launched a ballistic missile this week, saying it fired its first
artificial satellite into orbit. Japan's prime minister disputed
the account. U.S. officials say North Korea test fired a Taepo Dong
1 ballistic missile on Monday that flew across northern Japan and
crashed into the Pacific Ocean. The first stage landed in the Sea
of Japan. A Foreign Ministry statement criticized the United States
and Japan for making a ``fuss'' over the North's launch of a
``scientific satellite.'' ``Some people ... are making a fuss,
ignorant of this valuable success of science and technology,'' the
statement said. ``They suspected it to be a ballistic missile
launching test, expressed some `apprehensions' and described it as
`a serious event.''' (NKOREA-SATELLITE LAUNCH)

Jones looks to end season undefeated
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Meet starts at 1300 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Can Marion Jones be defeated?
	   The American has been perfect in 1998, winning every event she's
entered _ be it the 100 meters, the 200 meters, the long jump or
even a 60-meter race _ en route to putting herself on the verge of
a six-figure payday.
	   Jones, who is still only 22, was one of four athletes still in
the running for a share of the dlrs 1 million Golden League jackpot
heading into Saturday's IAAF Grand Prix Finals at the refurbished
Luzhniki Olympic Stadium.
	   Bryan Bronson (400-meter hurdles), Hicham El Guerrouj (1,500
meters) and Haile Gebrselassie (3,000) also arrived in Moscow
unbeaten in their specialties.
	   A total of 17 reigning Olympic or world champions were to
compete, putting aside concerns about security or the impropriety
of competing for huge prizes in a country gripped by an economic
and political crisis.
	   ``The people here have other things to worry about,'' said
Bronson, who edged world champion Stephane Diagana of France in a
photo finish Tuesday at Berlin for his 17th straight win. ``I
wouldn't feel bad if the stadium was empty, if nobody was there. If
people pay their last dollar for a track meet ... it seems very
indecent.''
	   Bronson and El Guerrouj were among about 50 athletes who signed
a petition last week urging the International Amateur Athletic
Federation to switch venues. But with extra security ensured, most
competitors showed.
	   Of the big-name qualifiers for the Finals, only sprinters
Michael Johnson, Maurice Greene and Ato Boldon withdrew, for what
the IAAF said were personal reasons.
	   Officials said only 2,000 of the 80,000 tickets for the meet
were for sale, at 70 rubles (about dlrs 4.10) each. The others were
distributed free, mainly to school children, according to Oleg
Kurbatov, press officer for the local organizing committee.
	   Jones was the main attraction.
	   The 100 meters world champion has been particularly dominant in
that event, turning in eight of the year's 10 fastest times.
Florence Griffith Joyner _ whose world record of 10.49 seconds in
1988 was once thought untouchable _ is the only woman to ever run
faster than the 10.71 Jones has clocked twice.
	   Jones leads Russian middle-distance runner Svetlana Masterkova
of Russia 88-83 in the women's overall Grand Prix standings, while
on the men's side, El Guerrouj holds a six-point lead over Bronson,
94-88, by virtue of the bonus the Moroccan received for breaking
the 1,500 world record in July.
	   Victories by Jones in the 100 and the long jump would net her
dlrs 50,000 for each, plus wrap up no less than a quarter of the
jackpot and another dlrs 200,000 for the women's overall title.
That adds up to dlrs 550,000. If any of the three men lose their
event for the first time this season, her share increases.
	   The IAAF also put up a dlrs 100,000 bonus for a world record.

Zanardi leads provisional qualifying for Molson-Indy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Motorsports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ Alex Zanardi gave the new
Vancouver Molson-Indy layout a thorough test Friday and found it to
his liking.
	   The Italian, who is well on the way to a second consecutive CART
FedEx Series title, was the only driver able to crack 100 miles per
hour on the 1.802-mile (2.9-kilometer), 14-turn temporary street
circuit winding around Concord Pacific Place in downtown Vancouver.
	   ``It's a good improvement from last year,'' said Zanardi, who
will try to nail down his first pole of the season when qualifying
winds up Saturday. ``It's not exactly as wide as it looked when I
was walking around it on Monday.
	   ``I thought, `Oh boy, we should be able to get around people out
there without them holding you up or giving you problems.' But, at
170 miles per hour, the road gets pretty narrow. It's going to be
pretty tough to pass somebody, especially if you don't get their
cooperation.''
	   In the 10th year of the race here, 85 percent of the course was
revised because of construction that has either taken place or is
pending. The bulk of the track was moved from the west side of
Concord property to the east side.
	   Zanardi, who heads into Sunday's race with at least an 80-point
lead over Target-Chip Ganassi Racing teammate Jimmy Vasser _ he can
add one more to the margin by winning the pole _ led provisional
qualifying with a lap clocking in at 64.838 seconds.
	   If he can add nine points to that lead this week, Zanardi, who
is expected to announce shortly his return to Formula One next
season, will clinch the championship with four races remaining.
	   ``As I've said before, life is smiling to me right now,'' said
Zanardi, who has won a series-high six races so far this season and
who is about to become a father for the first time. ``Every moment
of my life, not just in racing, is good right now.''
	   Zanardi has 10 career poles _ all in his first two seasons in
CART _ but he hasn't been able to win one this year, a fact that
has Zanardi shaking his head in wonder.
	   Gil de Ferran, who was third in qualifying, joked that Zanardi
was just giving everybody else a chance.
	   ``No,'' Zanardi said. ``I'm trying as hard as I ever have. But
if it's going to be a trade, I'm glad it happened this way and we
won more races. Maybe it's just that we've been working on the race
setup so hard that we've lost a little track of (qualifying).''
	   Dario Franchitti, coming off a victory two weeks ago at Elkhart
Lake, Wis., was close behind the leader at 64.958 seconds, followed
by de Ferran at 65.010, Christian Fittipaldi at 65.325 and local
favorites, Canadians Greg Moore and Paul Tracy at 65.434 and
65.514.
	   De Ferran said the new track was a little daunting in places.
	   ``Yesterday, after walking around the track, I was a little
concerned with some safety issues,'' the Brazilian explained.
``After driving it today, I enjoy it. It's a better layout than the
old one _ more fun. But it's a little dangerous.''
	   Defending race winner Mauricio Gugelmin, who has not won since,
was eighth at 65.680, while the struggling Vasser, last year's
runner-up on the old 1.703-mile (2.74-kilometer) course, was well
off the pace in 20th at 66.295.
	   Also far back in the tentative 28-car field was four-time race
winner Al Unser Jr., who was 23rd at 67.052.
	   Zanardi, who won the pole in each of his two previous visits to
Vancouver, set the record on the old track in 1996. But he finished
26th as a rookie two years ago and was fourth last September.
	   ``This place has been very bitter to me the last two years,'' he
said. ``I had the car to do the job in `96 and again in `97, and it
appears so far I have the same thing this year. Hopefully, we'll
have better results.''

	   PRESCOTT, Arizona (AP) _ Stop in one of the watering holes on
Whiskey Row these days and you're more likely to see tourists with
hip packs than the drunken carousers and gunslingers who gave this
area its delightfully seamy reputation.
	   But look and listen closely and the Old West radiates from the
old wood, the brass rails and the occasional old-timer you'll see
in the five historic bars that remain along Prescott's courthouse
square. Some of the stories are true, some legend. None are boring.
	   At the Palace saloon, you'll hear about the night of July 14,
1900, when a wind-driven fire threatened Whiskey Row. According to
local legend, drunken patrons decided the Palace's grand wooden bar
was too precious to lose, so they took it apart and ran the pieces
to a safe place.
	   Good thing they did. The Palace burned that night along with the
rest of Whiskey Row. But today you can belly up to the bar that is
generally believed to have been rebuilt from the rescued pieces.
	   Whiskey Row has long been a magnet for bad guys and wannabe bad
boys, dating back to the days when Prescott hummed as a center for
mining, ranching and timber in the growing Arizona territory.
Whiskey Row was where many a colorful character went to let off
steam.
	   ``This is the true West,'' said Dave Michelson, owner of the
Palace. ``Disneyland spends millions of dollars trying to recreate
Frontier Land, but this is the real thing.''
	   Today, five bars are left on Whiskey Row. The saloon girls are
gone, as are the card tables. But behind the swinging doors, places
like the Palace look almost exactly as they did when they reopened
after the fire of 1900.
	   Tourists are hard-pressed to turn down the chance to raise a
glass with the ghosts of the past.
	   ``Where I live, people think this is all myth _ out of the
movies,'' said Bill Murray of Ontario, Canada, as he sipped a cold
beer at the Palace. ``Just to sit in this place, you feel the
history. I can't get over how much they've been able to preserve
it. It's unbelievable.''
	   At the Palace, which first opened in 1877, whiskey and beer once
sold for 12 1-2 cents, Michelson said. During Prohibition,
customers would drink at the speakeasy in the basement while
waiting for their turn in the bordello upstairs.
	   Like the Palace, most of the original buildings along the
courthouse plaza were wood-frame structures before the fire. The
blaze burned through five blocks in just four hours. It took a back
burn started by a dynamite explosion to stop it.
	   Some business owners gave up, but most rebuilt. By 1901, Whiskey
Row, which is officially named Montezuma Street, was reborn as the
brick and cement series of bars and businesses that it is today.
	   Another place for tourists to stop is the Hotel St. Michael at
the end of the block. It advertised itself as ``Prescott's only
fireproof hotel'' before the turn of the century, said Mya Beckley,
director of sales for the hotel.
	   In 1900, it burned with the rest of Whiskey Row.
	   The hotel was promptly rebuilt after the 1900 fire into a
three-story, red-brick building complete with gargoyles. According
to hotel legend, Beckley said, the architects wanted to add a
fourth floor but was turned down by the city council, and the
gargoyles wound up modeled after the councilmen.
	   Like many Whiskey Row legends, there's an alternate version of
the gargoyle story. Lucy Geib, a tour coordinator for the Prescott
Chamber of Commerce, said another story has the gargoyles
resembling a group of hecklers who made fun of the builders
throughout the project. No one in Prescott had seen a three-story
building and the hecklers doubted the St. Michael would stay up.

Ammaccapane takes first-round lead

<TEXT>
	   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) _ Danielle Ammaccapane shot a 7-under-par 65
to take a three-stroke lead after the first round of the dlrs
600,000 LPGA Safeway Golf Championship.
	   Ammaccapane continued her up-and-down season on Friday by making
birdies on five of her first nine holes on the 6,294-yard
(5,753-meter) Columbia-Edgewater Country Club.
	   Laurie Rinker-Graham, playing in just her 14th tournament this
season after giving birth to a son 10 months ago, was one stroke
behind, tied with Emilee Klein, Dale Eggeling and Pat Hurst.
	   Ammaccapane has been erratic since winning the Mercury
Titleholders Championship in March. She missed two cuts and didn't
finish higher than 11th before finishing fourth at the U.S. Women's
Open in July.
	   Ammaccapane, who started on the back nine, birdied two of her
first four holes, including the par-3, 155-yard (141-meter) 13th.
She then birdied three of the four holes on the back nine to
overtake Rinker-Graham, Klein and Eggeling. On the front nine,
Ammaccapane had pars on her first four holes, birdied the next two
and finished at par.
	   ``It was a good round of golf today. Not too much went wrong,''
said Ammaccapane, who set the course record of 64 here in 1990,
matched in 1992 by Jen Crafter.
	   Three players were tied at 69 _ Sweden's Charlotta Sorenstam,
Penny Hammel and Tina Barrett, who began the day with an eagle on
No. 1, a 360-yard (329-meter) par-4, but lost the momentum with
four bogeys.
	   Rinker-Graham, who has taken her son, Timothy, on all but one of
her 14 tour stops this season, was five under heading to her final
hole, but she hooked her tee shot left into a bunker and two-putted
for bogey.
	   ``This is probably one of my best ball-striking days,'' said
Rinker-Graham, whose 68 beat her season low by a stroke. ``I made
putts, and putting obviously makes the difference.''
	   Rinker-Graham, who started on the back nine, made birdie putts
of 30 feet (9 meters) on her 13th hole and 20 feet (6 meters) on
the 16th, both par-3s. She also saved par on her sixth hole with a
20-footer (6-meter shot).
	   Since rejoining the tour in April, Rinker-Graham's best finish
was 26th at the Michelob Light Classic in June and at the U.S.
Open. For that tournament, she won dlrs 12,972 of her season total
of dlrs 42,298. The top prize at the Safeway is dlrs 90,000.
	   South Korea's Se Ri Pak, a shoo-in for rookie of the year,
stumbled with a 37 on the front nine, but recovered to finish at
even-par 72. Donna Andrews, the tour's third-leading money winner,
also shot a 72.
	   Many players said the greens at Columbia-Edgewater, baked by an
abnormally rain-free Portland August and early September, were
playing faster than any they'd seen all season.
	   ``I love putting on these greens,'' Klein said. ``We don't get
to play greens like these very often.''
	   Pak, whose reputation as a perfectionist is now well-known, was
frustrated at the greens' quickness and unpredictability. She
three-putted three times and sounded ready to write off the rest of
the tournament as practice for next week's SAFECO Classic in Kent,
Wash.
	   ``Really fast greens. I don't believe it,'' said Pak, second on
the money list behind Annika Sorenstam, who is not in the
144-player field. ``The practice putting greens not that fast.
	   ``Two days left, so ... I don't care. Good practice.''
	   Klein started out with a birdie on No. 3, hitting an 8-iron to
the back fringe and making a 30-foot putt. She bogeyed at No. 6,
then was steady the rest of the day, finishing with only two missed
greens.
	   Eggeling, a 22-year tour veteran, also was consistent, bogeying
just her seventh hole, the par-3 16th.

<TEXT>
	   ALTOS DEL VALLE, Argentina (AP) _ Of all places, South America
is getting a run on sled dogs.
	   Thanks to ``Gato'' Curuchet _ whose nickname means ``Cat'' _ and
who lives amicably with 42 sled dogs and one part-Arctic wolf in
Tierra del Fuego at the southernmost tip of South America.
	   He hopes to inspire interest in sled dogs South of the Border.
Way South, just some 450 miles (720 kilometers) north of the
Antarctic peninsula.
	   Clad in a parka, blue jeans and leather boots, the 45-year-old
Curuchet plays the part of a Snowman of South America, racing his
dogs amid snowswept mountain peaks here in the ``Valley of the
Huskies.''
	   ``Vamos chicos!'' Curuchet shouts as five of his Siberian
Huskies, their leg muscles bulging, leap in their nylon harnesses
and yank Curuchet and his sled down a snowy path. ``Let's go,
boys!''
	   Their hind legs kicking up ice slivers, the Huskies were off,
racing and yelping across a winter landscape.
	   ``We want sled dog racing to grow as a sport here. Before there
weren't sled dogs here,'' explains Curuchet, an Argentine from a
central Buenos Aires province who came in the early 70s, built his
cabin, married and settled down.
	   But this is hardly ``settling down.''
	   Curuchet runs a two-week Sled Dog School in winters. Some 32
youngsters ages 6-14 took part this year with Monday-Friday
lessons. They learned to harness the dogs, handle them with voice
commands and run small plastic sleds.
	   ``They start by getting to know the dog, getting the sled ready
and hitching up the dogs. In two weeks they can manage a short
circuit,'' says Curuchet, whose wood cabin is warmed by an old iron
stove.
	   Curuchet brought his first two Siberian Huskies from North
America nearly a decade ago, and some Alaskan dogs afterward. He's
brought more dogs since and they've multiplied.
	   He says he learned a lot from Indians in Alaska and sled-dog
enthusiasts in Minnesota and has worked hard to transplant the
atmosphere to this valley outside Ushuaia, Argentina, the
southernmost city on the planet.
	   It is cold here in winter, which comes during the North American
summer. Gales blow up frequently. Even without the dogs it is a
compelling scene of snowy beauty.
	   ``It's beautiful here. You feel like Jack London!'' Curuchet
exclaims as he steps out from a cabin whose rafters are hung with
old snowshoes and cross-country skis.
	   Learning about sled dogs came the hard way.
	   ``I'd tell the dogs to go one way and they'd go another and take
me whipping through the trees,'' he says. ``It was hard at first.
Dogs themselves are a job to train. At six months they get a nylon
harness. Next they are taught to pull a small branch, then
increasingly larger loads.''
	   It also took a long time to master sled-making. Never mind the
tips gleaned from experts in North America.
	   But now he easily presses long, slender strips of beechwood into
heavy presses to form the curving sled rails. Later he'll add
plastic sheeting atop two rails, a platform to hold food for the
driver and sacks of meat, proteins and vitamins for the dogs.
	   ``The dog is like an athlete: They are pure muscle, pure
fiber,'' he says, nuzzling one of the leaders, Moluk, age 11.
	   Moluk, whose thick gray hair masks powerful shoulders, has one
brown eye and the other an exotic pale blue.
	   The dog is one of the favorites for leading tourists. Cuchuret
can lead as many as six visitors at a time on 12-mile
(19-kilometer) sled dog jaunts.
	   Curuchet takes the lead sled, and the tourists follow with sleds
behind, once they are taught how to shout commands for left, right
and stop.
	   Along the trail, visitors join him in eating portions of dried
meat and trail mix blended with dollops of honey.
	   Riding a dog sled, Curuchet says, one learns to commune with the
wilderness and the wild.
	   ``With the sled you strike up an understanding between you and
your dogs,'' he says. ``It's a communion as you are constantly
forging a bond with the animals.''

Scenic solitude lures nature lovers and artists to Monhegan Island

	   MONHEGAN ISLAND, Maine (AP) _ Cedar-shake houses, the color of
weathered grey, ring a tiny harbor _ spreading from the shoreline
midway up an island hillside. Purple lupines, pink sea roses, and
golden black-eyed susans sprout in patches wherever there is soil.
Along the hill's top, deep-green fir trees bristle in the warm sun
commanding a wispy-blue sky.
	   Monhegan Island's Technicolor landscape 10 miles (16 kilometers)
off the coast of Maine lures people like Andy Benoit, a physician
and painter who comes four times a summer.
	   ``You're far enough away from the shore that you see the colors
more vivid,'' Benoit said as he painted Monhegan's village from its
pebble-sand and sea-glass Fish Beach. ``At dusk is the best.''
	   For more than 100 years, artists, naturalists, hikers and
rusticators have descended on Monhegan Island's tiny village of
tuna fishers and lobstermen to enjoy its simple solitude, 17 miles
(27 kilometers) of rocky trails and wildlife including 600 kinds of
wildflowers and 200 species of birds.
	   From late spring to mid-autumn, people, cargo, and U.S. mail
crowd the Monhegan Boat Line's dock at Port Clyde three times a
day, waiting to board the ``Laura B'' or ``Elizabeth Ann'' ferries.
	   About halfway through the hour-long ferry ride, what appears to
be a huge sperm whale rests on the surface of the brisk Atlantic.
That whale is actually a great island hill covered by evergreen
forest and encircled by a high, rocky shore. A massive,
moss-covered rock is what looked like its tail.
	   Closer still, a rocky shelf known as ``Smutty Nose'' guards the
entrance of a tiny harbor formed by Monhegan Island's marine mammal
``body'' and Manana Island's (it rhymes with banana) whale
``tail.'' Harbor seals frolic in the shallow surf here as
double-crested cormorants skim the waves for food.
	   Navigating past Smutty Nose and into the harbor, the ferry docks
at the wharf. Sail, tuna and lobster boats are lashed to harbor
moorings.
	   Passengers walk a steel plank onto the wooden wharf as the
aromas of baked treats and coffee escape through The Barnacle's
screen door to greet them. Boat and hotel crews unload luggage,
mail, propane tanks and pallets from the ferry, as the visitors
walk up a narrow dirt road hill toward their accommodations.
	   With six different businesses offering cabins, rooms,
apartments, and hostel beds, Monhegan Island is accessible for most
budgets and vacation schedules. A night's sleep for two ranges from
dlrs 50 to dlrs 125. Depending on the place, that may include
breakfast and/or dinner. Three businesses are open year-round for
those who seek a mild island winter.
	   The Island Inn's and Monhegan House's gourmet menus offer
breakfast, lunch and spectacular seafood specials for dinner. The
Periwinkle's more common fare features American fast-food favorites
as well as moderately priced fresh seafood for lunch and dinner.
And the Fish 'R' Us fish market sells fresh-caught fish and
lobster.
	   Seafood not too tempting?
	   Try the subs, soups and pizza (yes, pizza) at North End Pizza or
gobble up steamed hot dogs at the island's general store, The
Monhegan Store.
	   And for after-dinner coffee or dessert, there is the Barnacle's
aromatic coffee drinks and pastries or the Periwinkle's incredibly
rich and creamy ice cream whose flavors vary daily.
	   Monhegan's delicious foods and quiet nights notwithstanding, the
island's premier attraction is the 600-plus acres (240-plus
hectares) of island wilderness.
	   Using the Monhegan Associates Trail Map _ available at almost
every Monhegan business _ hikers easily navigate the 17 miles (27
kilometers) of trails. As explorers walk narrow paths, they can see
harbor seals playing on stone ledges near the rocky surf of Pebble
Beach, or the high cathedral ceiling formed by spruce trees'
interlacing branches high above the mossy floor of the Cathedral
Woods.
	   They can view the 160-foot (50-meter) cliffs of Whitehead and
Blackhead, Maine's highest, or groups of sea birds among the rusted
remains of the iron-hulled D.T. Sheridan at Lobster Cove, the
island's premiere bird-watching meadow.
	   After a strenuous hike, some might be tempted to swim in the
crisp 50- to 60-degree Fahrenheit (10 to 15 C) waters, but they
should beware. None who have tried to swim on Monhegan's
unprotected side have been saved. In the past five years alone,
three people have died in the riptides and undertows that leave
constantly swirling pools of white foam.
	   But check out the pebble-sand and sea-glass Swim Beach and Fish
Beach in Monhegan's tiny harbor. They are easier on the feet than
sharp rocks, and the gentle surf there has never swept any swimmer
away.
	   Since the late 19th century, Monhegan's serene beauty has
possessed painters and poets alike. Painters Rockwell Kent, Jamie
Wyeth, and Alice Kent Stoddard are among those who have lived and
studied on the island for many summers.
	   Kent built several of the island's dwellings when he lived there
in the early 20th century. And the grand home he built for his
mother is still inhabited today by the Wyeth family.
	   The artists' pervading presence is apparent in the many
galleries that line Monhegan's dirt road. Lining the walls of the
Monhegan Historical and Cultural Museum are the paintings of some
of its most famous and talented residents.

	   Sitting atop Monhegan's highest hill, the museum shares its
summit with an abandoned lighthouse. The main building of the
museum is the former lighthouse caretaker's quarters. It has
exhibits covering the entire timeline of Monhegan's island life,
from the Indians who frequently fished its waters through the
domestic life of permanent islanders in the 18th and 19th
centuries.
	   The museum also visually explains lobstering, tuna fishing, and
the winter ice harvesting operations at the island's Ice Pond. In
addition, there is a tiny exhibit dedicated to the island's most
fabled resident, Raymond E. Phillips _ Monhegan's hermit.
	   Phillips was purported to be a successful businessman who gave
it all up to build a solitary shed out of driftwood on Manana
Island. His only neighbors were the Norse and Phoenician symbols
carved into Manana's rock and the large, automated U.S. Coast Guard
fog station defiantly built on its exposed side.
	   Phillips lived off the sea's bounty and the few farm animals he
tended until he died on May 10, 1975.
	   After hiking trails, viewing paintings and eating seafood,
Monhegan offers its visitors no more than the gentle sound of an
ocean surf and a night sky unobscured by artificial light.
	   Monhegan Island is a nature-lover's waking dream.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; IF YOU GO: Monhegan Island is 10 miles (16 kilometers) off the
coast of Port Clyde, Maine. The ferry is dlrs 25 round trip. Beds
for two cost from dlrs 50 to dlrs 125 per night. Some include
breakfast and/or dinner. Be prepared with good hiking boots and
outerwear for extreme weather. There are no ATMs and not many

	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ Chris Perry tied the course record with a
9-under-par 62 that included two eagles and moved into a tie for
the second-round lead of the Greater Milwaukee Open with Mark
Calcavecchia, who had a 64.
	   Perry, the son of former major league pitcher Jim Perry and
nephew of Hall of Famer Gaylord Perry, birdied the final hole to
become the third player this week _ and second on Friday _ to match
the course record at Brown Deer Park golf course.
	   Loren Roberts had an opening-round 62, while Nolan Henke matched
that Friday, tying the record he set in 1996.
	   Perry and Calcavecchia, who is looking for his win in this
tournament in his 18th start, were tied at 12-under 130.
	   One stroke back was homestate favorite Steve Stricker, whose
first daughter was born just four days ago. He had a second-round
63.
	   Perry was honest in assessing his career-best round that
featured a 24-foot (7.3-meter) eagle putt on No. 6, a par-5, and a
17-footer (5.2-meter putt) for a 3 on No. 18.
	   ``It's not often you have someone going crazy like that,'' he
said. ``It is kind of fun. It was just one of those days in which
everything went right.''
	   Two strokes off the lead were Roberts, who had a 70, Mark
Carnevale, 66, Henke, 62, and John Maginnes, 65.
	   Defending champion Scott Hoch and PGA champion Vijay Singh were
seven strokes behind the leaders.
	   Mark Brooks, the 1991 champion, walked off the course at No. 14
and withdrew. He was 10 over par at the time.
	   Calcavecchia said he did a good job of relaxing and not thinking
too much.
	   ``I didn't even know how far under I was. That was good. No
thinking ahead. I played real solid,'' he said. ``It is nice to be
back in the hunt again.''
	   Stricker was glad to be in his hometown. ``This tournament means
a lot to me,'' he said. ``There just wouldn't be a more special
tournament for me to win than here in Milwaukee.''
	   Stricker's confidence was so high he hit drivers off the
fairway, including at No. 15 where it got him a 25-foot (7.6-meter)
putt for eagle that he made.
	   ``I'm excited,'' he said. ``I felt a little bit more aggressive.
The driver I hit on No. 6 off the fairway really pumped me up.''
	   Stricker's wife, Nicki, who had been his caddie until becoming
pregnant, gave birth Monday to a daughter, Bobbie Jean, in Madison,
about 75 miles (120 kilometers) away. Stricker, 31, didn't arrive
at Brown Deer on Thursday until two hours before he teed off and
battled the woes of little sleep.
	   Friday was a different story.
	   ``I didn't feel so rushed starting out. I felt like I was in the
tournament atmosphere,'' Stricker said.
	   Stricker said he wasn't worried that all the emotions of the
week would leave him drained going into the weekend rounds, even
though he admitted the recent developments in his life, including a
runner-up finish at the PGA Championship, felt like a ``whirlwind''
	   ``Just riding on adrenaline alone, I should be able to make it
through without a problem,'' he said.
	   Calcavecchia said the battle against Stricker and the big crowds
he's expected to attract should be fun.
	   ``Everything is right on the money for Steve Stricker right
now,'' Calcavecchia said. ``He just had a baby girl and now he's
trying to win his home tournament so he's a happy man. When you are
happy out here, it's a lot easier to play good.''

Fujimori urges economic caution for Latin America
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs to UPDATE with IMF meeting ending, Peru and Ecuador
leaders' comments on border dispute. Edits to conform.

	   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) _ The economic crises in Asia and
Russia loomed Friday over a meeting of Latin American nations where
Peru's president urged his counterparts to coordinate efforts to
bolster their economies.
	   Ten Latin American presidents gather on the Panamanian isthmus
Saturday for their 12th Rio Group annual summit. Talk of world
market worries was expected to dominate the one-day session.
	   Foreign ministers and officials from 14 nations met Friday in
Panama City ahead of the summit.
	   Peru's Alberto Fujimori, who arrived early to discuss a border
conflict with Ecuador's president, said Latin American states must
act in ``an integral manner'' to make sure that each does what it
can to stay financially healthy.
	   Nations must curb inflation and promote growth while carefully
managing their foreign debt, he said in a news conference late
Thursday.
	   ``Of course we must be very attentive to make sure that this
crisis affects us as little as possible in Latin America,'' he
said.
	   Finance ministers and central bank governors from nine of the
Latin American nations ended a two-day meeting with International
Monetary Fund officials Friday in Washington.
	   Aiming to calm investors' fears, IMF chief Michel Camdessus said
the countries are on the right economic track and are not seeking
international financial help.
	   Indicating pressure in emerging markets was spreading to Latin
America, Colombia this week became the first country in the region
to devalue its currency, the peso, by 9 percent.
	   Rio Group delegates also were to discuss efforts to fight
terrorism and the trafficking of drugs and illegal weapons.
	   Fujimori and Ecuador's President Jamil Mahuad spoke privately
for more than three hours Friday. They later expressed optimism
they would sign an accord to end their land dispute by the end of
the year.
	   Peace talks began three years ago to resolve the matter, which
was at the root of a January 1995 skirmish.
	   The Rio Group was founded in 1986 by eight nations: Colombia,
Mexico, Panama, Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Uruguay. It
later added Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, and Paraguay.
	   Two countries are the temporary representatives for their
regions: El Salvador for Central America and Guyana for the
Caribbean.

	   Out the window the pond lay white and still, the evergreens
bulking jagged behind it. Farther beyond in the distance the wavy
line of mountains glowed crimson from the first touch of morning.
	   It had been one of the coldest nights of the gaucho winter.
Still, our room was cozy, the creme-colored walls, tawny carpet and
dark-pine furniture lit gently by two white, porcelain lamps. This
was Leonida Stapff's warmest room. She always saves it for
late-comers and had insisted we take it.
	   She also insisted we eat. Leonida stuffed us mercilessly each
morning with fresh blueberry biscuits, butter-drenched waffles,
espresso coffee, chilled guava and grapefruit juice, scrambled eggs
with a dash of pepper and grilled onions, sliced papaya, melon and
hot apple strudel.
	   I left the rest of my diet in the eateries around town. There
are gaucho steakhouses and German gasthofs. There are Italian
cantinas and Swiss fondue chalets. For the sweet of tooth, tea
parlors, bakeries and ``casas de chocolate'' are everywhere.
	   You don't expect to find a thriving chocolate industry in a
tropical country. But here the chocolate was as fine, if not finer,
than anything I'd ever tasted in Switzerland, only cheaper. In most
shops, a box of 20 chocolate flat bars cost just dlrs 3.
	   To work off the calories, we decided to take walking tours of
the town. First, though, we bought ear muffs.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Gramado works hard to look like a Swiss village.
	   The homes and restaurants are all gingerbread-like structures _
white-plastered with A-roofs, freshly varnished shutters and low,
black-iron gates around buzz-cut lawns. Banks and shops have an
angular, cuckoo-clock style, their balconies bearded with flowers _
even in the dead of winter.
	   On every corner, every block were hydrangea shrubs or azaleas.
In the early morning, with the sun melting the frosting on the
sidewalks, the azaleas gleamed like pale-blue candy apples.
	   The streets were washed and swept clean each morning, and
hand-painted signs pointed us to the Igreja Matriz Sao Pedro, a
lean cathedral of basalt stone with 16-foot-high (5-meter-high)
stained-glass windows; the ``Minimundo'' _ Miniworld _ a miniature
``Legoland'' with replicas of European castles and colonial
cathedrals; the Prof. Hugo Daros Museum, with its exhibits on the
German and Italian settlement of Rio Grande do Sul; and the Lago
Negro (Black Lake), where alpine restaurants and pine trees _
brought as saplings from Germany's Black Forest _ paint shadows on
the dark surface.
	   On the main avenue, Borges de Medeiros, we found the Palace of
Festivals, a Bavarian-looking playhouse. Here, the city was
preparing to host the 26th annual Gramado Festival for Latin and
Brazilian Films. Begun in 1973, the festival is to South America
what Cannes is to Europe.
	   We sipped hot chocolate and cognac with a helping of tart,
passion-fruit pudding, then strolled up the avenue, stopping to
peer through the misting boutique windows at the bottles of local
Liebfraumilch and Riesling, baskets of cheddar and Swiss cheese,
racks of woolly sweaters and leather coats.
	   Under the twinkle of street lamps, we wandered over to the Praca
Major Nicoletti, bustling from the annual winter book fair.
Browsing inside a warm, green tent, we suddenly heard children
singing.
	   A boys and girls choir had come to rehearse for Sunday mass at
the cathedral. The square hushed, mesmerized by their crystalline
voices, fluttering white gowns and glinting eyes.
	   Dinnertime found us at Le Chalet de la Fondue. With wagon wheels
serving as chandeliers, pine logs crackling in the hearth and a
cheese fondue bubbling under candlelight on our table, the moment
couldn't be more romantic.
	   ``What should we do next year?'' Daniela mused. ``The
Caribbean?''
	   I thought for a second, then decided against it. You don't see
much snow in the Bahamas.

	   VALLETTA, Malta (AP) _ Maltese voters faced a choice Saturday --
reelect a Labor government shy about pushing too fast for European
Union membership or return to the Nationalists, staunch advocates
of a future anchored more solidly to Europe.
	   Only two years after the last election for parliament, Prime
Minister Alfred Sant was hoping for a new mandate, while veteran
Nationalist leader Eddie was banking on his assertion that Maltese
are ready to unblock Malta's bid to join the EU club.
	   Shortly after Labor returned to power in 1996 following a
nine-year tenure by the arch-rival Nationalists, Sant froze the
bid, which had been favorably seen by Brussels.
	   ``European Union membership would be the shot in the arm the
Maltese economy needs,'' said Fenech Adami in an interview Friday.
He contended that foreign investors would renew their enthusiasm
for Malta's economy, which started slowing down in the mid-90s, if
the Maltese back his platform for EU membership as soon as
possible.
	   Sant's party, sensing that the Maltese might now be more open to
membership, has campaigned advocating a free trade area agreement
with Brussels.
	   Sant decided last month to call elections three years early in
an attempt for more support. He now has a one-seat majority in the
65-member parliament -- not all that slim by political standards in
this nation of 370,000. But ministerial resignations and the
defection of a key party figure, Dom Mintoff, on some important
legislative votes, left Sant looking vulnerable.
	   For the first time in 53 years, Mintoff, 82, a former premier
and Labor leader remembered abroad for his pro-Libyan stance
especially in the 1980s, was not seeking another term in
parliament.
	   Labor's secretary-general, Jimmy Magro, said Friday that Malta,
with its industry now largely protected by the government and a
sprawling state sector, wasn't ready to make the move now for full
membership, which would leave the tiny economy competing with
economic powerhouses like Germany and Italy in the EU market.

	   If You Go ...
	   TRAVEL: Gramado is 80 miles (135 kilometers) north of Porto
Alegre, the capital of Rio Grande do Sul state. Flights reach Porto
Alegre direct from Buenos Aires and Montevideo, Uruguay. From the
United States and Europe, most flights stop over in Rio de Janeiro
or Sao Paulo, Brazil's main air hubs, before proceeding south for a
1-hour, 50-minute flight to Porto Alegre.
	   CLIMATE: Southern Brazil is classified as temperate, though it
can get as hot as 100 F (38 C) during the Southern Hemisphere
summer (December through March) and dip as low as 28 F (2 below
zero C) in the winter (June through August). In Gramado, the
weather is generally cooler. Expect some sleet and snow in the
winter and heavy fog in the late evenings.
	   LODGING: There are more than 60 luxury hotels, Alpine bungalows
and inns in Gramado _ not bad for a town of 22,400 people. Luxury
hotels run dlrs 140- dlrs (170 reals) to 225 dlrs (270 reals) for a
double in high season _ June through August _ slightly less the
rest of the year. But package deals bring much better prices that
vary wildly from month to month. Check with a travel agent (outside
of the United States) for the best deals.
	   Inns or ``posadas,'' are cheaper, generally cozy and very
comfortable, and most have all the amenities of the larger hotels,
except for whirlpool baths and indoor parking. The Hotel Azaleia, a
non-smoking inn, is among the best; located at Avenida Borges de
Medeiros, 1069 _ (054) 286-3583 _ the inn charges dlrs 50 (60
reals) for doubles in high season, breakfast included.
	   Gramado's youth hostel is located at Rua do Lago. (It's a small
street and there is no address number.) (054) 286-1811.
	   GETTING AROUND: Rental cars in Brazil range from dlrs 80 to dlrs
140 (95 to 170 reals) a day (insurance included) for economy to
mid-size models. From Porto Alegre, take the BR-116 highway 55
miles (88 kilometers) north to the mountain city of Nova
Petropolis, then east on the RS-115 highway 25 miles (40
kilometers) to Gramado. The drive usually takes roughly two hours.
	   Buses leave from Porto Alegre nearly every hour and are
reasonable: A one-way ticket costs about dlrs 7 (8.50 reals).
	   CURRENCY: The Brazilian real (pronounced REY-owl). The tourism
exchange rate is currently 1 real, 20 centavos per U.S. dollar.
Travel agencies are the best bet for a good rate, and they don't
charge fees. Banks do _ some as much as dlrs 3 (3.50 reals) per
transaction. Larger hotels generally exchange major currencies, but
offer a poorer rate.
	   RESTAURANTS: From the elegant fondue chalet to the hearty gaucho
steakhouse, you'll find dozens of places that serve delicious
German, Italian, Swiss and, of course, Brazilian fare. The top of
the German list is the Gasthof Edelweiss, an Alpine restaurant in
the Lago Negro district. Dinner for two runs dlrs 60- dlrs 75 (70
to 90 reals); For Swiss cuisine, try Maison de la Fondue on Avenida
Borges de Medeiros, 2311, or Le Chalet de la Fondue, Avenida das
Hortensias, 1297. Dinner for two at both restaurants costs dlrs 40-
dlrs 60 (50 to 75 reals) and is well worth it. For Italian, there
is the Cantina Pastasciutta (which bills itself as the ``pioneer of
pasta'' in Gramado) on Avenida Borges de Medeiros, 2083.
Red-and-white checkered tablecloths, bottles of Italian and
Brazilian wine hanging from the ceiling, and soft lighting give the
place a cozy atmosphere, and the home-made pasta, sauces and
cheeses are first-rate. Dinner for two with wine is about dlrs 35
(45 reals).
	   SPECIAL EVENTS: The annual ``Chocofest,'' festival of chocolate,
is held in March. The week-long Gramado film festival goes on in
August, book months in advance for hotel reservations. The city's
Festival of Flowers begins in late September and runs through
Columbus Day.
	   NEARBY ATTRACTIONS: Gramado serves as a jumping-off point for
hikers or drivers exploring the Vale do Quilombo _ Quilombo Valley.
The mountain town of Canela, graced by the Caracol Park, is a
perfect day trip for those looking to see waterfalls and dramatic,
pine-draped gorges. The nearby Italian-German colonies of Garibaldi
and Bento Goncalves, with wineries that produce Brazil's finest
wines, are also worth a day-trip.
	   INFORMATION: Gramado has a Web site for visitors:
www.viadigital.com.br/gramado/gramado.html. The municipal tourist
office is also very helpful at Avenida Borges de Medeiros, 1674.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Searchers have few answers to offer
the many relatives arriving and wondering what went wrong aboard
Swissair Flight 111: Surging tides quickly are spreading debris of
the shattered jet and sonar is not finding its vital data
recorders.
	   A family of six were the first relatives to arrive Friday in
Peggy's Cove, the fishing village near the ocean crash site where
229 people, including 132 Americans, died Wednesday night. Canadian
troops escorted the family to a private area on a bluff overlooking
the ocean.
	   Exasperated authorities, meanwhile, ordered curiosity-seekers to
keep their boats away from the crash scene and nearby shore, and
warned journalists not to intrude on the relatives' privacy.
Investigators and police were looking for people who saw the MD-11
go down.
	   Authorities also were mapping the ocean floor in preparation for
sending down a small, remote-controlled submersible to check out
the sea bed, said Vic Gerden, head of the Canadian Transportation
Safety Board's crash investigation.
	   A navy submarine equipped with high-tech sonar was unable Friday
to trace the MD-11's flight data recorders, which are hoped to
provide clues to the cause of the crash.
	   Finding the devices may take time because a beacon that sends a
tracking signal to guide searchers to them was not working in the
water, Philippe Bruggisser, chief of Swissair's parent SAirGroup,
said in Geneva.
	   Divers and spotter planes joined the recovery effort, but debris
was steadily spreading. Body parts were washing up on beaches.
About 100 Canadian soldiers were out combing the shoreline.
	   ``We can't contain the debris,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Glenn
Chamberlain, one of the search coordinators. ``All we can do is try
to find it.''
	   Searchers had yet to find any piece of wreckage larger than the
roof of a car, raising concern that fully reconstructing the jet _
a tool helpful to determining what happened _ might be impossible.
	   ``If we do not find more than what we have today, there's no
talking about any kind of reconstruction,'' said Benoit Bouchard of
the Canadian Transportation Safety Board.
	   Sgt. Andre Geurtin of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said the
most significant find during Friday's search was about 100 mostly
intact pieces of luggage, probably from the plane's cargo hold.
	   Only at midday Friday did search coordinators formally state
what had seemed clear since Wednesday night _ that there were no
survivors among those aboard the New York-to-Geneva flight.
	   That announcement, coupled with the failure thus far to find the
plane's fuselage or flight recorders, gave authorities only
discouraging news to offer family members arriving from Europe and
the United States.
	   ``It was important for the victims' families, for whom it is
only natural to hold out one last hope, that we did everything
which could possibly be done to find survivors,'' said Rear Adm.
Dusty Miller, one of the search commanders. ``There is no longer a
last hope.''
	   Chartered planes from New York and Switzerland arrived about 20
minutes apart Friday, bringing more than 250 relatives, grief
counselors and airline staff. The family members quickly were
escorted to a private area at customs. Many wore black. One couple
hugged each other; another woman clutched her chest while a
companion held her arm.
	   At search headquarters in Peggy's Cove, authorities set up a row
of green army tents overlooking the ocean to provide some privacy
for family members wishing to visit the site. The first arrived
Friday afternoon.
	   In the evening, family members converged at a Halifax hotel for
briefings from airline officials and other authorities. The
meeting, closed to reporters, was expected to produce some group
decisions on activities over the next few days and on whether the
relatives would be making public statements.
	   Muriel Provost of the regional Red Cross said the relatives have
suffered a double trauma _ first learning of their loved ones'
deaths, then having to board a plane. ``That must have been a very
painful experience for some of them,'' she said.
	   Royal Canadian Mounted Police Staff Sgt. Keith McGuire said
intruders venturing into the search area to look for debris face
arrest and seizure of their boats if they disobey orders to stay
out.
	   Gerden, of the Canadian Transportation Safety Board, said
investigators have listened to the tapes of the plane's last
conversation with air traffic controllers. He described the
conversations as ``professional at all times.''
	   The MD-11 dropped off radar screens 90 minutes after leaving New
York's Kennedy International Airport.
	   After a normal takeoff, the crew reported smoke in the cockpit
and decided to turn back to Boston. When they spoke to Canadian
controllers in Moncton, New Brunswick, they were told the Halifax
airport was much closer. The plane never made it to Halifax,
crashing into the ocean 30 miles (50 kilometers) to the south after
dumping much of its fuel.
	   Bruggisser, of SAirGroup, said the initial investigation
indicated the plane hit the water at a very high speed, breaking it
and those aboard into small pieces. ``The condition of the bodies
is such that the biggest body part is (the size of) a baby,'' he
said, his voice breaking.
	   Officials earlier stopped the body count at about 60, mainly
because they were not recovering full corpses.
	   Bruggisser refused to speculate on the causes of the smoke. He
said Swissair had made the changes required last year by the
Federal Aviation Administration concerning a wiring problem in
MD-11 cockpits that, if left uncorrected, could cause a fire.
	   There was no indication the crash resulted from sabotage or a
terrorist act, but investigators were not ruling anything out. The
RCMP called in explosives experts to examine debris for signs of a
possible bomb blast.

Riding a train through the frozen Tierra del Fuego

	   USHUAIA, Argentina (AP) _ The last licks of a winter gale die
away with the morning as storm clouds speed across the snowy peaks
of Tierra del Fuego National Park. A solitary train whistle sounds.
	   The long screech of the old-fashioned locomotive pierces the
frosty air, its smokestack belching puffs of white steam.
	   ``All aboaard!'' the stationmaster shouts as two dozen
passengers scramble aboard replicas of antique English passenger
wagons. For the next two hours they will be riding the ``Train to
the End of the World.''
	   By tourist train, and later the same day by catamaran over the
ice-blue waters of the Beagle Channel, they will explore the
southernmost tip of South America.
	   Tierra del Fuego, the Land of Fire, is a patchwork of
mountainous islands and sea channels carved out by glaciers ages
ago. Much of this land is uninhabited, its name conjuring up
visions of howling winds and towering seas.
	   Yamana Indians, a canoe people, lived here for thousand of
years, nomadic hunters who survived on seal meat and edible plants.
European exploration began with Magellan in 1520, followed by
whalers and wayfarers, sailors and sealers, and the occasional
missionary.
	   Today, tens of thousands of people visit Tierra Del Fuego each
year, mainly in the warmer summer months of December-February.
Smaller numbers come in late July and August, when it's winter in
the Southern Hemisphere.
	   It's just as spectacular then.
	   The English-style locomotive puffs its way out of a wooden
station for a roundtrip ride over 4.5 miles (7 kilometers) of
narrow track.
	   Begun in 1994, the train runs several trips daily, fewer in
wintertime, from a station a few miles (kilometers) west of
Ushuaia, population 45,000.
	   The train retraces parts of the route of a convict railway once
built and run by prisoners confined to Ushuaia, the southernmost
city on Earth, some 1,495 miles (2,400 kilometers) south of Buenos
Aires.
	   A former penitentiary as infamous to Argentines as Alcatraz, El
Presidio operated from the early 1900s until 1947, when it was
closed for humanitarian reasons.
	   Now it is a museum on the grounds of a naval base.
	   Black-and-white photos of the era show prisoners in striped
uniforms sawing in the forest, pushing logs into freight cars or
seated unsmiling on the train's narrow benches.
	   Chopping firewood from these beech forests is still a year-round
task for many in Tierra del Fuego, where long winter months yield
only 6 to 8 hours of daily sunlight and the temperature hovers
around freezing.
	   The tiny train chugs past an ice-encrusted stream, frozen peat
bogs and jagged mountaintops rendered postcard perfect by a recent
snowfall. Icicles drip from the rocks.
	   ``To your right you will see hundreds of blackened, scorched
tree stumps,'' says the tour conductor, Oscar Scheffelaar-Klotz.
``This was once a forest where the convicts cut down trees. Sparks
from the old freight train started fires here.''
	   The train halts beside a replica of an Indian settlement, then
rolls past an old sawmill and fields of wild berry bushes now
dormant in the snow as the smokestack's plume rises in the pale
winter light.
	   Further along, the wagons wend through the Cemetery of the
Trees, hundreds upon hundreds of acres (hectares) of trees removed
by convicts.
	   ``As you can see, the prisoners cut down many, many trees. And
each year they needed to build the train line farther out as they
cut farther and farther away from the city,'' the guide says.
	   Soon the train enters the Tierra del Fuego National Park, pocked
with peat bogs and hardscrabble hills. Across the Beagle Channel,
the Chilean mountains of the Darwin Cordillera glow a pale
blue-white. Chile and Argentina share the main island of Tierra del
Fuego.
	   Beech forests rise up the mountains and whisper in the wind.
Clumps of green lichen _ called ``devil's beard'' _ swing from
bushes. With the prisoners long gone, beavers now do the work of
felling trees, leaving trunks with chiseled toothmarks.
	   Snowy footprints, perhaps a fox, lead up a streambank. A
cormorant, a seabird whose wingspan can reach six feet (1.8-meter),
flies in search of an inviting lake as the train ride comes to an
end.
	   Here in Tierra del Fuego, water is as much a formidable presence
as land. Voyaging across both can be fitted into one day, with
connections between train and catamaran bookable in advance _ such
as the 100-foot (30-meter) catamaran Ezequiel MB that sails at
mid-afternoon.
	   Andean flute music is piped into the Ezequiel's enclosed
double-deck salon. Black-coated waiters serve white wine while
families sip hot Mate tea _ an Argentine tradition.
	   Warmly dressed tourists step out of heated salons onto the
open-air top deck and its panoramic view, as the ship glides from
Ushuaia Bay down the Beagle Channel.
	   One mountain after another slides past: majestic Monte Olivia
and a peak with serrated teeth called the Cinco Hermanos, or Five
Brothers.
	   ``Oh look! Seals!'' a 6-year-old girl squeals as the Ezequiel
pulls alongside an islet where dozens of fur seals rollick. The
animals slide off black boulders into the waves as tourists ``ooh''
and ``aah.''
	   Another island looms up, topped with grunting sea lions, among
them a 300-pound (136-kilogram) male defending his harem. Tourists
crowd the side of the boat to gawk.
	   ``Please be quiet,'' the tour guide whispers through the boat's
microphones as the Ezequiel idles within yards.
	   Then the catamaran pulls away, a golden winter sunset glinting
off the backs of the sea lions. Heading for home, the ship passes
islands covered with squawking black cormorants. Some nosedive into
the waves for fish.
	   The day ends as it began: Gray clouds gather atop distant
mountains. The wind picks up. The mercury drops.
	   As waves rise higher and rap against the catamaran's pontoons,
the Ezequiel speeds for Ushuaia Bay.
	   The city lights twinkle warmly, welcoming the tourist back after
a winter's day at the end of the world.

Orlando theme parks compete for Christian music audience
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ Theme park titans Walt Disney World and
Universal Studios, already rivals when it comes to thrill rides and
stage shows, are now competing for the ears (and dollars) of
Christian music fans.
	   The two Orlando theme parks have scheduled Christian music
concerts during the same weekend, Sept. 11-12.
	   Disney has sponsored its Nights of Joy for the past 15 years.
The two-night event has attracted more than 16,000 people since it
started. Universal Studios makes its Christian music debut with its
Rock the Universe concert.
	   Both sell tickets for the same price, dlrs 28 in advance and
dlrs 33 at the gate, and feature some of the biggest names in
Christian music.
	   Disney's lineup on both nights includes God's Property, Jars of
Clay, Avalon, Third Day, Bob Carlisle and Greg Long.
	   Universal is featuring Michael W. Smith, Newsboys, Audio
Adrenaline, Seven Day Jesus, Big Tent Rival and Burlap to Cashmere.
	   Universal officials said they realized they would be competing
for the same audience when they scheduled their concert.
	   ``It's not as if we closed our eyes and pointed to the
calendar,'' said Tom Schroeder, a Universal spokesman. ``It's a
perfect weekend to do Rock the Universe because so many people who
enjoy Christian music will be in Orlando.''
	   Universal's launch of Rock the Universe underscores the
popularity of Christian music. Christian music sales last year were
dlrs 550 million, according to the Nashville, Tenn.,-based Gospel
Music Association, up from dlrs 538 million in 1996.

 &UR; Volunteers sought to help refurbish Glacier backcountry chalet
	   GLACIER NATIONAL PARK (AP) _ The refurbished Sperry Chalet will
be open in September to volunteers willing to expend elbow grease
in exchange for spectacular scenery and backcountry ambiance.
	   The park's Sperry and Granite Park chalets, both famous old
lodges, were closed in 1992 because of sewage and wastewater
treatment problems.
	   Sperry has undergone a dlrs 1.6 million restoration and park
officials are recruiting volunteers to add the final touches.
	   Four volunteer spots will be available each day. Volunteers are
asked to stay for at least two days and work a minimum of six hours
each day.
	   Work projects will include scraping, sanding, painting, cleaning
and general ground maintenance.
	   Volunteers will have to provide their own food and sleeping
bags, and be able to hike 6.5 miles (10 kilometers) to and from the
chalet. Cooking facilities and beds will be provided.
	   Next year, the chalet will resume operating as a full-service
backcountry bed-and-breakfast. Funding has yet to be raised for
similar work at Granite chalet, which is being run as a hikers' hut
without meals and other amenities.
	   Save the Chalets, a nonprofit fund-raising organization working
with the park, is coordinating the volunteer effort.

 &UR; Six Flags to build dlrs 25 million water park in St. Louis suburb
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ A dlrs 25 million water park with six-story
water slides and a 750,000-gallon (2.8 million-liter) wave pool is
coming to Six Flags St. Louis.
	   The water park, named Hurricane Harbor, will be the largest
expansion in the 27-year history of the amusement park in suburban
Eureka. It is scheduled to open on Memorial Day 1999.
	   Premier Parks Inc., the park's owner, also plans to open a hotel
at Six Flags St. Louis.
	   Gary Story, president of Premier, said the water park and hotel
would help remake the amusement park as a tourist destination
designed to entice out-of-town visitors to spend more than a day in
Eureka.
	   ``There are only so many roller coasters a theme park can
build,'' Story said. ``Our company wants to find new ways for whole
families to have good, wholesome, clean fun. Building water parks
is the way our industry is going.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Train buffs plan to put old steam locomotive back on track
	   ASTORIA, Oregon (AP) _ The steam locomotive known as Santa Maria
Valley No. 21 once puffed its way across Southern California
pulling loads of sugar beets, vegetables and petroleum products.
	   When it had belched its last in 1962, the 81-ton locomotive was
dismantled and put to rest with a railroad preservation group in
Snoqualmie, Washington.
	   Now, a group of railroad enthusiasts in Astoria hopes to bring
it back to life.
	   By its 75th birthday in 2001, the locomotive could be puffing
along the Astoria and Columbia River Railroad, providing regular
trolley service through town with occasional dinner excursions to
Westport or Brownsmead and periodic trips to Portland for events.
	   The Astoria Railroad Preservation Association, a 20-member
group, raised dlrs 27,000 to buy the locomotive. It has been
stripped, sandblasted, cleaned and machined by volunteers working
in their spare time.
	   ``I think everybody loves old trains,'' said John Niemann,
president of the association. ``They're big, massive, make a lot of
noise, belch smoke and in some ways are a tremendous showing of
American decadence with all its workings on the outside.''

such desperate condition that they cannot wait for politicians and
diplomats to negotiate peace, a U.S. said in pleding dlrs 23
million in emergency food aid.
	   After touring the war-torn Serbian province, Hugh Q. Parmer of
the U.S. Agency for International development said the next five
weeks will be critical in determing how many of the estimated
50,000 worst-affected refugees die.
	   ``This is not the beginning and it is certainly not the end,''
Parmer said in announcing the additional U.S. assistance in the
Yugoslav capital Belgrade.'' USAID will continue to stand by those
suffering in the conflict.''
	   European Union members are also reportedly trying to put
together a relief plan for Kosovo. The crisis is expected to figure
prominently this weekend during a meeting of EU foreign ministers
in the Austrian city of Salzburg.
	   The United Nations estimates that more than 230,000 people have
fled their homes since Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
launched a crackdown Feb. 28 against the secessionist Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   Of those who fled, about 50,000 are living without shelter in
the hills and forests of Kosovo, a province of Serbia, which is
part of Yugoslavia.
	   Parmer said the ``damage and destruction'' after months of
fighting had ``reached devastating proportions.'' He warned that
the world must respond with more aid before the advent of winter
within the next two months.
	   ``We cannot wait for the diplomats and politicians to finish,''
Parmer said. ``We have a responsibility to produce on the ground so
that women, children and elderly do not die of starvation.''
	   Under pressure from the Americans and Europeans, both Milosevic
and moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova have agreed in
principle to a formula grandting self-rule to the majority Albanian
province.
	   The agreement would be reviewed in three to five years. Although
the arrangement falls short of Albanian demands for independence,
Rugova has promised to try to convince KLA hardliners to accept it.
	   But Western diplomats say that even with goodwill on both sides,
the deal could take months to finalize. In the meantime, the advent
of winter threatens a humanitarian disaster.
	   Despite diplomatic efforts, fighting is continuing southwest of
Pristina. Albanian sources accuse Serb police of burning homes and
driving more refugees into the fields and forests.
	   On Friday, two top Russian foreign ministry officials _ Nikolai
Afanasyevsky and Igor Ivanov _ met with Milosevic. Afterward,
Milosevic's office said the Russians reaffirmed Moscow's interest
in a peaceful solution.

U.N. tribunal sentences Rwandan ex-prime minister to life for

	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ A U.N. tribunal, in the first genocide
sentence by an international court, has condemned a former Rwandan
prime minister reviled for his bloodthirsty words and deeds to life
in prison for the slaughter of more than 500,000 Rwandans in 1994.
	   Jean Kambanda, the highest-ranking former political leader in
the tribunal's custody, is hated in Rwanda. Many are haunted by
memories of the slight man with a bushy beard and wearing fatigues,
handing out weapons to Hutu civilians to hunt down and kill ``Tutsi
cockroaches.''
	   Kambanda stood stoically while the three-judge panel rejected
his pleas for leniency Friday.
	   His crimes ``carry an intrinsic gravity, and their widespread,
atrocious and systematic character is particularly shocking to the
human conscience,'' Chief Judge Laity Kama said, reading the
judgment.
	   A wave of relief rippled through the audience, many of whom were
survivors of the three-month killing frenzy. But for some a life
sentence was not enough.
	   ``Life in prison, so what?'' said Alice Karekezi, a Rwandan
Tutsi who lost many friends in the slaughter. ``That won't bring
back the dead.''
	   Four years after the genocide, Kambanda's beard is cropped and a
somber suit and tie have replaced the military garb. ``I was
remembering him as a warrior ... seeing him like that was
strange,'' Karekezi said.
	   Rwandan survivors had waited years for the tribunal, which has
been troubled by mismanagement and corruption, to sentence its
first convict.
	   The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda said the
sentencing of Kambanda, 42, was the first for the crime of genocide
by an international court. He had pleaded guilty in May. The
tribunal's first conviction of genocide came Wednesday, against
former village mayor Jean-Paul Akayesu.
	   All those accused in the post-World War II Nuremberg trials
pleaded innocent to charges including murder and extermination. The
trials predated the establishment of the crime of genocide 50 years
ago.
	   ``The sentencing of Jean Kambanda and the conviction of
Jean-Paul Akayesu are the most significant steps to date in the
eradication of the culture of impunity in Rwanda and elsewhere in
the world,'' Justice Louise Arbour, prosecutor with the U.N.
tribunals for Rwanda and former Yugoslavia, said in a statement.
	   More than 500,000 Rwandans, mostly minority Tutsis but also
moderate Hutus, were butchered with machetes in the carefully
orchestrated genocide that began April 7, 1994.
	   Kambanda had sought two years or no prison time in exchange for
recording 90 hours of incriminating evidence against other alleged
leaders of the bloodbath, and for pleading guilty.
	   On May 1, the former banker confessed to six counts of genocide
and crimes against humanity, including responsibility for the
murder and extermination of civilians. He was the first person to
accept culpability for genocide before an international court.
	   Defense lawyer Oliver Michael Inglis, who had expected a
sentence of up to 15 years, said he would appeal. He contended
Kambanda was a puppet, manipulated by a powerful and evil military,
and afraid dissent would cost him his life.
	   Deputy Prosecutor Bernard Muna countered that no amount of
evidence against others could offset such wrongdoing. ``It was an
exemplary sentence. But I am afraid it might dissuade others from
coming forward to plead guilty,'' he said.
	   Muna said the prosecution pledged only to protect Kambanda's
wife and two children in exchange for his cooperation.
	   The tribunal issued its harshest possible sentence because
Kambanda committed his crimes knowingly and with premeditation,
Kama said.
	   ``Jean Kambanda abused his authority and the trust of the
population,'' said Kama, of Senegal. ``Nor has he expressed
contrition, regret, or sympathy for the victims in Rwanda, even
when given the opportunity.''
	   Kambanda is accused of inciting massacres, telling Hutus to kill
or be killed by Tutsi rebels: ``You refuse to give your blood to
your country, and the dogs drink it for nothing.''
	   He ordered roadblocks to help round up Tutsis, and presided over
meetings of his hard-line Hutu government as it planned and tallied
the massacres, Kama said.
	   Kambanda fled Rwanda when Tutsi rebels seized power in July 1994
and was arrested in Nairobi three years later with six other
high-level officials.
	   Rwanda has carried out prosecutions separate from the U.N.
tribunal, which is based in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha.
In April, Rwandan firing squads executed 22 people convicted of
genocide.
	   Kambanda was ordered held for now at a U.N. prison in Arusha,
where 30 others are in custody. The judges have not yet determined
where convicts should be incarcerated. At least four European
countries have offered to take prisoners, but the tribunal prefers
they remain in Africa.

Wounded and sick die daily within half-hour of hospital

	   SEDLARE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ His lung punctured by a bullet that
passed through his chest, Mehmet needs hospital attention, and
fast. But he can't get there from his mattress in a house filled
with the wounded and sick.
	   Nor can the young pregnant woman living in a nearby gorge filled
with hungry, thirsty refugees trapped by the conflict between the
Serb-Yugoslav army and Kosovo's ethnic Albanian rebels. She groans
as a doctor probes her swollen belly.
	   ``She'll be delivering in a few days,'' Dr. Skender Baca says.
``She belongs in hospital, not here in the dirt.''
	   Crossing Serb lines to the hospital, just half an hour away by
road in Kosovo's capital Pristina, is considered too dangerous by
most refugees.
	   Men of fighting age face arrest on suspicion of being members of
the Kosovo Liberation Army, fighting to split Kosovo from Serbia,
the dominant republic of Yugoslavia. Women, children and the
elderly are allowed to pass, if lucky. But they are often too
afraid to try.
	   ``I cannot cross a line. They will kill me,'' moans Mehmet, who
refuses to give his full name for fear Serb reprisal.
	   A woman on a mattress next to him has been hit by shrapnel.
	   ``They kill women, children and old men every day,'' she says,
refusing to give even a first name. ``How can we even consider
crossing?''
	   Humanitarian agencies warn of a looming tragedy when winter
strikes the more than 50,000 refugees living in the open after
fleeing villages destroyed in the 6-month old crackdown against
Kosovo Albanian separatists.
	   But tragedies already are happening.
	   ``I've had women and children die in front of me,'' said nurse
Keith Ursel of Winnipeg, Manitoba, working with Doctors Without
Borders. He said the victims could have been saved had they been
able to safely cross Serb lines.
	   Ursel said a woman with a complicated pregnancy tried to pass
the heavily fortified Serbian police checkpoint through the former
KLA stronghold of Malisevo, but was turned back.
	   ``They said they had orders not to let anyone through,'' says
Ursel. ``There's little chance she survived.''
	   Ursel tried to soothe Mehmet. Then he moved to another patient's
bed, lifting up a blanket to expose a thigh broken by shrapnel, its
bandage discolored by blood and pus.
	   Once outside, he shrugs when asked about the survival chances of
the seven people wounded inside if they don't get to a hospital.
	   Mehmet's chances, the nurse said, were 50 percent. ``The man
with the leg wound has a marginally better chance.''
	   The International Committee for the Red Cross is evacuating as
many cases as it can, but its small team in Kosovo has been able to
take out only two or three a day. There are thousands that need
attention.
	   Care remains a problem even for the few allowed through.
	   In one recent case, wounded women and children lay groaning on
the cold floor of a truck for nearly two hours until doctors at the
Serb-run Pristina hospital agreed to admit them even without proof
of medical insurance. Relief workers call demands for such
documentation from emergency cases absurd.
	   Medical staffers from Doctors Without Borders do what they can.
But they are too few and too poorly supplied to counter the cold,
dirt and growing hunger.
	   Baca, the doctor, says 12 percent of the Nekovc Valley refugees
suffer from diarrhea. Pneumonia and ear infections are also on the
rise, particularly among kids. Two infants who died in the past 48
hours could have been saved with basic medication.
	   Baca says some of the refugees remain shell-shocked psychiatric
cases, in need of at least tranquilizers. But he wouldn't hand out
any, even if available.
	   ``What if they fall asleep and the shelling starts again? They'd
be doomed.''

Two witnesses over 10 hours in hearing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Billy Hunter, the executive director of the
National Basketball Association, and NBA deputy commissioner Russ
Granik were the only witnesses during an arbitration hearing over
whether players with guaranteed contracts should be paid during the
lockout by owners.
	   The hearing before arbitrator John Feerick lasted 10 hours
Friday with Hunter, who began testifying on Thursday, on the stand
for most of the day. It was adjourned at 8 p.m. with Granik on the
stand.
	   Granik is to resume testifying on Tuesday, the day the hearing
is scheduled to end. Post-hearing briefs must be filed by Sept. 15,
and Feerick will then have 30 days to render his verdict.
	   The lockout is in its third month with the sides having met for
formal bargaining once since July 1. That session ended abruptly
when the owners walked out upon hearing the players' latest
proposal.

Clinton praises Ireland's economic success
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ There has never been a better time to be
Irish, declared U.S. President Bill Clinton, saluting the success
of Ireland's fast-growing economy and blossoming partnerships with
American investors.
	   ``You have worked together to draw out the strengths of every
element of this society and to minimize conflict,'' Clinton said
Friday, highlighting the economic peace dividend in a speech to
business, labor and community leaders at the Royal College of
Surgeons.
	   Turning to economic issues a day after an emotional tour of
Northern Ireland, Clinton signed an agreement with Irish Prime
Minister Bertie Ahern to minimize regulatory, customs and tax
barriers on doing business electronically. He touted the high-tech
industry as key to the prosperity of the once-poor Irish Republic.
	   ``Ireland will have its day in the sun because the most
important thing in the 21st century is the capacity of people to
imagine, to innovate, to create, to exchange ideas and
information,'' he said. ``By those standards this is a very wealthy
nation indeed.''
	   The two leaders digitally signed the electronic business pact on
a pair of laptop computers, a technological step which Clinton said
left him yearning for his pen.
	   ``Do you have any idea how much time I spend every day signing
my name?'' he said. ``I'm going to feel utterly useless if I can't
do that anymore.''
	   Clinton noted that 470 U.S. companies have invested in Ireland,
many of them devoted to information technology like Gateway and all
of them ``transforming the way the Irish interact and communicate
with other countries.''
	   Clinton said that Irish software exports _ second only to the
United States _ have been a key to creating a ``Celtic tiger
economy.'' Last year, the Irish economy grew by 7.7 percent and
unemployment hit a 20-year low, the president noted.
	   ``There has literally never been a better time, I don't suppose,
to be Irish because of the economic success, because of the
renaissance in writing, film-making, because of what so many people
are doing in so many ways to advance the cause of peace,'' he said.
	   At a morning photo opportunity, Ahern praised Clinton for making
a fresh contribution to the peace process in Northern Ireland.
	   ``What the president's visit has done is it has got the parties
to, I think, move what might have taken weeks and months over a
very short period,'' Ahern said.
	   The first of those steps was taken early this week by Gerry
Adams, president of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein Party who said that
violence should be finished in Northern Ireland.
	   That paved the way for Adams' first meeting, likely next week,
with David Trimble, leader of Northern Ireland's fledgling Assembly
and head of the main Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists.
	   ``I think the statements in the last few days by Gerry Adams and
Mr. Trimble's response make me quite hopeful about next week,''
Clinton said.
	   Trimble so far has refused to meet Adams, but in a speech in
Belfast on Thursday _ with Clinton looking on _ Trimble pledged to
work with those who are sincere in ``crossing the bridge from
terror to democracy.''
	   Trimble stressed that he wanted proof of that commitment from
the IRA, in the form of ``decommissioning'' some of its arsenal.
	   Clinton endorsed that position Friday, but also stressed that he
expected Sinn Fein to be given a role in Northern Ireland's new
government _ a step some Protestant unionists strongly oppose even
though it was envisioned in the peace agreement negotiated in
April.
	   ``What we all want is for the agreement to be fully implemented
so that all parts of it _ the decommissioning, the participation in
government by everyone who qualifies by vote of the people _ all
parts of it will be fully implemented,'' Clinton said.
	   Later, Clinton told reporters aboard Air Force One that the
peace process has progressed since his 1995 visit, which he termed
the first step and more ``celebratory.''
	   ``The peace process is much farther along this time,'' Clinton
said. ``But it's also at a critical juncture. Now we're trying to
take the last steps. They know what they've got to do.
	   ``They showed that yesterday when I walked the halls of Stormont
and they were all there together,'' he said, referring to the
gathering of all elected members of Northern Ireland's new
Assembly, people who for decades have been bitter adversaries.
``That's what they have to do.''

	   PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia (AP) _ The turbulent water off this
picturesque village where Swissair Flight 111 crashed into the sea
turned from a scene of fishermen frantically searching for
survivors to a painstaking military operation.
	   Authorities gave up Friday on the possibility they would find
any of the 229 people aboard the flight alive. They officially
called off rescue attempts, and focused on cleaning up.
	   Shrouded by a gray, soupy mist, officials in small military
boats fished out personal belongings, debris and the remains of
victims of Wednesday night's crash and delivered their cargo to the
HMCS Preserver, a 510-foot supply ship at the center of the
operation.
	   Private boats were banned from the area to keep them from
interfering with divers or a submarine that was searching for large
pieces of the wreckage in the choppy, agitated waters.
	   ``Small fishing boats have noisy diesel engines that interfere
with the sonar,'' said Navy Lt. Cmdr. Dan Agnew. Two large navy
ships patrolled the perimeter of the restricted area to keep boats
out.
	   At least two private boats were taken into police custody Friday
for traveling into the restricted area.
	   ``Be advised that this is a search-and-rescue area,'' a voice
from the Preserver boomed over the radio of one military boat.
``This is a no-fly, no-vessel, no-dive zone under my exclusive
jurisdiction. Return to port.''
	   The scene was vastly different from the early moments of the
rescue operation Wednesday, when fisherman and volunteers began
scrambling to find survivors.
	   Those townspeople had largely disappeared Friday, retreating to
their homes or leaving town to get away from the military and media
invasion.
	   Wayne Manuel, who had gone out on a boat Wednesday night after
the crash to try to save any survivors, left town Friday. A
neighbor, Darrell Fralick, said dashed hopes and the media circus
got to his friend.
	   ``They were expecting survivors,'' Fralick said. ``It's been
very upsetting.''
	   High seas and rough waters spread the wreckage over a
10-square-mile (26-sq.-kilometer) area, and human remains and
belongings floated to the surface.
	   Sgt. Keith McGuire of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said 100
soldiers were dispatched to collect items that washed up on the
shoreline.

	   The Supreme People's Assembly had been widely expected to elect
Kim Jong Il, North Korea's undisputed leader for four years, as
state president.
	   The assembly, however, adopted as its top agenda item the
amendment of the North Korean Constitution, said the North's
official Korean Central News Agency.
	   ``When the assembly elects a president, it has always been the
top agenda item,'' said Chang Yong-hoon, an analyst at Seoul's
semiofficial Naewoe Press, which monitors North Korean news media.
	   The last agenda item merely stated ``election for the state
leadership organs,'' without specifying.
	   Chang said the amendment of the constitution may be aimed at
abolishing the post of president. Or the North may leave the post
permanently vacant as a sign of respect for Kim's late father,
longtime President Kim Il Sung, who had ruled the country for
nearly half a century until he died of heart failure in 1994.
	   Even without the title of president, the junior Kim already is
firmly in control.
	   Since his father's demise, he has ruled his country as communist
party chief and head of the North's 1.1 million-strong military,
the world's fifth largest.
	   The brief KCNA dispatch said the assembly will also elect the
chairman of the North's National Defense Commission, the top
military post that the 56-year-old Kim has held since 1993. Kim was
likely to be reelected, Chang said.
	   Making a rare public appearance, Kim attended the assembly, KCNA
said.
	   Kim represents the first hereditary succession of power in a
communist state.
	   An estimated 680 deputies were chosen in a July 26 election for
a parliament that largely serves to rubber stamp legislation in the
tightly controlled country.
	   North Korea last amended its constitution in 1992 to give more
power to the National Defense Commission chief.
	   North Korea abolished the premiership and adopted the state
president in a constitutional amendment in 1972.
	   North Korean parliament last convened in 1994.

Spirlea defeats Serena Williams in tame match
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and ADDS Williams quotes; will be UPDATED after
Chang-Moya match &QL; 
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ No bumping. No cursing. And not much intensity
until a dramatic final two games that left Irina Spirlea pumping
her fists in triumph and Serena Williams walking dejectedly to her
chair.
	   In what promised to be a grudge match but turned into an
exhibition of mostly mundane tennis, Spirlea defeated Williams 6-3,
0-6, 7-5 Friday night to reach the fourth round of the U.S. Open.
	   Spirlea had collided with Serena's older sister, Venus, during a
changeover while losing in the semifinals last year. The incident
led Spirlea to curse Venus Williams after that match, and Richard
Williams _ the father of Serena and Venus _ to label Spirlea ``a
big, tall white turkey.''
	   Richard Williams also said at that time that Spirlea ``ought to
be glad it wasn't Serena she bumped into. She would have been
decked.''
	   But there were no fireworks or fistfights Friday night. The
players carefully avoided each other on changeovers, though they
exchanged only a perfunctory handshake after the match.
	   ``Tonight was not my night. That was the best she served in her
career. I didn't play that well. She had a lot of big serves I was
not able to return,'' Williams said. ``I'm pretty disappointed. I
didn't plan on losing today or in this tournament.''
	   The ninth-seeded Spirlea screamed after the final point and
swatted a ball high into the stands. Her victory kept up the
pattern of favorites moving easily through the tournament _ only
two seeded women and three seeded men have been eliminated so far.
	   Spirlea won the first set in 28 minutes, hardly enough time for
guys in the corporate boxes to remove their pinstriped jackets and
Wall Street power ties. One fan yelled ``turkey'' as the set ended.
	   Williams became more aggressive in the second set, and stayed
even early in the third set with some acrobatic saves on which she
ran down Spirlea's shots into the corners.
	   After one Williams save resulted in Spirlea netting an overhead,
Spirlea slammed her racket on the court in disgust as Venus
Williams celebrated in the stands.
	   With the score 5-5 in the third set, Spirlea used two passing
shots to set up the service break. Venus Williams stared at the
ground in the stands, expressionless and stunned.
	   Spirlea followed that up by holding her serve for the match,
including her sixth ace. Williams had just three aces in the match,
and committed 19 unforced errors in the final set.
	   Spirlea said there is no animosity between her and the Williams
family. But when asked whether she was friendly enough to go out to
dinner with Serena, she demurred.
	   ``I don't have time for dinner tonight,'' she cracked. ``I'll
call her and have her in my room for room service.''
	   Though she has risen from No. 453 to No. 20 in the world
rankings in less than a year, Williams said 1998 has not been a
success for her.
	   ``I am very disappointed this year because I feel that I could
have won at least a Grand Slam this year, especially this one in
particular, but obviously I didn't do it,'' she said.
	   Spirlea's next opponent will be No. 3 Jana Novotna, a Wimbledon
champion no longer burdened by past failures. As she wins, Novotna
finally is doing something that once seemed so remote _ having fun.
	   Novotna, who beat Sandrine Testud 6-2, 6-3 to reach the fourth
round, until this summer had been known mostly for defeats in
Wimbledon finals in 1993 and 1997 in which she squandered big
leads.
	   ``I think that after winning Wimbledon, yes, I have completed my
career,'' she said. ``An enormous dream came true for me and I am
just looking forward to playing more and enjoying it more. I am
just feeling incredibly relieved and just happy of what I have
achieved.''
	   Top-seeded Martina Hingis faced a familiar predicament against
Amelie Mauresmo, and came up with a familiar response.
	   Down by a set against Mauresmo for the second time this summer,
the world's top player again ran off an impressive streak to reach
the fourth round. The top-seeded Hingis, who had not lost a set in
the U.S. Open since 1996, rallied to defeat Mauresmo 4-6, 6-2, 6-2.
	   Hingis trailed Mauresmo by a set and 4-1 in the second set of a
Federation Cup match in Switzerland in July before rallying to win.
This time, Hingis was down by a set and tied 1-1 in the second
before winning 11 of the last 14 games.
	   ``The first set I guess I was still in practice,'' Hingis said.
``Then I said to myself, `Hey, girl, wake up. You don't want to go
back home.'''
	   Also advancing with little trouble to the fourth round was No. 6
Monica Seles, who won 6-3, 6-3 over Annie Miller. Seles is one
victory from a probable encounter with Hingis in the quarterfinals.
	   Steffi Graf reached the fourth round with a 6-1, 6-1 victory in
43 minutes over Mirjana Lucic in which she won nine straight games.
Graf, the No. 8 seed, made just seven unforced errors to 33 for
Lucic.
	   Lucic had eight double faults, often missing serves by several
feet. At one point in the second set, she stood at the service line
and shrugged.
	   When Lucic whiffed on a serve by Graf in the final game of the
match, a fan yelled ``strike one.''
	   ``It was like a nightmare, that's what it was like out there
today,'' Lucic said. ``I totally missed the ball, that didn't
happen when I was 3 1/2 years old.''
	   No. 14 Dominique Van Roost lost 6-4, 6-2 to Kimberly Po. The
only other women's seed ousted so far is No. 16 Ai Sugiyama, who
pulled out in the second round with a sprained ankle.
	   Winners among the men were No. 2 Marcelo Rios, No. 5 Richard
Krajicek, No. 7 Alex Corretja, No. 11 Yevgeny Kafelnikov and No. 13
Tim Henman.
	   The success by seeded men is in stark contrast to the upsets at
the two previous Grand Slams.
	   Seven of the top eight men's seeds have made it to the third
round, compared to just three at Wimbledon and one at the French
Open.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Searchers have few answers to offer
the many relatives arriving and wondering what went wrong aboard
Swissair Flight 111: Surging tides quickly are spreading debris of
the shattered jet and sonar is not finding its vital data
recorders.
	   A family of six were the first relatives to arrive Friday in
Peggy's Cove, the fishing village near the ocean crash site where
229 people, including 131 Americans, died Wednesday night. Canadian
troops escorted the family to a private area on a bluff overlooking
the ocean.
	   Exasperated authorities, meanwhile, ordered curiosity-seekers to
keep their boats away from the crash scene and nearby shore, and
warned journalists not to intrude on the relatives' privacy.
Investigators and police were looking for people who saw the MD-11
go down.
	   Authorities also were mapping the ocean floor in preparation for
sending down a small, remote-controlled submersible to check out
the sea bed, said Vic Gerden, head of the Canadian Transportation
Safety Board's crash investigation.
	   A navy submarine equipped with high-tech sonar was unable Friday
to trace the MD-11's flight data recorders, which are hoped to
provide clues to the cause of the crash.
	   Finding the devices may take time because a beacon that sends a
tracking signal to guide searchers to them was not working in the
water, Philippe Bruggisser, chief of Swissair's parent SAirGroup,
said in Geneva.
	   Divers and spotter planes joined the recovery effort, but debris
was steadily spreading. Body parts were washing up on beaches.
About 100 Canadian soldiers were out combing the shoreline.
	   ``We can't contain the debris,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Glenn
Chamberlain, one of the search coordinators. ``All we can do is try
to find it.''
	   Searchers had yet to find any piece of wreckage larger than the
roof of a car, raising concern that fully reconstructing the jet _
a tool helpful to determining what happened _ might be impossible.
	   ``If we do not find more than what we have today, there's no
talking about any kind of reconstruction,'' said Benoit Bouchard of
the Canadian Transportation Safety Board.
	   Sgt. Andre Geurtin of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said the
most significant find during Friday's search was about 100 mostly
intact pieces of luggage, probably from the plane's cargo hold.
	   Only at midday Friday did search coordinators formally state
what had seemed clear since Wednesday night _ that there were no
survivors among those aboard the New York-to-Geneva flight.
	   That announcement, coupled with the failure thus far to find the
plane's fuselage or flight recorders, gave authorities only
discouraging news to offer family members arriving from Europe and
the United States.
	   ``It was important for the victims' families, for whom it is
only natural to hold out one last hope, that we did everything
which could possibly be done to find survivors,'' said Rear Adm.
Dusty Miller, one of the search commanders. ``There is no longer a
last hope.''
	   Chartered planes from New York and Switzerland arrived about 20
minutes apart Friday, bringing more than 300 relatives, grief
counselors and airline staff. The family members quickly were
escorted to a private area at customs. Many wore black. One couple
hugged; another woman clutched her chest while a companion held her
arm.
	   At search headquarters in Peggy's Cove, authorities set up a row
of green army tents overlooking the ocean to provide some privacy
for family members wishing to visit the site. The first arrived
Friday afternoon.
	   Peter Gerety _ who traveled from Connecticut to be near the site
where his brother, U.N. worker Pierce Gerety, was killed _ carried
two rocks off the beach.
	   ``I just felt like having a memento. It was such a beautiful
place, and that's the irony of it.''
	   In the evening, family members converged at a Halifax hotel for
briefings from airline officials and other authorities. The meeting
was closed to reporters, and none of the relatives spoke afterward.
	   Jeffrey Katz, president and CEO of Swissair, said at a news
conference that a private memorial service would be held Saturday,
probably at the hotel.
	   He said the chief medical examiner would decide when remains and
personal effects would be returned to families.
	   Earlier, Swissair said 132 Americans were on board the doomed
flight. In a press release Friday, the airline reduced that figure
by one, giving no explanation.

Nunn defeats Thomas, Tyson loses to Hurtado
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Two-time world champion Michael Nunn won a
lackluster unanimous decision over Glenn Thomas in a 10-round
cruiserweight fight Friday night.
	   Nunn, who had held the IBF middleweight and WBA
super-middleweight titles, landed punches at will most of the
fight.
	   But they had little effect on Thomas (26-5), who spent most of
the bout against the ropes. Thomas, of Louisville, Kentucky,
occasionally scored with short combinations to the head.
	   Two judges scored the bout 99-91 for Nunn, while the third had
him winning 100-90.
	   Nunn, of Davenport, Iowa, improved his record to 53-4.
	   In a super-lightweight bout, Diobelys Hurtado stopped Darryl
Tyson, of Washington, in the fifth round.
	   Hurtado, ranked sixth by the WBC, sent Tyson (47-11-1) to the
canvas three times in the final round. The 37-year-old Tyson, in
his first bout since October 1996, disputed the second and third
knockdowns, claiming he slipped and was pushed behind the head.
	   But referee Jorge Alonso ruled otherwise and stopped the bout at
2:30 of the round by virtue of the three-knockdown rule.
	   ``The first knockdown I was really hurt but the other two were
not knockdowns,'' Tyson said. ``The referee did everything to
protect him.
	   ``It's a shame this was stopped because I was really coming
on.''
	   Tyson shocked Hurtado (27-1, 19 KOs) by flooring him with a
short right to the head late in the second round.
	   Hurtado, a former member of the Cuban national team now living
in Hialeah, survived the knockdown and began to connect with jabs
and combinations to the head and body.
	   ``He caught me with a good shot but I was able to recover right
away,'' Hurtado said.
	   Hurtado, 26, hopes the victory earns him a WBC super-lightweight
title shot. Miguel Angel Gonzalez and Kostya Tszyu are expected to
fight for the vacant crown later this year.

	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ While he's Mighty Mac against the rest of the
National League, Mark McGwire is a big zero against the Cincinnati
Reds.
	   McGwire remained at 59 homers, going 0-for-3 with a walk Friday
night in the St. Louis Cardinals' 3-2 loss to Cincinnati. He's
homered against every other NL team, but doesn't have a single RBI
against the Reds this season.
	   By changing speeds, Pete Harnisch (11-6) got McGwire to fly out
to right in the first, then struck him out in the third and walked
him in the fifth, loading the bases.
	   Scott Sullivan struck out McGwire on three pitchers to end the
seventh, making him look like an ordinary hitter with a two-strike
slider low and away.
	   McGwire came into the five-game homestand with 12 homers in 16
games, including two each at Florida on both Tuesday and Wednesday
nights. He has 22 games left to catch Roger Maris' record of 61,
but his lead over Sammy Sosa was cut to two when Sosa hit his 57th
in the Chicago Cubs' 5-2 win at Pittsburgh.
	   The largest crowd at Busch Stadium this year, 48,076, stood and
cheered every McGwire at-bat, flashbulbs popping on each pitch.
	   Cincinnati is 7-0 against St. Louis this year, exercising
extreme caution against McGwire, walking him 12 times. He's
2-for-16 against the Reds this season, and against Harnisch he's
2-for-10 in his career with one homer _ that back in 1989.
 &UR; Cubs 5, Pirates 2
	   In Pittsburgh, Sammy Sosa kept the pressure on Mark McGwire in
baseball's historic home run derby, breaking Hack Wilson's Chicago
Cubs record with his 57th homer and driving in the go-ahead run.
	   Sosa, who has now homered against every NL team this season, hit
a 2-0 pitch from Jason Schmidt off a right-field auxiliary
scoreboard in the first inning to break Wilson's 68-year-old
record.
	   His homer drew a curtain call from an enthusiastic crowd of
36,510 that passed up a western Pennsylvania tradition _ the first
night of the high school football season _ to possibly see history.
	   Sosa was 2-for-5 with a single, scored twice and reached base
four times, the last two on errors.
	   The Cubs, who have 21 games remaining, have won five straight
and eight of nine to maintain their one-game lead over New York in
the NL wild-card race. The Pirates lost their seventh in a row
after winning nine straight.
	   Matt Karchner (3-0) pitched two scoreless relief innings for the
victory.
 &UR; Mets 2, Braves 1 &QC; 
	   In New York, Mike Piazza gave Mets' fans his best Mark McGwire
imitation.
	   Piazza homered for the third straight game, a McGwire-like
485-foot shot over the left field picnic area.
	   Piazza, who turned 30 Friday, was 3-for-3 with a walk, homering
after John Olerud's walk in the fourth. Piazza has eight homers in
his last 14 games.
	   New York, which had been 0-5 against the Braves this season, has
homered in 10 consecutive games, hitting seven in its last three.
	   Al Leiter (14-5) won for the fourth time in five starts,
pitching a five-hitter with two strikeouts and three walks. It was
his fourth complete game of the season.
	   Tom Glavine, trying to become the first 19-game winner in the
majors, dropped to 11-2 on the road. Glavine (18-6) allowed two
runs and five hits in seven innings.
 &UR; Expos 8, Marlins 0 &QC; 
	   In Miami, Dustin Hermanson combined with two relievers on a
three-hitter and Shane Andrews homered twice as Montreal handed
Florida its eighth straight loss.
	   Hermanson (13-10) allowed three hits in seven innings, striking
out eight. Hermanson won for the sixth time in eight starts. He was
followed by Steve Kline and Ugueth Urbina, who pitched one hitless
inning apiece.
	   Andrews hit two of Montreal's four homers. He hit a solo shot
off starter Brian Meadows (10-11) in the fifth and another off
reliever Justin Speier in the seventh. Andrews, who has 22 homers,
has three career multihomer games.
	   Derrick May and Chris Widger hit back-to-back homers off Meadows
in the sixth, giving the Expos a 7-0 lead.
 &UR; Phillies 6, Brewers 2
	   In Milwaukee, Curt Schilling struck out 10 to increase his major
league-leading total to 268 as Philadelphia stopped a three-game
losing streak.
	   Schilling (14-12) allowed both runs and six hits in seven
innings, reaching double digits in strikeouts for the 14th time
this season and the 43rd time in his career. He led the NL with 319
strikeouts last season.
	   Rookie Steve Woodard (9-10) lost his fifth consecutive start,
giving up six runs _ two earned _ and five hits in four innings.

Celebrations leave 11 dead in traffic accidents

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam's victory over Thailand in the
semifinals of the Tiger Cup soccer tournament came at a cost _ a
flurry of traffic accidents as fans on motorbikes poured into the
streets to celebrate.
	   Such outbursts have become common after the national team scores
major victories in the soccer-mad country. Fans speed around the
cities' major streets, waving the Vietnamese flag.
	   Ho Chi Minh City's Cho Ray hospital normally gets 100 cases a
day from traffic accidents. The Thanh Nien newspaper reported
Saturday that the number shot up to 443 on Wednesday _ National Day
_ and Thursday, with nine deaths.
	   Another two people died in Hanoi. Viet Duc, the capital's major
hospital for injury treatment, said traffic accidents doubled on
Thursday when Vietnam beat Thailand 3-0 to advance into the final.
	   Meanwhile, the Labor newspaper reported Saturday that Ho Chi
Minh City police seized 175 motorbikes for traffic violations
Thursday night, while 22 bikes were seized in Hanoi.
	   Prices being demanded by scalpers provided further proof of
soccer's popularity. A 65,000-dong (dlrs 4.65) ticket was going for
700,000 dong (dlrs 50) just before Thursday's match, and prices
already had risen to 500,000 dong (dlrs 36) a day before Saturday
night's final.
	   Those are huge amounts in one of the world's poorest countries,
with an average per capita income of about dlrs 300 per year.

Yankees 11, White Sox 6
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ The New York Yankees reached 100 wins on the
earliest date in major league history as Bernie Williams homered
twice Friday night in an 11-6 victory over the Chicago White Sox.
	   By reaching No. 100 on Sept. 4, the Yankees accomplished the
feat five days earlier than the 1906 Chicago Cubs and the 1954
Cleveland Indians.
	   The '06 Cubs set the major league record for the fewest games to
reach 100 victories (132). The Yankees (100-38) set an AL record,
doing it four days earlier than the '54 Indians.
	   If the Yankees go 17-7 or better during the rest of the season,
they would break the AL record of 111 wins set by the '54 Indians
and the major league record set of 116 set by the '06 Cubs.
	   With the Yankees trailing 4-3 in the eighth, Chuck Knoblauch
reached on an infield hit, stole second and scored on Derek Jeter's
single off Chad Bradford (2-1).
	   After Bill Simas relieved, Jeter stole second and raced to third
on catcher Chad Kreuter's overthrow. Williams' 23rd homer made it
6-4 and Tino Martinez followed with his 25th homer. It was the
eighth multihomer game for Williams.
	   Graeme Lloyd (3-0) got the final out of the seventh for the
win.
 &UR; Indians 10, Tigers 2 &QC; 
	   In Detroit, Charles Nagy beat Detroit again with a five-hitter
and Manny Ramirez and Travis Fryman hit three-run homers for
Cleveland.
	   Richie Sexson also homered as the Indians won for the fifth time
in six games. The Tigers have lost three straight, 25 of 32 and are
1-3 since Larry Parrish became interim manager when Buddy Bell was
fired Tuesday.
	   Nagy (13-9) has won three straight starts and improved his
career record against Detroit to 15-4, his most wins against any
club.
	   Nagy walked none and struck out seven in his first complete game
since May 9, 1997, at Detroit. He reached 1,000 career strikeouts
when he fanned Bobby Higginson in the fifth.
	   Rookie Seth Greisinger (4-8) lasted just four-plus innings.
 &UR; Blue Jays 12, Red Sox 1 &QC; 
	   In Toronto, Jose Canseco hit a three-run homer and Shawn Green
had four hits as Toronto won its eighth consecutive game.
	   After winning the first two games of the four-game series, the
Blue Jays are within seven games of the Red Sox, the AL wild-card
leader. Toronto would pull within five games with a sweep.
	   Green tied a career high with the four hits, capping his night
with an eighth-inning homer off Carlos Reyes. It made Green the
first Toronto player ever with 30 homers and steals (32).
	   Pat Hentgen (12-10), who missed his previous start due to
tendinitis in his right shoulder, allowed just one run and four
hits in 6 1-3 innings. Dave Stieb pitched 2 1-3 innings for his
second save of the season and third of his career.
	   Tim Wakefield (15-7) was pounded for eight runs _ six earned _
and eight hits in 6 1-3 innings.
 &UR; Rangers 9, Twins 3 &QC; 
	   In Arlington, Texas, Will Clark drove in four runs and Juan
Gonzalez bettered his club record single-season RBI mark.
	   Clark had a two-run single in the third and a two-run double in
the sixth to extend his hitting streak to 13 games with a 3-for-4
night.
	   Gonzalez, the major league RBI leader with 146, was hit by a
pitch with the bases loaded in a five-run third, and added an RBI
double in the eighth.
	   Gonzalez surpassed his own team record of 144 RBIs set in 1996,
and extended his hitting streak to 15 games.
	   Paul Molitor went 2-for-4 and drove in all three runs for the
Twins.
	   Rangers starter Aaron Sele (17-10) allowed three runs _ one
earned _ and six hits in seven innings to extend his winning streak
to four games.
