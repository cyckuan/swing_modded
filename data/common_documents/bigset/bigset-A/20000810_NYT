METS CRUSH ASTROS, 12-5 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ If there is one thing Jay Payton does not need, it is
more rest. The New York Mets center fielder missed most of the last
three years with injuries, and the presence of Darryl Hamilton
could cause Payton to sit out a few more games this year. ``I won't
say there's benefit to having rest,'' Payton said.
</P>
<P>
   Not every game will work out the way Wednesday night's did for
the Mets, who pounded the Houston Astros, 12-5, at Enron Field. The
Mets built an early lead off Jose Lima, which allowed Manager Bobby
Valentine to use Hamilton, Payton and Benny Agbayani in the same
game. Hamilton, who had been out with a toe injury, homered in his
first at-bat since April 6.
</P>
<P>
   But in most games, Valentine will have to choose among the
veteran Hamilton and the young players Payton and Agbayani for two
spots, left and center field. The players are aware of the
situation. ``All three like to play every day, I'm sure,'' Payton
said. ``But that's not going to be the case.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, the threesome played ``Can You Top This?''
for nine innings. Payton went 2 for 4 with a homer. Agbayani went 2
for 3 with two runs batted in. And Hamilton, pinch-hitting for
Agbayani in the sixth, punched a curveball from Jason Green off the
side of the left-field scoreboard and into the bullpen for a home
run.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old Hamilton, a center fielder, played the next two
innings in left, his first game at the position in nearly seven
years. Bubba Trammell took over for Hamilton in the eighth and was
on base when Mike Piazza belted his 30th homer of the year, a
majestic 445-foot shot that cleared the farthest center-field fence
in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The victory made the Mets 5-0 in Rick Reed's starts since he
returned from a wrist injury in mid-July. The right-hander has a
2.78 earned run average during that span, and he improved to 7-2
with seven solid innings on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Reed retired 12 of 13 hitters from the first inning until the
fifth, when Tony Eusebio homered. By then, the Astros were well
behind. With one out in the second, Todd Zeile dropped a hit in
front of right fielder Lance Berkman, who dove for the ball and
missed. It rolled to the wall as Robin Ventura scored and Zeile
pulled in with a triple. One batter later, after Zeile scored on a
wild pitch, Payton lined a ball over the left-field scoreboard to
give the Mets a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Payton's ball would probably have stayed in any other park, but
that did not really matter. Payton had not homered since the first
game after the All-Star Game break, and he has been bothered by a
sprained wrist suffered on a swing in early July. Payton has gotten
his hits, maintaining an average near .300, but he has favored the
wrist and hit more grounders since the injury.
</P>
<P>
   The home run was the 36th Lima has allowed this year, the most
in the majors. The right-hander, who won 21 games last year, lost
13 games in a row after winning his first start this year. He had
won his last three decisions before losing on Wednesday night to
drop his record to 4-14. Lima's problems started up again in the
third. Agbayani doubled off the right-field wall, then Derek Bell
lined a ball into the right-field corner, where it wedged under the
padded wall. Bell got a run-scoring triple, and Edgardo Alfonzo
singled him in to make it 5-1 Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Payton and Mike Bordick singled to lead off the fourth, and
after a sacrifice bunt, Lima was removed from the game. Agbayani
blooped a two-run single off Joe Slusarski, giving the Mets a 7-1
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   When Reed singled off Green to lead off the sixth, every Met in
the starting lineup had gotten a hit. Green left the game two
batters later, when Bell followed Hamilton's homer with a smash up
the middle that caught the rookie right-hander in the abdomen.
Green recovered and threw to first for the out, but was bruised and
had to leave the game.

ANGELS MAY NEED MORE PITCHING HELP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Angels have boasted of their pitching
depth all season, but the events of the past 10 days might
eventually lead them to claim another starter off waivers to fill
out the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   As of now, the Angels have a three-man rotation of Ramon Ortiz,
Scott Schoeneweis and Matt Wise. Kent Mercker will become the
fourth starter when he is activated Saturday. The Angels won't need
a fifth starter until Aug. 19 when they play the Yankees in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Seth Etherton nor Jarrod Washburn will be eligible to
come off the disabled list by then, leaving Brian Cooper as their
top option. Cooper was sent back to Triple-A Edmonton on Monday to
work out mechanical flaws in his delivery.
</P>
<P>
   There is a possibility Cooper won't be ready by then, leaving
the Angels with the option to start a reliever _ either Mike Fyhrie
or Al Levine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The options we have here are viable,'' manager Mike Scioscia
said. ``But our guys always have their ear to the pavement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My own feeling is we're going to do it with somebody we've
got,'' general manager Bill Stoneman said. ``We're not really ready
to determine that right now. ... Anything's possible. There could
be a surprise, that's part of the business. Things happen.
Opportunities spring up, you jump at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman said he isn't second-guessing himself for releasing Ken
Hill or trading Kent Bottenfield. Even though Bottenfield has been
gone since July 30, he still leads the team in starts (21) and
innings pitched (1272/3).
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran into a couple fluky things,'' Stoneman said. ``Etherton
goes out, Washburn goes out. We'll get through this. We ran into
this early in the year and got through it. Most importantly, we're
delighted to have Ronny Gant (obtained in the trade for
Bottenfield). He won a game for us with two home runs the other
night. He's going to be a huge part of the offense the rest of the
year.''
</P>
<P>
   SHORT HOPS: Pitcher Tim Belcher threw lightly off a mound and
played long toss Wednesday. Belcher, who is recovering from a
strained muscle in his right elbow, is not close to returning. ...
Shortstop Kevin Stocker has been bothered by a sore hamstring the
past few games. ... The Angels are off today, then begin a
three-game series against the defending champion Yankees on
Friday. &QL;

   Houston's traffic, talent impress Dimel
</P>
<P>
   By DALE ROBERTSON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   One of the tallest buildings in the state of Wyoming is a dorm
next to the football stadium in Laramie. It is five stories high.
As for the traffic . . . what traffic?
</P>
<P>
   ``I could leave my house at 7:54,'' Dana Dimel recalls (fondly,
I suspect), ``and be in the office by 8 a.m. Not being an early
morning person, that change is something I'm having to get used
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he has left the University of Wyoming for the
University of Houston, a lifestyle change of approximately 180
degrees, Dimel's alarm clock will be going off no later than 6,
since he must commute from Richmond to the UH campus near downtown.
</P>
<P>
   But as of this morning, things start returning to normal for
him. The Cougars begin two-a-days, and football practice is
football practice, whether it is in the shadow cast by the Rocky
Mountains or by Houston's skyline.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my two feet are back on the field,'' Dimel said, ``it
will feel the same. I'll be in the environment I'm used to.''
</P>
<P>
   There are certain benefits to be gleaned from his new urban
setting, however. Most important, lots and lots of prospective
Cougars are growing up in close proximity to Dimel's workplace.
Probably more people reside inside Loop 610 than in all of Wyoming
and his previous home of Manhattan, Kan., combined.
</P>
<P>
   And since his is hardly the only game in town, Dimel isn't in a
fishbowl anymore. He can ply his trade without stifling scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of a nuts-and-bolts guy,'' the former Kansas State
offensive lineman admits. ``I'm a grinder. I don't need a lot of
attention to be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dimel is no dimwit. He realizes his effectiveness as a coach
will be measured not only in wins and losses but also in the
attention his football team garners in a crowded, jaded market. Kim
Helton didn't get fired for a 7-4 season that ended with three
victories in a row. He got fired because athletic director Chet
Gladchuk saw zero excitement swirling about Helton's program after
seven erratic, mostly lackluster seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Dimel must sell tickets. Otherwise, UH is wasting a lot of money
on him at $600,000 per for five years, plus the cash it took to buy
out Helton's contract.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, while this guy may be a stranger to his chaotic new
neighborhood, he is well-versed on the circumstances in which he
finds himself. At K-State, he grew accustomed to playing before
crowds of 8,000. Yet after a decade of coaching there as an
assistant to Bill Snyder, Dimel saw the Wildcats selling 40,000
season tickets. Then, in Dimel's third of three consecutive winning
seasons at Wyoming, hardly a bastion of football tradition either,
the Cowboys routinely attracted 20,000-plus, a reachable goal at
UH.
</P>
<P>
   Dimel concedes the Cougars' entrenched attendance woes ``scare
me a little bit.'' But the problem, two decades old, has him
thinking creatively. For example, until people have begun flocking
through the turnstiles _ yes, he says they eventually will _ he
will dispense with the common recruiting tactic of bringing
prospects to games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want them to see the empty seats,'' he said. ``That
hurts you.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he will have the kids he is chasing tour Robertson
Stadium and visit the training complex on off days. Dimel thinks
UH's facilities, for the short term, are his greatest selling
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't succeed here, with everything we have,'' he said,
``I'll have nobody to blame but myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Dimel does not want for self-confidence, as his introductory
news conference last December revealed. He was extremely aware of
where his accomplishments ranked vis-a-vis other coaches of his age
and experience level. As Dimel pointed out, only Joe Tiller, whom
he replaced at Wyoming, won more games over the next three seasons
at a new school, with Tiller's 24 victories at Purdue besting his
23.
</P>
<P>
   His expectations at UH are at least as high, although he admits
he doesn't have much of a feel for what he is up against in
Conference USA. But he loves the Texas talent pool, and he knows it
well, having recruited the state for Kansas State for a number of
years.
</P>
<P>
   All except one member of his first Cougars class is a Texan, and
only three are not from the greater Houston area. That's a bunch of
extra fans right there, what with so many extended families in easy
_ usually _ driving distance of the stadium. A disproportionate
percentage of parents of Helton's players, in contrast, lived in
Florida and were, understandably, rarely seen.
</P>
<P>
   Also rarely seen in Helton's program was the boola-boola
camaraderie that is crucial at the college level. Kim's NFL roots
made things a bit too businesslike, according to insiders, with the
players going in all different directions when practice ended.
Dimel is building a closer-knit squad. He wants a small-town
atmosphere in his locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the big-city chaos outside.

TROJANS FRESHMAN IS A HIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ It's early in training camp, but freshman
strong safety Matt Grootegoed is making such a big impression that
no one is discounting the possibility he could start this season.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Mater Dei High graduate was considered the No.3
strong safety. Today, he is considered No.2 after an impressive
three days of practices. And Grootegoed, who developed a reputation
in high school as a big hitter, will finally get a chance to show
his true talent today when the Trojans hold their first practice in
pads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've seen his strength,'' secondary coach
Dennis Thurman said. ``I'll be surprised if hitting isn't a big
part of his game. Matt Grootegoed will have one heck of a career
before he leaves USC.''
</P>
<P>
   Grootegoed might be the best bet among the true freshmen trying
to break into the starting lineup. It's already been decided he
will start on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Troy Polamalu is currently USC's starting strong
safety, but he has not started a game and the position is
considered wide open. The other candidate is senior DeShaun Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of work I have to do. I don't really know how
good I'm doing,'' Grootegoed said Wednesday. ``Not right away, but
I hope to start later in my college career. It's really intense
playing so far, there's no room for mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   UNDER FIRE: Junior cornerback Kris Richard will start at left
cornerback in place of Antuan Simmons, who is redshirting while
recovering from surgery to remove a stomach tumor.
</P>
<P>
   It means a much tougher season for Richard, who will see many
more passes thrown his way than last season when he played right
cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   `He'll probably see 50 more balls thrown at him than last
season,'' Thurman said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard doesn't believe it will be a drastic switch, because he
played left corner against UCLA and Louisiana Tech last season,
when Simmons was out with a back injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it,'' he said. ``I was thinking, I better grow up fast.
It's time to become a man. It hurts not having Antuan. Right now,
the test will be for me to build on the foundation he set.''
</P>
<P>
   QUICK STUDY: Former Chatsworth High quarterback Matt Cassel has
impressed coach Paul Hackett with his maturity in his first
practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a natural leadership ability and huddle skills. I'm
very pleased,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Cassel's biggest adjustment has been trying to get used to the
speed of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is tremendously fast,'' Cassel said. ``There's such
a difference between varsity (high school) and Division I
football.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett is giving Cassel an opportunity to win the No.2
quarterback position, but he will probably redshirt unless starter
Carson Palmer gets injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get my shot, I get my shot. If not, that's fine with
me,'' Cassel said. ``If Carson plays throughout the season, what
I'll probably do (is redshirt).''
</P>
<P>
   IT'S A SNAP: Hackett said defensive tackle Bernard Riley would
probably handle snapping for field goals, but he is still searching
for a candidate to replace Zeke Moreno on punts. Moreno will be the
punt snapper in the season opener against Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for place-kicker expects to heat up today as Hackett
intends to give more time to kicking now that the Trojans are in
pads. The kickers were 1 for 3 during Wednesday's practice. &QL;

 &HT;    CASA GRANDE'S DIRTY SECRET(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By EDYTHE JENSEN(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Casa Grande, Ariz.) - A racially charged prank by two Casa
Grande police officers has exposed a history of bizarre practical
jokes, police misconduct and racial tensions in this rural
community south of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Two Casa Grande officers who were punished for impersonating
Blacks and Hispanics while making prank calls to their own
department were told Wednesday night by the city personnel board
that they would learn before the end of the month whether the
disciplinary action taken against them would be upheld.
</P>
<P>
   Galen Flynn and Chris Western's 10-day suspensions and pay
reductions were unfair, attorney Armand Salese said, because the
department has for years condoned officer-initiated crank calls,
racial slurs and even illegal conduct - some of it aimed against
racial minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all cases of police misconduct in Casa Grande are racists;
some are just bad,'' Salese noted.
</P>
<P>
   He then cited reports of police brutality against a restrained
suspect, allegations that an officer solicited sex from a homeless
person, an officer's felony misuse of confidential police records
to investigate his daughter's boyfriend, and a prank during which
an officer set off a firecracker to make another policeman believe
a gun had been fired.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Robert Huddleston said the incidents cited by
Salese happened over a 20-year-period. The officer was disciplined
for records misuse, the sex allegation was deemed unfounded and the
other two accusations were not reported to supervisors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The personnel hearing at Casa Grande City Hall was opened to the
public Tuesday and Wednesday at the two officers' request and
attracted more than 100 spectators, some of whom said recordings of
the prank brought to light years of police harassment of minority
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tapes make me sick to my stomach,'' Casa Grande native
Rose Gibson said. ``But Black people here have known this has been
going on for a long time; it's really coming out now.''
</P>
<P>
   In one tape, Flynn and Western summon officers to a home by
pretending to be one of the occupants and speaking in an
exaggerated Black dialect. Huddleston said the two officers were
punished for endangering residents and other police officers with a
false call.
</P>
<P>
   Salese called the pair's prank ``a stupid-human trick'' in an
atmosphere where that kind of behavior was encouraged. He played a
tape of another Casa Grande officer mimicking a Black man as he
called for a female officer to help him change a child's diaper.
</P>
<P>
   The officer who made that call to his own department is Rudy
Reyes, son of Pinal County Sheriff Frank Reyes. Salese said the
tape has been played for years at police briefings and parties for
laughs, leading officers to believe it was acceptable to ridicule
minorities in fake calls to the department.
</P>
<P>
   Huddleston said he first heard it two years ago and laughed at
it; no disciplinary action was taken against Reyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not proud to talk about any of this,'' Huddleston said of
the Reyes incident. He said Reyes went out of his way not to give
an address, and his call did not endanger residents or other
officers - a key difference between Reyes' action and that of Flynn
and Western.
</P>
<P>
   The chief said Reyes' tape is not an example of police racism
because the comments were not made in public and were not directed
at minority residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cultural sensitivity is a big issue, and I would be foolish to
say it's not an issue in this department. It's probably something
we need to improve,'' Huddleston said.
</P>
<P>
   By appealing their punishment in public, Flynn and Western are
trying ``to embarrass the department, the city and our officers in
order to get concessions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's unfair,'' Huddleston added.
</P>
<P>
   Huddleston said he is now working on changes in departmental
conduct guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Salese said an undercurrent of racism in the department needs to
be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some supervisors have permitted a racist attitude in the
department, and that sends a negative message about Blacks in the
community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Salese is hopeful that Flynn and Western's appeal will bring
change to department practices.
</P>
<P>
   Casa Grande employs 55 sworn police officers; two are Black,
Huddleston said.
</P>
<P>
   Called to support the two officers' contention that other
misconduct goes unpunished, Casa Grande Police Sgt. Dennis Mercer
said that it was a common practice among Casa Grande officers to
make prank phone calls, and that supervisors knew about them.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning by City Attorney Kay Bigelow, Mercer
acknowledged that he had been the subject of police brutality
complaints and that some were determined to be founded.
</P>
<P>
   Bigelow also brought out the fact that Western and Flynn had a
history of disciplinary problems. Both had been reprimanded for
leaving a narcotics training class in Scottsdale early and going to
a topless bar. Flynn was disciplined for leaving a department
machine gun in his open garage, from which it was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Western was reprimanded for pursuing a suspect in a high-speed
car chase through a residential neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Records also show the pair are the only two officers in
department history to receive medals of valor. The two ran into a
burning building to save a resident.

POLL SHOWS SCHOOL REFORM INITIATIVES FARING POORLY
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Two education initiatives expected to be fiercely
battled this fall are faring poorly, according to a new poll.
</P>
<P>
   Both a measure supporting vouchers and one to lower the
two-thirds vote requirement for local school bonds are failing to
gain support from a majority of voters, a poll released by the
Public Policy Institute of California says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ironically when Californians are saying they are really
concerned about schools, they seem to be opting for the status quo
instead of measures that are oriented toward shaking things up,''
said Mark Baldassare, director of the poll. ``The education
initiatives are going to have a tough go at it this fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters are evenly divided on the voucher initiative, with 45
percent supporting it, 44 percent opposed and 11 percent with no
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Initiatives that do not begin with a majority of support often
have a hard time passing, especially when there will be an active
``no'' campaign, as is the case for the voucher measure, Baldassare
said.
</P>
<P>
   This measure, Proposition 38, would give parents $4,000 in state
money that can be used to help pay for private schooling. Democrats
are overwhelmingly more opposed to the initiative than Republicans.
It is also opposed by residents in the Bay Area, while supported by
those in San Diego and the Central Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos favor the voucher initiative, 56 percent to 35 percent,
even though most are Democrats. But Baldassare said he did not know
if those numbers would hold up during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may align more with Democrats over time,'' he said. ``The
pro-voucher side sees Latinos as a key audience because of the
belief that Latinos may be more likely to opt for parochial
schools, and many find their public schools failing their
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Both education initiatives are expected to be expensive
campaigns, and television commercials on both sides of the voucher
campaign have already been on the air for several weeks, in both
English and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Redwood City venture capitalist Tim Draper is the main backer of
the voucher measure, and he has pledged to match all spending by
the ``no'' side. Estimates say total spending on the measure could
reach $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative is opposed by Gov. Gray Davis and virtually every
school group in the state.
</P>
<P>
   A report filed this month with the secretary of state's office
said $3.8 million has been raised so far by the ``yes'' side, with
almost all of that _ $3.6 million _ loaned to the campaign by
Draper.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents have raised $1.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 39 _ which lowers the vote threshold to 55 percent
for school bonds _ is a slightly modified version of Proposition
26, which was narrowly defeated on the March ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Voters seem upset  &LR; annoyed that they are facing the same issue,
again,  &LR; Baldassare said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost half say they are upset about being asked again, and
among those 83 percent said they will vote no,'' he said. ``I think
that adds to the difficulties in passing 39.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldassare also said people may be reacting negatively to the
mention of property taxes in the ballot summary.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an era of so much talk of government surpluses, I think
people don't like the idea of raising taxes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters, including Davis and most school groups, raised $7.7
million through June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of that money came in loans from several Silicon
Valley entrepreneurs, including Reed Hastings, a Davis appointee to
the state Board of Education and chairman of NetFlix.com Inc. In
addition, John Chambers, president of Cisco Systems, gave $250,000
to the campaign. The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, an
anti-tax group, is the main opponent, and it listed $1.7 million in
contributions through June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Other findings in the poll include:
</P>
<P>
   -- U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein continues to hold a commanding
lead over her Republican opponent Tom Campbell. Among likely
voters, 52 percent said they will support Feinstein while 33
percent back Campbell. Feinstein is even leading the Central
Valley, traditionally a strong area of support for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   -- Gov. Gray Davis' approval rating has remained virtually
unchanged in the past year. Forty-one percent rated the Democratic
governor's job performance as good, while 10 percent rated him
excellent, the exact same numbers as in Feb. 2000 and Sept. 1999.
</P>
<P>
   -- The state Legislature's approval rating has also remained
constant, although not as positive as Davis'. While 34 percent
rated the Legislature's performance as good, 43 percent said it was
fair.
</P>
<P>
   -- An overwhelming majority of voters support an effort to allow
independent voters to vote for party candidates in primary
elections. Among all adults, 71 percent support the idea, 22
percent oppose and 7 percent don't know.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 2,003 Californians was taken July 28 to Aug. 4 in
both English and Spanish. It has a sampling error of plus or minus
2 percentage points.

DIVINE RIGHT IN DOWNWARD SPIRAL
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ It's just a crazy hunch, but I'm starting to get
the uneasy feeling that Steve Young isn't going to play for the
49ers this season. Nor is Joe Montana.
<P>
   Maybe God really has revoked San Francisco's divine right to
grid leadership by heroic legendary quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Cheap shot by God.
</P>
<P>
   The reality hit me when I was radio-station-surfing and heard a
promo on KNBR for ``The Jeff Garcia Show.''
</P>
<P>
   The Garcia show should be exciting.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Good morning, Jeff! Bit of a rough game for the Niners &LR; 
 &UR; yesterday. We appreciate you talking to us live from the ICU! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Big question on Garcia: Can he sling the cliches like a true
superstar?
</P>
<P>
   SURPRISE endorsement: The S.F. Latino Democratic Club voted to
endorse community activist Aaron Peskin for Supervisor in District
3, over (among others) Supervisor Alicia Becerril.
</P>
<P>
   It's an anti-machine vote, since Becerril was appointed to the
Board of Supes by Willie Brown and is a close friend of John
Burton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do like to give Latino candidates the benefit of the
doubt,'' says club President Esperanza Macias.
</P>
<P>
   But: The club didn't like Becerril's voting record on Mission
District and Latino issues such as gentrification and displacement
of tenants, nonprofits and social services.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, on endorsement-voting day, Becerril didn't bother to show
up at LDC headquarters to campaign or vote.
</P>
<P>
   Also endorsing Peskin, who is a machine unto himself:
Assemblywoman Carole Migden.
</P>
<P>
   ATTENTION, MEEK: The city of Santa Cruz's Adult Education Center
is offering a course titled ``Positively Loud: An Introduction to
Yelling and Screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   From the course synopsis: ``We will practice various aspects of
yelling and screaming, progressing from ... easy screams to medium
yells to all-out shouts, whoops, hollers and shrieks. Yelling and
screaming is an excellent skill to have for situations like
self-defense, warnings and expressions of fun and joy.''
</P>
<P>
   Also being offered urse list &LR; is ``Better Use of the Arms and
Shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   Wise-guy Larry Mackin says, ``I suggest that the 49ers' coaching
staff takes the class and the team defense takes the latter.''
</P>
<P>
   I plan to go for a black belt in loud whining.
</P>
<P>
   HOMELESS, CUBED: Jim Reid is the slightly off-center would-be
politician who did jail time for defacing an illegal tobacco
billboard, went homeless for a week to check out that scene, and
says he rode Muni for 24 hours, on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Jim's newest plan: Teeny-tiny homes for the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Each 10-by-10 home has a full bathroom, mini-kitchen and
mini-loft, and is as well-appointed and charming (redwood siding,
ceramic tile) as a new home. And the cubes are stackable.
</P>
<P>
   Reid's plan: Assemble a crew of qualified homeless people to
construct the cubes, provide them to the cream of the homeless
(those graduated from rehab programs, etc.) in exchange for an
agreement to adopt a park or a block of the city and keep it clean.
</P>
<P>
   The units also could be sold on a 15-year mortgage for about
$600 a month, less than a homeless person now pays to stay in
hotels so crappy that the cockroaches form grievance committees.
</P>
<P>
   Jim's prototype will be on display Friday (8 a.m. to 5 p.m.) at
City Hall, Polk St. side.
</P>
<P>
   Not sure how Reid will keep his dignity cubes out of the hands
of dot.commer workaholics looking for handy S.F. housing.
</P>
<P>
   STOP AND steal the roses:
</P>
<P>
   Flower thefts are being reported at several S.F. parks. The
flowers are being fenced at the Flower Market.
</P>
<P>
   And my source in Burlingame, Deep Stem, says thieves have been
ripping off agapanthus all over her 'hood for about five years.
</P>
<P>
   What we need is a petunia posse.
</P>
<P>
   CRESCENT MOON over Palo Alto:
</P>
<P>
   Indoor plumbing having been a staple of Palo Alto living for
decades now, it will be a culture shock to pupils at Walter Hays
and Escondido elementary schools when they open the school year
with Porta Pottis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once construction is done, it's going to be great!'' PTA Prez
Melinda Christopher told the P.A. Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, kids, hold on!
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Matters worries that some of these children might become
so emotionally scarred that they wind up going to Cal.

 BUSH CAMPAIGNS IN CALIFORNIA AS POLL SHOWS CLOSER RACE  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXNARD _ Vowing an all-out battle to win the nation's most
populous state, Texas Gov. George W. Bush began a two-day
whistle-stop trip up the Central Coast Wednesday as a new poll
showed him getting some valuable help from Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   The poll by the Public Policy Institute of California gave Vice
President Al Gore 40 percent of the vote and Bush 37 percent. Green
Party candidate Nader picked up 8 percent, almost all of it at
Gore's expense. Pat Buchanan, who is fighting for the Reform Party
nomination this week, received just 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 2,003 Californians was taken as the GOP national
convention gave Republicans the stage in Philadelphia and before
Gore announced his choice of a new running mate, Connecticut Sen.
Joe Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the results appear to shatter the common political wisdom
that California is a lock for the Democrats in the 2000
presidential race. And Bush himself pounded the idea in his
appearances from the bunting-draped back of an Amtrak train as he
made his way from Oxnard to the fields of Guadalupe _ where he
planned a walk with field hands _ to Santa Maria Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come November, mark my words, when the nation watches
California, it will be in the Bush-Cheney column,'' he said to
cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that Democrats think Republicans ``don't intend to
fight for (California), just like the last two campaigns _ (but) we
are not writing off anyplace, particularly this important state.
This state is the biggest, most powerful state in the union.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Baldassare, the Public Policy Institute's poll director,
said Bush's surge, combined with Nader's impact in peeling off
critical independent voters, underscores the pivotal weeks ahead
for Gore and his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't take California for granted anymore,'' Baldassare
said. ``Gore isn't showing as strong among Democrats as he should
be _ California is still a battleground.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's train tour of California carried a new slogan, ``Change
the Tone'' _ clearly a jab at Democrats beginning their convention.
And joining him Thursday will be a campaign partner, Sen. John
McCain, Bush's former bitter rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do we change the tone?'' Bush asked the crowd from the
back of the train. The election, he yelled, is about which party is
about  &LR; ``more likely to appeal to our better angels, not our darker
impulses.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign is well aware that some of Bush's bounce has
come from the intense media focus on the Republican convention last
week. And while Bush's aides say they are encouraged by his poll
numbers here, they acknowledge that polls matter little until after
Labor Day, when the voters begin paying close attention.
</P>
<P>
   On the new Democratic vice presidential candidate, the Bush
campaign has made it a point not to attack Lieberman, as a way of
demonstrating that it is serious about its pledge to restore
civility to the political process. Bush followed the script
Wednesday, praising Lieberman but getting in a subtle jab at
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Lieberman is a man who has been praised by people from
both sides of the aisle,'' Bush told reporters after stepping off
of his campaign plane at the Point Mugu Naval Air Station here.
``That's a good sign. I don't know him personally, but I do
appreciate his strong positions on ethics that he has taken.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a reference to Lieberman Clinton for his behavior with
White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by a reporter whether Lieberman would inoculate Gore
against questions about his ethics, Bush replied: ``Remember who is
going to be the president. The race is between Al Gore and me, and
who's best to set the right tone in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as at the Republican National Convention, the Bush team was
reluctant Wednesday to share the stage with other Republican
candidates. The hundreds who waited more than an hour at Oxnard's
Amtrak station for Bush to arrive were entertained by mariachis and
children's groups. Although they were briefly introduced to
candidates like South Bay Rep. Tom Campbell, who is running a
crucial race against Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the lawmakers were not
given a chance to address the voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's tour had the air of a victory lap Wednesday, the governor
joking that some supporters were already addressing him as ``Mr.
President To Be.''
</P>
<P>
   But Baldassare said Gore's work in the next weeks will make the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's ``inability to maintain momentum`' has less
to do with his partnership with Clinton than with the fact that
voters won't hand this election over on a silver platter, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Gore's eight years at Clinton's side, voters ``are not
yet convinced that the vice president is a leader in his own
right,'' Baldassare said.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also challenged the notion _ suggested by Bush, Cheney
and speaker after speaker at last week's GOP convention _ that
Clinton is a political albatross around the neck of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as he ends his term, two-thirds of all California voters
rate his job performance as good or excellent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was based on a statewide telephone survey of 2,003
California residents _ 1,597 of them registered voters and 988
likely voters _ from July 28 through August 4. The margin of error
is plus or minus 2 percentage points.

L.A. PLAYS HOPEFUL HOST TO DEMOCRATS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By JOHN WILDERMUTH 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Democratic National Convention opens Monday in Los
Angeles, about 15,000 journalists and more than 20,000 delegates
and guests will be in town for what city officials are calling a
celebration of the city's future.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the 15,000 or so demonstrators expected to jam the
streets around the Staples Center during the four-day convention
could turn out to be the ants at the picnic, but Los Angeles Mayor
Richard Riordan is confident that his city will emerge as the
ultimate winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope everything turns out good, but as they say in show
business, `As long as they spell the name right ...' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan and other civic leaders are billing the convention as a
coming-out party for Los Angeles. Battered by floods, earthquakes,
droughts, riots and the O.J. Simpson trial during the early 1990s,
Los Angeles also was hammered by economic hard times that cost it
hundreds of thousands of jobs and sent fleets of moving vans
heading out of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Times were so tough that some people said, not entirely
tongue-in-cheek, that the 1994 Northridge earthquake was a blessing
in disguise since it put so many people to work clearing the
rubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles absolutely could not have hosted this four years
ago,'' said Ben Austin, a spokesman for LA Convention 2000, the
host committee and fund-raising group. ``We weren't ready for the
world to parachute into our back yard.''
</P>
<P>
   But things are different today. The local economy is booming,
and construction cranes are sprouting all over the city. Los
Angeles has a new subway system, a $375 million state-of-the-art
arena and a mayor anxious to show off the things that have happened
during his two terms in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll get a direct impact of about $150 million from the
convention,'' Riordan said. ``But we're also getting 15,000 members
of the media presenting Los Angeles to the world in prime time.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting here hasn't been easy, admitted Noelia Rodriguez, head
of the convention committee. Rodriguez, a former top aide to
Riordan, was given the job last February with orders to kick start
a stalled fund-raising effort that was still $10 million short of
the $35 million it had promised to provide for the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan, a wealthy Republican attorney and businessman first
elected mayor in 1993, donated $1 million of his own money to the
convention effort and then raised another $5 million in cash. But
until billionaire investor Ron Burkle came through last week with a
$1 million check, convention backers were worried about having
enough cash to pay the bills.
</P>
<P>
   There's also been continuing tension between the nonpartisan
host committee, made up of the civic leaders who raise the money,
and the Democratic National Convention Committee, the political
group that spends it.
</P>
<P>
   Although there have been rumored disputes about everything from
the way the Staples Center skyboxes are allocated to big donors to
how the money is being used, convention officials are downplaying
the problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always going to be some conflicts, but that's just
the way it is,'' said Austin of the host committee. ``What's
important is that we're marching in the same direction and share
the same goal: to host a great convention.''
</P>
<P>
   The jokers in the deck, however, are the thousands of
demonstrators. Many of the expected activists were in Seattle last
year, where protests against the World Trade Organization turned
violent and shut down much of the city center.
</P>
<P>
   While there were few problems at the Republican convention in
Philadelphia last week, despite an estimated 4,000 protesters, Los
Angeles officials are expecting a bigger crowd and more potential
for trouble downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts by the police to keep demonstrators away from the
convention center have been overturned by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won a suit challenging the attempt to keep protesters 250
yards from Staples Center,'' said Dan Tokaji, a staff attorney with
the American Civil Liberties Union in Los Angeles. ``They would
have needed a 60-foot-high Jumbotron screen to be seen by the
delegates.''
</P>
<P>
   ACLU attorneys also objected when police tried to seal off 186
acres around the center and force people living in nearby
neighborhoods to show passes before being allowed to drive in the
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all contrary to basic American values,'' Tokaji said.
``This isn't South Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   A compromise will provide protesters with an assembly area
across the street from Staples Center and also allow them to use
Pershing Square in the city center as a gathering point.
</P>
<P>
   There are still plenty of worries about the planned protests,
however.
</P>
<P>
   A number of downtown businesses will be closing their doors
during the convention, citing traffic problems and concerns that
the protests could turn violent.
</P>
<P>
   Others are concerned about how the scandal-ridden Los Angeles
Police Department, burdened by a yearlong corruption investigation,
will respond to the demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried about the police overreacting,'' said Los Angeles
City Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg. ``I watched a demonstration the
other day, and it took 200 officers to arrest 35 people who just
sat in the street and offered no resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police see the convention as a chance to collect a million
zillion dollars in overtime and use all their new weapons, like
pepper fog dispensers and the like. It's absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Rita Walters, whose district includes the downtown
area and the convention center, is confident that any problems can
be kept to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympics (in 1984) were two weeks long, but they went
wonderfully well,'' she said. ``This is only four days and
hopefully people can keep cool for four days.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the goal for the Democrats, who would like a convention
like the last one in Los Angeles, which nominated John F. Kennedy
in 1960. The fewer problems outside the convention hall, the better
the politicians will like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to throw a nice party and get people talking about Los
Angeles,'' Austin said. ``The Democrats' goal is to see that (Vice
President) Al Gore comes out of the convention with a nice bump.
Ours is to see that Los Angeles comes out with a nice bump, too.''

ERRANT E-MAILS VIOLATE PRIVACY OF KAISER MEMBERS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By JANET WELLS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kaiser Permanente violated patient confidentiality for hundreds
of members last week when e-mails containing sensitive medical
information, names, and home phone numbers were mistakenly sent to
the wrong people, Kaiser officials disclosed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a glitch that raises privacy concerns, a programming error
occurred August 2 at a Maryland Web site server facility Kaiser
uses for its online service. Kaiser On-Line lets members ask for
medical and pharmaceutical advice and schedule appointments.
</P>
<P>
   The error affected 858 members before Kaiser's online support
crew caught the mistake and shut down the program. Had the tech
workers not spotted the problem, it could have impacted more than
8,000 members who were receiving e-mail responses at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser officials spent the past week calling all of the 858
members and apologizing, said Kaiser spokeswoman Beverly Hayon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are upset,'' Hayon said of members' responses. ``The vast
majority have been gracious.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 of the misdirected e-mails were intended for
Kaiser members in California, said Hayon, who characterized the
error as an isolated incident that has been rectified.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're talking about is nothing that breached security of
Kaiser On-Line. No hacker, no virus,'' Hayon said.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy experts, however, say the incident raises questions
about the safety of online medical services _ especially with the
health care industry pushing digital medical care as ``the new
frontier'' to cut costs and improve access, said Earl Lui, senior
attorney with the Consumer Advocacy Organization in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an example of what could go wrong when you rely on
technology rather than people seeing people. This would not have
happened if these people had come in and seen a nurse or called a
nurse,'' he said. ``When you lose that human element, errors like
this can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The error happened while Kaiser _ the nation's second-largest
health insurance plan _ was doing a routine upgrade of the capacity
of the online system, which is attracting 20,000 new members a
month, said Anna-Lisa Silvestre, director of Kaiser Permanente
Online.
</P>
<P>
   About 250,000 of Kaiser's 8 million members nationwide have
signed up for the interactive site, which allows free access to
health care news and chat rooms, as well as medical and
pharmaceutical advice and appointment clerks. The site conducts
about 8,400 transactions a month, mostly in scheduling
appointments.
</P>
<P>
   A notice on the Web site assures privacy, saying, ``We are
dedicated to keeping your personal health information confidential.
We take many precautions to make sure others can't pretend to be
you and get your confidential information from this Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   However, during the system upgrade, a technical problem occurred
that interrupted delivery of about 8,000 e-mails, Silvestre
explained. Since Kaiser Permanente On-Line has promised to respond
to e-mail queries within 24 hours, programmers quickly wrote a
program to resend the e-mails. On August 2, about 20 minutes after
the send program was initiated, a technician noticed that there was
some kind of error, and stopped the transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser didn't know about the import of the error until the next
day when a member told them that she had received a response to her
question _ along with messages intended for several hundred other
Kaiser members. The member was one of 19 people who received
between 20 and 400 messages not intended for them.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser said most of the e-mails were about routine matters.
However, at least one of the e-mails was a response to a member's
question about a sexually transmitted disease, the Washington Post
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser On-Line is conducting a ``root cause analysis'' to
determine the source of the problem, which will help determine
procedures to prevent a similar mistake from occurring, Silvestre
said.

   Because of lower costs, increased accuracy and convenient access
to health care, online medical services are ``the future of health
care,'' said Sam Karp, chief information officer for the California
Health Care Foundation, which funds health care research and did a
landmark study on Internet privacy.
</P>
<P>
   While Kaiser's mistake ``raised an alarm'' concerning security
and safeguards in online health services, Karp praised the HMO as a
pioneer in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing the early pains of a new health care system
emerging,'' Karp said. ``I certainly hope the (Kaiser) incident
won't discourage providers from offering (online services) or
consumers from using it.''
</P>
<P>
   Problems with privacy in the health care arena existed ``before
we had all these new technologies,'' said Daniel Zingale, director
of the state's new Department of Managed Care, who also has high
hopes for online health services benefiting the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Privacy is one area of legitimate concern, but it can be
addressed,'' he said. ``It's like the automobile industry. You
don't want to stop building cars because of break-ins, you want to
build them with locks.''

COWBOYS' KEVIN SMITH CONTEMPLATES RETIREMENT

<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Cowboys cornerback Kevin Smith,
frustrated by recurrent back problems, is on the verge of calling
it a career.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys announced yesterday that Smith, 30, has cleaned out
his dorm room at training camp and returned to Dallas to ponder
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   His agent, Steve Zucker, and several teammates said Smith has
been mulling his future for more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   A source said that the Cowboys have been trying to persuade the
eight-year veteran to retire and were considering cutting him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going on and making our personnel decisions as though he
won't be on the team this year,'' Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie fourth-round draft pick Kareem Larrimore will get the
first shot at replacing Smith in the starting lineup if he retires,
Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who reiterated that Smith is contemplating his decision,
said Smith would be asked to join the Cowboys' coaching staff if he
retires.
</P>
<P>
   Zucker said Smith, who has been limited by his back injury
during training camp, will see a doctor in Dallas tomorrow and
probably make a decision this week or early next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``His back is really bothering him,'' Zucker said. ``We've been
discussing this all day. He really wants to play. He's
frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   A source said announcing the retirement is a mere formality,
considering Smith's health. Smith's problems stem from a
degenerative disk in his lower back that sidelined him last season
for five weeks of training camp and the first three games.
</P>
<P>
   Smith underwent several rounds of epidural injections to get
back on the field last season, but was always aware that his
problems weren't going away.
</P>
<P>
   Zucker said Smith had a good off-season and was feeling great
about his prospects for the upcoming season, but that was before he
aggravated the back injury early in camp.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Darren Woodson and defensive tackle Leon Lett, two of
Smith's closest friends on the team, said the former Texas A&AMP;M
standout told them he was thinking of retiring during last week's
trip to Tokyo for the American Bowl against the Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough,'' Woodson said. ``The back injuries have limited
what he can do on the field. It is something he has been thinking
about for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   If Smith does retire, the Cowboys will save his $750,000 base
salary against this year's salary cap. However, his prorated
signing bonus of $1.48 million will still count against the cap.
</P>
<P>
   That charge is minimal compared with the roughly $3.2 million in
prorated signing bonus money that Smith will count against next
year's cap. The Cowboys, however, don't have to pay base salaries
of $2.3 million, $2.7 million and $2.8 million the next three years
on Smith's deal, which runs through 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Erik Williams holdout/retirement situation, in which
the Cowboys are going to force Williams to give back already-paid
signing bonus money if he retires, Jones said they will not ask
Smith to pay back bonus money.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a first-round pick in 1992, started on the Cowboys' Super
Bowl teams in 1992 and 1993 and was on the brink of becoming one of
the league's top cornerbacks when he suffered a torn right
Achilles' tendon in the first game of the 1995 season.
</P>
<P>
   Smith returned to the field in 1996, but has not been the same
player. He was repeatedly picked on by quarterbacks who shied away
from Deion Sanders on the opposite side. Injuries, low confidence
and a penchant for interference penalties robbed Smith of his
starting job at the end of the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   He fought back and reclaimed his starting job last season before
dealing with more injuries late in the year.
</P>
<P>
   While Jones respected the way Smith battled through his
struggles, he coveted Smith's character as a leader in the locker
room and as a team player even more.
</P>
<P>
   Smith restructured his contract in each of the past five years
to help the Cowboys clear salary cap room. Smith's 2000 base salary
was reduced to $750,000 from $1.9 million. ``Everything we've asked
Kevin to do, he has done,'' Jones said. ``He has been an integral
part of our success.''
</P>
<P>
   A source said that is why Jones is hesitant about forcing Smith
out the door and why he's very eager to provide Smith an assistant
coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   If Smith quits, the Cowboys will have only nine players
remaining from the 1995 season's Super Bowl team and only seven who
have three rings in the 1990s. If Williams quits, the numbers drop
to eight and six, respectively. nn

AT A MISSION FOR THE NEEDY, CHENEY PREACHES `COMPASSIONATE
CONSERVATISM' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs lede graf for rewording)  By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ In his first solo campaign swing as the Republican
vice presidential candidate, Dick Cheney took his ticket's message
of ``compassionate conservatism'' to an inner-city homeless shelter
here Wednesday and promised that a Bush administration would expand
federal support for religious-based social service groups.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney also muffled his attacks on Vice President Al Gore by
praising his choice for running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman,
D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good man, well qualified for the post,'' Cheney told
reporters. ``Everything I know about the guy is positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's Jewish faith should have no effect on the race,
Cheney said. ``I don't think it's an issue,'' he said. ``I think
the country is far beyond any kind of religious-based bigotry.''
</P>
<P>
   Still buoyant from a three-day rail trip with Gov. George W.
Bush across key battleground states last weekend, Cheney and his
wife, Lynne, picked Sunshine Ministries, a century-old soup kitchen
that now also counsels drug and alcohol abusers and provides
after-school classes for poor children, as their first stump stop
away from Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said that he would emphasize Bush's campaign themes _
education, Social Security, tax reform and rebuilding the military
_ in a three-day trip through swing states including Ohio and
Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the mission's brick building here, surrounded by
rubble-strewn empty lots 10 minutes from St. Louis' glistening
signature archway, the Cheneys met with several of the youngsters
who attend after-school programs that teach fellowship and
practical skills. Lynne Cheney plunged right in, eagerly greeting
each teen-ager by name, but Dick Cheney seemed less comfortable in
the glare of jostling television crews. When Felicia Hollis, 14,
stumbled a bit explaining her goal to be a prosecutor one day, the
vice presidential nominee said, ``The cameras make me nervous,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Clarkson, the ministries' associate director, said the
mission that runs a 45-person shelter, offers food, clothing and
job training to 300 families in four nearby federal housing
projects, and provides classes to 200 children after school.
</P>
<P>
   The church-based center derives its entire $2 million annual
budget from private contributions, Clarkson said, and symbolizes
the kind of non-governmental, community-rooted approach to social
services and education that is a hallmark of the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great things about organizations like Sunshine
Ministries is it demonstrates that government doesn't have a
monopoly on the wisdom of how to deal with society's problems,''
Cheney told local community and religious leaders invited to the
afternoon event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, only three federal social service programs allow
religious organizations to apply for funding on the same basis as
other providers,'' Cheney said. ``Governor Bush and I believe
faith-based groups, whether Mormon or Methodist or Muslim, ought to
be eligible for public money to advance their good work.''
</P>
<P>
   If elected, Cheney said, the Bush administration would expand
the federal charitable deductions for 80 million taxpayers who do
not itemize their deductions, swelling the resources available to
groups like Sunshine Ministries.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush administration would also broaden federal support for
after-school programs, said Cheney. ``After-school programs are
vital in terms of reducing drug use, teen pregnancy and criminal
behavior by providing young people things to do and places to be,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked later how these pledges contrasted with a 10-year
voting record in the House that including opposing the Head Start
education program, Cheney sidestepped the question, retorting that
it ``probably squares as well as Joe Lieberman's voting record with
Al Gore's.''
</P>
<P>
   That response offered a glimpse into what is likely to be a
Republican refrain from now until the election: ``I think it's
going to be tough for Al Gore to be as aggressively negative on
some of Governor Bush's ideas which his own running mate supports,
like school vouchers and ballistic missile defense,'' Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
   But Cheney said the contrasts between the running mates will
stand out, including his tenure as White House chief of staff under
President Ford and secretary of defense under President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're clearly products of our experiences,'' Cheney told
reporters. ``I've got a lot of experience in the White House and
Defense Department. Joe's background has a stronger legal
dimension, as an attorney and attorney general.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But when the chips are down,'' Cheney continued, ``I hope the
American people will believe my experience and what I've got to
offer adds more to the Bush ticket than Joe adds to the Gore
ticket.''

DREIFORT IS LOOKING GOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two months ago, Chan Ho Park was in the midst of a
five-game winning streak and appeared ready to become the Dodgers'
much-needed No.2 starter behind Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Park (11-8, 4.04 ERA) has struggled since, but now Darren
Dreifort has five straight victories after defeating the Chicago
Cubs 7-5 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort (9-7, 4.51) also hit two homers, but the Dodgers were
more pleased with the way he has curbed his walks and developed
into the pitcher they always hoped he would be. Since July 17, he
has allowed 10 earned runs in 332/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Park, who won five straight from May 29-June 28, had a
respectable ERA in July (3.82). Even during the winning streak Park
was wild, walking six twice and five once. In July, he walked 12 in
back-to-back starts, including seven July 15 against the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to need them all if we're going to get this thing
done,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said of his rotation. ``I see
some similarities between (Dreifort) and Chan Ho. They are so
competitive, they sometimes try too hard. But when they're on, they
don't seem to let the little stuff bother them.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Claude Osteen said Dreifort's success can be
traced to staying out of big innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a very fluid rhythm right now,'' Osteen said. ``In the
past he would try to muscle up in tough spots. He is learning that
you don't have to blow it by hitters all the time. That is a
valuable lesson for a pitcher and it has taken him a while. Relax
and let you defense work for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Osteen said Park does not seem as relaxed as he was in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to face adversity better,'' Osteen said. ``He'd be
doing fine and one pitch or one at-bat might make him lose his
concentration. Like I said, I don't think he has pitched badly. But
now it's crunch time.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort, a pending free agent, usually struggles during the
second half and has been shelved the past two years in September
due to arm problems. Park was 8-4 last year after the All-Star
break and finished 13-11. In 1998, he went 10-4 in his last 17
starts and was NL Pitcher of the Month for July.
</P>
<P>
   WHITE IN, GOODWIN OUT: With right-hander Jon Lieber pitching for
the Cubs, the Dodgers normally would have gone with left-handed
hitting Tom Goodwin instead of switch hitting Devon White. But
White got the start after going 4 for 8 lifetime against Lieber
with two homers.
</P>
<P>
   QUICK HITS: Catcher Todd Hundley became just the ninth player in
Dodger Stadium history to reach the second deck with a home run
when he hit a 449-foot blast in the second inning. Red catcher
Eddie Taubensee did it earlier this season (April 15). The last
Dodger was Raul Mondesi (April 12, 1996). ... Johnson said reliever
Mike Fetters won't pitch for a few days after breaking a fingernail
on his right hand during Tuesday's victory. ...
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort was struck just above his glove in the seventh inning
Tuesday by a Gary Matthews Jr. liner. He is not expected to miss
his next start, Sunday against Atlanta. ...
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' annual family game used to be a fan favorite if
only to count how many of Manny Mota's children would play (he has
six sons, four daughters). Wednesday, the game was played at 3:30
p.m., well before the crowd arrived because of another tradition,
Sammy Sosa taking batting practice. ...
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are off today before starting a three-game series
Friday in Atlanta. In the first game, Park faces Kevin Millwood
(7-8, 5.05 ERA). Saturday, Ismael Valdes (2-5, 6.10) faces Greg
Maddux (12-6, 3.21). Sunday, Dreifort faces Andy Ashby (8-8,
5.02). &QL;

   SOMALIA-BUSINESS (Mogadishu, Somalia) _ There are 5 competing

imported goods; and an infinite number of guys with donkeys who
will deliver 55 gallons of clean water to your house for 25 cents.
What Somalia does not have is a government, and in many ways, this
makes it the world's purest laboratory for capitalism. No one
collects taxes. Business is booming. So it may come as a surprise
that business people in Mogadishu, the wrecked and lawless capital,
are begging for a government. They would love to be taxed, and
would gladly let politicians meddle at least a bit in their
affairs. By Ian Fisher.

   CIR-HIGHSCHOOL-GADGETS (Undated) _ Rohnert Park, Calif., 60
miles north of San Francisco, is mostly white and middle class, but
it is no Lake Wobegon. At the local high school, most of the
students are academically average. SAT scores hover around 1025,
and the dropout rate is 1.7 percent. Some of the sports teams
shine, while others struggle. The homecoming dance in the fall and
the prom in the spring are the year's two social high points. And
like their counterparts around the country, the 2,000 students at
the school, Rancho Cotate, are no strangers to electronic devices.
That makes it as good a place as any to see what kind of gadgets
the thoroughly modern high school student is using these days. When
the Ranch, as the school is called, reopens this fall, students
will arrive with electronic paraphernalia aplenty, their backpacks
heavy with cell phones, pagers, CD players and custom-burned CDs,

   CIR-WEB-RESEARCH (Undated) _ For students who grew up with the
Web, the idea of roaming library stacks to do research is as quaint

are organized and easily navigated, students prefer diving into the
chaotic whirl of the Web to find information. One problem with this
strategy is that many students are not well versed in advanced
searching techniques so a simple search for, say, information about
the planet Saturn can yield tens of thousands of hits. Yet students
persevere with this hit-or-miss approach, saying that they are
simply more comfortable sifting through hyperlinks than they are
flipping through a card catalog. And they admit that using the Web
requires less exertion. But while the keyword approach to searching
makes perfect sense to teenagers, it troubles many educators, who
fear that point-and-click research can lead to lazy study habits
and ineffective searches. By Lori Leibovich.

CARVIN HAS VICTORY FINISHING BEHIND RECORD-SETTING TEEN-AGER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ After the trials and tribulations of the past six
years, getting passed by a teen-ager named Klete Keller seemed the
least of Chad Carvin's worries last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I looked up and saw I got second, after all I've gone
through,'' Carvin said, ``it just filled me with so much emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   On a night when records fell and tears flowed, Carvin's saga
proved to be one with a happy ending as the U.S. Olympic Swimming
Trials began at the IU Natatorium.
</P>
<P>
   By finishing second in the men's 400-meter freestyle, the Laguna
Hills, Calif., native made the Olympic team. It didn't seem to faze
him in the least that, after leading for nearly 390 meters of the
400-meter race, he had been out-touched at the finish by Keller,
who was swimming in his first Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This meet is about making the team,'' Carvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the Olympians swam under Matt Cetlinski's American
record _ 3 minutes, 48.06 seconds _ that had stood for 12 years.
Keller's winning time was 3:47.18, while a tiring Carvin touched in
3:47.50.
</P>
<P>
   Their prize for victory is daunting. The 400 freestyle is one of
the specialties of Australian phenom Ian Thorpe. The Thorpedo's
world record is nearly six seconds faster than Keller swam last
night, which suggests that Keller and Carvin still have about 10
meters to make up. The top-ranked American, Tom Dolan, chose not to
compete in the freestyle event and, instead, concentrate on the
Thorpe-less 400 individual medley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone is untouchable,'' Keller said with a
teen-ager's aplomb. ``I think you'll be surprised \Rin Sydney\S.''
</P>
<P>
   In the opening night's only other final, an emotional Kaitlin
Sandeno, three months removed from her high school prom, captured
the women's 400-meter individual medley in 4:40.91. Maddy Crippen
of Philadelphia took the second spot in a field that included 1996
Olympic gold medalists Cristina Teuscher and Kristine
Quance-Julian.
</P>
<P>
   To make the team in the men's 400, Carvin twice yesterday swam
the fastest of his life. It was a far cry from his previous Olympic
swim trials.
</P>
<P>
   After making the U.S. team for the world championships in 1994,
he swam poorly. It turned out that after returning from Rome,
Carvin had to have his appendix removed.
</P>
<P>
   As the Atlanta Games neared, Carvin was back in form and
expected to make the Olympic team in at least two events. But
doctors diagnosed a heart problem, and though Carvin received
get-well wishes from, among others, President Clinton and Tom
Hanks, he was forced to sit out for much of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the '96 trials, I was at home, my parents' house, and at
first I didn't even turn it on \Rand watch on TV\S,'' Carvin
recalled. ``When I finally did, I broke into tears. I couldn't even
get through one race.''
</P>
<P>
   The heart problem _ a virus _ was treated with bed rest and
medication.
</P>
<P>
   Now, all he and Keller have to do in Sydney is stop a Thorpedo.
</P>
<P>
   Sandeno, meanwhile, will be trying to win an Olympic event that
a U.S. swimmer hasn't captured since Janet Evans took the gold in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   But first things first. Sandeno is 17 and just finished her
junior year at El Toro (Calif.) High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``This probably means I'm going to miss a month of school,''
Sandeno said. ``But I think I have a good excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   The emotion of what she had done _ going from school yearbook
staff to the Olympics _ still shook Sandeno nearly an hour after
she had left the water. In a room filled with reporters, tears
rolled down her cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to think this, but it's another to experience
it,'' she said. ``I am very shocked and surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandeno, however, was far from a long shot in the 400 IM. She
has won the event at the past three U.S. nationals and earned two
gold medals at the '99 Pan Am Games. Her 4:44.18 clocking in
yesterday's prelims had been her the fastest qualifier.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a little pressure,'' she said. ``I like to be the
hunter, not the hunted. But once I got out there, I just told
myself that I've worked hard and I deserve to be in that lane.''
</P>
<P>
   Teuscher, who swam on the gold-winning 800 relay at the Atlanta
Games, finished third. Fellow '96 Olympian Quance-Julian, trying to
come back after having a baby, had the fifth-fastest prelim time
but finished eighth in the final.

KAREEM LARRIMORE ON DECK FOR COWBOYS IF SMITH RETIRES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Kevin Smith's possible retirement
heightens the Cowboys' problems at cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of having two veteran starters, Smith and Ryan McNeil,
to help overcome the free-agent loss of Deion Sanders, the Cowboys
could have a rookie starter in their secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who has returned to Dallas to ponder his future, is
expected to make a decision later this week or early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-round pick Kareem Larrimore, who has moved ahead of
fellow rookie draft picks Dwayne Goodrich (second round) and Mario
Edwards (sixth round) will get the first shot at replacing Smith if
he retires. Edwards has also been impressive and will compete with
Larrimore.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dave Campo, who said the Cowboys will adjust their defense
to help whoever starts, said the Cowboys will be fine at
cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like this is a good group of athletes,'' Campo said.
``At this point, I feel comfortable with them. I've been doing this
for 30 years. When I look at those corners I see some potentially
good football players.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are also hoping to have the option of using veteran
backup Charlie Williams, who has yet to participate in training
camp after undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery in July. His rehab
was set back a couple of weeks by a staph infection.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, however, is still at least a couple of weeks away from
returning.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have also inquired about former Giants cornerback
Phillipi Sparks. Sparks' agent, Hank Bauer, said the Cowboys' offer
of a $440,000 contract was too low.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have two open roster spots. But chief scout Larry
Lacewell said that they are not likely, at present, to find a
quality cornerback not in an NFL camp.
</P>
<P>
   He also said it will be tough to find one when teams trim their
rosters because ``nobody is going to let go a good cornerback.'' He
said few teams have two, let alone, three good ones.
</P>
<P>
   Larrimore, who has been playing on the first-string nickel
defense, was always considered to have the most potential of the
Cowboys' three drafted cornerbacks. He was drafted behind Goodrich
because he went to a small school (West Texas A&AMP;M) and flunked a
drug test at the scouting combine.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-11, 190-pounder brings an exciting combination of
size and speed to the position. Larrimore runs the 40-yard dash in
4.34 seconds and is a very aggressive tackler.
</P>
<P>
   Larrimore said Smith has played a big part in his development
and showed little excitement about his new-found opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like losing a big brother,'' Larrimore said. ``I can't
say I'm excited right now. I'm a little disappointed. He was a
mentor.''
</P>
<P>
   But Larrimore added that ``if it's time for me to step up to the
plate then that's what I'm going to have to do. If they throw me in
the fire, I'm ready to take that responsibility.''

INDIANS' BULLPEN CLAMPS DOWN, SEALS 6-4 VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Gabe Kapler's hitting streak is still alive, thanks
to a bad-hop single in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for the Rangers was that Kapler's single, even if it
did drive in a run, was their only hit over five innings against
the Cleveland Indians' bullpen. The Rangers needed more than that,
because the Indians jumped on Rangers starter Matt Perisho for five
runs in four innings and held on to a 6-4 victory at Jacobs Field
last night.
</P>
<P>
   The loss left the Rangers 2-5 on the road trip. They've also
lost eight of their past 11 and are 10-16 since the All-Star break,
with no relief in sight. They have a day off today, their last one
for a month, before opening a six-game homestand against the Boston
Red Sox and the New York Yankees. They follow that with an
eight-game road trip against the same two teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't think about that,'' first baseman Rafael Palmeiro
said. ``You can't worry about who you're playing or what their
record is. The next seven weeks we're going to play hard and have
some fun. Whatever happens, happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Having fun might help morale but may not do much for the
won-loss record against some stiff competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about that,'' manager Johnny Oates said. ``You've
got to play them all. We'll show up every night, give it our best
effort and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Last night's game was delayed 43 minutes by rain, and the storm
came at an inopportune time for both Kapler and Perisho. Kapler was
batting against Cleveland starter Dave Burba with bases loaded and
two outs in the third when, with the count 2-2, time was called.
</P>
<P>
   When he got back to the plate, Burba threw one pitch and struck
him out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like starting the whole AB over again,'' Kapler said.
``It's like the advantage completely goes to the pitcher. He can go
with the same pitch, but I've got all that time to think about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perisho had trouble coming back from the rain delay, too. He had
survived a three-walk bases-loaded jam in the first by striking out
Jim Thome and retired the side in order in the second. But when he
came back after the delay, the Indians scored two off him in the
third and three more off him in the fourth, to take a 5-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first inning I struggled with my control, but I made a
quick adjustment,'' Perisho said. ``I was able to settle down and
find some rhythm. When I came back after the rain delay, I never
felt loose. I made some quality pitches, and they hit them.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss left Perisho 2-4 with a 6.13 earned-run average. Since
winning his first start June 17, he is 0-4 with a 7.00 ERA in his
past nine starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's killing me,'' Perisho said. ``I've pitched some decent
games and I've had some games like this where I was bled to death.
I keep waiting because I know it's there. When it's there, I know
it will come fast. I ask the older guys how do you get over this,
and they just say keep working and learn from your mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates said: ``He's inconsistent right now. You've got to have
patience. The guy hasn't pitched much at the big-league level.
You've got to give him a chance to pitch and hope he can get his
command down. It did with \RRick\S Helling, and it's getting there
with \RRyan\S Glynn. There's no reason it can't with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Perisho left trailing 5-0. The Rangers knocked out Burba with
three in the fifth but couldn't do much against the Indians'
bullpen. In the Rangers' final 18 plate appearances, they had one
hit, two walks and six strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler, batting with two on and two out in the seventh, kept the
hitting streak alive with a smartly hit bouncer that took a wicked
hop and sailed over second baseman Roberto Alomar's head.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a hitting streak, a little luck is going to be
involved,'' Kapler said. ``That was pure luck.''

TEXAS MOTORPLEX LOSES ONE NHRA RACE DATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEN HAYWARD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What has been speculated for the past three months became
official yesterday when the National Hot Rod Association announced
a 24-event schedule for 2001 that includes only one event at the
Texas Motorplex in Ennis.
</P>
<P>
   The Motorplex, the venue that some consider set the standard for
drag-racing facilities when it was built in 1986, will hold its
traditional October race, but its spring event was taken off the
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1997, the Motorplex has had two NHRA national
events. The first event of 2000 was held over the Memorial Day
weekend, and the second, the 15th annual O'Reilly Auto Parts
Nationals, is set for Oct. 19-22.
</P>
<P>
   The only event at the all-concrete quarter-mile drag strip next
year is set for Oct. 18-21, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Houston Raceway Park in Baytown also lost a racing date and will
host its event next year March 22-25.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors began circulating earlier this year that the Motorplex
and Houston Raceway Park would lose events. The spring event in
Ennis had experienced gradual growth in attendance each year and
had sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   Track owner Billy Meyer said at the Castrol Nationals in May
that he would sell the facility if there were not two dates.
Motorplex general manager Elon Werner was not available for comment
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've done this for a long time, you learn it takes a
while for \Ran event\S to build and it may take awhile for a race
to catch on,'' said Bruce Allen, who drives a Pro Stock for
Arlington's Reher-Morrison Racing. ``The first couple of years they
had \Rthe spring event\S it was real close to the Winston Cup
races. You look at it both ways; it's not good to have a race and
not have it very well attended. The first race was not very well
attended, and the second race has always been a grand slam.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the three open slots were filled with new events. Second
events were added at The Strip at Las Vegas Motor Speedway and
Route 66 Raceway in Joliet, Ill., outside of Chicago. The Bristol
(Tenn.) Dragway, which has hosted The Winston Showdown the past two
years, will have a points-paying national event in 2001. The
facilities in Las Vegas and Bristol are owned by Bruton Smith's
Speedway Motorsports Inc.
</P>
<P>
   An event scheduled for July 5-8 was slated as ``TBA,'' which
some are speculating could be an all-star event.
</P>
<P>
   The series' 23 events will be contested in 17 states next
season. All but one facility, the Virginia Motorsports Park in
Dinwiddie, Va., that had events this year will have at least one
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule was announced more than a month after the NHRA and
ESPN announced a landmark television contract for the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came up with a schedule that maintains 24 nationally
televised events, and increasing the schedule right now is not the
right time,'' NHRA president Tom Compton said. ``We made the
decision to go back to one race in Dallas and one race in
Houston.''

HINGIS AVOIDS ANOTHER UPSET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ Martina Hingis narrowly avoided having
to explain a second consecutive loss to an inferior opponent with a
comeback victory over Chanda Rubin on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, the top-ranked player in the tournament and the world,
pulled enough of her game together in time to beat the 19th-ranked
Rubin, 5-7, 7-5, 6-1 in the second round of the estyle.com Classic
at Manhattan Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous,'' said Hingis, who was upset by qualifier Amy
Frazier in the quarterfinals of last week's Acura Classic.
``Sometimes you go out there, and when you know you're game is not
at the top, you're nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis' problems weren't all in her head. She tried to match
baseline power with the stronger Rubin, perhaps confident in her
six-match win streak over Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin broke Hingis to take a 6-5 lead in the first set, and held
off two break points to win the set. Rubin was one point away from
sending the second set to a tiebreaker but sent a passing shot long
and never quite recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis broke Rubin's serve to go up 3-1, and also seemed to
break her spirit, as the result was in little doubt for most of the
final set.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the third set, I felt strong,'' said Hingis, who advanced
to face either Frazier or Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario in Friday's
quarterfinal. ``Every game I played, I felt stronger. I haven't
played much on hard courts, so every match helps.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Hingis, Serena Williams enjoyed a pedestrian
victory a few hours earlier, when the fifth seed and defending
champion dominated qualifier Tamarine Tanasugarn, 6-2, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   The match, which lasted 1 hour, 3 minutes, seemed like a
marathon compared to Williams' 38-minute first-round demolition of
Ruxandra Dragomir; and Williams, always the perfectionist, found
plenty of fault in her effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a scale of 10, that was probably a three,'' said Williams,
who advanced to face fourth-seeded Conchita Martinez, a 6-4, 7-6
(7-2) winner over Alexandra Stevenson. ``I just don't think I
played very well.''
</P>
<P>
   That won't give much of a confidence boost to Tanasugarn, who
had won matches on four consecutive days to reach the second round
but, as with most of Williams' opponents, couldn't keep pace with
Williams' powerful serves and groundstrokes.
</P>
<P>
   Williams went up two breaks early in the first set and admitted
to being slightly bored on the court but said the victory wasn't as
easy as it appeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``She hits the ball kind of flat, and it has a weird spin on it
and stays low to the ground,'' Williams said. ``Today just wasn't
that great for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The first two matches of the day held significantly more drama.
Martinez came back from a three-game deficit in the first set and
trailed 5-2 in the second, but took advantage of Stevenson's
inconsistent baseline play and won the final four points of the
tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ball wasn't aggressive enough early in the match, and
(Stevenson) hits the ball hard,'' Martinez said. ``I tried to get
her deep (in the court) but I hit some balls too short.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very pumped up at the end of the second set. I felt I
was playing well, and I was ready to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Eighth-seeded Sandrine Testud beat Dominique Van Roost and
advanced to face either No.2 Lindsay Davenport or fellow
Frenchwoman Anne-Gaelle Sidot in the quarterfinals. Testud earned a
6-2, 3-6, 7-5 victory and won the match when the chair umpire
overruled the final two points of the match. &QL;

CARVIN, SANDENO ADVANCE ON EMOTIONAL FIRST DAY OF TRIALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Kaitlin Sandeno bawled after the 400-meter
individual medley final. Chad Carvin willed back the tears after
his preliminary swim in the 400-meter freestyle. It's no secret the
U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials ought to be sponsored by Kleenex for
all the emotion the meet dredges up every four years.
</P>
<P>
   But Sandeno? Carvin? The two Southern Californians were among
the charmed ones on the opening day of the eight-day tearfest; they
earned berths on the U.S. team that will compete next month at the
Sydney Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   Carvin finished second to Phoenix Swim Club's Klete Keller in
the 400 freestyle to realize a dream deferred four years by a
serious illness. Both Keller and Carvin surpassed the 12-year-old
American record of 3 minutes, 48.06 seconds, with Keller using a
furious finishing kick to clock 3:47.18 to Carvin's 3:47.50. Kevin
Clements of Industry Hills was sixth with a personal best of
3:52.81.
</P>
<P>
   Summing up his remarkable comeback, Carvin said, ``I just
couldn't give up on my dreams. What it really came down to is I
didn't want to have any regrets.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandeno, 17, from Lake Forest, recorded the third-fastest time
in the world this year in the 400 IM after leading all qualifiers
in the morning heats. She was out in front from the start in the
final on her way to a personal best of 4:40.91.
</P>
<P>
   Granada Hills High product Kristine Quance-Julian, who is trying
to make her second Olympic team less than two years after giving
birth to her first child, qualified fifth in the 400 IM in the
morning but faded to eighth in the final (she finished two spots
behind her Trojan Swim Club teammate Michala Kwasny).
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really not a whole lot to say,'' Quance-Julian said,
fighting back tears. ``I'm still trying to digest it. And I'm
having a hard time.''
</P>
<P>
   The hardest leg of the four-stroke race for Sandeno? That would
have had to have been her figurative victory lap. She sniffled her
way through the award ceremony and postrace news conference. The
rising senior at El Toro High became especially emotional when she
saw her name being painstakingly scripted onto the natatorium wall
on which appear the complete rosters of every Olympic team selected
within its cozy confines.
</P>
<P>
   It was a wailing wall on this day.
</P>
<P>
   Sandeno was the first name on the fourth swimming team to be
displayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to think about (making the Olympic team) and
another thing to make it,'' Sandeno said. ``It's all kind of a blur
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Carvin, 26, knows only too clearly how disconnected the dream of
making an Olympic team can be. He was ranked second in the world in
the 200 and 400 freestyles in 1995 and seemed a virtual lock to
earn a spot on the Atlanta Summer Games squad.
</P>
<P>
   But toward the end of 1995, his performance in the pool dropped
off dramatically and he fell into a depression so deep that he
tried to overdose on sleeping pills. During his subsequent
hospitalization, doctors pinpointed the cause of his fatigue: A
virus had attacked his heart.
</P>
<P>
   His doctors advised him that he might require a transplant. To
Carvin's immense relief, he needed only months of complete bed
rest. That was hard enough for someone who thought nothing of
swimming 20,000 meters and biking 20 miles and surfing in a single
day.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic Trials were held in March in 1996, and Carvin was
too weak at that point to participate in them. By the end of 1996,
he had returned to competition and finished that year ranked 27th
in the world in the 200-meter butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   He has continued to feel more like his old self every
competitive season since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know that I am (all the way back),'' Carvin said.
``What makes me better now is I have overcome everything. All the
things I face up to now are kind of insignificant.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a good thing, too, because Keller and Carvin face a
daunting challenge in Sydney. His name is Ian Thorpe and at the
Australian Olympic Trials in May he lowered his own world record in
the 400 freestyle to 3:41.33.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. men haven't medaled in the 400 freestyle at the
Olympics since 1984. The U.S. hasn't even placed a swimmer in the
top eight in the event in the past two Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   The swell of support that Carvin rode like a Huntington Beach
wave at the IUPUI Natatorium will crest for Thorpe in Sydney. So
what, Carvin said. After all, he metaphorically hung 10 on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   All day long, swimmers approached Carvin to wish him well. It
was all the softspoken swimmer could do to keep from crying.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder he ran out of energy before the end of the race; he
was emotionally spent before he stepped to the blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd feel a surge of emotion whenever someone came up to give
me good luck,'' Carvin said. ``I was trying to draw upon the energy
people were sending my way.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the joy on his face lit up the place. &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC received an oral commitment Wednesday from
center Rory O'Neil of Burroughs High in Ridgecrest, Calif., giving
the Trojans their fastest start in recruiting in coach Henry
Bibby's four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil (6-foot-11, 215 pounds) selected USC over Stanford,
making him the program's third commitment. He averaged 20 points,
12 rebounds, 3.6 blocks, two assists and 1.3 steals last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Coach Bibby can get the most out of me and help me get
to the NBA,'' O'Neil said.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans also received commitments last month from twin
brother guards Errick and Derrick Craven of Bishop Montgomery in
Torrance, Calif. USC now has one scholarship available. &QL;

<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ In what has become an annual rite of
summer, a coveted free agent has spurned the Lakers after using
them for leverage to get a better deal elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall Gill, who on Sunday said he would join the Lakers for
their $2.25 million salary-cap exception, instead is about to
re-sign with the New Jersey Nets for at least $7 million, NBA
sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gill, a 6-foot-5 guard, had told New York reporters he would
take less money to join the defending champion Lakers, saying,
``I'm very excited that I'm getting a chance to be on a
championship team. I want to experience that.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, he's more eager to experience a bigger paycheck.
That's not unusual; last summer, forward Charles Oakley publicly
teased the Lakers, using their interest to get a three-year, $18
million deal from the Toronto Raptors.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers officials would not comment on the situation, but the
team remains hopeful Gill will take their offer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Lakers signed undrafted rookie Nate Johnson, a
6-6 forward from Louisville. Johnson, who played for the Lakers'
summer-league team, signed a one-year, nonguaranteed contract and
will join the team in training camp. &QL;

BUSH CAMPAIGN TRAIN MOBBED IN OXNARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: Updating throughout) 
By DOMINIC BERBEO 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXNARD, Calif. _ Just days before the Democratic National
Convention, Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush opened a
whistle-stop tour of California on Wednesday, vowing to
aggressively pursue votes in the state and vowing to beef up the
military and cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My intentions are to come here not only because it's a pretty
place, but we are going to come here because we intend to carry
California in November,'' Bush told some 3,000 people at the Oxnard
train station, his first stop on a campaign swing up the Central
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from the back of a red-, white- and blue-decorated
Amtrak train, Bush spoke in Spanish at times, while laying out his
plan to spend more on defense, boost education and rework the tax
code to benefit the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   ``El sueno Americano es para todos,'' he said, telling the crowd
in Spanish that the American dream is for all people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats had their chance,'' he said, adding that taxes
are at their highest level as a percentage of the American economy
since World War II. ``They've squandered the moment. The current
surplus means government has more money than it needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor called for reform of Medicare and Social
Security, saying Americans should be allowed to invest their
paycheck contributions instead of being required to rely on the
government for retirement checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be your choice to take some of your own money and
put it in private markets to get a better return on your
investment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush vowed to rebuild the military power of the United States,
saying it would help boost morale among the armed forces he claims
were ignored by the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Those comments drew cheers from the crowd, mostly older
residents from around Ventura County, where two military bases are
two of the largest employers in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he will not ignore California _ and its 54 electoral
votes _ as previous GOP candidates did before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody said to me the other day, 'Well, you just like to go
to California because it's a pretty place to be, but you don't
intend to fight for it, just like the last two campaigns.' They
misunderstand me,'' he told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's rally was similar to the Republican National
Convention in that there appeared to be more diversity represented
on the stage than in the audience. An African-American gospel choir
followed a mariachi band, and the emcee was also African-American.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Becerra, the Ventura County chairman of the Bush campaign,
joined Bush on the train platform. He said that in the past, GOP
presidential hopefuls have lost key votes in California by not
campaigning seriously in the Democrat-dominated state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has made a commitment not to concede California,''
Becerra said in an interview. ``Ignoring California is a huge
mistake that we've made in the past, and it has cost us.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush might not have an easy time conquering California,
where 45 percent of registered voters are Democrats, compared with
35.14 percent Republican, according to the Secretary of State's
Office.
</P>
<P>
   In Oxnard, Ventura County's largest city with 160,000 residents,
there are 58,143 registered voters _ 30,575 Democrats and 16,007
Republicans, according to county Assistant Registrar of Voters
Bruce Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   At the rally, some 100 Gore supporters carrying signs with
messages such as ``This is Gore Country,'' came out to upstage
their rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans are trying hard to court the Latino vote and
forge new ground in California, but they don't have the substance
to do it,'' said Democrat Ann Malashock of Camarillo. ``People
remember how Republicans treated immigrants with Proposition 187.''
</P>
<P>
   But for others, like Republican Susan Lopez, an assistant at the
Boys &AMP; Girls Club of Oxnard, the main draw to the GOP is Bush's
stance against abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm voting Republican because of the moral issues like
pro-life and family values,'' Lopez said. ``But it is true that
they need to get more in touch with the people and find out what
our other issues are.''
</P>
<P>
   Minda Petralba, a Filipino immigrant housewife from Oxnard, said
she is Catholic and a member of Mothers For Life, a local
anti-abortion group. She said she has voted Republican for 10 years
because of the abortion issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as they have that view on abortion, I'll vote for
them,'' she said. She added that she would prefer Bush not support
the death penalty, but that the abortion issue was more important
to her.
</P>
<P>
   Bush arrived in Oxnard by train from the nearby Point Mugu Naval
Air Station, where he arrived by plane from Texas. He left at noon
for San Luis Obispo, and is scheduled to be joined on the campaign
trail in Northern California by his former rival, Sen. John McCain,
who nearly split the Republican vote with Bush in California's
March primary.
</P>
<P>
   The two will then campaign through Oregon and Washington before
heading home Saturday to sit out next week's Democratic convention.

VAUGHN HAS ROUGH NIGHT AS ANGELS LOSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It was a night to remember for Angels Tim
Salmon and Matt Wise, but Mo Vaughn would prefer to forget
everything about Wednesday's game against the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Wise, who attended Pepperdine, pitched seven strong innings in
his first career major-league start. Salmon hit career home run
No.222, tying Brian Downing for the all-time Angels record and
extending his career-best hitting streak to 17 games.
</P>
<P>
   But Vaughn went 0 for 4, including 0 for 3 with runners in
scoring position, never getting the ball out of the infield in a
4-2 Angels loss in front of 25,334 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take this game tonight on my shoulders, my back,'' Vaughn
said. ``You can't be a big-league hitter, hitting third and leave
10 runners (actually six) on base. I'm hitting .190 (actually .199)
versus left-handers. That's the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   The win enabled the Red Sox to avoid a three-game sweep, and
prevented the Angels from making up ground on the Mariners and A's
in the AL West and wild-card races. The Angels remained 8{ games
behind the Mariners and 3{ behind the A's.
</P>
<P>
   Wise made 94 pitches in his seven innings, only one of which was
bad: a hanging slider that Nomar Garciaparra converted into a
three-run homer in the third inning. Wise gave up five hits with
one walk and two strikeouts. But he wouldn't admit to feeling good
about his performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is we didn't win,'' said Wise, who secured 20
tickets for friends and family and had dozens more in the crowd.
``If I'd given up 10 and we won 15-10, I'd be a lot happier.
Individual success doesn't matter here; it's about winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Having beaten Pedro Martinez one night earlier, facing Red Sox
starter Jeff Fassero (8-5) might have seemed like a walk in the
park to Angels hitters. Instead, they did a lot of walking back to
the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Gant hit a solo homer in the first inning for a 1-0 Angels
lead, his third homer since joining the club after the July 30
trade for Kent Bottenfield. But after that, the Angels couldn't get
anything going against Fassero until Salmon's record-tying homer
leading off the sixth earned him a long standing ovation and a
curtain call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't expecting anything, it caught me off-guard,'' Salmon
said of the ovation. ``I only tied the record. But I appreciate
that. It's for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had numerous chances against Fassero, getting runners
in the second, third and fifth innings. But they failed to get a
hit with runners in scoring position, going 0 for 9.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn had chances against his ex-teammates but struck out with
a runner on third in the third inning and grounded out with the
bases loaded in the fifth. Both outs ended the innings.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn had yet another chance against Red Sox reliever Rheal
Cormier, coming up with runners on first and second and two outs in
the seventh. But he grounded out back to the pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were too many opportunities, too many situations to
break the game open,'' Vaughn said. ``It's been happening all year.
I haven't capitalized in those situations. Tim Salmon, (Darin)
Erstad, they're all doing something for us, and I'm slowing us
down. ... I'm hitting .285. That's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Wise got into a groove after giving up Garciaparra's homer,
retiring the next 11 hitters in a row until Ed Sprague singled with
one out in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon's homer in the sixth narrowed the deficit to 3-2, but the
rally ended there. Manny Alexander homered off reliever Mark
Petkovsek for the Red Sox's final run in the ninth. &QL;

GALAXY WINS, ADVANCE TO CUP SEMIS

<P>
   FULLERTON, Calif. _ The Galaxy was as lucky to walk away with a
2-0 victory over San Jose in Wednesday's U.S. Open Cup quarterfinal
as it was to escape any serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Mauricio Cienfuegos and Seth George both scored second-half
goals in front of 4,345 at Cal State Fullerton to lift L.A. past
the Earthquakes. The win sets up an Aug. 23 semifinal against the
Chicago Fire, a 5-1 quarterfinal winner over the Dallas Burn
earlier in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a brief shoving match and a bruise that forced Cobi
Jones out of the game in the 63rd minute, the Galaxy limped off
fairly healthy. Simon Elliott and Sasha Victorine were also whacked
late in the game, but everyone appears ready for Saturday's Western
Division showdown against Kansas City at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely got physical at the end and we hope Cobi's
injury isn't too serious,'' Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid said. ``I
think we came out a little flat after Saturday's game (a 5-1
victory over the Wizards) but we picked up the tempo in the second
half and Mauricio sort of broke the ice for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was scoreless until Peter Vagenas sent a long ball for
Cienfuegos, who somehow poked his shot over Earthquakes goalkeeper
Joe Cannon, who raced out to challenge. San Jose defender Jimmy
Conrad hustled back to clear the ball away, but his attempt slammed
into the side netting to give the Galaxy a 1-0 lead in the 77th
minute.
</P>
<P>
   Striker Seth George, who replaced Jones, scored his first goal
of the season in the 81st minute, sealing the victory for the
Galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seth hadn't played well earlier in the season but as of
recently, he's trained well in the last four or five days,'' Schmid
said. ``I thought tonight was a good time to reward him for the
corner he had turned and he rewarded me with a good goal.''
</P>
<P>
   After making a one-on-one save against Abdul Thompson Conteh
late in the first half, Galaxy keeper Matt Reis turned Conteh away
again in the 62nd minute to earn his shutout. Reis _ playing in his
fourth consecutive match since starter Kevin Hartman had knee
surgery _ has been impressive. In two U.S. Open Cup games and two
MLS games, Reis has surrendered only three goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously he made two big one-on-one saves and with each game
his confidence is growing,'' Schmid said. ``He's feeling better
about himself and people are starting to realize that we've got two
pretty good goalkeepers.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Sebastian Vorbe couldn't do anything with a
give-and-go ball from Jorge Salcedo in the fifth minute, sending
his 15-yard shot from the right side over the Earthquakes net.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose's Richard Mulrooney provided a brief scare for the
Galaxy, running in from 20 yards out. The Earthquakes' Dario Brose
nudged a free kick to the right which Mulrooney fired inches over
the Galaxy's crossbar in the 14th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Salcedo, who has played in only three games for the Galaxy after
recovering from early season knee trouble, provided a nice spark
along the left side as Vagenas' replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Although Salcedo appeared to tire, he dropped several passes in
dangerous spaces, though he couldn't capitalize on his own big
chance in the 20th minute. Elliott dropped a delicate pass to
Salcedo, who was alone inside the penalty area to the left. Salcedo
tried to go far post, but he didn't get enough on it, allowing
Cannon to make an easy save to his right.
</P>
<P>
   Vorbe turned on the jets in the 21st minute. After receiving the
ball along the left side just past midfield, he cut through the
middle and sprinted toward the net. As John Doyle and Conrad
scrambled to close Vorbe down, the Haitian striker found Jones
cutting inside the penalty area. Jones had an easy chance from
eight yards but his shot deflected off Cannon.
</P>
<P>
   Conteh blew an even better chance for the Earthquakes. He took a
pass from Khodadad Azizi and blew past defender Robin Fraser in the
38th minute. With only Reis to beat, Conteh tried to blast his shot
over Reis, but the former UCLA keeper swung his arms in the air,
getting a piece of the shot to leave the first half scoreless.
</P>
<P>
   ALSO: In other U.S. Open quarterfinal action, Miami beat D.C.
United 3-2 after Jim Rooney scored in the 112th minute of the first
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The Fusion will meet the New York/New Jersey MetroStars in the
other semifinal. The MetroStars beat Columbus 2-1 (7-6 on penalty
kicks) after the two teams finished regulation and overtime tied
1-1. &QL;

WHITE SOX PUT A HURT ON MARINERS, HALTING WIN STREAK AT FIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ This Mariners club is, on the strength of its 67-47
record at the 114-game mark, the best in Seattle history.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, this Mariners club lost worse than any team, save
one, in team history.
</P>
<P>
   Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, who saw a five-game winning streak come to an end,
were carried away Wednesday by a tornado arguably worse than the
one that served as Dorothy's transport to Oz. By the time the
Mariners had been unceremoniously plopped down in a strange country
and the swirling winds had stopped howling, the White Sox had
claimed a 19-3 victory and some vengeance for Seattle's sweep of a
doubleheader Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If last night was long,'' manager Lou Piniella said, ``then
tonight was longer. My word, they put a whipping on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly whipped was Mariners starter Jamie Moyer. The
left-hander had trouble getting his changeup to move and couldn't
locate his fastball in the strike zone. For a pitcher who lives and
dies on those pitches, it was a four-inning funeral dirge.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer gave up 11 runs in 3 2/3 innings, the worst one-game
effort in his career. It came in the wake of having allowed seven
runs (six earned) in 6 1/3 innings last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in that start suggested something worse was to follow.
But it did, and it followed fast. And furious. Frank Thomas hit his
32nd homer in the first with a man on. By the time he came up in
the second, the Chicago lead was 4-0, with hits by Charles Johnson
and Ray Durham wounding Moyer.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas then lit the fuse on No. 33, a three-run shot that put
the Mariners in a 7-0 hole. Things were looking grim, but at least
there was plenty of game left to play. However, Chicago used that
to its advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox scored at least one run in each of the first six
innings, capping the exploits with a seven-run sixth off Rob
Ramsay. It was an inning that saw 12 batters come to the plate.
Jose Paniagua came out of the bullpen to get the final out of the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Moyer was hit with questions about not only
Wednesday night's game, but about last Friday's game, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any answers,'' Moyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Any guesses as to the problem?
</P>
<P>
   ``No guesses,'' Moyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Bryan Price was careful not to read too much into
the uncharacteristic weak performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's any pitcher here who has the leeway to have a
couple of bad games, Jamie's the one,'' Price said of the old man
(37) of the starting rotation. ``We've had big losses like this
before and we've regrouped. Jamie will regroup, I'm sure of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's loss was the first real blowout of the
Mariners since April 18, when _ no surprise here _ the White Sox
scored 11 times in the fourth inning en route to an 18-11 victory.
The Mariners have suffered some lopsided loses since, but those
were reasonably competitive games that disintegrated in the final
few innings.
</P>
<P>
   There was none of that this time around. By the time Moyer left
in the fourth inning, he'd been charged with 11 runs, the most he'd
ever given up.
</P>
<P>
   The game was so far over, so quickly, that Moyer and lefty
reliever Ramsay were left out on the mound as long as possible to
keep the bullpen from being uselessly ground up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated to leave Jamie out there, and Ramsay, too,'' Piniella
said. ``But after the doubleheader yesterday, we were thin in the
bullpen. If we get deep into the game with (Thursday's starter)
Aaron Sele, we should be back to normal in the bullpen by Friday or
Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   How best to quantify this loss? Moyer set a franchise record by
giving up 11 runs. Ramsay gave up only eight, but giving up eight
runs in two innings was more than Ramsay had given up in any month
this year.
</P>
<P>
   By the time this one was over, the Mariners had put all three of
their catchers on the field at the same time _ newcomer Chris
Widger behind the plate, Dan Wilson at third base for the first
time in his career and Joe Oliver in a rare appearance at first.
</P>
<P>
   It was a night that looked like the residue of a badly staged
WWF match.
</P>
<P>
   For all of that, the Mariners have a chance to come back with a
win behind 12-game winner Sele in the series finale. To do so would
be a good test of character after the Mariners lost by 16 runs. The
only greater loss was by 17 to Detroit, 20-3, on April 19, 1993.
The 24 hits allowed by Seattle were the most in club history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play to win, but we know that we're not going to win them
all,'' Ramsay said. ``The idea now is to get back out there
tomorrow, win the game and win the series.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be the only remedy that will ease the bitter taste of
this blowout.

DODGERS MISS CHANCES, FALL TO CUBS IN 10TH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This was the week the Dodgers were supposed to
start making their move.
</P>
<P>
   They had home games and bad teams on the schedule. They had
Kevin Brown pitching Wednesday night against the Chicago Cubs
before heading to Atlanta to face the mighty Braves.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing this season has fit cleanly, especially their
10-inning, 5-4 loss to the Cubs in front of 39,753 at Dodger
Stadium that turned on a bases-loaded walk by Antonio Osuna.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are throwing it away,'' said Mark Grudzielanek, who popped
out with the tying run at third in the 10th. ``We are playing at
home and we should be winning these games, but we are just throwing
it away.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown struggled early and left after six innings with a sore
right-side muscle. Todd Hundley broke an 0 for 19 slump with a
monster home run, but made two throwing errors and struck out with
the winning run at second in the ninth. The Dodgers stranded five
baserunners in the final two innings.
</P>
<P>
   But even more surprising is the home-field advantage _ or, lack
thereof _ that the Dodgers have been hoping will carry them to the
National League West title. They play 19 games at home in
September, including 13 of the last 16. But so far, they are just
27-26 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   They dropped two of three to the lowly Milwaukee Brewers over
the weekend and split the first two games with the Cubs, who have
won 13 of 19 after an awful start. With Wednesday's loss, the
Dodgers are 5 games behind the division-leading San Francisco
Giants, who beat Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Today they fly to Atlanta where they begin a weekend series.
They will face Kevin Millwood, Greg Maddux and the white-hot Andy
Ashby, who is undefeated since coming over from Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Against Chicago, the Dodgers tied the game in the eighth on a
pinch home run by Dave Hansen off Jon Leiber, who had retired the
previous 14 batters. For Hansen, it was the 10th of his Dodger
career, a franchise record. But with a chance to win in the ninth,
they couldn't score after Shawn Green opened with a double and Gary
Sheffield was intentionally walked.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the inning, the Cubs loaded the bases against
Osuna, but first baseman Eric Karros appeared to save the game by
diving to stop Gary Matthews Jr.'s liner and throwing to the plate
to force Sammy Sosa for the second out.
</P>
<P>
   But Osuna (2-5) walked Jeff Reed to force home the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Worrell (2-3) pitched the ninth to earn the victory. After
putting runners at the corners with no outs, Rick Aguilera struck
out Devon White and got Grudzielanek on a pop to second. Green
walked, bringing up Sheffield, the NL leader with 35 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, who took a called third strike and hit into an
inning-ending double play earlier, nearly won it with a liner that
was foul by several feet. Two pitches later, he fouled out to Mark
Grace to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we put the ball in play the run scores,'' Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson said. ``That's what makes this game so maddening.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown entered the game 10-4 with a 2.34 ERA, but found himself
trailing 1-0 just three batters in when Sosa drove a double into
the gap in left-center for his league-leading 102nd RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley tied it in the second with a mammoth home run off
Leiber. It was his first in 19 at-bats and it landed 449 feet from
home plate.
</P>
<P>
   But Hundley also was critical in the Cubs' third inning, when
two throwing errors eventually led to three runs.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that Brown was not on his game. Brown, who
experienced some shoulder discomfort last month, felt his side
tighten in the fourth inning. Pitching coach Claude Osteen said
Brown wanted to pitch the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had thrown 101 pitches after six and it wasn't worth taking
a chance,'' Osteen said. ``Brownie is a such a competitor he was
ready to continue, but he was hurting.'' &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Clippers' six-month search will end today.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio assistant Alvin Gentry met with executive vice
president Elgin Baylor on Wednesday, according to a Clippers
source, making him the likely face at a news conference called for
today to announce a new head coach.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Clippers' other two top coaching candidates,
Denver assistant John Lucas and Clippers assistant Dennis Johnson,
said they are not the new coach.
</P>
<P>
   Gentry, who was the head coach in Detroit for parts of the last
three seasons, had been in the running from the beginning but came
to the forefront this week. He said earlier in a report in the San
Antonio Express-News on Monday that he wanted the job and liked the
team's young players.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the perfect time to get that job,'' Gentry told the
Express-News. ``They have a lot of young, talented players and they
will be able to hold onto them for the next four years or so.''
</P>
<P>
   Gentry was unavailable for comment Wednesday. The Clippers had
no comment on the coaching vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers had been without a coach since February, when Chris
Ford was fired. Jim Todd took Ford's place on an interim basis for
the rest of the season, but his name was removed from consideration
once the regular season ended.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich hired Gentry as an assistant in
June. This was after Atlanta announced that Gentry was going to be
their top assistant. It turned out Gentry hadn't made his final
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Gentry, 45, was fired with 24 games left last season due to
Detroit's lackluster efforts. The Pistons were 28-30 when he was
let go, having lost seven of their last 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Gentry took over as the Pistons' interim coach on Feb. 2, 1998,
after Doug Collins was fired. He finished the season going 16-21
and earning the respect of Grant Hill and Joe Dumars, according to
reports. At the end of the season, the Pistons removed the interim
tag.
</P>
<P>
   His first season was the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season. The
Pistons finished 29-21 and lost in the first round of the playoffs
to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Gentry became a Pistons assistant in 1995-96. Previously, he
spent four seasons with the Miami Heat, mostly as an assistant.
Gentry became the interim coach with 34 games left in the 1994-95
season, replacing Kevin Loughery. Gentry went 15-21 the rest of the
way. The Heat hired Pat Riley at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Gentry was an assistant coach for the Clippers under Mike
Schuler for the 1990-91 season. That team, with Danny Manning,
Charles Smith, Ken Norman and Ron Harper, went 31-51. Gentry was
also an assistant for Larry Brown in San Antonio and at Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   With Gentry the likely coach, there will be at least a decade of
Clipper ties. At times, it felt like this job was open that long.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers' search took longer than even Baylor imagined.
Baylor said he hoped to have a coach in place by the June 28th NBA
Draft. That didn't happen and the Clippers went on to acquire a
slew of talented young players, including three first-round draft
picks: forward Darius Miles, point guard Keyon Dooling and shooting
guard Quentin Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Clippers acquired rookie swingman Corey
Maggette, power forward Derek Strong and power forward/center Sean
Rooks through trades.
</P>
<P>
   Such youth brought renewed interest to the coaching search and
led Baylor to re-open his search. The Clippers talked to former
Lakers coach Del Harris about the job. Cincinnati Bearcats coach
Bob Huggins said he was offered the job but turned it down.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fratello was in contention early but withdrew his name. He
then had renewed interest late but withdrew again.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson tried to impress Baylor through coaching the Clippers'
summer-league team but never became a top candidate. Lucas remained
a candidate throughout. &QL;

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: WHY FOREIGN POLICY SHOULD MATTER MORE
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (p) political categories for
release Sunday, Aug. 13.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After an ex-governor with scant foreign policy
experience wins the presidency, he imposes a boycott against an
adversary that had behaved badly halfway around the world in a
place where few Americans have ever been.
</P>
<P>
   The adversary takes unkindly to the American-led boycott,
retaliating with a walkout of its own. That, in turn, helps
solidify the re-election of his former rival, who also went to the
White House as an ex-governor.
</P>
<P>
   That's the story of Jimmy Carter's decision to shun the 1980
Moscow Olympic Games because the Kremlin had muscled its way into
the Afghan civil war.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Walter Mondale, Carter's former No. 2, was running an
uphill race against Ronald Reagan, Carter's successor in the White
House. When the Soviets and their partners bowed out of the Los
Angeles Olympics, Team U.S.A. easily won the most medals.

<P>
   Reagan and his handlers closely tied their ``Morning in
America'' campaign theme to the nation's upbeat mood over the
Olympic victory, thereby helping to ensure Mondale's subsequent
drubbing at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Although nearly a generation has since passed, those events
remain relevant today because they point up some truths about how
presidential elections are waged and what's likely to happen once
they're decided.
</P>
<P>
   First, foreign policy issues rarely decide elections. Although
they can be a factor in whether a candidate ``appears
presidential,'' most voters look elsewhere in choosing whom to
support.
</P>
<P>
   Second, foreign affairs is the one arena where a president
enjoys a great deal of leeway in setting a course for the nation
and, often, for its allies as well. Here, lawmakers and judges play
secondary roles.
</P>
<P>
   Had Congress run the show, has it often does over domestic
policy, the U.S. military interventions in Kuwait, Somalia, Bosnia,
Haiti and Kosovo would each have probably taken different turns. In
1998, President Clinton didn't call anybody on Capitol Hill before
ordering the Pentagon to fire off cruise missiles into Afghanistan
(a smart move) and Sudan (as it turned out, a misguided one).
</P>
<P>
   Third, the law of unintended consequences, which thrives in
Washington's political climate, weighs heavily when events abroad
are in play. Carter hardly thought he would be giving Reagan a leg
up against Mondale when he went after the Soviets over Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Going by the form charts, Al Gore has run around the foreign
policy track a good deal more than has George W. Bush. But while a
president has the final say, it might matter more that the State
Department would have a different look and feel under Bush's Colin
Powell than under Gore's Richard Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   Both presidential hopefuls seem able to process information in a
hurry. That can be an vital asset in a fast-moving crisis. And
neither man appears fearful of acting decisively if and when the
nation's security is threatened. That is, after all, the prime duty
of a 21st century president.
</P>
<P>
   So it's somewhat ironic that the outcome in November will, more
than likely, turn on issues over which any president, Democrat or
Republican, possesses far less ultimate power and real
responsibility.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: WHY FOREIGN POLICY SHOULD MATTER MORE
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (p) political categories for

   WASHINGTON _ After an ex-governor with scant foreign policy
experience wins the presidency, he imposes a boycott against an
adversary that had behaved badly halfway around the world in a
place where few Americans have ever been.
</P>
<P>
   The adversary takes unkindly to the American-led boycott,
retaliating with a walkout of its own. That, in turn, helps
solidify the re-election of his former rival, who also went to the
White House as an ex-governor.
</P>
<P>
   That's the story of Jimmy Carter's decision to shun the 1980
Moscow Olympic Games because the Kremlin had muscled its way into
the Afghan civil war.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Walter Mondale, Carter's former No. 2, was running an
uphill race against Ronald Reagan, Carter's successor in the White
House. When the Soviets and their partners bowed out of the Los
Angeles Olympics, Team U.S.A. easily won the most medals.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan and his handlers closely tied their ``Morning in
America'' campaign theme to the nation's upbeat mood over the
Olympic victory, thereby helping to ensure Mondale's subsequent
drubbing at the polls.

 &HT;    LIFE IS EASY IN TECH'S FUTURISTIC 'COOL TOWN'

   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ With technology stock prices falling sharply
in recent months, some Americans might think the tech revolution is
cooling off.
</P>
<P>
   But in Silicon Valley, laboratories are exploding with new ideas
and products for the 21st century. ``Things are moving faster than
ever,'' said Jamie Beckett, a spokeswoman for Hewlett-Packard Co.
``There is no sense of anything slowing down.''
</P>
<P>
   During a recent tour for journalists, the gadget geeks at
Hewlett-Packard eagerly showed off some of the new products they
hope will shape the Internet Age. The devices are being tested in
the company's ``CoolTown'' laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   If the Hewlett-Packard vision becomes reality, our lives will
resemble one long episode of ``The Jetsons.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer chips will be embedded in our watches, refrigerators,
clothes, vending machines, even the tires on our cars. In this
wireless Internet-connected world of ``pervasive computing,'' our
possessions will be ``thinking'' for us.
</P>
<P>
   A typical day might go something like this: Your smart alarm
clock will consult your electronic calendar to determine what time
to wake you. But because it also will be aware of traffic reports,
the clock will wake you a bit earlier if the freeway is jammed.
</P>
<P>
   A little later, when your wrist watch updates you with breaking
news about worsening traffic, you may decide to take the bus
instead of driving. Just glance at your Web-enabled watch to find
out how soon the bus will be coming by. An embedded computer in the
bus will keep updating its location, using a Global Positioning
System transmitter over a wireless network.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that the bus is still 10 minutes away, you'll have time
to pull out your palmtop computer to order a double latte at the
coffee shop near the bus stop. By the time you get there, the
coffee will be ready, its price deducted from your online bank
account.
</P>
<P>
   And on your day will go, with computer-enhanced devices
streamlining your life at every turn. Your car tires will let you
know when they need air. The mannequin in the store will sense you
approaching and offer an instant electronic coupon. Everything from
your telephone to your toaster will be able to sense what you want,
and will be eager to please.
</P>
<P>
   By working with companies such as Microsoft, IBM, Lucent
Technologies, Sun Microsystems and Xerox, Hewlett-Packard hopes to
make the devices _ which they stay will start appearing on store
shelves within a few years _ ``context aware,'' so they know who
you are and what you want to do.
</P>
<P>
   You'll be surrounded by sensors providing constant streams of
information about location, temperature, light and sound. Those
sensors will make the products tailor themselves to your needs.
</P>
<P>
   But how will the devices know who we are? The answer is
``biometrics,'' measurements of our body parts. Car keys and
refrigerator door handles may recognize our fingerprints or palm
prints, while telephones and radios will recognize our voices.
Desktop and palmtop computers may look us in the eye to size up our
irises.
</P>
<P>
   Those body measurements will free us from having to use
passwords and PIN numbers, making our interactions with
computer-embedded devices much less aggravating.
</P>
<P>
   They also will forever change our notions about privacy. When
the tiny chips in the bed sheets can instantly sense who is rolling
on them and transmit that data over the Internet, life may get much
more complicated for some people.

 ART ADV: With a graphic showing disenfranchisement rates, and two

 By JONATHAN TILOVE  
 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The 2000 Democratic National Convention here is
being held in the 33rd Congressional District. It is the poorest,
most Hispanic district in all of California. Democrats win in the
33rd without breaking a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   And yet these densely packed precincts of L.A. and the teeming
small cities to its southeast offer a troubling puzzle to the
Democrats, and to democracy itself. When Bill Clinton and Al Gore
swept the 33rd in 1992, they also collected fewer voters here than
in any other district in California.
</P>
<P>
   That seeming contradiction is possible because the 33rd also
owns the distinction of having the fewest registered voters of any
California district, and not entirely because the locals are not
organized or interested. It is, rather, because so many of those
living here are not citizens at all, but immigrants not yet
eligible to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Call California's 33rd the can't-vote capital of the United
States, a not-so-shining symbol of a nation within a nation but
outside its body politic, whose existence is rarely observed and
whose meaning for representative government goes largely
unconsidered. As America heads toward another, potentially close
presidential election, nearly 20 million residents over the age of
18 simply cannot vote.
</P>
<P>
   More than 14 million are the foreign-born who are not yet either
eligible, interested or able to make it through the citizenship
process. More than 80 percent of them are not white, more than half
Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   And an estimated 4 million to 5 million Americans --
disproportionately black and brown -- have lost the vote because
they have committed felonies.
</P>
<P>
   If the can't-vote nation could vote, the American electorate
would be less white, and the fortunes of Democrats -- who tend to
win minority voters by significant and sometimes overwhelming
margins -- would be more secure than they are now. If places like
the 33rd Congressional District produced votes at anything like
normal rates, California would be a Democratic lock.
</P>
<P>
   And, even though the felon and ex-felon population is much
smaller, a new analysis by two sociologists from Northwestern
University and the University of Minnesota concludes that, were it
not for disenfranchised felons, the Democrats would still have
control of the U.S. Senate, and if current felon disenfranchisement
rates had existed in 1960, Richard Nixon would have defeated John
F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Bush-Gore election turns out to be as close as the
Kennedy-Nixon election, and Bush squeaks through, we may be able to
attribute that to felon disenfranchisement,'' said Jeff Manza, the
Northwestern sociologist.
</P>
<P>
   Manza and Minnesota collaborator Christopher Uggen concluded
that, if disenfranchised felons voted in the way and at the rate of
those who otherwise looked like them demographically and
socioeconomically, about 30 percent would have turned out to vote
in 1996, and 93 percent of them would have voted for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, The Sentencing Project, based in Washington,
D.C., estimated that 3.9 million Americans, including 1.4 million
black men, could not vote because of felony convictions.
(Hispanics, whose rate of incarceration has doubled since 1980, are
also a growing share of the disenfranchised.) But Manza and Uggen,
using a more sophisticated method, estimate that close to 5 million
are disenfranchised, and that the number is growing.
</P>
<P>
   Growing also, through immigration, is the much larger population
of those who cannot vote because they are not yet citizens.
</P>
<P>
   According to an analysis of the 1999 Current Population Survey
by Steven Camarota, research director of the Center for Immigration
Studies in Washington, nearly 40 percent of Hispanics and
Asian-Americans are not citizens, compared to 4 percent of blacks
and 2 percent of whites. Altogether, there are 7.7 million
voting-age Hispanics who are not citizens, and because the Hispanic
community is much younger than the population at large, their
voting strength is even more dramatically diminished.
</P>
<P>
   Arturo Vargas, executive director of the National Association of
Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, headquartered smack in the
middle of the 33rd Congressional District in the city of Commerce,
illustrates the point this way:
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, out of every 100 Latinos, 36 were under 18 (compared to
26 in the general population), 25 were not citizens, 16 of the
citizens were not registered, and 6 of the registered did not vote.
That leaves 17 Latinos who voted, compared to 42 out of 100
non-Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   With so many non-citizens concentrated together, it cannot help
but have a distorting effect on democracy and representation,
nowhere more apparently than at the most local level.
</P>
<P>
   (By contrast, while the Asian-American population is slightly
more heavily non-citizen than the Hispanic population, the
political impact is less pronounced because the Asian community is
smaller, more dispersed and less clearly identified with either
party.)
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   One of the 33rd District's largest and most commercially vibrant
communities is the city of Huntington Park. But, according to
Fernando Guerra, who directs the Center for the Study of Los
Angeles at Loyola Marymount University, while Huntington Park has
an almost entirely Latino population of close to 120,000, there are
only about 12,000 registered voters. In the last municipal
election, the top vote-getter for city council, Rosario Marin, won
with 1,295 votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a city of 120,000,'' said Guerra. ``This is not good
for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   It is better than it was a decade ago, when many of these
communities still were run by whites. The neighboring city of Bell
remains a throwback to that era -- 90 percent Hispanic, but with
only one Hispanic on the five-member city council.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the people on the council are the same ones who were
in office when I went to (Bell) high school,'' said Araceli
Gonzalez, 30, a councilwoman in neighboring Cudahy and a rare
Republican, who thinks her party must and can win over Latinos.
When Gonzalez was elected to the Cudahy council in 1997, she
completed the Latinization of a board that she said was once
elected by a much older white community that has largely
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   It is not always whites, though, who represent the old guard.
</P>
<P>
   Just beyond the 33rd, in Compton, a black minority holds
tenaciously to power in a city now majority Latino. Both
communities may vote Democratic in state and national elections,
but there is no common interest in mobilizing folks to become
citizens and voters. John Ortega, a local activist and attorney,
knows that Hispanics will eventually wrest control of Compton. But
he said, ``I don't expect to see it in my lifetime. I'm 65.''
</P>
<P>
   In the city of Los Angeles itself, Latinos are now nearly half
the population, but not even a fifth of the electorate. A Latino
candidate remains a long shot to capture the mayoralty next year.
</P>
<P>
   In the schools, said Guerra, ``We have one-third of the children
attending the L.A. Unified School District who have parents who
cannot participate in the selection of the governing board.''
Latinos comprise 68 percent of the students, but only one of seven
school board members. Last year a Latina candidate lost by 532
votes.
</P>
<P>
   And, as Woody Guthrie might have put it, the story is the same
from California to the New York island.
</P>
<P>
   Brentwood, in Suffolk County, Long Island, has New York's
largest Hispanic community outside the city. More than half the
district's 15,200 students are Hispanic, and nearly a fifth are
black. But all seven school board members are white. Only about
1,600 people vote in the school board elections.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   To Johnny Velez, who has organized a local Hispanic Democratic
club, ``it's taxation without representation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's common sense,'' said Velez. ``You pay taxes, you have
kids in the school, you should be able to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, in fact, the way it works in New York City and Chicago.
Before the last great wave of immigration, it was not unusual for
states to allow non-citizens to vote in both state and federal
elections. A proposal several years ago to allow non-citizens to
vote in Los Angeles school elections went nowhere, and would
require amending the state constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Velez said he is contemplating suing Brentwood to allow
non-citizens to vote in school elections. ``It's simple,'' he said.
``I want to see some Spanish representation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Anthony Felicio, the Italian-American chairman of the
Brentwood board of education to which he was first elected in the
1960s -- the administration building is named for him -- thinks
that allowing non-citizens to vote would undermine the meaning of
citizenship. ``Our system has been working pretty well here,'' said
Felicio. ``If they're not citizens, the only thing they can't do is
vote. Their kids are educated just like anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   The representation gap found in Brentwood is now being
replicated in small communities across the country that have
suddenly become home to large numbers of Latin Americans who have
come to work at poultry plants, slaughterhouses and factories.
</P>
<P>
   In America's carpet capital of Dalton, Ga., Hispanics now make
up at least a third of the county population, but 2 percent of its
registered voters. The first Latino to run for the Dalton school
board received 15 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   But even where Latinos have achieved power, the large number of
can't-voters can distort the way power is distributed.
</P>
<P>
   The congresswoman in California's 33rd District is Lucille
Roybal-Allard, whose father, Edward Roybal, a pioneer in Latino
politics in Los Angeles, served in Congress for 30 years.
Roybal-Allard won with 87 percent of the vote last time, but that
was with only 43,310 votes. Across town, on L.A.'s Westside, U.S.
Rep. Henry Waxman received three times as many votes on his way to
a slightly less impressive percentage of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   What that means is that Roybal-Allard ultimately must answer to
a much smaller group of people than Waxman, and that the few who
vote in her district wield power in ways that undermine the meaning
of one man, one vote.
</P>
<P>
   Putting aside the question of how ably Royal-Allard, who now
chairs the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, represents her district,
Peter Skerry, a professor of government at Claremont-McKenna
College, said it is a situation that invites complacency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those problems of our immigration policy that no
one wants to really address,'' said Skerry, author of
``Mexican-Americans: The Ambivalent Minority.''
</P>
<P>
   And any remedies are fraught with political overtones. When
Clinton and Gore sought to accelerate the naturalization process in
1996, they were accused of corrupting the system for political
gain.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The impact of felon disenfranchisement is uneven across the
country, because the rules vary state by state. Maine,
Massachusetts, Utah and Vermont do not disenfranchise felons at all
(inmates in one Massachusetts prison formed a political action
committee), while in Alabama, the only way a felon can regain the
vote is to petition for a pardon. Nationally, 13 percent of black
males are unable to vote because of felony convictions, but in
Alabama and Florida, it is close to a third.
</P>
<P>
   Most elections are not close enough for those lost votes to
matter. But when Manza and Uggen re-examined close U.S. Senate
elections since 1978, they concluded that the felon vote could have
reversed Republican victories in Virginia, Texas, Georgia,
Kentucky, Florida and Wyoming, and prevented the Republican
takeover.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these people get out, they are probably Democratic voters,
like myself,'' said Tommy Waites, an ex-felon now doing a prison
ministry out of a church in Montgomery, Ala. Waites successfully
petitioned to win a pardon and will vote in his first presidential
election this year.
</P>
<P>
   Obtaining a pardon is arduous, said Jerome Gray, state field
director for the Alabama Democratic Conference. Only about 200 are
granted a year and most ex-felons don't know about the process.
``Most of them think they are in the penalty box forever,'' said
Gray.
</P>
<P>
   Just recently, Recardo Cook registered to vote for the first
time at the Jefferson County courthouse in Bessemer, Ala.,
clutching in his hand the pardon he received this spring. Cook
served 15 years in prison for murder, some on death row, before the
capital sentence was reversed. He has been out 10 years now and is
pastor of a Baptist church in Bessemer.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago he decided he ought to practice what he
preached to his parishioners about voting, and began to petition
for his pardon.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks if more ex-felons voted, some of the politicians ``who
speak so harshly'' on issues of criminal justice might tone it
down.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said he hasn't decided whom he will vote for this fall, but
plans to study the candidates and the issues and, when the time
comes, ``I'll just make my choice of the lesser of the evils.''
</P>
<P>
   (FOURTH OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gray and other Democrats are working to change the
law to automatically restore the right to vote once a felon has
served his time and paid his fine.
</P>
<P>
   If that happened, Gray said, it could change Alabama politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1998, we had several statewide races in the general
election where Democratic candidates we were supporting lost by
less than 10,000 votes,'' he said. ``In Alabama, we have 105,000
black men who are ineligible to vote because of felony convictions.
If I had just 20,000 of them, that could have turned those
elections around, to say nothing about close races in legislative
districts and for county school board.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The 2000 Democratic National Convention here is
being held in the 33rd Congressional District. It is the poorest,
most Hispanic district in all of California. Democrats win in the
33rd without breaking a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   And yet these densely packed precincts of L.A. and the teeming
small cities to its southeast offer a troubling puzzle to the
Democrats, and to democracy itself. When Bill Clinton and Al Gore
swept the 33rd in 1992, they also collected fewer voters here than
in any other district in California.
</P>
<P>
   That seeming contradiction is possible because the 33rd also
owns the distinction of having the fewest registered voters of any
California district, and not entirely because the locals are not
organized or interested. It is, rather, because so many of those
living here are not citizens at all, but immigrants not yet
eligible to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Call California's 33rd the can't-vote capital of the United
States, a not-so-shining symbol of a nation within a nation but
outside its body politic, whose existence is rarely observed and
whose meaning for representative government goes largely
unconsidered. As America heads toward another, potentially close
presidential election, nearly 20 million residents over the age of
18 simply cannot vote.
</P>
<P>
   More than 14 million are the foreign-born who are not yet either
eligible, interested or able to make it through the citizenship
process. More than 80 percent of them are not white, more than half
Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   And an estimated 4 million to 5 million Americans --
disproportionately black and brown -- have lost the vote because
they have committed felonies.
</P>
<P>
   If the can't-vote nation could vote, the American electorate
would be less white, and the fortunes of Democrats -- who tend to
win minority voters by significant and sometimes overwhelming
margins -- would be more secure than they are now. If places like
the 33rd Congressional District produced votes at anything like
normal rates, California would be a Democratic lock.
</P>
<P>
   And, even though the felon and ex-felon population is much
smaller, a new analysis by two sociologists from Northwestern
University and the University of Minnesota concludes that, were it
not for disenfranchised felons, the Democrats would still have
control of the U.S. Senate, and if current felon disenfranchisement
rates had existed in 1960, Richard Nixon would have defeated John
F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Bush-Gore election turns out to be as close as the
Kennedy-Nixon election, and Bush squeaks through, we may be able to
attribute that to felon disenfranchisement,'' said Jeff Manza, the
Northwestern sociologist.
</P>
<P>
   Manza and Minnesota collaborator Christopher Uggen concluded
that, if disenfranchised felons voted in the way and at the rate of
those who otherwise looked like them demographically and
socioeconomically, about 30 percent would have turned out to vote
in 1996, and 93 percent of them would have voted for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, The Sentencing Project, based in Washington,
D.C., estimated that 3.9 million Americans, including 1.4 million
black men, could not vote because of felony convictions.
(Hispanics, whose rate of incarceration has doubled since 1980, are
also a growing share of the disenfranchised.) But Manza and Uggen,
using a more sophisticated method, estimate that close to 5 million
are disenfranchised, and that the number is growing.
</P>
<P>
   Growing also, through immigration, is the much larger population
of those who cannot vote because they are not yet citizens.
</P>
<P>
   According to an analysis of the 1999 Current Population Survey
by Steven Camarota, research director of the Center for Immigration
Studies in Washington, nearly 40 percent of Hispanics and
Asian-Americans are not citizens, compared to 4 percent of blacks
and 2 percent of whites. Altogether, there are 7.7 million
voting-age Hispanics who are not citizens, and because the Hispanic
community is much younger than the population at large, their
voting strength is even more dramatically diminished.
</P>
<P>
   Arturo Vargas, executive director of the National Association of
Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, headquartered smack in the
middle of the 33rd Congressional District in the city of Commerce,
illustrates the point this way:
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, out of every 100 Latinos, 36 were under 18 (compared to
26 in the general population), 25 were not citizens, 16 of the
citizens were not registered, and 6 of the registered did not vote.
That leaves 17 Latinos who voted, compared to 42 out of 100
non-Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   With so many non-citizens concentrated together, it cannot help
but have a distorting effect on democracy and representation,
nowhere more apparently than at the most local level.
</P>
<P>
   (By contrast, while the Asian-American population is slightly
more heavily non-citizen than the Hispanic population, the
political impact is less pronounced because the Asian community is
smaller, more dispersed and less clearly identified with either
party.)
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   One of the 33rd District's largest and most commercially vibrant
communities is the city of Huntington Park. But, according to
Fernando Guerra, who directs the Center for the Study of Los
Angeles at Loyola Marymount University, while Huntington Park has
an almost entirely Latino population of close to 120,000, there are
only about 12,000 registered voters. In the last municipal
election, the top vote-getter for city council, Rosario Marin, won
with 1,295 votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a city of 120,000,'' said Guerra. ``This is not good
for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   It is better than it was a decade ago, when many of these
communities still were run by whites. The neighboring city of Bell
remains a throwback to that era -- 90 percent Hispanic, but with
only one Hispanic on the five-member city council.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the people on the council are the same ones who were
in office when I went to (Bell) high school,'' said Araceli
Gonzalez, 30, a councilwoman in neighboring Cudahy and a rare
Republican, who thinks her party must and can win over Latinos.
When Gonzalez was elected to the Cudahy council in 1997, she
completed the Latinization of a board that she said was once
elected by a much older white community that has largely
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   It is not always whites, though, who represent the old guard.
</P>
<P>
   Just beyond the 33rd, in Compton, a black minority holds
tenaciously to power in a city now majority Latino. Both
communities may vote Democratic in state and national elections,
but there is no common interest in mobilizing folks to become
citizens and voters. John Ortega, a local activist and attorney,
knows that Hispanics will eventually wrest control of Compton. But
he said, ``I don't expect to see it in my lifetime. I'm 65.''
</P>
<P>
   In the city of Los Angeles itself, Latinos are now nearly half
the population, but not even a fifth of the electorate. A Latino
candidate remains a long shot to capture the mayoralty next year.
</P>
<P>
   In the schools, said Guerra, ``We have one-third of the children
attending the L.A. Unified School District who have parents who
cannot participate in the selection of the governing board.''
Latinos comprise 68 percent of the students, but only one of seven
school board members. Last year a Latina candidate lost by 532
votes.
</P>
<P>
   And, as Woody Guthrie might have put it, the story is the same
from California to the New York island.
</P>
<P>
   Brentwood, in Suffolk County, Long Island, has New York's
largest Hispanic community outside the city. More than half the
district's 15,200 students are Hispanic, and nearly a fifth are
black. But all seven school board members are white. Only about
1,600 people vote in the school board elections.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   To Johnny Velez, who has organized a local Hispanic Democratic
club, ``it's taxation without representation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's common sense,'' said Velez. ``You pay taxes, you have
kids in the school, you should be able to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, in fact, the way it works in New York City and Chicago.
Before the last great wave of immigration, it was not unusual for
states to allow non-citizens to vote in both state and federal
elections. A proposal several years ago to allow non-citizens to
vote in Los Angeles school elections went nowhere, and would
require amending the state constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Velez said he is contemplating suing Brentwood to allow
non-citizens to vote in school elections. ``It's simple,'' he said.
``I want to see some Spanish representation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Anthony Felicio, the Italian-American chairman of the
Brentwood board of education to which he was first elected in the
1960s -- the administration building is named for him -- thinks
that allowing non-citizens to vote would undermine the meaning of
citizenship. ``Our system has been working pretty well here,'' said
Felicio. ``If they're not citizens, the only thing they can't do is
vote. Their kids are educated just like anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   The representation gap found in Brentwood is now being
replicated in small communities across the country that have
suddenly become home to large numbers of Latin Americans who have
come to work at poultry plants, slaughterhouses and factories.
</P>
<P>
   In America's carpet capital of Dalton, Ga., Hispanics now make
up at least a third of the county population, but 2 percent of its
registered voters. The first Latino to run for the Dalton school
board received 15 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   But even where Latinos have achieved power, the large number of
can't-voters can distort the way power is distributed.
</P>
<P>
   The congresswoman in California's 33rd District is Lucille
Roybal-Allard, whose father, Edward Roybal, a pioneer in Latino
politics in Los Angeles, served in Congress for 30 years.
Roybal-Allard won with 87 percent of the vote last time, but that
was with only 43,310 votes. Across town, on L.A.'s Westside, U.S.
Rep. Henry Waxman received three times as many votes on his way to

of one man, one vote.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Undermined Barak holding an empty politcal bag
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM -- Israel is testing whether it is possible to run a
country without a government. The answer so far: sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Undermined by votes in the Knesset and betrayed by a one-time
coalition partner in filling the nation's figurehead presidency,
Prime Minister Ehud Barak has been left holding an empty political
bag, like the kid taken on a snipe hunt.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether Barak, after a series of political
defections, can cobble together a functioning coalition before the
Knesset, on a three-month recess, reconvenes in October and makes a
final decision on its preliminary vote to call early elections.
</P>
<P>
   Whether there is really a majority for elections is at least
questionable. Two no-confidence votes that would have forced
elections were defeated before the vote that left the possibility
hanging over the recess like the sword of Damocles. The hesitation
suggests something short of confidence among Barak's opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The sniping at particulars of Barak's government doesn't add up
to a coherent alternative and the main opposition party, Likud,
presents no commanding figure as a challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a so-called national unity government, muddling together
elements of Likud and the Labor Party, could come out of the
stalemate, in effect formalizing it. Middle ground players like
Natan Sharansky, leader of the large and politically engaged
Russian immigrant community, would like that.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Barak has been politically wounded by his efforts to
bring peace to a population that, according to the polls, wants
just that.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the Camp David talks set Barak up for this fall,
if fall it turns out to be. The talks exposed how far the prime
minister was willing to go in resolving the most contentious issues
-- the future of Jerusalem and a Palestinian right of return _ but
left him with nothing to show for his tenders.
</P>
<P>
   That has allowed criticism of the costs of peace to rage without
any offsetting context of the benefits from a settlement along the
lines Barak pursued.
</P>
<P>
   So Shas, the ultra-orthodox party, not only bolted its coalition
with Labor but, going back on an implied commitment, engineered the
surprise defeat in the Knesset of the presidential candidacy of
national icon Shimon Peres. To replace the venerable Ezer Weizman,
a peace advocate, the Knesset picked Moshe Katsav, a nondescript
Knesset member who, though a Likudnik, immediately started
exploiting Israeli class differences in demagogic ways more common
to Shas than to Likud.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister David Levy added insult to injury with his
cabinet resignation. (A gesture diminished by the fact that
resigning or threatening to is Levy's political shtick.)
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the political outcome here, it is likely we have seen
the high-water mark of Israel concessions for peace. Even another
Barak-led government would shy from the Camp David offers. The
Palestinian negotiators have outwitted themselves again.

THE REPLACEMENTS CAN BE QUICKLY FORGOTTEN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  BY ERIC HARRISON &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've got to wonder why no one thought to cast Keanu Reeves in
``Hollow Man,'' the sci-fi/horror thriller about invisibility that
opened recently. He's spent his whole career perfecting a persona
so blank that he might as well be invisible.
</P>
<P>
   OK, that's absurd: His following is predicated on sex appeal,
and in the absence of personality, that appeal surely must derive
from his looks _ what else is there? A faceless Keanu will not do.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he is a vacuum at the center of ``The Replacements,'' as
he is in his other films. With his stolid drone and inexpressive
eyes, he has all the excitement of tofu. What flavor he has comes
from the other ingredients tossed in the pan.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, the ingredients in ``The Replacements'' include
football, Gene Hackman and a handful of talented if relatively
unknown supporting players. Hackman gives this dish its bite, the
other actors its charm.
</P>
<P>
   As for football, the inherent drama of the sport adds zing even
to so inept a concoction as this. As a result, it's possible to
leave the theater thinking that this movie, based on the 1987 pro
players strike, is not the stinker it first appeared to be.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be fooled. The movie is bad _ very, very bad. And no
scene-stealing supporting cast member or hyped-up sporting event
can change that.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the filmmakers' sins is the script, and a poorly
developed main character is only part of it. A better actor than
Reeves could've fleshed out the role of a failed ex-pro quarterback
and brought something _ charisma, an emotional core _ for the
audience to hook into. But as it is, we're given no reason to care.
</P>
<P>
   We learn eventually that after his college career ended on a
traumatizing note, Reeve's Shane Falco spent several
undistinguished years as a pro before quitting the game. So this is
what made him a gloomy bore. That's good to know, but it doesn't
make him any less boring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at you, and I see two men _ the man you are and the man
you ought to be,'' Hackman's stern football coach tells him.
``Someday those men will meet.''
</P>
<P>
   What do you want to bet that football will be the facilitator?
</P>
<P>
   This _ personal redemption _ is the basic theme for nearly every
sports movie ever made. If the climatic sports event is filmed
excitingly enough, we walk out of the theater flushed and feeling
good. Even non-sports fans are susceptible.
</P>
<P>
   With ``The Replacements,'' that final rush is little
compensation for the tedium of much that has come before.
</P>
<P>
   Hackman plays Jimmy McGinty, a once-celebrated coach coaxed out
of retirement to lead a team of scabs while the pro athletes are
out on strike. He agrees on one condition: That he be allowed to
recruit ``a team of poor nobodies who play to win.''
</P>
<P>
   His point _ and it's one that the movie keeps repeating, perhaps
to obscure the fact that the movie makes heroes out of a bunch of
scabs _ is that the professionals are pampered millionaires who
care only about the bucks. Former Houstonian Brett Cullen plays the
main pampered millionaire _ the striking Washington Sentinels
quarterback. He's none too pleased with the strike-breakers.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Reeves, the other team members include a psychotic
ex-cop, a convicted felon, a sumo wrestler, a born-again preacher
and a soccer player. They all are looking for redemption _ all,
that is, except for a few who are clearly in the mix simply because
the filmmakers thought they'd be fun to have around.
</P>
<P>
   They really are fun. A few of them shine, particularly Orlando
Jones as a fast-talking con-man and wide-receiver and Nigel Gruff
as the soccer player.
</P>
<P>
   The movie works best when it kicks back and lets the players do
riffs with one another.
</P>
<P>
   Because there's little tension in the early football games, and
because Falco is so bland, the movie feels directionless until
about midway, when the team starts to bond after a bar fight.
Improbable as it seems, the vehicle is Gloria Gayner's dance
anthem, ``I Will Survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the story always comes back around to Falco.
</P>
<P>
   This is screenwriter Vince McKewin's third produced script. He
must've read in a book somewhere that characters should be given
distinctive traits, but maybe he skipped the chapter about creating
character depth.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the movie, Falco meets and falls in love with the head
cheerleader. In lieu of a personality, she's given a trait _ she's
a terrible driver, oblivious to everything around her. It has
nothing to do with anything. It's just a silly scene, quickly
forgotten. So is the character.
</P>
<P>
   So is the movie. &QL;

BLESS THE CHILD SHOULD BE BETTER THAN IT IS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Bless the Child,'' a movie that plays like a recruitment
film for Demon Busters Inc., Kim Basinger battles the Forces of
Darkness for the soul of her niece.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, she has the Catholic Church and lots of angels on
her side. The angels are annoyingly inconsistent, but they usually
show up.
</P>
<P>
   Basinger, mistaking this for a serious film and thus missing a
golden opportunity to play arch terror, is Maggie O'Connor, a
divorced nurse who keeps her house and life in order.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1993, Maggie's drug-addicted, ne'er-do-well sister
Jenna shows up, carrying her 8-day-old baby, Cody. Jenna splits,
leaving Maggie to raise the girl. She does it in a three-scene
montage hardly worth the 30 seconds spent on it. A simple ``six
years later'' and we would have known just as much: Maggie now
loves Cody.
</P>
<P>
   Cody is considered autistic. (The film is vague on details.) She
can also do cheap parlor tricks, like mentally make plates spin on
edge. It's fun for the other kids, but a bit weird to grown-ups.
She restores dead animals to life, too.
</P>
<P>
   It's now almost Easter 2000. Tabloid headlines scream, ``Fourth
Child Murdered,'' and we learn the murderers are Satanists looking
for a 6-year-old destined to be a powerful new emissary from God on
Earth. Hint: It's Cody.
</P>
<P>
   Jenna, now apparently clean and sober, reappears with a famous
husband, New Age cult guru Eric Stark (Rufus Sewell), who
immediately whisks Cody into his waiting limousine over Maggie's
tearful protests.
</P>
<P>
   Maggie's search for Cody is aided by helpful, handsome FBI agent
John Travis (Jimmy Smits). He was a seminary student before
dropping the priesthood for crime-busting. Now he's an FBI occult
specialist who carries a Bible in his shoulder holster (well,
practically) and knows the devil when he sees him.
</P>
<P>
   Maggie also gets help from a kind nun, those on-again, off-again
angels and a frightened former member of Stark's cult, Cheri
(Christina Ricci in a large cameo).
</P>
<P>
   The movie, when not wearing us down with long conversations that
go exactly where we knew they would go, finds Maggie and Travis
trying to get Cody back while Stark uses high school theology to
convert Cody _ a good Christian _ to Satanism. (Jump off this high
building, Cody, if you really think your Lord will protect you.)
</P>
<P>
   The movie changes tone frequently: drama, psychological horror,
monster movie, mild religious film. It goes way over the top in a
few scenes where Maggie sees (or does she?) Satanic creatures, from
hordes of rats to flying ghouls to a big ol' giant troll.
</P>
<P>
   Two scenes, one of attacking rats and another in which a
character losses a major body part, supply good scares. The rest is
mostly shouting ``Boo!'' at people who expect worse. The effects
are not bad and kind of fun in their go-for-broke ugliness.
</P>
<P>
   Although lacking anything new, the movie still should be better,
or at least more fun. But director Chuck Russell (``The Mask'')
plays this like high drama, preventing all the potential camp humor
and cheap thrills from bursting forth. And the film drags.
</P>
<P>
   Basinger desperately needs something to do besides act, since
there's nothing here for her to act about. ``My baby's been stolen
by Satan'' makes for melodrama, not drama.
</P>
<P>
   After years on ``NYPD Blue,'' Smits should have been able to do
this role without checking the script, even with the priesthood
angle. He's fine, but hardly registers. As the bad guy, Sewell
(``Dark City'') gets the most interesting character, if only
because he's so serious about this converting to evil stuff. But he
plays it with so much restraint, there's little menace.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Holm has a very brief, throwaway cameo as the wise old
Satan-buster these films always have. Holliston Coleman plays the
child well enough to get by, but with no special screen appeal.
Support actress Dimitra Arlys, however, makes a cooly evil
impression as a demon nanny with killer knitting needles.
</P>
<P>
   The movie has more sunlight and is less oppressive in tone and
decor than most recent films in this genre. There's considerable
talk about ancient demon signs and symbols.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is scary enough to give nightmares (those rats!) to
young kids, especially since a child is often threatened, but not
nearly enough to excite jaded horror audiences. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Bless the Child &QL; 
Starring: Kim Basinger, Jimmy Smits, Rufus Sewell, Christina Ricci &QL; 
Director: Chuck Russell &QL; 
Writers: Tom Rickman, Clifford and Ellen Green &QL; 
Rating: R for violence, drug content and brief language. Also,
scenes too disturbing for young children &QL; 
Running time: 110 min. &QL; 
Grade: C- &QL;

THE ANTIDOTE TO E-SNOOPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week I offered a half-hearted defense of the FBI's
notorious Carnivore program, the one that can scan millions of
e-mail messages in pursuit of terrorists, dope dealers, and sellers
of illegal cable TV boxes. It seems to me that the technology isn't
that dangerous if it's hedged about with strong legal safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   And one other thing _ Carnivore won't work. All the e-mail
snooping in the world will be of little value against bad guys who
encrypt their messages. The Feds may be able to read the addresses,
which must be sent in the clear. But use a good crypto program and
everything else in the message is just a blur of seemingly random
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, computers can eventually decipher the messages _ in a
few million years per message, using your typical supercomputer.
And even if some genius in the basement of the National Security
Agency has found a way to decode each message in, say, a week, he'd
still be overwhelmed by the sheer number of messages he'd have to
crack.
</P>
<P>
   It makes you wonder why the FBI even bothered to develop
Carnivore, until you ask yourself whether you encrypt your own
e-mail. Here's a good Baptist bet for you: If 50 readers of this
column can prove to me that they use e-mail encryption, I'll slip
an extra $50 into the collection plate next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It's been several years since I tried an early version of Pretty
Good Privacy, one of the first e-mail scramblers. With its talk of
hash algorithms, passphrases, public and private keys, it made my
brain hurt. Dr. Evil himself would probably be repulsed by the
complexity of the process. For a law-abiding sort like me, it
wasn't worth the bother.
</P>
<P>
   But it needn't be this way. Web browsers come with sophisticated
encryption software built right in. It kicks in automatically when
you use your credit card to buy something online. This same
encryption engine can be applied to your e-mail by obtaining a
``digital certificate,'' basically a set of keys that let you send
and receive scrambled messages. Standard e-mail programs like
Microsoft Outlook and Netscape Communicator let you plug in these
certificates and use them with ease.
</P>
<P>
   Most people haven't known about this feature, or they aren't
willing to pay the minimum of $14.95 a year charged by Verisign
Inc., the best known dealer in digital certificates. But in the
grand tradition of the Internet, somebody thinks he can give away
the certificates and make it up in volume. WildID (www.wildid.com)
passes out free certificates good for 30 days, and sends you an
e-mail when it's time to renew. The company hopes to make money by
attracting millions of users to its site and bombarding them with
ads.
</P>
<P>
   The WildID system requires you to fiddle with some browser
settings that most folks never touch, but in only a couple of
minutes I was sending secret messages _ with nobody to send them
to. Just as in the days of Pretty Good Privacy, WildID sends
encrypted messages only to other WildID users. That's fine if you
send messages only to fellow members of the Soprano crime family.
But your notes to others remain insecure.
</P>
<P>
   Another secure mail service called ZixMail (www.zixmail.com)
offers a handy backup. ZixMail runs inside its own client software,
instead of the e-mail program you normally use. Also, it's not as
easy to set up as WildID.
</P>
<P>
   But ZixMail has a clever feature that lets you send secure
e-mails to people who don't use the product. What they get is an
unencrypted e-mail that contains a link to a Web page where the
message is waiting. When the recipient clicks the link, the Web
page uses the browser's standard encryption system to download,
decode, and display the message. It's pretty slick.
</P>
<P>
   It's still not quite slick enough. Most of us will keep on
sending our e-mails in the clear. But if the government is ever
caught abusing its e-snooping technology, ZixMail and WildID will
have all the business they can handle. And the FBI's poor old
Carnivore will starve to death.

CHATTING WITH SOUND, PICTURES  
 BY CARRIE KIRBY  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   2000 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When Jayson Agagnier chats online with his
4-month-old nephew, the two sit in front of Internet cameras so
that they can see each other while they talk.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco resident also likes to use a laptop with a
cellular modem and Webcam to capture images of the city's streets _
as viewed from the front of a cable car.
</P>
<P>
   With permission from Muni, he attaches a camera to the front of
a cable car about once a month and beams the images to his personal
Web page.
</P>
<P>
   He can capture only still photos that update every few seconds,
but faster cellular modems will soon be available that will allow
him to broadcast live video as the car rolls from the wharf to
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the fast-moving world of Webcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Internet cameras have been around as long as the World Wide Web
itself. Until recently, plugging a camera into a computer and
broadcasting images of yourself to the world was something only
geeks did. The Web is still full of live cameras showing the
insides of computer labs.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the availability of cheaper cameras and free Web-based
services are making broadcasting pictures and live video onto the
Internet so easy that regular people are using Webcams to share
special moments with family or hold everyday conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Web sites such as SpotLife and Camarades are supplying
everything needed for free online camera use with the hope that Web
broadcasting can be as common a way to stay in touch as e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, a few barriers remain before Webcasting can become
part of our daily lives. For people without broadband Internet
connections, video images move slowly and appear jerky.
</P>
<P>
   And because many free services list all their members in a
directory and don't offer password-protected private
videoconferencing, some broadcasters may find that they are
sacrificing their privacy to go online.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the setbacks, it is relatively easy to be a Webcaster.
</P>
<P>
   Today's Webcams are capable of recording still pictures, video
and audio. Unlike digital cameras, Webcams have to be physically
attached to a computer to work.
</P>
<P>
   Users plug the Webcam into the computer and then log on to
SpotLife or a similar Web site, which guides them through an easy
setup process that usually takes about half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't use to be this easy. Before these free Webcasting
services came along, would-be Internet broadcasters had to spend a
lot of time setting up servers and figuring out how to make
pictures appear on their personal Web pages. Now it's not even
necessary to have a Web page to broadcast, because the Web sites
mentioned above provide a place to store video and images online.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Jeremy Schwartz said sharing video online like Agagnier
and his nephew do is the natural next step in the evolutionary
chain from e-mailing photos and greeting cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of rich media (images, video and sound) as a
communications method among consumers is just going to go through
the roof,'' Schwartz said. In a recent report for his employer,
Forrester Research, Schwartz predicted that in five years, when
broadband DSL or cable modem connections are more common, 92
percent of consumers will use visuals and audio to communicate on
the Internet once a month.
</P>
<P>
   The price of Webcams are falling, from about $300 a few years
ago to less than $100. Last month, mainstream Webcam use got a
boost when Compaq began including a Logitech QuickCam and SpotLife
software with each Presario it sells.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Webcam technology is getting better and more fun to
use. Traditional Webcams show photographs, updated periodically _
as slowly as once every 15 minutes, or as rapidly as 30 times a
second.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Webcams have been silent. But now, broadband
connections and free Webcasting services make it possible for
ordinary people to broadcast streaming videos and sound.
</P>
<P>
   Another developing technology, cellular modems, is making it
possible to use Webcams to show the folks at home what you're doing
on vacation. Like cell phones, cellular modems are mobile, giving
Webcasters the freedom to leave their homes and capture outdoor
scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Some say Webcam technology still has room for improvement.
Warren Slocum, San Mateo county clerk, and his two children use
Webcams to chat with Slocum's father a few times a week. ``It's not
like a smooth motion picture, but the quality is OK for what it
is,'' Slocum said.
</P>
<P>
   While he and his father found setting up the cameras easy,
Slocum said it took awhile to get used to talking to a camera while
looking at the computer screen. The experience is more like using a
walkie-talkie than a telephone, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get in the rhythm _ one person talks, the other
person listens. You can't be talking simultaneously,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because both Slocum and his father have a Webcam, they both can
see each other while they talk.
</P>
<P>
   Web broadcasters, though, can easily interact with friends who
don't have Webcams by using text chat. Camarades and most other
online Webcam sites offer chat rooms that appear right next to or
below the Webcam image, so the users can chat and view video at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   Others use their Webcams to record video, then send it as an
e-mail attachment or post it online.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone will feel comfortable opening family events or
conversations to the public. While some Webcam services, such as
SpotLife, make it possible to protect broadcasts with a password so
only the intended viewer can see it, other services, such as
Camarades, don't have password protection.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Chlubna, a Camarades user who lives in Pacifica, has
experienced harassment from unintended viewers. In exchange for its
free service, Camarades requires all broadcasters to be listed in
its directory. That means anyone who wants to can see any of the
content.
</P>
<P>
   Chlubna set up a Webcam on Camarades so his girlfriend could see
him from her home in Australia. But he soon began receiving daily
unwanted e-mails and instant messages from men he didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   Recently he posted an indignant message on his page, telling
viewers that he is not interested in receiving any comments.
</P>
<P>
   A little unpleasantness is not too large a price to pay in
exchange for the free service, Chlubna said. But he has a warning
for new Web broadcasters: ``Be prepared for harassment. You open
yourself up to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other camera users see things they don't want to see when
browsing through the camera directories listed on Camarades and
other Webcast services. Some sites, such as SpotLife, ban sexual
and violent content. Others, including Camarades, permit adult
content, but only in a designated adult section.
</P>
<P>
   Both SpotLife and Camarades offer special sections for families
and children, but some users complain about cameras displaying
adult material in these special areas.
</P>
<P>
   A host of Camarades' family section, Ohio dad Denver Harris
spends about two evenings a week looking at the different Webcams
listed in his section. Recently he found someone broadcasting adult
content, and he sent the person a stern e-mail asking him to stop.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to using volunteer monitors such as Harris,
Camarades and many other sites encourage viewers to report naughty
broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   Each user page on Camarades has a ``cyberpatrol'' button.
Pushing it takes a snapshot of the broadcast and submits it to
Camarades staff, who will remove the camera from the site if they
deem the image offensive.

MAC USER READY TO TAKE PC PLUNGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY   
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Many years ago, I bought a Macintosh computer
and have continued to buy Macintoshes through the years. I want to
buy a PC. Where can I have my files from Microsoft Word 98
converted to be used on my PC? If this is impossible, I may have to
buy another Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seen the Light
</P>
<P>
   DEAR SEEN: Stop! Put down that checkbook nice and slowly, ma'am.
That's it. Now back away from the MasterCard. Good, good. OK, cuff
her, boys. Another senseless Macintosh purchase avoided.
</P>
<P>
   You Apple-heads put your pitchforks and torches away. Whether
you like it or not, most of the world's personal computing is done
on the PC platform, and there are people just as fervent about PCs
as you are about your Macs. I've used both, and guess what? They
both crash, they both have their eccentricities and they both
occasionally make me want to drive my fist through the monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of a computing platform should be based on which
software someone intends to use, not on goofy case colors or
Compuserve rebates. For example, there are graphics and digital
video programs that either work better on a Mac or simply don't
exist for the PC. If that's the stuff you use, the decision is a
no-brainer. If you lean toward office suite software _ word
processing, databases, spreadsheets _ you're probably better off
with a PC. At least the hardware is usually cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   When software publishers saw Apple's market share sliding a few
years back, they made sure there would be PC versions of their
stuff around just in case Steve Jobs decided it was time to have
the big garage sale. Today, programs like Quark Xpress, InDesign,
Photoshop and Microsoft Office can read and write files from either
platform.
</P>
<P>
   Word is a good example. If you create a document on the Mac in
Word, it can be opened by Word on a PC. But don't think you have to
pay somebody a ton of money to do this, unless you'd like to hire
me for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Put a PC-formatted disk in the Mac and save your Word document
to it. If you give it a .Doc extension as you save it, you'll make
it a little easier on the PC end. Take the floppy to the PC, call
up the file, then do a Save As (from the File menu) to save it
somewhere on the PC, making sure the ``Save as type'' box on the
Save As dialog box is set to ``Word document,'' which it usually
is.
</P>
<P>
   Now go buy your PC. Sorry, Steve. Bill Gates wins another one.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Sometimes when I turn on my computer, the
hourglass icon appears on my screen as if I have clicked on an icon
to start a program or action. Can you tell me what this might be?
</P>
<P>
   _ Tempus Fugit
</P>
<P>
   DEAR TEMPUS: No need to worry. That's just Microsoft's
Eavesdropper 2000, a little-known feature of Windows that sends a
complete inventory of your hardware, copies of all your personal
documents, your browser history file and your bank balance and
credit card numbers back to World Domination Headquarters in
Redmond, Wash., every time you boot.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that hourglass just means that all the little
behind-the-scenes programs are continuing to load. Sometimes they
add icons to the System Tray as they load, sometimes not. To get an
idea of what's running, hit Control-Alt-Delete to get a list. The
only things that absolutely have to be there are Explorer and
Systray.
</P>
<P>

INTERNET `WEB STATIONS' ARRIVE AT MAJOR LEAGUE BALLPARK 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The seventh-inning stretch is coming up at the
ballpark and you realize it's been more than two hours since you
last logged in.
</P>
<P>
   Like a left-hander coming in from the bullpen, relief is here.
</P>
<P>
   Starting this week in San Francisco, Giants fans will have
limited access to the Internet at one of five ``Web Stations'' at
the Pac Bell Park, making it the first major league baseball
stadium in the nation to provide such a service.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco-based Streetspace Inc., the company that last year
installed similar terminals at cafes and shops in Berkeley, put the
sleek little machines in the ballpark to give people access to
e-mail as well as selected sponsor sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are pretty much living online these days. If there's a
break in the action or people are just walking around, it's a great
way to keep in touch,'' explained Michael Wranovics, vice president
of marketing at Streetspace.
</P>
<P>
   The terminals allow people to check out the San Francisco
Giants' home page, SFGiants.com, as well as the other sponsoring
sites _ Hotmail, CitySearch Bay Area, FOXSports.com and
ABCNews.com.
</P>
<P>
   It does not give people full access to the Internet but instead
operates as a closed network powered by Pacific Bell's high-speed
digital subscriber line, or DSL.
</P>
<P>
   Wranovics said the stations are not designed for people to spend
long periods of time surfing the Web. The limited Internet access
also restricts people from calling up objectionable material, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The stations, rather, allow people to send or receive mail, make
restaurant reservations or transactions, look at movie schedules or
get other quick bits of information.
</P>
<P>
   While the service is free to users, they must first register
with Streetspace to access the sites. Wranovics said the
registration is for privacy and for the company's internal
information and that the data is not sold or shared with other
parties.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants also do not pay for the Web Stations. The service is
supported by the five sponsors, a number which may be increased but
will be kept small for simplicity's sake. The number of terminals
may also be increased to as many as 30.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Alioto, the Giants' senior vice president of corporate
marketing, said the Giants considered installing ``smart seats,``
or screens on the back of seats that could provide limited Internet
access and other features.
</P>
<P>
   Streetspace's Web Stations offered a less intrusive alternative,
Alioto said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we really wanted to do this is that it adds to the
experience at the ballpark,'' he said. ``It's there if you want it,
but you don't have to go to it. It's just part of the
attractions.''
</P>
<P>
   For Streetspace, which was founded a year and a half ago, the
deal with the Giants is something of a coup.
</P>
<P>
   Streetspace has other deals in the works with nationally known
partners, Wranovics said. ``We are basically building an
infrastructure and we plan to build it all over the country,'' he
said.

Cyberspace the latest destination for Americans on a spiritual
quest 
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In cyberspace, no one can hear you scream.
</P>
<P>
   You can't shout anyone down, can't wag your finger in someone's
face, can't storm out of the room. In short, it's a great place for
people of various faiths to talk about the potentially explosive
issue of religion.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Rev. Charles Henderson, pastor of the First
Church of Cyberspace, discovered after creating and leading an
online church that is open to people of many beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson's 4-year-old cybercongregation _ he says his church
budget is only $19.95, the monthly Internet fee _ includes
Christians, Jews, atheists and pagans. Between debates on religion,
these virtual parishioners share personal struggles, prayers and
cyberhugs.
</P>
<P>
   The 58-year-old Henderson is an ordained Presbyterian pastor who
has been in the ministry for three decades, but he's never pastored
a congregation like his online church.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tremendously diverse,'' said Henderson from the church's
office in New York. ``It has pagans, Wiccans, liberals, gays,
straight _ that's what makes it so exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to confine your search for God to a house of
worship anymore. God has gone online. Internet experts say that
religion has become one of the most popular stops in cyberspace. At
least 25 percent of the estimated 100 million Americans online use
the Internet regularly to seek or share spirituality, a 1998 study
by the Barna Research Group, an organization that tracks religious
trends, concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional image of a religious community _ like-minded
believers who gather in a mosque, synagogue or church _ is being
revolutionized by cyberspirituality.
</P>
<P>
   Internet experts are divided on where such online connections
will lead. Some warn that faith communities that don't go online
will eventually perish.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a church or a denomination to ignore the Internet would
strike me as utterly foolish,'' said Mark Kellner, author of ``God
on the Internet'' (IDG Books Worldwide, $24.99, 308 pages).
</P>
<P>
   Others view the popularity of cyberreligion in less Darwinian
terms. They say the Internet will profoundly change how faith
communities interact with one another and the world, but believe
that online sites will never replace actual communities of worship.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson thinks there will always be churches, the type made of
wood and bricks and stained-glass windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to be at a place at the same time,'' he said.
``That's an indispensable ingredient to being a Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   But the communications superhighway is growing busier each day.
Metro Atlanta churches, synagogues and other faith communities are
jumping aboard in ever-increasing numbers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Peachtree Presbyterian Church in Buckhead cybercasts its
services live every Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Congregation Or VeShalom, a Sephardic Jewish community in north
Atlanta, posts upcoming events, service schedules, Jewish links _
even recipes _ on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   The Drepung Loseling Institute, a center for Tibetan Buddhist
studies in Atlanta, uses its site for religious and political
reasons. It talks about Tibet's mystical tradition as well as its
struggle to retain its culture under Chinese occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most traditional religious leaders have seen the wisdom
of going online.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Tim McDonald, pastor of the First Iconium Baptist
Church in Atlanta, ``hoops'' during his sermons _ a traditional
form of preaching in the African-American community _ dresses in
conservative suits and still wears an Afro.
</P>
<P>
   But McDonald is also a cyberevangelist who rattles off technical
computer jargon like Scripture and gushes over the Internet's
impact on his ministry. He uses the Internet to e-mail members,
research sermons and welcome out-of-town visitors and others to his
ch and biblical passages, said he appreciates too many religious
traditions to label himself by any particular faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I am,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He's discovered that the Internet is a powerful tool for
satisfying his spiritual yearning.
</P>
<P>
   Spiritual guides are only a click away, he learned after
e-mailing a Catholic monk who had written a book on ``centering
prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   The monk ``was stationed somewhere in China as a missionary,''
Strand says. ``I got his first response within 24 hours. That's
revolutionary. Do you understand what I would normally have to do
to get to him?''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching someone thousands of miles away is a bonus offered by
the computer age. But reaching a person across the street still
involves personal contact. That's why McDonald isn't worried about
the Web and what it offers.
</P>
<P>
   It will never replace holding another person's hand in prayer,
he thinks, but it will bring additional people to God.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald said he's noticed that the anonymity of the Web
encourages people to be more open _ he recently counseled a drug
addict too ashamed to reveal his problem in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people won't go to their church but they will go to
another pastor on the Internet,'' McDonald says.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald treats his laptop like his Bible _ it's his constant
companion.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask his other companion.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I are going on a Caribbean cruise for our 25th
wedding anniversary and she made only one request,'' McDonald says,
chuckling. ``She said, `Don't bring your computer.'''

ICE-T'S TAKE ON NAPSTER, THE LAW AND MORALITY  
 A NEWS SERVICE CATERS TO NONPROFIT GROUPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oliver Stone may have an equal in the music business.
</P>
<P>
   At an industry conference in Los Angeles last Tuesday, the
rapper Ice-T, a self-described ``conspiracy theorist type of guy,''
shared his views on the recording industry and the Napster
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Records are free when on the radio, right?'' Ice-T said. The
recording companies, ``are tripping off the fact this stuff comes
through the computer clean,'' he said. ``That's the thing. When it
comes on the radio, you can tape it, I can send it to my homeboy.
But mail moves slow and the Internet moves faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Ice-T's comments had his audience of about 400 people
roaring with laughter. The gathering was the Herring on Hollywood
2000 conference, sponsored by The Red Herring, a business magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the majors do is they go into gangster techniques,''
Ice-T said, referring to the major recording labels. ``Napster will
resurface in one of these major record companies as a way to share
files. Once they figure out how to take the technology and get paid
off of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Napster, of course, is the service that lets people swap music
files over the Internet, often with little regard to copyrights.
The Recording Industry Association of America is suing Napster in
federal court in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The rapper also commented on the musicians _ including the
rapper Dr. Dre and the band Metallica _ who are suing Napster.
``Some lawyer wakes me up and says, `Man, we can get a couple of
million dollars.' And I'm like: `Sue whoever you gotta sue. Who is
Napster? What do they do?''' Ice-T said suing is for lawyers, not
artists.
</P>
<P>
   Why do so many people traffic in music they haven't paid for?
``To me,'' Ice-T said, ``you got the cops and the robbers. And to
me, I think human beings are naturally robbers. I think human
beings want it free. And that's just your nature. And if there is a
way around paying, that is what you are going to do. None of you
guys are moral enough to say I would rather pay $16 than get it
free.''

   _ LAURA M. HOLSON
</P>
<P>
   A News Service Caters to Nonprofit Groups
</P>
<P>
   When the University of California at Berkeley announced two
weeks ago that physicists had peeled the tips off carbon nanotubes
_ an advance that may assist in the development of micromachines _
major newspapers did not put the arcane news on their front pages.
But at least they knew about the development.
</P>
<P>
   The news went out to the media by way of AScribe
(www.ascribe.org), an Internet-based distributor of news releases
for universities, nonprofit organizations and foundations.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days it has carried other announcements, like the
results of a Michigan State University study about the male
children of alcoholics and a new theory from the Jet Propulsion
Center about temperature cycles in the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   If these subjects are not what most people would consider
newsworthy, that is partly the point. Because universities and
nonprofit groups often know that their news releases may have only
a narrow audience, they may be loath to spend several hundred
dollars to distribute a release over PR Newswire or Business Wire _
the two main services that corporate America relies on to
disseminate news releases.
</P>
<P>
   But by using software automation and the Internet to create a
low-cost way to distribute such releases, the founders of Ascribe _
Ron Wolf, a former business reporter, and David Irons, a former
university spokesman for Harvard and Berkeley _ are offering a
service that is meant to make ``public interest'' announcements
more accessible and affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Some 250 colleges, universities and other organizations have
signed up for the service, paying $10 to $20 a release depending on
the subscription plan. Releases are e-mailed to AScribe in Oakland,
Calif., where they are copy-edited and then sent to news
organizations and Web sites through several means, including The
Associated Press and Dow Jones Interactive.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being paid to distribute the news releases, AScribe also
receives payment each time someone downloads a release through Dow
Jones. Most of the 150 Web sites that publish the releases also pay
AScribe. The company is now trying to attract venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf, a former reporter for The San Jose Mercury News, said the
company hoped to develop relationships with thousands of
organizations that would use AScribe to publicize themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great constituency for lots of other content besides
corporate financial news,'' he said.

VITRIOL FLIES AFTER WEB SITE PUBLISHES ACCOUNT ABOUT COLUMNIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Establish a Web site with lots of links to other sites, and they
call you an aggregator.
</P>
<P>
   But Jim Romenesko, a man much noticed in his own profession
because he notices it back, has begun to reach out far beyond his
humble html beginnings. His MediaNews.org Web site is becoming an
online version of the local bar, where journalists go after hours
to argue, to announce their new jobs, to toast their friends and
denounce their enemies.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Romenesko, a journalist himself, has transformed
himself twice over.
</P>
<P>
   First he was a simple, if obsessive, aggregator who created a
site linked to other sites featuring media news or media criticism
_ offering what Sandra Mims Rowe, editor of The Portland Oregonian,
called one-stop shopping for such material.
</P>
<P>
   Then he was hired by a journalism research center, the Poynter
Institute, and, along with his links, he made a place for running
discussions, like the current give-and-take _ or bash-and-poke _
between journalists and public relations people who sometimes are
called flacks by the journalists. (The nastier themes of this
particular battle are punctuated with some gentle intermezzos, like
the observation that ``Flacks are like spouses: half the time, they
just want to be heard.'')
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he expanded his portfolio once again with the
publication of a lengthy revisionist history of the 1998
controversy involving the columnist Mike Barnicle of The Boston
Globe _ who was accused of plagiarism by the newspaper _ complete
with new details provided by Barnicle. This is a new stage in the
evolution of MediaNews.org. It is not just for links any more. And
it is not just for journalists any more.
</P>
<P>
   The article by Eugene Kennedy, who is identified as an author
and a columnist, is based on some original reporting, new documents
provided by Barnicle and a review of the record. It argues that
Barnicle was the victim of shifting standards and deeply mixed
messages from the editor of The Globe, Matthew V. Storin. (Storin
said Friday that he had followed the discussion but did not want to
comment on it or on the new direction of Romenesko's site.)
</P>
<P>
   Among the first people to send e-mail to the site after
Kennedy's article was posted was the author Norman Mailer, who
wrote: ``Despite the position of The Boston Globe, I don't think
Michael Barnicle received anything in the way of a fair or balanced
judgment. And the careful assessment in Eugene Kennedy's piece goes
just about all the way to prove it.'' The historian Doris Kearns
Goodwin and her husband, the political consultant Richard Goodwin,
wrote to call the Kennedy piece proof Barnicle was a victim of
``political correctness.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Peter Maas, a sometime collaborator with Barnicle, who
paused just a second with his nod to the ``fine Kennedy piece on
Barnicle'' before lambasting Richard Blow, a former top editor at
George magazine, over his handling of a piece by Maas and Barnicle.
Blow's response came quickly, and began, ``Has Peter Maas fallen on
his head?''
</P>
<P>
   Then things really took off. Journalists at two different
publications were claiming all or partial credit for Barnicle's
downfall. The disagreement between Blow and Maas escalated (Maas
called Blow's assertions ``fiction,'' while Blow responded that
``Peter Maas didn't like being fact-checked then, and apparently he
doesn't now.'')
</P>
<P>
   One amused bystander observed in his own posting that ``I don't
pretend to know the relationships among your correspondents about
Mike Barnicle _ they sound like they all live in the same condo and
hate each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, on any given day, vitriol can fly in any discussion
thread on any site. What sets Romenesko's site apart, beyond its
continual evolution, is the seriousness with which it is followed
among print and online journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Celia McGee, a reporter for The Daily News in New York,
announced her move from media columnist to feature writer on
Romenesko's site, and Steven Brill, the founder of Brill's Content
_ one of Romenesko's regular links _ used it as a public forum to
discuss how free-lancers should be compensated for the online
resale of their work.
</P>
<P>
   The redesign of the online magazine Salon was excoriated by
Romenesko's readers. Salon's editor, David Talbot, said in an
interview on Friday: ``On the one hand, it's a little embarrassing
to have your dramas played out that way on a bulletin board for
everyone to comment on. On the other hand, it's a useful way for
journalists to sort out these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The Barnicle article, and the attendant discussion, however,
stretched the concept of a discussion toward the breaking point. As
James Naughton, president of the Poynter Institute, explained in an
interview, ``We weren't vouching for'' Kennedy's long, long e-mail,
``but we weren't holding it out of the dialogue about a substantive
ongoing issue in journalism.''

CHANGING THE GOVERNMENT'S BUSINESS CULTURE TO MAKE UNCLE SAM A BIG

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last December, when the government was in the throes of Year
2000 anxiety, e-commerce initiatives barely crossed the minds of
many federal officials. Not that e-commerce executives particularly
cared: With their companies' stock prices climbing and much larger
markets in their sights, they could afford to look past the
government as a place to do business.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the only Year 2000 disaster has turned out to be the
stock prices of dot-com businesses, Internet executives and federal
officials are taking a much closer look at one another. Thanks in
part to the Year 2000 scare, the government is much smarter about
information technology systems and processes, and it is now
directing that knowledge to Internet purchasing efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies, meanwhile, are looking for any market that
can deliver revenue and keep their businesses afloat as the dot-com
consolidation continues. The goal is not only to sell goods to the
government to help build its e-commerce systems, but to provide
goods that government purchasing agents can buy through those same
systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet buzzcronym for this market is B2G, for business to
government, and the numbers involved are large enough to get just
about any dot-com's attention. The federal government will spend
hundreds of millions of dollars building its e-commerce systems
over the next five years, according to the Gartner Group, a
technology research firm. And as those systems improve, the
analysts say, the government should be able to move a large part of
its $260 billion in annual purchases onto the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the race to B2G. But as dot-coms have begun to chase those
dollars, they are finding that doing business with the government
frequently requires two things Internet companies lack: time and
patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, there's tremendous potential there,'' said Christopher
Baum, a Gartner Group analyst. ``But when you peer over the edge,
you start to see a lot of rocks down there. It's like cliff-diving
in Acapulco with the tide going out.''
</P>
<P>
   Baum said Washington was still far from having its computer
systems set up so that private businesses could easily integrate
their own Internet-based purchasing systems with those of the
government. Such systems, for instance, might enable a vendor to
display its catalog of office furniture on agency purchasing sites
with little need to fine-tune it for each site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not even the largest businesses can afford to set up separate
interfaces with even the biggest government agencies,'' Baum said.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, he said, the government would also streamline the
payment clearing process so that vendors on various agency Web
sites could clear payments electronically through one source,
instead of several.
</P>
<P>
   But there are several obstacles that could slow such
initiatives, analysts and government leaders said. According to a
report to be released Monday by the META Group, a technology
research and consulting firm, federal employees involved in the
government's e-commerce efforts said the biggest short-term
obstacle was lack of money.
</P>
<P>
   According to the META Group, government agencies could halve the
average cost of processing an order _ to $10 from the current $20 _
by using the Internet. But even in a time of budget surpluses,
officials said they had a difficult time persuading members of
Congress to invest in e-commerce programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of money is hard to get,'' an official said. ``If I
say, `Give me $10 million and I can save $50 million,' the benefit
of that $50 million saved doesn't necessarily accrue to the glory
of the people who make the decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   That thinking could change if either political party were to
seize on the issue as campaign fodder. But changing the business
culture within the government so that e-commerce can be adopted may
be more difficult, longtime agency officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to operate in Internet time, not Washington time,''
said David J. Barram, administrator of the General Services
Administration, which oversees the procurement of about $40 billion
in annual goods and services for federal agencies. ``But it's very
hard because people don't want to make a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thought is, `Somebody's going to get you,''' Barram
continued. ``It might be Congress. It might be a partisan attack
from another party. But the ethic is to not take risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Barram's agency was the federal government's
biggest e-commerce success. In 1996, it started an online ordering
site, GSAAdvantage.gov, which now lists more than a million items
and last year sold more than $100 million in goods to government
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Because more than 90 percent of the financing for the General
Services Administration comes from its own operations _ it collects
transaction fees from vendors who sell to the government _ Barram
said his agency's workers were somewhat less worried about having
their financing withdrawn if they made mistakes. That ethic, plus
the fact that the agency holds the purse strings to many online
federal purchases, has made it a primary target for dot-coms
wanting to get a piece of the business-to-government pie.
</P>
<P>
   One Internet company, MobShop, recently began working with the
agency's Federal Supply Service to offer so-called group purchasing
on the Buyers.gov site, which will roll out this month. In group
purchasing, suppliers offer an item for sale at a progressively
lower price as greater numbers of prospective buyers express
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Rose, MobShop's chief executive, said that even within the
General Services Administration, it could be difficult bridging
what he called the huge gulf between the culture of an Internet
company and the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge opportunity for us,'' he said, ``because the
government has the heft to do a lot of things. But there are all
sorts of processes that don't make a lot of sense that you have to
work within.''
</P>
<P>
   Those processes are even harder for an Internet company to
accept, he said, because in the current market, dot-coms do not
have unlimited resources to spend on projects that might not
generate revenue quickly. ``There is a point where everybody will
sit down and ask, `Is this worth doing?''' Rose said. ``I don't
know where that point is. It's a constant game of assessing how
best to use our resources.''
</P>
<P>
   But for those companies that can wait long enough, the benefits
can be substantial. The Dell Computer Corp., which began selling to
the government online in 1996, will sell roughly $400 million worth
of computers to federal workers on the Internet this year. Aside
from the obvious revenue increase, Dell also saves time and money
by moving these purchases online, according to Tom Buchsbaum, vice
president for federal systems at Dell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cuts the order-cycle time for us,'' Buchsbaum said, ``and
we don't have to cut a purchase order and have it processed. But it
also makes all of government available to us at the click of a
mouse, instead of having to get in a plane to D.C. to get things
together. It certainly broadens our reach.''

GIVING ONLINE AUDIENCES NEWS THEY WANT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JIM RUTENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is how Jonathan Klein, a former high-level executive at
CBS, sees the future of news:
</P>
<P>
   Viewers will click on video reports they want to see, when they
want to see them. Computerized news services will learn users'
viewing habits and offer them news bits tailored to their tastes.
Advertisers will aim at viewers based on their supposed news
preferences.
</P>
<P>
   Klein is so sure that his vision of the future is accurate that
he is staking $35 million in venture capital on a new Web site,
FeedRoom, which is to make its public debut later this month.
</P>
<P>
   FeedRoom is one of a handful of new Web sites offering users
television-style news reports on the Internet, in digestible bits
that can be put together into personalized newscasts. Yahoo has a
similar offering, as does Zatso.com, a new company from San
Francisco. Another site, called Jagfn.com, posts video reports
about financial news.
</P>
<P>
   These services are based on the new-media assumptions that
consumers want information and entertainment on demand and that
high-speed Internet connections, offered by broadband services, can
finally give it to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to watch good news, you'll watch good news; if you
like to watch crime news, you'll watch crime news,'' said Klein,
who was executive vice president of CBS News from 1995 to 1998.
``It's putting the clicker in the viewer's hand and saying, `You
decide.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in the not too distant future, Klein predicts, this new
style of newscast will replace the traditional news fare of the
major networks and local TV stations.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that prediction is an accurate one and whether it would
be a step forward or back for journalism are matters of heavy
debate in the television news industry, which is struggling to hang
on to viewers amid increased competition.
</P>
<P>
   And even if Klein is right, analysts say, it is not clear that
sites like his would be well received by people not yet accustomed
to watching anything resembling TV on computers that, for the most
part, have poor pictures and make for uncomfortable viewing.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Klein's news service is among the most ambitious
attempts yet to recreate a television news experience on the
Internet. Though the concept has been around for a while, it has
been slow to take off because of inadequacies in Internet
technology.
</P>
<P>
   And the more established news providers have been hesitant. They
are waiting to see which business models will survive and how
viewing habits will develop, once more people have broadband, or
high-speed, Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   FeedRoom, which will require users to have broadband
connections, is meant to be user friendly, with a central video
window occupying one-quarter of the computer screen (currently,
video windows occupy only about one-sixteenth). The main window is
flanked by smaller ones advertising the available reports. A
separate box offers viewers links to different types of reports
under categories like health, entertainment, finance and sports.
</P>
<P>
   The reports will be provided by local stations around the
country that have struck deals to provide video to FeedRoom, which
in return will share advertising revenue and design the stations'
individual Web pages. Last week, Klein announced two such
agreements with the NBC television station group and Tribune
Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   What stops these major media companies from doing it themselves?
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a very large, successful broadcast business that
we have to continue to run and grow,'' said Jay Ireland, president
of the NBC station group. ``These guys had a combination that
proved very valuable, and it gets us out there quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   With the NBC and Tribune deals in place, FeedRoom now has ties
to 32 TV stations that reach 45 percent of the country's television
markets. Klein said he hoped to complete similar deals with other
big television networks by the end of the year. Although no major
advertiser is signed yet, he said he had enough financing _ from
investors like Warburg Pincus, Ridgewood Capital and Intel _ to
operate for two years without ad revenue.
</P>
<P>
   But FeedRoom is designed with advertisers well in mind, and
Klein said he expected to close some deals soon. The site is
equipped with software that can identify users and, based on what
segments they tend to select, aim specific banner ads at them. The
system is also programmed to give on-screen prominence to the types
of segments an individual viewer tends to choose.
</P>
<P>
   The automatic winnowing is worrisome to many journalists and
media experts, who fear that the proliferation of personalized news
will enable viewers to filter out information that is important but
may not be sizzling entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business model might do a very good job of supporting
narrow content for things like sports or business or health,'' said
John V. Pavlik, executive director of Columbia University's Center
for New Media. ``But I'm not so confident that the business model
will support public affairs journalism. Who, exactly, is going to
be the sponsor for that type of news?''
</P>
<P>
   Some network news executives said last week that they shared
that concern, especially in light of the low TV ratings for last
week's Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has potentially enormous implications for not only how we
do our business, but also for our democracy,'' said Andrew Heyward,
president of CBS News.
</P>
<P>
   But while ``it has implications for the citizenry that might be
disturbing, that doesn't mean you can stop it,'' he added. ``This
is where the technology is heading.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, big-network news executives like Heyward seem satisfied
to sit back and monitor expensive experiments like Klein's. ``The
FeedRoom is one of what are going to be numerous experiments in the
early days of broadband,'' Heyward said. ``No one knows which is
going to prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have little research on which to base forecasts because
of the embryonic state of broadband Internet access _ whose 31
million users so far are mostly office workers and college
students, according FeedRoom's research.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not stop analysts from debating whether computer
users are ready for personalized, TV-style, online newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard to do broadband video right now,'' said David
Card, a media analyst with Jupiter Communications. ``Point one:
There aren't a lot of people who have broadband. Point two: Even in
broadband, it's not a beautiful experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein acknowledged the challenges. ``It's an enormous risk,'' he
said. ``But the rewards are enormous if this thing works.''

CLOAK, DAGGER AND MOUSE: A COLUMNIST DEFECTS TO THE WEB
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ When Hugo Dixon resigned from The Financial Times last
December to start his own Web site, heads turned both inside and
outside the newsroom. After all, Dixon had become the newspaper's
franchise columnist _ the lead writer and editor of the
much-heralded Lex column. Each day, he provided smart commentary on
the merger of the day or a company's recent earnings report.
</P>
<P>
   Even without a byline, the columnist was so well known in the
world of London finance that his departure from The Financial Times
was chronicled in most of the big national newspapers. Gossipy
items about his exit peppered the papers with almost the same
attention showered on the Spice Girls.
</P>
<P>
   But that attention turned to real rubbernecking in May, when
Dixon announced that he had effectively defected to The Financial
Times' rival, The Wall Street Journal. Dixon, 36, signed a deal to
begin publishing a daily column in September that mimics The Lex _
based on content from his new Web site, BreakingViews.com _ in The
Wall Street Journal's European edition. In addition, Dow Jones, the
Journal's parent company, took a 7 percent stake in
BreakingViews.com, which offers quick financial commentary online
about breaking-news subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon's move came as The Wall Street Journal and The Financial
Times, a unit of Pearson PLC, are in an intensifying brawl aimed at
increasing readership on each other's home turf. And the focus on
Dixon has recently become more intense because of an accusation
being privately levied by some of his former colleagues: Dixon may
have a conflict of interest because his company is being partly
financed by people and companies that he and his team of
journalists are supposed to be writing commentary about.
</P>
<P>
   In a city that is not known for objective journalism, and at a
time when media companies increasingly are financially intertwined
with the people and companies they write about, it is not clear if
the accusation is fair. Dixon acknowledges that the company's
investors include Morgan Stanley Dean Witter along with his
longtime friend, Roland Rudd, who owns Finsbury, one of the leading
financial public relations firms in London representing leading
European companies, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Dixon rebuts the criticism as simply noise. ``I myself think
it's an issue that's been blown up to be an issue, but I don't
believe it's an issue,'' he said. ``I don't know who has a 3
percent stake in New York Times or Dow Jones or in Pearson or
whatever, but I wouldn't be surprised if there was an investment
bank that did. Everyone owns stakes.'' He also said that the stakes
are ``passive'' and that neither financial backer has a seat on his
board.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Dixon has been in the limelight since he left The
Financial Times just before Christmas, taking his colleague from
the Lex column and partner, Jonathan Ford, with him to help him
start BreakingViews.com.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon says he conceived the idea for a financial-commentary Web
site more than four years ago, just after interviewing Bill Gates,
Microsoft's chairman, during a dinner with Michael Kinsley, who had
just started Slate, a political and culture Web magazine owned by
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't clear to me whether it made sense to put a political
magazine online,'' he recalls thinking. ``But in the financial
arena, where investors are trading stocks'' on a day of news
developments, he said, ``speed is essential. So it seemed to me
that financial journalism was naturally suited to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, though, in 1996, the Internet had yet to emerge in
Europe with the same force as in the United States. It was not
until last year, ``with sites like TheStreet.com going public and
money so available for ideas like this,'' he said, that he began to
consider the idea seriously. Having raised about $1 million in a
first round of financing by December, Dixon and Ford turned in
their resignations at The Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``To leave an established organization is quite a wrench,'' he
said. ``They would try to give me all these goodies, and I was
saying no with increasingly strange excuses about why I was turning
down these jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The bombshell came when he told his ex-employer that he planned
to start a Web site that would effectively be an online version of
Lex, the paper's franchise column. In what may have seemed like a
further affront to The Financial Times, he went on to be named the
British business journalist of the year for his work at the
newspaper, and he audaciously promoted BreakingViews.com at the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Then, early in May, he announced that he had raised $6.7 million
and made his syndication deal with The Wall Street Journal Europe.
The timing could not have been more important in the bruising
battle between the two business broadsheets.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal redesigned its European edition in
February to better suit readers and has been aggressively marketing
the paper across the Continent. At the same time, The Financial
Times has tried to make inroads in the United States with a $35
million advertising campaign starring Dan Aykroyd plugging its Web
site, FT.com.
</P>
<P>
   Financial Times reporters and editors have been privately
griping about Dixon's defection and his investment partners, though
none agreed to do so publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Top executives at the paper were terse. Richard Lambert, the
editor in chief, said simply, ``I don't have an opinion about it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for The Wall Street Journal, Richard J. Tofel, the Dow Jones
vice president for corporate communications, said the company is
committed to BreakingViews.com. ``In terms of financial firms
having stakes in publishers, that's nothing new,'' he said. He
pointed out that Dow Jones has a business relationship with General
Electric through CNBC and also has business interests or alliances
with Reuters and Hearst. ``Whether things are adequately disclosed
is what's important,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dixon, the Web site and the column in The Wall
Street Journal Europe will include a disclaimer if he or his staff
ever write directly about any of his investors. He said there was
no reason to put a disclaimer on articles, for example, about
clients of Morgan Stanley ``because they advise on zillions of
deals.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times operates a joint newsroom with and has an
investment stake in TheStreet.com, an online financial news and
commentary site that may compete with BreakingViews.com. The
Street.com is partly owned by James J. Cramer, the hedge fund
manager and columnist. It has policies to deal with the appearance
of conflicts, and Cramer's columns carry disclaimers when he writes
about stocks he owns.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the controversy, the reporting in BreakingViews.com does
not so far seem to have been colored by its investors' interests.
The site carried a critical column about Carlton Communications,
one of Finsbury's largest clients, which was noted in an item in
The Observer last Sunday. And when Dixon wrote a column this week
about Pearson's acquisition of National Computer Systems, it
included a disclaimer noting that Dixon had worked for the
Financial Times and that he also owned shares in Pearson.
</P>
<P>
   Still, though Dixon is used to being in public view, his
financial arrangements may expose him to a new level of scrutiny.
He does not shy away from the attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of people from the FT coming to our site,''
Dixon said, grinning.

IT TAKES A WORLD WIDE WEB TO RAISE A VILLAGE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By JOHN MARKOFF  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Overlooked in last month's Group of 8 discussions about
the challenge of a growing ``digital divide'' between the
information rich and the data deprived was the work of Bernard
Krisher, a 69-year-old former journalist who is trying to bring the
Internet to one of the poorest regions in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Krisher's nonprofit group, American Assistance
for Cambodia, has been toiling to create a permanent Internet
connection to a primary school in the village of Robib, a cluster
of six rural communities in north central Cambodia, more than a
nine-hour drive from Phnom Penh. (On Monday, the group plans to
announce that it has succeeded.)
</P>
<P>
   The Internet link is being provided at no charge by Shin
Satellite in neighboring Thailand. By placing the village directly
on the Internet, Krisher, an American who worked as an Asia
correspondent for Newsweek for decades, says he hopes to assist in
the economic transformation of a region of Cambodia in which the
average per capita income is about $37 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to providing computer education and Web access to a
village school attended by 400 students, the Internet project is
supporting the creation of a small woven-silk industry in the
village, which plans to sell silk scarves and table runners on the
Internet. Once production begins, Krisher said, it might be
possible to generate as much as $2,000 a month in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to show that the Internet can really help a
single village,'' said Krisher, whose nonprofit group is based in
Tokyo, where he lives. ``If this is copied elsewhere around the
world, it might help eliminate the digital divide.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the effort is on a small scale, Nicholas Negroponte, a
computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who
is also engaged in the effort to aid Cambodian villages, said the
project demonstrated that the global impact of the Internet could
ultimately serve to reverse the disparity between urban wealth and
rural poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Net will reverse urbanization,'' said Negroponte, director
of the MIT Media Laboratory. ``The past 150 years of development
have been one of urbanization. To be rural has meant to be poor.
The Net could bring some of the same opportunities to the rural
world and maybe even turn being rural into being rich.''
</P>
<P>
   The e-commerce effort has been created with the help of the
Hotel Okura, a luxury hotel in Tokyo that has agreed to process
credit card purchases made from the village's Web site, whose
server computer is in Phnom Penh (www.villageleap.com). The plan is
to ship the products by express mail through Cambodia's postal
service, with the intention of reaching customers anywhere on the
globe within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A number of the Robib villagers are now being trained in the
once traditional weaving skills of the region _ skills that
atrophied under the brutal reign of the dictator Pol Pot in the
1970s and the years of strife afterward, isolating the country and
disrupting traditional trade patterns.
</P>
<P>
   A satellite dish provides a continuous 64,000-bits-a-second
connection to a small group of computers in the village, which are
powered for part of each day by a small solar power system. The
hookup is also being used for a simple experiment in telemedicine
that American Assistance has organized.
</P>
<P>
   A group of doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston
has agreed to answer health-related questions from villagers via
e-mail, as well as offer general guidance on diseases like malaria
and HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not what we usually think about when we talk about
telemedicine, where a doctor may transmit an X-ray to a colleague
for a second opinion,'' Krisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the challenge of Krisher's effort lies in helping
recreate the social structure of the village, which was disrupted
by the Khmer Rouge military under Pol Pot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a nice, traditional Cambodian village,'' Krisher said.
``They had some old, dilapidated schools, and the Khmer Rouge
arrested all of the teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   Krisher's commitment to Cambodia grew out of his years as a
foreign correspondent for Newsweek. While many of the magazines'
other reporters were drawn to Vietnam alone, Krisher traveled
widely in Asia during the 1960s and 1970s. He became close with the
Indonesian leadership and through those relationships was
introduced to Prince Sihanouk of Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two men initially had a mercurial relationship,
they ultimately became good friends, and Krisher kept in touch
while the prince was in exile when the Khmer Rouge were in power.
</P>
<P>
   When Sihanouk returned to Cambodia in 1990, he asked Krisher to
help the struggling country. In 1994, Krisher founded and became
publisher of The Cambodia Daily, a small English-language newspaper
in Phnom Penh. He also raised money for and helped found the
Sihanouk Hospital of Hope, in Phnom Pehn, which is now the nation's
largest hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Krisher set up American Assistance for Cambodia in 1990, running
it with his wife, Akiko, and his daughter, Deborah Krisher-Steele.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is to construct 200 rural schools in Cambodian
villages, under a program in which donors contribute $14,000 to
build small school houses, with matching funds from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Krisher said he thought the Internet added a powerful lever to
his small village-level projects. He said he received three or four
e-mail messages from children at the Robib school each day, asking
questions about his home in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is it,'' Krisher said. ``You have to do things in a micro
way that doesn't require a vast amount of money. My basic
philosophy is to build a small sample and make it work and then
just copy that.''

<P>
   Who hasn't heard the mantra: change or perish? It's a corporate
cliche by now. And like many cliches, it happens to be true. But
so, too, is its unhappy corollary: many companies change and
perish. Change is so disruptive it can tear organizations apart.
</P>
<P>
   To change successfully, companies should stop changing all the
time. Instead, they should intersperse major initiatives among
carefully paced periods of smaller, organic change. By doing so,
overall change can be managed with an approach called dynamic
stability.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving dynamic stability is more difficult than ramming big,
hairy, audacious changes through an organization, in much the same
way that it is more difficult to end a war with negotiations than
with an atomic bomb.
</P>
<P>
   But dynamic stability has the great advantage of leaving
survivors. It allows change without fatal pain.
</P>
<P>
   Change, as it is usually orchestrated, creates initiative
overload and organizational chaos, both of which provoke strong
resistance from the people most affected.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatic change programs _ programs that have been all the rage
since the 1970s _ typically involve drastic measures as CEOs seek
to maximize growth or economic value as quickly as possible. In
dynamic stability, though, the goal is change that can be sustained
over both the short and long term.
</P>
<P>
   In its drive to become a global competitor, Finley, Kumble,
Wagner, Heine, Underberg, Manley, Myerson &AMP; Casey, a law firm based
in New York City, speedily added partners and associates throughout
the 1980s. But the firm's pace wasn't sustainable. Finley Kumble
collapsed in 1988 amid huge debts, vicious infighting and many
legal improprieties.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric, by contrast, wanted rapid change, but it also
knew when to slow down. Throughout the 1980s GE engaged in creative
_ most people would say brutal _ destruction involving massive
layoffs, restructuring and divestitures. But GE's changes in the
1990s were far less disruptive.
</P>
<P>
   GE's acquisitions in the last decade _ companies such as
Employers Reinsurance and Kidder, Peabody _ have tended to be in
areas like financial services where GE had already carved out
niches. They were thus less disruptive to the organization. By
alternating radical change with more organic modifications, Jack
Welch carefully buttressed the organization's stability, thereby
making major changes more feasible. That's dynamic stability.

   At its essence, dynamic stability is a process of continual but
relatively small change efforts that involve existing practices and
business models rather than new ones. Besides ``tinkering'' and
``kludging,'' which differ from each other mainly in scale, dynamic
stability requires that the pace of big and small changes must be
implemented at the right intervals.
</P>
<P>
   We all know a Mr. Fixit, someone who is always making things
from odd nuts and bolts. Similarly, some of the greatest change
masters _ companies such as 3M and Hewlett-Packard _ are
world-class tinkerers. They go into the corporate basement, so to
speak, where they rapidly pull together inspired solutions to
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Chemical, for example, developed Saran Wrap for an
industrial-coating application. With a little tinkering _ and a lot
of expertise in marketing and branded consumer products _ Dow
successfully aimed the product at consumers, an entirely different
market.
</P>
<P>
   Tinkering, of course, does not guarantee successful change. But
it is less costly, less destabilizing, and quicker than creative
destruction and invention.
</P>
<P>
   Kludging is tinkering, but with a college education. It takes
place on a larger scale and involves many more parts. Some parts
can come from outside a company's existing portfolio as in mergers
and acquisitions, but usually the components of a kludge are assets
lying around an organization's backyard, such as particular skill
functions or standard technologies or models.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are so large, kludges can result in the creation of
a division or an entire business. Consider the case of GKN, a
British industrial conglomerate. Starting in the early 1980s, the
organization would often land contracts and then find engineers to
staff the projects. But sometimes contracts would get postponed or
canceled, leaving engineers idle.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with this recurrent situation, GKN's units began to rent
out their idle engineers for short assignments elsewhere, pulling
them back into the organization as needed. The units started the
practice on an informal basis, but it proved so successful that GKN
created a new company, CEDU, to manage hiring out its own engineers
_ and those of other companies _ on short-term contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The change in the status quo has been almost painless. The
business model had been known in the organization for years. To
make more money from it, all GKN had to do was formalize the
practice in a new company.
</P>
<P>
   Most proponents of change management argue that you have to
change as much as you can as quickly as you can to stay ahead of
the competition. That advice is not so much wrong as
overgeneralized.
</P>
<P>
   Like individuals, organizations have different needs for change.
Those that have consistently avoided change may need to undergo
rapid, destructive change. Companies that already have been
changing rapidly face a different challenge _ they must learn to
shift down from highly destabilizing, disruptive change to
tinkering and kludging.
</P>
<P>
   One business leader who understands the value of pacing is Lou
Gerstner. At IBM and, before that, at American Express Travel
Related Services and RJR Nabisco, his initial impact was pure
creative destruction.
</P>
<P>
   In his first nine months at Travel Related Services, for
example, Gerstner began a major reorganization of the card and
traveler's check businesses, accompanied by a widespread shift of
managers across those units. A rash of new product introductions
followed quickly. The nine-month transformation was, in Gerstner's
words, like ``breaking the four-minute mile.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gerstner had a genius for knowing when it was time to rest.
He was alert to early signs of change fatigue: cynicism and
burnout. He recognized that the success of his overall change
campaign depended on the stability of the units involved, and he
was very thoughtful about how and when to intersperse the small
changes among the big.
</P>
<P>
   At Travel Related Services, no new products were launched and no
new executives were brought in from outside for 18 months after
Gerstner's initial blitz. But he tinkered constantly to prevent the
company from drifting into inertia; he played with the structure,
with the compensation system, with product offerings.
</P>
<P>
   The unthreatening nature of the interim changes allowed the
company to better absorb a second wave of product introductions and
restructurings when it arrived.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL SIDEBAR)
</P>
<P>
   FOUR OPERATING GUIDELINES
</P>
<P>
   Like many managerial practices, dynamic stability is as much art
as science. But companies that successfully tinker and kludge use
these four operating guidelines:
</P>
<P>
   REWARD SHAMELESS BORROWING: The first rule of dynamic stability
is that companies must be willing to noodle with what already
exists _ and invent from scratch only as a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   APPOINT A CHIEF MEMORY OFFICER: Only by remembering the past as
we tinker and kludge can we avoid making the same old mistakes _
and take advantage of valuable opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   TINKER AND KLUDGE INTERNALLY FIRST: Dynamic stability is much
easier to manage if you stay inside the organization. Just as the
body is more likely to reject a foreign organ than its own, an
organization has greater difficulty reconfiguring imported parts.
</P>
<P>
   HIRE GENERALISTS: A company dedicated to dynamic stability needs
generalists. Generalists are often derided as jacks-of-all-trades
and masters of none. But their range of skills lets them combine
disparate ideas, techniques, processes and cultures. In other
words, they can tinker and kludge. What's more, generalists are
typically more open-minded and less biased than specialists are.

 c.2000 Harvard Business School Publishing  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The vast Chinese market has always attracted foreign companies,
but very few have been able to capitalize on the opportunities the
country affords. That failure can be attributed in large part to
the traditional investment vehicles available to foreign companies,
all of which create complexities and conflicts that hamstring
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Now, one company, Eastman Kodak, is pioneering a new corporate
structure in China _ one that looks very similar to Western
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the uniqueness of Kodak's approach, consider how
most foreign companies operate in China. The most common corporate
structure is the joint venture, in which companies share day-to-day
operational control with a local partner. But doing so can paralyze
decision making, a fatal flaw in today's rapidly changing markets.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent, for example, has seen its share of the market for
optical-fiber transmission equipment in China slide from 70 percent
to 30 percent because it must negotiate each technological change
in a product with a local partner.
</P>
<P>
   The involvement of local partners also exacerbates the effect of
China's narrow business licenses. Because Chinese regulations
restrict companies' geographic reach as well as the range of goods
they can manufacture and distribute, realizing economies of scale
and scope is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever, for example, recently had six joint ventures in
Shanghai making soap, ice cream, skin cream and laundry detergent.
Theoretically, a foreign company could consolidate the distribution
of its various joint-venture products, but it would have to get
consent from all its Chinese partners. That seldom happens, because
the partners fear that the products from their individual joint
ventures would end up at a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid such complicated management issues, some companies have
established wholly owned foreign enterprises, so-called WOFEs, but
they, too, have limitations, among them difficulty winning
contracts and forging local alliances. China's local governments
have routinely favored state-owned enterprises over foreign
ventures, especially since 1999, when the industrial ministries in
Beijing were abolished.
</P>
<P>
   There is a better way for companies to compete in China. Since
1994, businesses have been able to register as joint-stock
companies _ a familiar corporate structure in the West. All of
China's state-owned enterprises listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen
stock exchanges have adopted this structure. But so far, only one
foreign multinational has taken this route: Eastman Kodak.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak's joint-stock companies, which I call foreign investor
shareholding corporations, or FISCs, have allowed the company to
achieve a high degree of operational control. The FISCs eliminate
the trade-off between management control and market access by
granting local partners minority stakes in return for their
business assets, such as factories and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Because local partners lose direct ownership of those assets,
they can be excluded from the day-to-day management. But as part
owners, they remain interested in helping the FISCs perform, which
motivates them to help the venture secure access to the markets.
</P>
<P>
   The FISC structure also mitigates the economic impact of narrow
business licenses. For example, Kodak doesn't have to get its local
partners' consent to consolidate distribution of products from its
different operations.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Kodak has created two FISCs: Kodak (China), in which it
holds an 80 percent share, and Kodak (Wuxi), in which it holds a 70
percent share.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak (China) purchased the assets of two domestic photofilm
manufacturers, Xiamen Fuda and Shantou Era, in return for 10
percent stakes and the right to appoint one board member each;
Kodak named the remaining eight directors. Because there must be at
least five shareholders, the Guangdong and Fujian international
trust and investment corporations also took nominal stakes in Kodak
(China). For its part, Kodak put up $380 million in cash. Kodak
(Wuxi) worked out a similar arrangement with different
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear why the shareholding structure works for Kodak. But
it's important to realize that it works for China as well. It gives
Chinese authorities a face-saving way to allow industrial reform
through the back door.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the photo industry had been almost entirely closed
off to foreign corporations because the government wanted to
develop a domestic photofilm industry. Foreign companies such as
Kodak were restricted to licensing agreements or direct imports,
which attracted heavy duties. But domestic manufacturers could not
keep up with the industry's rapid technological innovations, and
all but one were technically bankrupt by the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak's proposal to create FISCs was therefore considered a good
solution by Beijing authorities. No less than five central
government organizations, including three ministries, cooperated
with Kodak.
</P>
<P>
   China's State Development Planning Commission, which had been
involved in creating Kodak's FISCs, last year released a research
report supporting the ``Kodak model.'' And, in theory, the
regulatory framework already lets foreign corporations convert
existing joint ventures and WOFEs into FISCs, provided they have
been profitable for three years.
</P>
<P>
   If foreign corporations move in this direction on their own, it
will save Chinese authorities from having to embark on a wholesale
restructuring of the legal infrastructure of business.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the FISCs are well placed to obtain quick listings
on the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock exchanges, making it easier for
them to raise new capital. For all these reasons, many companies
will probably follow Kodak's lead.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Stephen Riggio remembers telling executives at Barnes &AMP; Noble
that the Internet was the future of bookselling in 1994, before
Amazon.com had even begun. But he has never gotten much credit for
it. By the time he founded Barnesandnoble.com, in 1997, Barnes &AMP;
Noble had become watchwords for letting an Internet upstart eat
your lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Last week should have been heartening. Amazon.com lost its
president, missed its revenue projections and saw its stock plummet
amid doubt of its ability to branch into new markets. One Lehman
Brothers analyst even questioned how long the company would be able
to pay its bills.
</P>
<P>
   But Barnesandnoble.com (www.bn.com) suffered, too. The company
reported a wider-than-expected loss and missed its own revenue
target by more than 14 percent, a sign to some analysts of a
growing saturation of demand for books from people already online.
Investors sent its stock tumbling more than 25 percent to close on
Friday at $3.75 a share, down from a 52-week high last fall of
$23.50 a share.
</P>
<P>
   This week should come as a welcome relief from all the bad news
for Riggio, brother of Barnes &AMP; Noble's founder Leonard Riggio and
acting chief executive of its online spinoff. He will enjoy a novel
role reversal. Now it is his turn to play the new media visionary.
</P>
<P>
   Barnesandnoble.com is teaming up with Microsoft on Tuesday to
open the first major online store selling digital books, available
for downloading and reading on a screen or in single paperback
copies printed on demand on high-speed presses _ a technological
capacity that Amazon.com does not yet have.
</P>
<P>
   The launch is a pivotal event for the company and a bellwether
for the industry. Although many consider the idea of reading on a
screen awkward and far-fetched, some publishers hope that
electronic books will provide a new avenue of growth in an
otherwise nearly flat business, just as first paperbacks and then
audio books did in the past. As the first major outlet for digital
books, the new store will assay the depth of consumer demand, the
prices readers are willing to pay and the danger of piracy and
hacking. For Barnesandnoble.com, analysts say, selling digital
books could some day hold out the potential for new, more
profitable sales within the company's traditional franchise _
books.
</P>
<P>
   Partly for that reason, Riggio has been pushing the e-book idea
for years, according to current and former employees. One of
Riggio's first directives when he resumed Barnesandnoble.com's
day-to-day management in January, long before the idea took off
with publishers, was to install a tab for electronic books on its
home page.
</P>
<P>
   The digital-book store is a big bet for a small company,
considering that no one yet knows the size of the potential demand.
To build its presence in the digital book market,
Barnesandnoble.com invested $20 million in MightyWords, which
publishes short digital books. The company spent undisclosed
millions more on technology for downloading electronic books,
providing storage space and processing payments.
</P>
<P>
   For its part on Tuesday, Microsoft will introduce the latest
version of its free software for reading on screens. The new
edition is easier to use than its predecessors and is available for
desktops and laptops as well as expensive hand-held devices.
Microsoft executives say that no skeleton-key code-breaker will be
able to open all of the electronic books available for its
software, but no single electronic book is fully hacker-proof.
</P>
<P>
   The dual launch offers Barnesandnoble.com a chance to benefit
from Microsoft's formidable marketing strength. Microsoft is
backing the new venture with a sizable campaign, and in the process
promoting Barnesandnoble.com. In an unusual boon to authors and
publishers accustomed to begging for attention, Microsoft is
actually paying some of them for the right to advertise their books
with its software. Microsoft, in turn, hopes to make its money in
the form of a small commission on each sale of a digital book for
its software.
</P>
<P>
   Barnesandnoble.com and Microsoft did not disclose the terms of
their agreement. Microsoft expects to work with other Web sites,
and Barnesandnoble.com will continue selling books in other
electronic formats.
</P>
<P>
   The site will begin with more than 2,000 digital titles
available in the Microsoft format, adding about 150 new titles a
week. In addition to selling electronic books, Barnesandnoble.com
hopes to use them to keep its customers coming back, another area
where the company has lagged behind Amazon.com. The company will
offer virtual shelf space to customers, by investing in computer
servers that will store shoppers' digital books online. Customers
can download the same title to the same one or two computers as
often as they like, easing the need to store the electronic texts
on their hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   The digital-book store also sets the stage for a new battle with
publishers. Riggio said the company planned to expand its
long-standing publishing program into digital books. ``Publishers
really add very little value to the distribution of book content,''
he said. ``They are not terribly good at physical book
distribution, and they are not very good at technology. They will
have a place in the digital world, but smaller than it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble, which holds a large stake in the online unit,
previously published its own editions of books in the public
domain, like ``Leaves of Grass'' or ``Middlemarch.'' But now
Barnesandnoble.com has hired a respected former illustrated book
publisher, Michael Fragnito, who has begun meeting with agents to
discuss buying the digital rights to previously published works
still under copyright.
</P>
<P>
   That puts Barnesandnoble.com into direct competition with
traditional publishers, its major suppliers, who are themselves now
scrambling to acquire the digital rights to their authors' back
lists. As Chris MacAskill, MightyWords' chief executive, discovered
when he published some authors' short essays, traditional
publishers can be quite territorial. ``Publishers get very, very
jumpy about digital rights,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Riggio says the digital rights originally belong to the
author, not the publisher. ``We strongly believe that the author is
entitled to a very big share of the savings that results from the
distribution of digital content,'' he said. What royalty rate
Barnesandnoble.com will offer for digital rights to previously
published titles remains to be set, Riggio said.
</P>
<P>
   He maintains that, in time, Barnesandnoble.com will flourish in
the online world because most of its products _ books, videos and
music _ can be delivered over the Internet. To promote its
products, he says, the site is already becoming an online
broadcaster. Barnesandnoble.com began a network for 16 online radio
stations, soon expanding to 120, along with online video
programming about authors and books, BNTV.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, some analysts say Barnesandnoble.com's most
promising innovation may be more low-technology delivery
techniques, particularly its same-day delivery program. In
Manhattan, any order before 11 a.m. is delivered by 7 p.m., at no
extra charge, by a fleet of Barnesandnoble.com trucks and
messengers. Riggio says the company is evaluating similar services
in other cities. Barnesandnoble.com also lets people return online
purchases at Barnes &AMP; Noble stores. (Until recently, it was even
possible to receive a refund greater than the online price.)
</P>
<P>
   But, although most analysts support Barnesandnoble.com's
investment in electronic books on the chance of a payoff years down
the road, few expect it to help the company's sagging stock price
any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by the low share price, rumors have spread through the
industry that Bertelsmann was seeking to buy the online bookstore
outright. Flush with cash from selling a stake in America Online,
Bertelsmann has been buying up struggling Internet retailers to
build an Internet commerce empire under its own brand. Bertelsmann
executives have pointedly declined to comment on the question.
</P>
<P>
   Riggio, too, declined to comment on any talks, except to say
that ``we talk to them about all kinds of things.'' Both Barnes &AMP;
Noble and Bertelsmann are ``committed to the business,'' he said.
The online store expects to begin making a profit in 2002, and
analysts say its profits could help Barnes &AMP; Noble bolster its own
sagging shares. In the meantime, Riggio says, Barnesandnoble.com
has over $350 million in cash and no debt _ plenty of capital to
stay in business till the company turns a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Riggio has a long way to go to restore Wall Street's
faith in the company. For one thing, some say that, after more than
doubling from one year to the next, the days of explosive growth in
online bookselling are over. People already online seem to be
buying as many books online as ever they will, said Mark Rowen,
Internet analyst at Prudential Securities. As a result, he says,
growth in the online book market is slowing significantly, to about
the rate that new consumers hook up to the Internet or a little
faster _ about 20 percent to 25 percent a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Noto, analyst at Goldman Sachs, said Barnesandnoble.com
faced an uphill battle because it was locked into marketing
agreements with other companies like AOL, limiting its ability to
cut costs when revenue declines. Worse, he said, Barnesandnoble.com
thus far has failed to take advantage of Barnes &AMP; Noble's 544
retail stores to win new customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You expect their customer acquisition costs to be lower than
pure Internet companies, and, the bottom line is, they still are
higher than Amazon's,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, Noto said, is motivational. The online
store threatens to steal sales from the retail stores, and, except
for the Riggios, Barnes &AMP; Noble executives have no incentive to
work together. Others blame a lack of stable management. Riggio
assumed the title of acting chief executive seven months ago, and
the company still has no replacement.
</P>
<P>
   But Riggio said that the analysts were ``very wrong.'' ``I don't
know the analyst who has been inside the company or met with its
management,'' he said, calling his management team ``one of the
most stable in the sector.'' Cooperation between the chain and the
online store, he insisted, was coming along fine. He declined to
name specifics but promised ``exciting things in the next six
months.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicted the company's marketing costs would decline, too.
Heavy spending to advertise in print, radio and television is
``behind us now,'' he said, and the company could use its access to
Barnes &AMP; Noble stores to strike advantageous marketing deals, like
its agreement with America Online. ````We'll be around in 10 years,
or 20 years. People are more motivated to work with us now than
with companies in the Wild West shootout that had been the
Internet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for hiring a new chief executive, Riggio said, his day-to-day
management ensured continuity and the board would make a decision
in due time. ``I am among the candidates being considered,'' he
said.

   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ For some kids, summer comes
lurching to a halt like a dusty station wagon on its last drop of
fuel. For my kids, this summer will scream to a halt like a super

 &HT;    Clinton takes one for the Gore team
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Some Republicans seemed surprised when Bill
Clinton poked fun at the Bush dynasty during the Republican
National Convention last week. Some thought the outgoing Democratic
President had screwed up, shot off his mouth, walked on Al Gore's
effort to stefor the love and support, but stay cool. `` The truth
of the matter is, if President Clinton wants to continue doing
that, that's fine by me,'' Bush said he told his dad. It's good
because Clinton ``lives by polls and focus groups, and he's
reacting to what he sees.''
</P>
<P>
   But what if the last part of Bush's statement _ that Clinton is
hard-wired to pollsters _ is correct? What if Clinton's slap was a
carefully calculated move to draw out the elder Bush _ to
underscore to voters that George W. is a child of privilege who
pulled himself up by his wealthy father's boot straps?
</P>
<P>
   What if it's part of a plan by Gore-Clinton to remind voters of
the huge deficits and gargantuan national debt rung up during the
Bush-Reagan years _ that Daddy's Oldsmobile had a flat?
</P>
<P>
   Could it be a planned strategy to re-heat the charge
Clinton-Gore made in 1996 _ that the Republican ticket, now of the
former president's son and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, is ``a
bridge to the past,'' while Democrats represent ``a bridge to the
21st Century?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The mistake they made is they posited themselves in the
past,'' said Rahm Emanuel, an adviser to both Clinton and Gore.
``And that's from the moment of the Cheney selection forward. The
thematic of the campaign is future vs. past.''
</P>
<P>
   So the president uses his constant podium to not only step on
the kick-off of the Bush feel-good convention (New York Daily News
headline: ``Poppy to Bubba: Lay off my boy'') _ but successfully
draws out the man Gore-Clinton hope to portray as the
revenge-driven puppeteer and ventriloquist.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore-Clinton camp certainly recalls that Poppy's comment in
New Hampshire last February, lauding ``this boy of mine,'' probably
contributed to Bush's loss in the primary there to John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gore spokesman Chris Lehane tipped the campaign's hand.
``It tells you something about George Jr.,'' Lehane said. ``He has
to send his father out to defend him.''
</P>
<P>
   While still en route to the convention, the younger Bush had
said ``It's amazing to me that the president of the United States
would spend time trying to be a political pundit.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazing? Perhaps. Stupid? Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   But it will be interesting to see the effect it has on the
Bushes to have sand kicked in their faces by the guy who, with the
possible exception of Ross Perot, they like the least of anyone in
the world.

 &HT;    Who says summer's a bore?
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ For some kids, summer comes lurching to a halt
like a dusty station wagon on its last drop of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   For my kids, this summer will scream to a halt like a super
jetliner without landing gear.
</P>
<P>
   Such will be the pace at which summer vacation slams to a close
that Mom won't need to order the boys' hair slicked back on Day 1
of school.
</P>
<P>
   The G-forces of re-entry will have done it.
</P>
<P>
   In our house this has been two summers _ one experienced by a
17-year-old on a creative binge, one by a just-turned 13-year-old
who, with a friend, has wrung every day of its sweaty,
back-to-basics potential.
</P>
<P>
   Little brother Rob and his friend Matt didn't raft the
Mississippi exactly, but they did everything else in the good
old-fashioned way: under the sun, out among the bushes and burs, in
the mud (artificially fashioned in the back yard, that is),
anywhere but in the house. Hallelujah.
</P>
<P>
   Big brother Michael took the proverbial candle, burned both
ends, reduced it to a puddle, stuck another wick in it, burned both
ends and repeated the procedure. In other words, he extracted more
waking hours out of summer than I thought possible of a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Running directly counter to the preconception (mine) that the
essence of the perfect teen summer is long and luxurious sleep, he
made two most unusual vows at the start of vacation:
</P>
<P>
   (1) He would awake before sunrise every day and photograph it.
</P>
<P>
   (2) He would photograph each sunset.
</P>
<P>
   In between he had a part-time job, took tae kwon do, read
``Atlas Shrugged'' and wrote and recorded music with a friend.
</P>
<P>
   SLEEP, ANYONE?
</P>
<P>
   Two summers ago I constructed on this page what I believed to be
the ultimate fantasy camp for ages 14 to 16. It is called Camp
Coma.
</P>
<P>
   It dispenses with swimming, woodworking, crafts, campfires, all
that buzz. What Camp Coma offers is sleep, 24 hours a day if
desired, in specially insulated sleep capsules deep in Cleveland's
sewer system. (No need for scenery at Camp Coma.)
</P>
<P>
   How about it, son? Well, go figure. This year my eldest not only
got up before dawn every morning, but did so specifically for the
scenery.
</P>
<P>
   The alarm clock would sound. He would grab the camera. He would
find a spot outside to catch the new day arriving.
</P>
<P>
   Two and a half months ago he had only the most cursory
understanding of a camera. He's still a beginner. But now he's
figuring things out.
</P>
<P>
   Of the many sunsets and sunrises photographed, some with too-low
light, too unsteady a hand, a few looked like the inside of a
closet or a camera being tossed off the falls. But take away a few
discards, and you had some stunners, a cumulative portrait of the
beauty beyond our shutters every morning, every night.
</P>
<P>
   A DAY SEIZED
</P>
<P>
   As for the younger one in our house, the tan will attest to the
milking of daylight for all it's worth. From soggy jump-fests on
the trampoline while wrestling a water hose like a live anaconda,
to too-long days at the West pool and at the little slice of park
in Beverly Hills, to countless other outdoor excuses, he has
maxed-out on daylight.
</P>
<P>
   To this, we must credit two inanimate partners: a bicycle and
that park, where he met his pal and found a world far more
fascinating that anything Nintendo or Nickelodeon can conjure.
</P>
<P>
   As one who never found summer boring enough to ever want it to
end, I cringe to hear it so portrayed.
</P>
<P>
   It's a big, wide, captivating world, and there's an awful lot of
time in a day to enjoy it, even if you sleep until noon.

E-MAIL SPARKS GROWING INTEREST IN NEW INVENTIONS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By SABRA CHARTRAND  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Electronic mail has become ubiquitous, so it comes as no
surprise that independent inventors, as well as advertisers,
consumer electronic and telecommunications companies, are working
on new ways to exploit this form of communication.
</P>
<P>
   _ Anyone who has ever lost a cell phone, personal digital
organizer or a laptop knows how it feels to mislay a device that
may contain critical personal or professional information. The
feeling is even worse if the device is stolen. Now a Japanese
inventor has capitalized on wireless technology to patent a method
of sending an e-mail to a lost or stolen device that will lock the
appliance or erase the data it holds.
</P>
<P>
   Mikio Hasebe, of Gyoda, Japan, has developed a system in which
the owner of a wireless-enabled device such as a laptop chooses a
password and a security response in case anything should happen to
the computer. If the laptop is stolen or mislaid, the owner can
write the password in the subject line of an e-mail and send it to
the device. Assuming the computer is operating, or when it is
turned on, software in the laptop would then initiate a
pre-determined security response, either locking the display screen
so nothing would appear, showing only the name and contact
information of the owner, or erasing the laptop's hard drive. Mikio
Hasebe won patent 5,987,609 for Kabushiki Kaisha Toshiba, in
Kawasaki, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Some people write e-mails online, while others write messages
and then log on to send them. Advertisers want to reach both types
of Internet users, and now a New York inventor has won a patent for
Juno Online Services LP that would ensure that banner
advertisements and other kinds of online ads would run even when a
message writer was not online.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Moraes, of Forest Hills, N.Y., created a system in which
advertising is downloaded through an e-mail server when a
subscriber is online. Later, when the subscriber uses his computer
to write e-mails, the commercials that are stored on his system
flash across his screen. Moraes recommends in his patent that the
ads be targeted to the individual and changed frequently. When the
subscriber logs on to send e-mail and retrieve new messages, the
e-mail server would update the advertisements according to a
pre-determined distribution schedule. The next time the user writes
an e-mail, the ads that have already appeared on his screen will
have been replaced with new ones. Moraes won patent 6,014,502.
</P>
<P>
   Many people receive e-mails with breathless subject lines like
``Available now, millions of CDs!'' ``Make money from home,'' or
``Get Viagra online!'' Most avoid opening such unsolicited
promotional e-mail, lest they find their names added to even more
junk e-mail lists. But two Japanese inventors, Akira Kamakura and
Hideki Tanaka, have patented a method of encouraging people to read
and to reply to their junk mail. Their idea is to award bonus
points for each answered message. Each piece of junk e-mail would
contain an offer of bonus points, and when the recipient replied to
the pitch, a database system would transfer points to their name.
The bonus points accumulate, and eventually the junk e-mail
recipient can redeem them for gifts. The invention belongs to
Fujitsu Limited, in Kawasaki, Japan, and the inventors received
patent 6,076,101.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people would probably say that the best e-mail
enhancement they could imagine would be a way to eliminate junk
e-mail altogether. A new patent awarded to a San Francisco
inventor, Sunil Paul, aims to do that by screening out unsolicited
mass promotions. An e-mail address that serves as a probe is
planted along a communications network so that it gets picked up
and included in mass junk electronic mailings _ the sizeable ones
known as spam. The probe's e-mail boxes are monitored in a control
center to look for incoming spam.
</P>
<P>
   When unsolicited e-mail is found, the system analyzes its origin
and creates a signal that informs Internet servers of the spam
source. The alert is then forwarded to network servers and user
terminals, where filters store the information and then use it to
vet e-mail from the spam source. Junk e-mails can either be
rejected, delivered but flagged as ``JUNK,'' or processed under
special instructions from the addressee. Paul received patent
6,052,709.
</P>
<P>
   Attachments often accompany e-mail, and many times people find
themselves trying to read a document that is not formatted with
compatible software. Converting attachments is often
time-consuming, and sometimes impossible if the recipient doesn't
have the right programs. Three inventors for Siemens Information
and Communications Networks Inc., in Boca Raton, Fla, have won a
patent for a system that translates the file format of attachments
before sending them to the recipient.
</P>
<P>
   To use the system, a customer would register the format
capabilities of his or her computer with a local or remote Internet
service provider. When an e-mail with an attachment is directed
through the service provider to the customer, the system first
compares the attachment's format to the capabilities of the
computer to which it is destined. If it sees that the computer
can't perform the conversion, it will do it instead. The inventors,
Shmuel Shaffer, William Beyda and Paul Bonomo, received patent
6,092,114.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail devotees like to know whether they have new messages even
when they are not online. Dan Kikinis, of Saratoga, Calif., won a
patent for DataLink Systems, Corp. in San Diego for a paging system
embedded in a computer keyboard. When an e-mail is received but the
recipient is not online, the server matches the e-mail address to a
dial-up paging service. A page is sent to a telephone number that
results in an alert such as a flashing light on the keyboard, or
instructions to the computer to automatically log on and download
the e-mail. Kikinis received patent 6,085,232.
</P>
<P>
   At the AT&AMP;T Corp. in New York, five inventors have combined
voice and e-mail in a patented system that allows subscribers to
get both just by looking in their e-mail box. The system converts
voice mail into e-mail. The system then converts the voice message
into text or a .wav file, formats either one as an e-mail and sends
it to the recipient. Sanjay Agraharam, Lee Begeja, Carroll
Creswell, Ram Ramamurthy and Sandeep Sibal received patent
6,085,231.

 &HT;    Futuristic space wars not captivating
 &HT;    By Yusuf Davis
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As the sequel to ``Imperium Galactica,'' ``IG2'' is an
epic, real-time strategy game that is so big it takes four CDs to
hold all the empire-building, intergalactic warfare and
interstellar game play.
</P>
<P>
   With three main story lines and numerous missions and subplots,
players have almost as many options as features in this massive
program. Each story takes several hours to play, and each provides
a different challenge and approach to the game. A number of the
missions are randomly generated, ensuring that the same game is
never played twice.
</P>
<P>
   All these intricacies and choices were lost on reviewer Jim
Wilson, 17, who said he plays a lot of different types of games on
several different platforms. He called ``IG2'' ``interesting but
not much of an attention-grabber.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got a lot of features and optional stuff, but that's
what's wrong with it,'' said Jim, who tried the game enough times
to not like it very much. ``They tried to do too many things and
didn't make any one thing all that great.''
</P>
<P>
   ``IG2'' takes place in the 26th century, when gamers control a
huge and intricate galaxy. They can discover, colonize or conquer
new planets or research and develop newer, faster spacecraft and
more powerful weapons. No matter what path gamers choose, they must
engage well-armed enemies in distant space to defend their colonies
from alien attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Though artillery battles and firefights are a mainstay of this
program, there are several subplots that test a player's skills and
strategy-forming powers, such as establishing diplomatic channels
with several weird alien races, or sending spies to infiltrate
alien governments to steal their secret technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fighting was pretty cool, and I tried to get into the
spying thing a little more, but after a while, I lost interest,''
Jim said.
</P>
<P>
   Though real-time strategy games are generally his favorite, Jim
said there was something about this game that he ``just couldn't
get into.'' He conceded that others might find it entertaining, but
he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sound and graphics are good and it has a few other good
qualities, but overall I didn't like it all that much,'' said Jim.
``If this is supposed to be an upgrade and an improvement, I'm not
sorry I missed the original.''

 &HT;    SUV problems stem mostly from drivers
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Are sport-utility vehicles safe?
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is considering testing them because of
reported cases of rollovers. Recent questions have arisen about the
tires that many of them roll on.
</P>
<P>
   I believe that SUVs are not inherently unsafe, but for the past
six months I have made a conscious effort to watch the way in which
they are driven. That could be the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Most drivers do not make necessary adjustments to their driving
style or habits according to their vehicle. Unfortunately, SUV
drivers seem to be the biggest offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, you can't expect to drive a ``school bus'' the same
way that you would a sports car. But I see SUV drivers attempting
to do just that all the time.
</P>
<P>
   The perception that sport-utilities provide lots of protection
because they provide lots of structure around the occupants is
true. But they have one big handicap, their center of gravity. A
vehicle's center of gravity may not be a driver's top concern, but
it is one of the most important characteristics in the handling of
any vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   You may have seen road signs warning 18-wheelers to slow down on
curves because the vehicle could tilt over. While not as vulnerable
as an 18-wheeler, an SUV has a similar problem because of its
height.
</P>
<P>
   When people build race cars, one of the first things they design
into that vehicle is a low center of gravity. The center of gravity
is the point on which the weight of the vehicle rotates.
</P>
<P>
   Look at a Chevrolet Corvette. The rocker panels seem to be
almost on the ground. It has a very low center of gravity. It's
supposed to; it's a sports car. It is designed to go around corners
quickly and easily.
</P>
<P>
   Then look at any sport-utility. Its rocker panels can be a foot
or more off the ground. The center of gravity is much farther off
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford Expedition and Chevy Suburban are both substantial,
sizable vehicles, and either would make me feel well-protected. But
I wouldn't expect either to stop either one in as short a distance
as a Taurus or an Impala.
</P>
<P>
   It's simply a function of mass in motion. You can't stop 4,000
pounds of SUV in the same distance that you can stop a 3,000-pound
sedan, yet I see SUV drivers riding right on the bumper of the
vehicle in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   Another contributing factor to an SUV's limits is its tires. By
design these vehicles have what I like to term ``compromise
tires.'' They are designed to be functional in both on-road and
off-road situations.
</P>
<P>
   This dual purpose means that they do not provide the ultimate
traction capabilities of a highway-only tire. They can't. They
never would survive in off-road situations.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the tires on an SUV. They are big, leading to the
assumption that they provide greater traction in all situations.
They don't. The tread pattern typically has big wide spacings so
that rocks and mud are self-cleaned from the tire surface. It also
means that the total contact area of an SUV tire, compared with a
highway tire, is smaller. Less contact, less traction.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that SUV tires are made with a much harder
compound than a highway tire. If you are planning to drive
off-road, you need a puncture-resistant tire.
</P>
<P>
   The Corvette comes equipped with Z-rated tires. That means they
have a very soft compound. Will they last a long time? Probably
not, but they will stick like glue to the road surface. The softer
the compound, the better the adhesion.
</P>
<P>
   Reality is that it is drivers' responsibility to know the
abilities and limitations of their vehicle and to make adjustment
to their driving styles if they expect the vehicle to perform
safely in all situations.

 &HT;    By Nora Carter

   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``We recently purchased a 1998 Taurus with 39,000 miles on it
from a local dealership that specializes in late model used cars.
</P>
<P>
   Within the first 30 days, we noticed a strange sound that we
thought might be coming from the engine. We took it back to their
service facility, where the technician assured us that the engine
sounded normal.
</P>
<P>
   Well, two months later the sound was getting worse, so we took
it to a Ford dealership. They informed us that the front hub
bearings showed rust and needed to be replaced. We opted not to
have the repairs done until we investigated the problem further.
</P>
<P>
   We have been told that the bearings are sealed and should last
for the life of the vehicle. We have also been on the Internet
NHTSA site and have contacted Ford customer relations. There is no
recall on the bearings.
</P>
<P>
   Ford advised us to return to the dealership that sold us the car
to negotiate the repair, which we did. Although the operations
manager is willing to work with us and not charge ``full retail''
to replace the hub bearings, we feel that we should not have to
bear any of the expense of the repair.
</P>
<P>
   My daughter is continuing to drive this vehicle while we are
deciding what to do.
</P>
<P>
   _ Michelle Elam
</P>
<P>
   A: Stop! Get your daughter out of that car until it is repaired.
</P>
<P>
   The hub bearing is directly connected to the drive axle, brake
rotor and front wheel. Failure of the bearing could cause loss of
vehicle control at worst, and will certainly cause additional
damage to components and leave her stranded, at best.
</P>
<P>
   Hub bearings don't last for the life of the car, sealed or
otherwise. They should not have failed at 40,000 miles, but unless
you buy a used car from the original owner who has documented and
kept records of every service and repair, most used cars' previous
lives are uncertain. Perhaps the former owner had changed the
factory wheels or drove through a lot of water or constantly rode
the brakes.
</P>
<P>
   The dealership you purchased the Taurus from has a good
reputation in that it performs extensive inspections of all
vehicles before they are considered for sale.
</P>
<P>
   An abnormally noisy hub bearing should have been detected on a
test drive. It may have been overlooked during the visual
inspection because parts not customarily removed would have needed
to have been to see the rust.
</P>
<P>
   As much as it would be nice to be able to point the finger at
someone, I'm not certain there is any definite blame. Depending on
the severity of the noise when you bought the car, the problem
could have been overlooked by even the most astute mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   When you are plunking down a large sum of money for any used
car, it is always advisable to have the vehicle inspected by an
independent mechanic, but even that isn't foolproof.
</P>
<P>
   If your dealer is willing to work with you on the repair, what
we commonly refer to as a ``goodwill adjustment,'' I'd get it in
writing and probably take it. If your daughter does additional
damage to the car as a result of not having the hub bearing
repaired, you will incur hundreds of dollars in expense that will
not and should not be covered.
</P>
<P>
   There are no guarantees, especially with used cars. I have been
blessed with good ones and cursed with bad ones. A good long test
drive and a second mechanical opinion before you sign on the line
is often your best defense.

 &HT;    New Dreamcast titles have promise
 &HT;    By Troy Oxford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sega Dreamcast owners probably saved some money on
games the last few months. Besides the much sought after ``Virtua
Tennis,'' Capcom's ``Marvel vs. Capcom 2'' and the sleeper hit
``Wacky Races,'' the games of late June and July weren't that
spectacular. August, however, will be a different story.
</P>
<P>
   As the Oct. 26 launch of the PlayStation 2 draws closer, gamers
are going to see some very impressive Dreamcast titles as a prelude
to the game console competition.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the titles to look forward to this month:
</P>
<P>
   ``Seaman'' (coming Wednesday): A one-of-a-kind title from Sega,
``Seaman'' redefines the virtual pet. With the addition of a
microphone peripheral, you raise, nurture or abuse a wisecracking
fish/man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Fighter'' (Wednesday): With various deep-sea vehicles and
interesting missions, this underwater title from Ubi Soft looks
promising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ecco the Dolphin'' (Aug. 16): Another aquatic adventure game,
``Ecco the Dolphin'' looks amazing. The undersea world, marine life
and visual effects represent some of the best graphics on the
Dreamcast yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``WWF Royal Rumble'' (Aug. 17): All of your favorite WWF
superstars clobber away in this good-looking wrestling game. With
nine possible wrestlers in the ring at once, this looks like it
will be a smackdown good time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Test Drive V-Rally'' (Aug. 23): This off-road racing title
from Infogrames looks very cool. The game features a big selection
of cars, more than 80 tracks and game play in 12 countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimate Fighting Championship'' (Aug. 30): From the
developers of ``Tony Hawk Pro Skater'' for the Dreamcast comes this
intense fighting simulator. The game features a unique fighting
system, an array of moves and beautifully crafted 3-D models.

 &HT;    Wheels provide games an authenic feel
 &HT;    By Troy Oxford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Racing games are as popular as ever on the video game
console.
</P>
<P>
   From ``Gran Turismo 2'' for the PlayStation to the Dreamcast hit
``Crazy Taxi,'' each platform has a plethora of titles that put you
behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   The `me, but racing game enthusiasts probably want a more
authentic feel.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, there are a couple of great racing controls available.
The Interact Concept 4 Racing Wheel and the Mad Catz MC2 Racing
Wheel offer the most natural driving experiences for the Sony
PlayStation and Sega Dreamcast.
</P>
<P>
   Both controls consist of a steering wheel, a set of optional
pedals for braking and acceleration, and vibration feedback.
Despite the similarities, there are quite a few distinguishable
features between these products.
</P>
<P>
   Although both wheels can be placed in your lap or mounted to a
flat surface with suction cups, the Mad Catz wheel offered a little
more comfort and stability with its wide contoured base with
optional straps. The narrower flat base of the Interact controller
was fine when attached to a tabletop but was a little awkward in my
lap.
</P>
<P>
   Both controls look cool and sleek as far as design, but the Mad
Catz controls seem a little lighter and less rugged than the
heavier Interact controls. For instance, the control levers of the
Interact wheel are metal but the Mad Catz levers are plastic.
</P>
<P>
   The true test, however, is control, and both wheels performed
exceptionally. The custom calibration allows you to fine-tune your
steering style. Whether your steering movements are subtle tugs or
sweeping arcs, they can be programmed into the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   One feature that Mad Catz included was a two-position shifter
attached alongside the steering wheel. This is an invaluable
addition that makes it a little more comfortable and intuitive
while controlling a vehicle with a manual transmission.
</P>
<P>
   If the idea of a steering wheel seems a little cumbersome but
you still want an alternative to the standard controller, there is
the Mad Catz Hand Held Racing Wheel for the PlayStation. Although
it looks like some sort of alien weapon, it is surprisingly
comfortable and performs well for most racing games.
</P>
<P>
   Also for the PlayStation is the JogCon by Namco. The hand-held
controller is a perfect hybrid of steering wheel and standard
controller. The vehicle movement is controlled by a motorized
steering dial in the center of the unit. If a sharp turn is handled
at an excessive speed, the wheel realistically tightens and resists
movement. It's a great device to learn how to brake properly for
turns.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the JogCon, however, is that it currently works
only with Namco's racing title ``Ridge Racer 4.'' It will be
supported by ``Ridge Racer 5'' for the PlayStation 2 this fall, but
if you don't plan to pick up either title, it may not have much
value.

 &HT;    A mouse you'll want around the office
 &HT;    By Shaun Conlin

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   The next iteration of Microsoft's IntelliMouse line is the
IntelliMouse Optical ($55; www.microsoft.com; for PC and Mac),
complete with the trackball-less, any-surface, never-gum, supremely
accurate ``IntelliEye'' laser reader in its belly. The most
ambitious descendent yet, the USB or PS/2 mouse boasts easy
Internet interfacing with the requisite left and right buttons on
top, a combination scroll wheel and third button nestled in
between, plus a thumb and pinky button on each side insinuated as
``forward'' and ``back'' commands on a browser _ or any function
the user cares to program. A symmetrical, ergonomic device, the
side buttons also accommodate left handed users.
</P>
<P>
   A great, high-tech mouse for all, lefties included, providing
they never share their computer with a righty nor ever use a
righty's computer, in which case, all involved are going to feel
backward.

 &HT;    SUV problems stem mostly from drivers
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Are sport-utility vehicles safe?
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is considering testing them because of
reported cases of rollovers. Recent questions have arisen about the
tires that many of them roll on.
</P>
<P>
   I believe that SUVs are not inherently unsafe, but for the past
six months I have made a conscious effort to watch the way in which
they are driven. That could be the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Most drivers do not make necessary adjustments to their driving
style or habits according to their vehicle. Unfortunately, SUV
drivers seem to be the biggest offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, you can't expect to drive a ``school bus'' the same
way that you would a sports car. But I see SUV drivers attempting
to do just that all the time.
</P>
<P>
   The perception that sport-utilities provide lots of protection
because they provide lots of structure around the occupants is
true. But they have one big handicap, their center of gravity. A
vehicle's center of gravity may not be a driver's top concern, but
it is one of the most important characteristics in the handling of
any vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   You may have seen road signs warning 18-wheelers to slow down on
curves because the vehicle could tilt over. While not as vulnerable
as an 18-wheeler, an SUV has a similar problem because of its
height.
</P>
<P>
   When people build race cars, one of the first things they design
into that vehicle is a low center of gravity. The center of gravity
is the point on which the weight of the vehicle rotates.
</P>
<P>
   Look at a Chevrolet Corvette. The rocker panels seem to be
almost on the ground. It has a very low center of gravity. It's
supposed to; it's a sports car. It is designed to go around corners
quickly and easily.
</P>
<P>
   Then look at any sport-utility. Its rocker panels can be a foot
or more off the ground. The center of gravity is much farther off
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford Expedition and Chevy Suburban are both substantial,
sizable vehicles, and either would make me feel well-protected. But
I wouldn't expect either to stop either one in as short a distance
as a Taurus or an Impala.
</P>
<P>
   It's simply a function of mass in motion. You can't stop 4,000
pounds of SUV in the same distance that you can stop a 3,000-pound
sedan, yet I see SUV drivers riding right on the bumper of the
vehicle in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   Another contributing factor to an SUV's limits is its tires. By
design these vehicles have what I like to term ``compromise
tires.'' They are designed to be functional in both on-road and
off-road situations.
</P>
<P>
   This dual purpose means that they do not provide the ultimate
traction capabilities of a highway-only tire. They can't. They
never would survive in off-road situations.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the tires on an SUV. They are big, leading to the
assumption that they provide greater traction in all situations.
They don't. The tread pattern typically has big wide spacings so
that rocks and mud are self-cleaned from the tire surface. It also
means that the total contact area of an SUV tire, compared with a
highway tire, is smaller. Less contact, less traction.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that SUV tires are made with a much harder
compound than a highway tire. If you are planning to drive
off-road, you need a puncture-resistant tire.
</P>
<P>
   The Corvette comes equipped with Z-rated tires. That means they
have a very soft compound. Will they last a long time? Probably
not, but they will stick like glue to the road surface. The softer
the compound, the better the adhesion.
</P>
<P>
   Reality is that it is drivers' responsibility to know the
abilities and limitations of their vehicle and to make adjustment
to their driving styles if they expect the vehicle to perform
safely in all situations.

   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``We recently purchased a 1998 Taurus with 39,000 miles on it
from a local dealership that specializes in late model used cars.
</P>
<P>
   Within the first 30 days, we noticed a strange sound that we
thought might be coming from the engine. We took it back to their

   Well, two months later the sound was getting worse, so we took

<P>
   We have been told that the bearings are sealed and should last
for the life of the vehicle. We have also been on the Internet
NHTSA site and have contacted Ford customer relations. There is no
recall on the bearings.
</P>
<P>
   Ford advised us to return to the dealership that sold us the car
to negotiate the repair, which we did. Although the operations
manager is willing to work with us and not charge ``full retail''
to replace the hub bearings, we feel that we should not have to
bear any of the expense of the repair.
</P>
<P>
   My daughter is continuing to drive this vehicle while we are
deciding what to do.
</P>
<P>
   _ Michelle Elam
</P>
<P>
   A: Stop! Get your daughter out of that car until it is repaired.
</P>
<P>
   The hub bearing is directly connected to the drive axle, brake
rotor and front wheel. Failure of the bearing could cause loss of
vehicle control at worst, and will certainly cause additional
damage to components and leave her stranded, at best.
</P>
<P>
   Hub bearings don't last for the life of the car, sealed or
otherwise. They should not have failed at 40,000 miles, but unless
you buy a used car from the original owner who has documented and
kept records of every service and repair, most used cars' previous
lives are uncertain. Perhaps the former owner had changed the
factory wheels or drove through a lot of water or constantly rode
the brakes.
</P>
<P>
   The dealership you purchased the Taurus from has a good
reputation in that it performs extensive inspections of all
vehicles before they are considered for sale.
</P>
<P>
   An abnormally noisy hub bearing should have been detected on a
test drive. It may have been overlooked during the visual
inspection because parts not customarily removed would have needed
to have been to see the rust.
</P>
<P>
   As much as it would be nice to be able to point the finger at
someone, I'm not certain there is any definite blame. Depending on
the severity of the noise when you bought the car, the problem
could have been overlooked by even the most astute mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   When you are plunking down a large sum of money for any used
car, it is always advisable to have the vehicle inspected by an
independent mechanic, but even that isn't foolproof.
</P>
<P>
   If your dealer is willing to work with you on the repair, what
we commonly refer to as a ``goodwill adjustment,'' I'd get it in
writing and probably take it. If your daughter does additional
damage to the car as a result of not having the hub bearing
repaired, you will incur hundreds of dollars in expense that will
not and should not be covered.
</P>
<P>
   There are no guarantees, especially with used cars. I have been
blessed with good ones and cursed with bad ones. A good long test
drive and a second mechanical opinion before you sign on the line
is often your best defense.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Learning, fun? _ hmmm . . . sounds dubious. But
Mattel Interactive's new Pokemon PokeROMs ($8;
www.pokemon.com/goods/pokeroms.html; for Mac and Windows) deliver
on this claim to a good degree as Pokemon icon Professor Oak leads
kids in activities that promote math and grammar skills. Each
session begins with a ``Concentration''-type puzzle, where math
equations and answers must be matched, each correct union revealing
part of a Pokemon. When the entire image is visible, it can be
saved or printed. The computerized board game finds up to four
players answering grammar questions to move across a virtual game
board. Difficulty can be tailored to children from grades 1 to 5,
but there are too few questions in each level and they quickly
become repetitive. The Pokemon observatory, where you search a map
for Pokemon and click hot spots to reveal them, is lackluster. Each
click seems to reveal a different shot of your Pokemon but, in
reality, only triggers a slide show that will reveal all of the
pictures if you don't click away fast enough. In spite of these
negatives, PokeROMs, available on small, mini CD-ROMs, offer a
non-violent, educational computer experience that children will
enjoy . . . for a while. Here's hoping Mattel adds new questions to
the Series 2 and 3 PokeROMs (due later this year).

   A SWING AND A HIT Hey, batter batter . . . Humongous
Entertainment has updated its Junior Sports collection with
Backyard Baseball 2001 ($20; store.humongous.com; for Mac and
Windows), an update of their best sports title, Backyard Baseball.
So what's different? Well, kids still can choose their own teams
(and team names) but in addition to the original cast of
characters, players also can choose from 31 kid versions of their
favorite big-leaguers such as Sammy Sosa and Randy Johnson
(hands-down the game's best pitcher). Also new in this version is
the option to build your own player from scratch, choosing his or
her batting, fielding, throwing and running skills. Special wacky
abilities are rewarded for outstanding play. A pitcher, for
instance, might get to throw fireballs, which actually burn on
their way to the plate. Batters might get to smack
``undergrounders'' (hits that travel under the playing field and
pop up at random spots). This game features Humongous' trademark
beautiful animation, silly humor and great play. All in all, it's
another home run.

 &HT;    Virtual high schools are now in session
 &HT;    By Sophia Lezin Jones
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Telecommuting has made its way to the public schools _
at least in metro Atlanta's Gwinnett County.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning this fall, students in 14 high schools can opt to take
one course per semester at home, on their personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   District educators have developed several online classes
_including Algebra I, Algebra II, Advanced Placement Language Arts
and Economics _ that will count toward graduation. The courses cost
$275 each.
</P>
<P>
   The state's largest school district is the first in Georgia to
offer online courses developed by its educators to all of its high
school students.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, students at about 20 Georgia high schools take online
classes through the Virtual High School project, a Concord,
Mass.-based program developed with a federal grant to offer
challenging Web-based courses.
</P>
<P>
   In Gwinnett, as many as 300 students are expected to enroll for
an online course for the fall semester, which begins Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Students log on to a designated Web site where lecture notes and
slide shows are posted. Homework and other assignments will be
submitted via e-mail, while Class Web sites have been set up to
allow teachers to see how much time students are spending on
assignments. Teachers may establish a chatroom where students'
questions are answered live. Tests will be password protected,
timed and accessible just once.
</P>
<P>
   Students will have only two mandatory face-to-face meeting with
their teacher _ for orientation and the final exam.
</P>
<P>
   Gwinnett developed its online program to give students,
especially those who work and are active in extra-curricular
activities, more flexibility, said Wendy Burns, an assistant
principal at South Gwinnett High who oversaw the development of the
program.
</P>
<P>
   The county tested the program during the winter and summer
semesters.
</P>
<P>
   Helana Peterson, a rising sophomore, took Algebra I at home this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be really disciplined to do (the work) on your
own,'' said Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   Her online instructor, Matthew Waymack, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one standing over their shoulder making them do
anything,'' he said. ``I'm not there. They have to be able to take
the initiative and ask if they have questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson finished the class with a B, but four of the 20
students who registered dropped it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got behind and way over their head,'' Waymack said.

ADVERTISING: REPORT SAYS INTERNET GROWTH WILL DRIVE OVERALL AD
SALES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (Spelling Rutherfurd is CQ) 
 By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its annual forecast, Veronis Suhler, the investment banking
firm, predicted that the popularity of the Internet as an
advertising and information medium will continue to increase
rapidly in the short term, though not to the exclusion of more
traditional media like magazines and newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's 14th annual communications industry forecast,
released on Monday, found that total advertiser spending grew 9.1
percent, to $165 billion, last year; it expects spending to grow
8.6 percent annually, climbing to $249.1 billion in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, this growth ``will be driven largely by
Internet advertising, which exploded 140.6 percent, to $4.6 billion
in 1999 and is forecast to increase at a 39.5 percent compound
annual growth rate, more than quadrupling to $24.4 billion by
2004.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said the growth in online ad spending should account
for nearly a quarter of total advertising growth predicted for all
segments through 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Should Veronis Suhler's predictions pan out, by 2004, Internet
advertising will exceed consumer magazine advertising, which is
projected to reach $16.4 billion; network television advertising,
estimated at $19.4 billion; and cable television advertising, a
projected $21 billion. It should then be close to radio
advertising, projected to climb to $26.6 billion. Daily newspapers
are still expected to generate the highest advertising income, an
estimated $63.2 billion in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet will continue to stimulate media growth almost
across the board, said James P. Rutherfurd, executive vice
president of Veronis Suhler, which is based in New York. ``The good
news is that it has sparked a metamorphosis for traditional
media,'' he said. ``By developing content-rich Web sites and
information portals, traditional publishers and television networks
are positioning themselves to capture their share of revenue
diverted to the Web over the next several years.''
</P>
<P>
   The report found that newspapers had lost some classified and
real estate advertising to the Internet. But newspapers have offset
these losses with strong national advertising, increased dot-com ad
spending and development of online classified advertising programs.
Another positive trend for newspapers, the report said, was the
aging of the United States population, since 71 percent of people
over the age of 35 read a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the forecast said that ``contrary to popular
thought, television viewing is not being cannibalized by growing
Internet use.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead,'' the report said, ``many Internet users actually
watch television while surfing _ in a majority of households,
computers are co-located in the living or family room with the
television.''
</P>
<P>
   It also said that ``while the television market has benefited
from dot-com ad dollars, this influx is not expected to last, as
some Internet entities change their advertising emphasis to more
targeted media.''
</P>
<P>
   Veronis Suhler said this development should be positive for
consumer magazines, which, with their large, targeted audiences,
have become an increasingly attractive advertising vehicle for
dot-coms. These publications have proved ``very resilient when it
comes to the Internet's growing reach,'' the report said, in part
because the Web ``has so far been unable to successfully duplicate
the look, feel and ease of use of magazines and other printed media
and is unlikely to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is easy for search and comparison shopping, but
not for random access,'' Rutherfurd said. ``If you're looking for
what's going on in the sports world, for example, flipping through
a magazine or newspaper, with a catchy picture or headline, is
better than surfing page after page on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The forecast also predicted that although the decline in
broadcast television ratings has slowed since 1997, it will resume
after the 2000 elections, the Sydney Olympics and the recent spike
generated by reality-based programming.
</P>
<P>
   It projected that interactive entertainment _ PC games and
console video games, like Sega's Dreamcast system _ would have the
highest growth rate of any segment of the communications industry
through 2004. Hourly use per person per year of video games is
forecast to climb 21.5 percent through 2004, on top of a 29.4
percent annual increase between 1995 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, between 1995 and 1999, hourly annual
Internet use rose 106.8 percent. That growth is expected to
moderate to 18.4 percent through 2004.

booming Internet industry, will attend, just a day after another
VIC event that drew a similar turnout.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first of three tech-connected parties tonight, another
edition of the business-minded social whirl among the geek set in
Los Angeles. A burgeoning industry of Web-based entertainment and
new-media companies, with tens of thousands of tech-minded partying
people, has fueled the rapid growth of a network of networking
organizations in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be a new group springing up every day,'' said
Giovanna Imbesi of Los Angeles' chapter of First Tuesday, which
itself sprung up here only last spring after starting in London a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   For a business notorious for its asocial computer nerds
ensconced in coding caves before glowing cathode-ray tubes, there's
a lot of humanity interacting these days in Los Angeles'
interactive industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's also a large segment of the business where their
entire world is 17 inches (of computer screen). That's it,'' said
Christian Gray, publisher of the Southern California Technology
Calendar. ``This is their chance to get out and shake hands with
people they've been e-mailing.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just the organized gatherings of groups such as VIC
and First Tuesday. Conferences like last week's Herring on
Hollywood drew hundreds of participants who then hit a circuit of
show-related evening soirees for three straight nights. And
individual Web sites often celebrate major events with blow-out
parties such as the recent Artistdirect.com event featuring singer
k.d. lang at its sprawling Miracle Mile offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could literally go to a conference a day, especially in
L.A. or New York,'' said Imbesi. ``But I think some of this
phenomenon gets exaggerated in L.A. because most of the events have
some sort of entertainment slant to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this isn't just socializing, not in a town where
schmooze has been elevated to an art form, where every chance
meeting with cocktail in hand comes with a calculation of its
business implications. The Net set social whirl is all about
getting ahead, or at least catching up.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's a whole new world that's very different from the
entertainment business,'' said Tiffany Wagner, who recently joined
Massive Media, a West Hollywood Web company after working in
entertainment. ``This is all new to me. And I come here to work.
The companies we target, they're here and we let them know what
we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Kelley of Brentwood, an ad saleswoman for AOL's local
operations, says she's scouting for new accounts, not new dates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business contacts is the reason I come here,'' Kelley said.
``If I get two or three contacts in a night, it's worth it. I don't
look at it as much as a scamming place as one for real business.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a fluid business where you're as likely to be partnering
with a company as competing against it, getting out is vital.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going out and forming groups and learning from each
other,'' said Kaye Popofsky, a record producer and founder of Step
UP, a support group for women in technology. ``It's smart; it
should be this way. Multimedia, unlike (traditional) entertainment,
is so expansive and so new, you can't do your job unless you know
what others are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexis de Tocqueville observed that Americans love to join
groups. Some 150 years later, the people in this newest of American
industries are joining with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so many people out there, (the social scene) is just
growing in leaps and bounds,'' said Conchetta Fabares, executive
director of the Digital Coast Roundtable, which coordinates a
quarterly gathering of the leaders of more than 20 of the region's
tech networking groups, with a combined (though overlapping)
membership of 50,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people are new to it, and they're just learning,''
Fabares said. ``They're interested in communicating. They're trying
to network. That's by and large why these events are so
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray, the calendar publisher, tracks 80 to 100 events a month,
put on by 150 to 200 organizations. No one should be surprised, he
said, that the social scene is big enough to need the e-mail
service he provides.
</P>
<P>
   ``For better or worse, L.A. is a schmooze town,'' Gray said.
``You see the same thing in Silicon Valley and New York, but in the
fragmented area we're in, it creates huge opportunities for
gathering people together.''
</P>
<P>
   At these events, you're as likely to be chatting with a
Docker-clad CEO of a major Web services company, such as marchFIRST
managing director Nick Rothenberg, as to a junior marketing
employee like Wagner. And as the Net affects more and more other
businesses, local Net events have attracted a broader range of
participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't just 15 people hanging out in a chat room
anymore,'' said Rothenberg. ``This thing used to be entertainment
people mostly. Now you see people from some Fortune 500 company who
realize this is a center of the Internet business.''
</P>
<P>
   VIC puts on six to 10 events a month of various sorts, from
small executive-only gatherings of 100 to blow-out bashes of 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original intent was to connect people on the Westside
involved in the emerging new-media scene, CD-ROMs and interactive
gaming,'' said VIC executive director Brad Nye. ``The Internet
wasn't even part of the conversation that first meeting, just five
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   That's all changed radically of course. But the need for
face-to-face remains, Nye said, because it's good business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social and professional development go hand in hand,'' Nye
said. ``Good relationships build trust. And there's no industry
that facilitates this sort of interaction, business interaction,
like this one.''
</P>
<P>
   VIC's boom has encouraged other groups to form, often to create
more intimate gatherings than the often sprawling VIC gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   But staying small is very hard. Just ask David Cremin, a partner
at venture-capital firm Zone Ventures, who decided he wanted to
start something like the Churchill Club, a Silicon Valley
social/business staple. Cremin sent perhaps 175 e-mail invitations
to meet at a downtown restaurant a year ago in the first gathering
of the Zone Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four-hundred and fifty people showed up,'' Cremin said.
``There were lines around the block. It was complete disaster,
because we were so successful. We hit a hot button. People showed
up because they want to meet one another. They want to interact.''

ON THE LANGUAGE OF CERVANTES, THE IMPRINT OF THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SAM DILLON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Cindy Flores Davalos, a 24-year-old Mexican with
neon pink hair, speaks native Spanish and minimal English. But in
her job as the editor of a women's ``channel'' at Elsitio.com, an
Internet company here, she operates in a linguistic netherworld
that experts call Cyber-Spanglish.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at her computer, Flores keeps her hand on ``el maus,''
which she uses to ``clickear'' on the icons on her screen. She
loves to ``chatear'' with her clients online, and when someone
sends her an intriguing ``imail,'' she may ``forwardear'' it to a
friend. Her instantaneous e-mail service, AOL's ICQ (named for the
play on ``I seek you''), gets this rave review: ``I love to
ICQuear'' (pronounced eye-see-kay-YAR).
</P>
<P>
   ``Our daily routine obliges us to work in English,'' Flores said
in Spanish. ``The force of English on the computer screen is
overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Flores' linguistic experience is shared by millions of Hispanics
who are adopting computers and the Internet as the tools and toys
of daily life. From Mexico to Madrid and from Tijuana to Tierra del
Fuego, Spanish-speakers are freely importing English
technology-related words into their vocabulary. They ``taipear''
rather than ``escribir a maquina.'' When they save a file, they
make ``el backup.'' And when their computer jams, it is time to
``resetear.'' Pronunciations tend to retain the simplicity of
American vowels _ the first syllable of ``brainstormear,'' for
instance, is usually said brayn, rather than bry-een.
</P>
<P>
   The hybridization of Spanish and English into Spanglish is not
new, of course. It has been accelerating for half a century, and
has often irritated Latin nationalists who see the process as
cultural infiltration from the United States, as well as purists
who think the mother tongue of Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra is
quite nice in its classic form, gracias. What is different now,
experts say, is that linguistic gatekeepers in much of the Latin
world appear to be throwing up their hands in the face of the
latest English invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a hard-fought battle from the '60s through the
'80s,'' said Jose Carreno Carlon, director of the department of
communication at the Iberoamerican University in Mexico City. ``But
the nationalists and purists are in retreat, especially because in
the cybernetic world many English words have no easy equivalent.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a doubt, many computer-related words _ ``click,'' for
instance _ resist neat translation. But Ilan Stavans, a
Mexican-born professor of Spanish at Amherst College who has
compiled a forthcoming dictionary of Spanglish terms, says there is
another reason for the quick welcome given to many English terms
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a shift in the cultural climate not only in Mexico,
but all over Latin America and Spain,'' Stavans said, noting that
the left had once held intellectual sway there. ``Before the fall
of the Berlin Wall, everything that came from the imperialist
gringo had to be rejected. But attitudes have become more receptive
to U.S. popular culture, especially among the middle classes. They
don't reject, they absorb.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 10 percent of the 6,000 hybrid terms Stavans has collected
are Cyber-Spanglish, underlining the Internet culture's growing
influence in the Hispanic world.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is expected to have 128 million Internet users
by 2001. There are far fewer users in Latin America and Spain, but
the number is rising rapidly. Some 2.7 million Mexicans will be
wired into the Internet by year's end, says Marc Alexander, an
analyst at IDC, an American Internet market research company, and
Mexican users are increasing by 50 percent annually. In all of
Latin America, there are now 13.2 million Internet users, up from
8.4 million last year. Nine million Spaniards are now wired.
(English is also bending the Portuguese of Brazil, South America's
largest Internet market.)
</P>
<P>
   The rapid growth has made cyberspace the linguistic crucible
that a century ago was centered on America's southwest border and
later in cities like Miami and New York, where Latinos intending to
drive their trucks to market began saying ``Voy a manejar mi troca
a la marketa'' instead of the ``Voy a manejar mi camion al
mercado.''
</P>
<P>
   In more recent decades, Spanglish was fed by English-language
movies, radio and television broadcasts, and advertising. In 1982,
President Jose Lopez Portillo tried to turn back the tide by
creating the Commission for the Defense of the Spanish Language,
which campaigned to rid Mexico City billboards of words like
hamburgers and pub.
</P>
<P>
   ``People rejected that purist campaign,'' said Dr. Tarsicio
Herrera Zapien, the professor of classical letters who is secretary
of the prestigious Academia Mexicana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Languages evolve, and we don't need to fight for Spanish if it
is alive,'' said Herrera.
</P>
<P>
   The Academia Mexicana was set up 125 years ago, its statutes
say, to ``seek the conservation, purity and perfection of the
Spanish language'' in Mexico. But in recent years, Herrera says,
its members have put less focus on purity and will likely do
nothing to prevent the use of Cyber-Spanglish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't legislate how people speak,'' said Herrera. ``We
simply catalog Mexican usages.''
</P>
<P>
   The Academia Mexicana is one of 20 organizations in Latin
America affiliated with the Real Academia Espanola (Royal Spanish
Academy) in Madrid, established in 1713 to protect Castilian
Spanish from an earlier source of linguistic pollution: words
derived from Quechua, Nahuatl and other indigenous tongues were
being incorporated into Latin American speech.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage the use of proper Spanish, the Real Academia has
established a Web site at www.rae.es. It offers an interactive
service, Espanol al Dia, to answer questions about the correct use
of Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Tascon, the editor of El Pais Digital, the Internet
version of Spain's largest newspaper, says the Real Academia has
urged Spaniards to resist the English onslaught by seeking correct
Spanish translations of computer-related terms, a practice he tries
to follow as an editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't use el atachment,'' Tascon said. ``We use archivo
adjunto, which is longer, but at least it's Spanish. We try to use
el sitio instead of el site, but that's a battle.'' Half the papers
in Spain now routinely use el site, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes English words just force their way into general
use,'' he said. ``We try to get people to use `charlar,' for
instance, but they say `chatear' anyway.''

PROPS, COSTUMES FROM MOVIES AND TV SHOWS ARE NOW AVAILABLE ONLINE &HT;    By BRUCE WESTBROOK
 &HT;    c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine: Michelle Pfeiffer's dress in your closet, or Dr. Evil's
chariot in your garage.
</P>
<P>
   It can happen _ for a price _ thanks to a new army in the
Internet revolution: collectors of movie and TV memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   Their rabid interest and avid bidding has sparked an explosion
of activity for (begin ital) objects de show biz (end ital) in
lively online auctions.
</P>
<P>
   Everything from costumes to cars is being sold, driven by the
cachet of having appeared on screen.
</P>
<P>
   Most buyers aren't high-rollers who can pay $666,000 for Judy
Garland's ruby slippers from ``The Wizard of Oz,'' as occurred at
Christie's New York auction house last May.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, average fans are going online to buy memorabilia at
reasonable prices _ provided $160 for a film canister sounds
reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   As this frenzy mushrooms, studios are taking notice. There's
gold in them thar prop warehouses, and MGM and others have begun
mining it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, studios didn't try to recoup revenue from such
items,'' said Paul Brown, president of Legends in Time Memorabilia,
a Vancouver-based dealer in film artifacts (found at
www.webautographs.com).
</P>
<P>
   Studios stored some items after a production wrapped, while
others would be taken home by crew members, offered in small sales
on the lot, given to charity or discarded.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet is changing all that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Memorabilia is going through explosive growth thanks primarily
to the Internet,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   At first, such items were sold largely by individuals on the
Web's top two auction sites: eBay (www.ebay.com) and Amazon
(www.amazon.com).
</P>
<P>
   But now studios are staging their own formalized auctions _
sometimes at their own Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're learning they have valuable assets in the prop room or
costume warehouse,'' Brown said. ``They're learning they can recoup
some production costs via online auctions rather than tossing this
stuff away.''
</P>
<P>
   New Line set the stage last year by creating its own auction
site at auction.newline.com. This marked the first time a major
film studio used the Internet to sell props and costumes to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Items from ``Lost in Space,'' ``Blast From the Past'' and the
``Austin Powers'' movies quickly sold. In fact, they're still
selling.
</P>
<P>
   Bids close at 6 p.m. Monday for Charlize Theron's robe from
``The Astronaut's Wife.'' On Sunday afternoon, the high bid was
$237.
</P>
<P>
   Items from ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' have been
pricier. Dr. Evil's chariot sold for $7,802, while a 1965 Corvette
with groovy decorations went for $121,000.
</P>
<P>
   MGM takes the plunge Friday, launching its biggest auction ever
with 600 items from ``The Outer Limits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the largest online auction ever devoted to a
single television series,'' claims Hank Cohen, president of MGM
Television Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding will be at Amazon Auctions (www.amazon.com/auctions).
For a preview, go to theouterlimitsprops.com.
</P>
<P>
   The breakdown: 400 props, 100 costumes, 50 drawings and 50 set
decorations. They're all from the sci-fi show airing on Showtime
and in syndication, not the '60s original.
</P>
<P>
   Bids will start at $1. There will be no reserves (a required
minimum bid) except for some costly items.
</P>
<P>
   The auction is timed to coincide with ``The Outer Limits' ''
two-hour series finale, ``Final Appeal,'' premiering on Showtime on
Sept. 3. It thus serves a dual purpose: raising money and
publicizing the show.
</P>
<P>
   Several items from the finale will be auctioned, including a
robe worn by Charlton Heston as a Supreme Court justice in the year
2070.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect that robe to be much admired,'' said show publicist
Paul Gendreau.
</P>
<P>
   Which actors work with an item is a factor in its sale.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who's coordinating the ``Outer Limits'' auction, finds it
``staggering'' that people will pay so much for TV props.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a small `X-Files' auction of 38 items, and total
bidding was $53,000,'' Brown said. ``The top-selling item was a
piece of artwork wrapped around a book held by Gillian Anderson. It
was a piece of paper created on a computer, and it sold for $7,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's astonishing,'' he said. ``I can't explain why people pay
such prices.''
</P>
<P>
   For ``The Outer Limits,'' Brown was determined to include
``things for the little guy who wants to spend $20. We like
everyone to have a chance.'' So even schematic drawings for props
will be offered.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all this is just the tip of the junk heap. For its six
seasons, every ``Outer Limits'' drawing, blueprint, prop and
costume was saved, and up to 20,000 items are in a warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   When the auction ends Sept. 5, they'll go on sale, too _ at the
preview site. Legends in Time will set prices on each item, ``and
the first person who pays gets it,'' Brown said. ``That sale should
last about two years.''
</P>
<P>
   MGM will get all proceeds, after fees are paid to Amazon and
Legends in Time and a donation is made to Variety Club Children's
Charity.
</P>
<P>
   MTV's ``Cool Crap'' auction is strictly philanthropic. Geared to
music-video props, it's running through Wednesday on Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work with the artists, who give us the stuff, and the money
generated benefits antiviolence charities as part of our `Fight for
Your Rights' campaign,'' said MTV spokesperson Carrie Caine.
</P>
<P>
   Some mementos mean big bucks. A green VW Beetle driven by Mandy
Moore in her ``Candy'' video was up to $43,000 Sunday. More
affordable are a pink microphone prop used in No Doubt's
``Ex-Girlfriend'' video (bidding was at $1,425 Sunday) and
``Daria'' animation cells ($310 as of Sunday).
</P>
<P>
   Online auction giant eBay has become a home for organized prop
auctions, too. For 14 months eBay has hosted a massive sell-off
from another canceled TV show, Mystery Science Theater 3000.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after Sci-Fi axed the series, its creators at
Minneapolis-based Best Brains began selling 10 years' worth of
memorabilia _ with amazing results.
</P>
<P>
   One fan spent $1,294 for a two-foot model of the show's
``Satellite of Love.'' But pieces of the ship's interior have sold
for as little as $20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most sales have been $100 to $200,'' said Best Brains' Barbara
Tebben. That includes a film canister painted with the name Boggy
Creek II, which went for $160.
</P>
<P>
   Top-dollar item was the show's logo planet, which went for
$5,500.
</P>
<P>
   About 490 items have been sold, with another 60 being offered.
Best Brains' Jim Mallon, who directed many of the low-cost
episodes, said sales have surpassed $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's appropriate that this was a handmade show, and
now 500 of its props are scattered among our devotees,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A trend is to auction movie items while the film is still in
theaters. DreamWorks is auctioning clothes, props and even vehicles
from its new What Lies Beneath at Amazon. A burgundy dress worn by
Michelle Pfeiffer _ and the partly burned candle she held in the
scene _ sold for $1,026 Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Mallon worries that there could be a downside to the trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never gave a thought to selling props as memorabilia while
we were making ('Mystery Science Theater 3000'),'' he said. Now he
fears that prop auctions will become a way to fund movies and
``we'll start seeing films with incredible amounts of (stuff) in
the background, just so they can turn around and sell it.''

CHOICE OF JEWISH CANDIDATE IS NOTED IN SLURS ON INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LISA GUERNSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The selection of Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut for the
Democratic ticket has prompted a barrage of anti-Semitic comments
in online chat rooms and on Internet message boards, leading at
least a few online services to start purging offensive postings.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hours after the news broke on Monday, chat rooms on
America Online and Yahoo were peppered with slurs against Jews. At
times, as many as half the comments included offensive remarks.
</P>
<P>
   On an AOL message board devoted to conversation about Lieberman,
where more than 20,000 comments had been posted by Tuesday
afternoon, many included disparaging references to Jews. AOL
monitors began removing offensive postings on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   AOL officials would not say how many messages had been deleted.
But they said they were prepared to suspend or cancel the accounts
of those found to have violated the service's rules against hate
speech, vulgar language or harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Message boards are like collections of open letters, available
indefinitely to be read and responded to. Chat rooms are harder to
monitor, because they are live discussions among perhaps a dozen
computer users, and the comments vanish almost as quickly as they
appear.
</P>
<P>
   Comments on Monday ranged from direct slurs against Lieberman to
denials of the Holocaust. Some were in German. In a Yahoo chat
room, a person who went by the name Young Nazi Girl declared Jews
to be people with ``loyalty to no one but the dollar.'' In an AOL
chat room, some visitors declared that Jews controlled and
manipulated the government and the media.
</P>
<P>
   CNN.com banned 10 chat room visitors for offensive remarks
related to Lieberman, said Edna Johnson, a CNN spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   On several services, the anti-Semitic vitriol in chat rooms
appeared to have subsided on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Anti-Defamation League has been monitoring online activity
since the Lieberman announcement and has seen a ``spike'' in
anti-Semitic remarks on the Internet, said Abraham Foxman, the
league's national director. Many were sent to e-mail lists devoted
to discussion of white supremacy, he said,
</P>
<P>
   Before the Internet, Foxman said, those people would not have
been heard by most Americans. ``Today, this goes globally to a
million people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, online chat rooms are known as places where some
people, shielded by anonymity, let ugly remarks fly. Message
boards, where discussions are archived and therefore more
traceable, may be slightly tamer, but still attract extremists.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Graham, a spokesman for AOL, said staff members and
volunteers would ``aggressively pursue'' those found to have posted
anti-Semitic comments. But he said the number violating AOL's rules
was not abnormal, given the volume.
</P>
<P>
   When Elian Gonzalez was seized by federal agents, Graham said,
more than 60,000 messages were posted within 20 minutes, with a
similar proportion of violations.

   Still, staff members of groups like the Anti-Defamation League
and the Simon Wiesenthal Center said the slurs against Jews in
mainstream political chat rooms _ and not just on Web sites devoted
to such causes _ showed that anti-Semites felt emboldened to reach
out to a larger audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they are able to do is piggyback on a news event,''
Foxman said. ``And therefore they get a certain legitimacy, a
boost.''
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, there were some signs that the anti-Jewish message
would not travel far. Scores of people had logged on to message
boards to balance the offensive remarks with declarations of their
own disgust for anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot believe,'' wrote one AOL subscriber, ``that anyone in
their right mind would write anything as hateful as I have read
here.''

 By MARCY MEDINA, with contributions from ROSE APODACA JONES,
CASSANDRA NYE and LAUREN CRAIG  
 (Two color slides are available.) 
 From WWD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    LOS ANGELES _ With Emmy-nominated TV hits such as ``Sex and the
City'' and ``Will &AMP; Grace'' making Jimmy Choo and Dolce &AMP; Gabbana
practically household names, the 52nd Annual Primetime Emmys are
poised to compete in that ``Style Superbowl'' that until now has
been dominated by the Oscars.
 &HT;    ``I think TV will give the Oscars fashion race a run for its
money,'' predicted Randolph Duke, who has dressed several of the
networks' leading ladies.
 &HT;    The nominees _ listed here _ are no strangers to the fashion
hoopla. Joining them here are actresses whom the Academy of
Television Arts and Sciences may have overlooked, but of whom
fashionistas can't get enough.
 &HT;    One thing is certain: If they don't look fabulous, it won't be
for lack of trying.
 &HT;    ``Given these women's status, they can afford the best,''
observed stylist Rachel Zoe Rosenzweig, who has worked with
Michelle Pfeiffer, Brooke Shields and Meg Ryan. ``They should all
take advantage of that access. If people don't want to deal with
the competition, have a dress custom made.''
 &HT;    So what should viewers expect on the big night? WWD surveyed the
experts _ the designers, stylists, magazine editors, hair stylists
and makeup artists _ about how the nominees and attendees should
look.
 &HT;    Many of those surveyed will also, inevitably, make their mark at
the broadcast Sept. 10.
 &HT;    
 SARAH JESSICA PARKER  
 &HT;    Everyone wants TV's ``It'' girl, as much for her willingness to
experiment with fashion on screen in her role as sex columnist
Carrie Bradshaw in ``Sex and the City'' _ which won her a
nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series _ as for
her experimentation with fashion offscreen.
 &HT;    Good thing she studied up on the collections as a front-row
guest at every key designer's show. She is the series co-producer,
you know.
 &HT;    _ STEFANO DOLCE and DOMENICO GABBANA: ``We would like to see
Sarah in a hot skirt with fringe and beading paired with a brocade
bustier and Swarovski-crystal-embroidered sandals. Sarah is daring
and has a unique way of interpreting fashion. She is not afraid to
take chances and always looks great.''
 &HT;    _ MARK BADGLEY and JAMES MISCHKA: ``She has a great, original
sense of style. She would look fab in a quirky, asymmetrical net
cocktail dress.''
 &HT;    _ MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``My favorite. Please tangle me up
in that hair! I'd love to see her a redhead _ deep red _ very
steamy.''
 &HT;    _ RANDOLPH DUKE: ``You always run the risk of what I call the
`beauty pageant parade' of dresses with all these pretty things
coming down the carpet. You need those women who have great bodies
and sex appeal to pepper it up. Sarah Jessica Parker can do that.
She's one who could pull off a hot pant or bra under a sheer top.''
 &HT;    _ DAVID GARDNER, hairstylist, Profile agency (who will be
styling Parker's hair on Emmy night): ``Seeing as she wore her hair
straight for the MTV Movie Awards, I think she will go curly and
wild. I know it's what I would like to see.''
 &HT;    
 JENNIFER ANISTON  
 &HT;    This newlywed is certainly not going to throw a housecoat over
that sexy figure. Playing sweet Rachel may have scored her a nod
for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for
``Friends,'' but she should take the high road to chic style.
 &HT;    _ RANDOLPH DUKE: ``With Brad Pitt in tow, it doesn't matter what
she wears. Jennifer will have everybody beat, hands down. The dress
I designed for her last year was a departure, which was nice
because you don't get that often. But since she tried it last year,
I think she will go more simple this year.''
 &HT;    _ RICHARD TYLER: ``Jennifer could be great in a dress that has a
touch of whimsy to it, not too serious, but still sophisticated.
She would be very beautiful in rich, strong turquoise or
aquamarine. Her body and skin are flawless, so she can wear
anything. I would like to keep her modern and very sexy.''
 &HT;    _ PAMELA DENNIS: ``On Emmy night, she's going to emanate what
she has for the past year, always classy and simply dressed. She
has a sex appeal that is uncoupled, and she and Brad are an
uncoupled couple. She won't change her look. It works for her.
She's with him, isn't she? Would you change your look?''
 &HT;    _ LAURENT D, hairstylist: ``I would give her curly, very natural
hair _ similar to Gisele Bundchen.''
 &HT;    _ DAVID CARDONA, designer (nominated along with Bob Mackie for
Outstanding Costumes for a Variety of Music Program for ``Cher:
Live in Concert''): ``Jennifer is fabulous. Ever since Brad,
whether he's the reason or not, she's had a six-pack stomach. I
love seeing her in hip-hugging skirts that accentuate her body. And
I don't think she is too skinny. I just think she's in great shape
for the first time in her life.''
 &HT;    _ JEANINE LOBELL, Stila Cosmetics and veteran makeup artist:
``Jennifer is beautiful in an approachable way. It would be odd to
see her completely painted. I'd like her tan and shimmering and
bronze. It's the look of somebody on holiday who threw on a gown.''
 &HT;    
 HEATHER LOCKLEAR  
 &HT;    This quintessential L.A. woman is now a New Yorker (``Spin
City'' tapes there) and a Seventh Avenue favorite. She has the
body, attitude and cult status that make her a dream for designers
such as Michael Kors and Dolce &AMP; Gabbana.
 &HT;    _ STEFANO DOLCE and DOMENICO GABBANA: ``We would like to see
Heather accentuate her great figure in a stretch chiffon dress with
a low neckline encrusted with floral beading and high-heel sandals.
Her hair and makeup (are) always perfect.''
 &HT;    _ PATRICIA FIELD and REBECCA FIELD, stylists: ``Urban sexy. Stay
with those above-the-knee hemlines.''
 &HT;    _ MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``She should try some layers and a
shorter length ... to the chin. A not so `salon perfect' style
would be so refreshing. She would rock as a shiny brunette.''
 &HT;    _ HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``The girl is up for anything. The
only thing that bothers me is she dresses a little too rock 'n'
roll sometimes. I'd probably glam her up a bit, maybe in Michael
Kors' gold matte top and skirt. There's also a great Vera Wang
short, one-shoulder dress that's gold on top and black on the
bottom. She can do metallics in an elegant way that shows off that
great figure.''
 &HT;    _ LAURENT D, hairstylist: ``I would give her a Farrah Fawcett
blow-dry.''
 &HT;    _ RACHEL ZOE ROSENZWEIG, stylist: ``She's such a bombshell.
She's innately sexy. She could wear a housecoat and still be sexy.
With Heather, the key is reversing what we expect of her. Play down
the hair and makeup. No cleavage. She should just walk onto that
carpet and people should be saying she's stunning, not hot.''
 &HT;    
 HALLE BERRY  
 &HT;    OK, already, the world knows you've got the bod. Enough of the
cha-cha duds. She looked stunning in that white Valentino gown
peppered with red roses when she won a Golden Globe as Dorothy
Dandridge in the HBO production.
 &HT;    Primed to scoop a second trophy for the role as Outstanding Lead
Actress in a Miniseries or Movie, she would be wise to summon the
elegant heroine she portrayed.
 &HT;    _ ELIZABETH STEWART, creative director of style, New York Times
Magazine: ``I would love to see Halle in something that's not a
bikini top, doesn't bare her midriff or have fringe. She'd look
great in a draped chiffon evening dress from Donna Karan's fall
2000 collection.''
 &HT;    _ BRADLEY BAYOU, couturier and TV host: ``She's a dream. Lately,
some of her choices have been a little out-there. When you look
like she does, you don't need to display yourself like that. But
with a body like that, you can't go wrong. Good or bad, she's
taking those chances, and God bless her.''
 &HT;    _ HAL RUBENSTEIN, fashion director, InStyle: ``There's nothing
Halle Berry can't wear. The woman radiates great energy. There's a
very gamine quality about her, and yet she has a womanly figure.
Most fun for Halle would be Galliano's resort collection, wines and
mustards that are overtly sexy yet not cheap.''
 &HT;    _ PAMELA DENNIS: ``She always picks something beautiful and
of-the-moment. She's a chameleon. She can pull off a Madonna or an
Ashley Judd, going very couture or very hot and sexy.''
 &HT;    _ PATRICIA FIELD and REBECCA FIELD, stylists: ``Serve up all
your gorgeousness and lusciousness. If you've got it, naked is
best.''
 &HT;    
 SELA WARD  
 &HT;    As InStyle's Hal Rubenstein noted, here's more proof that some
things in Hollywood can get better with age. Nominated for
Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for ``Once and Again''
(she already took home a statuette in that category in 1994 for
``Sisters''), Ward can pull off just about any look and designer.
Play up the drama, sister.
 &HT;    _ MARK BADGLEY and JAMES MISCHKA: ``Such a beauty. We would put
Sela in very classic, dramatic shapes, probably dark _ think John
Singer Sargent portraits.''
 &HT;    _ RACHEL ZOE ROSENZWEIG, stylist: ``Sela radiates beauty, even
when she's in shorts and a tank top. She's 40-something and proud
of it. I'd put her in something European. But I wouldn't rule
anything out because the Americans are now getting more edgy. She
absolutely should have something with a low back that trains behind
her.''
 &HT;    _ HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Sela Ward is just the most
smashing-looking lady, but she wears black an awful lot. If
anything, here is a woman who could wear those great jewel tones
for fall, like a carnelian gown by Richard Tyler, or the tremendous
gowns by Donna Karan. She would look spectacular in a diaphanous
dress with an uneven hem or a leather top with a full skirt.''
 &HT;    _ ETIENNE TAENAKA, celebrity hairstylist, Vidal Sassoon: ``At
44, Sela looks fabulous! She should take advantage of what she's
got. Skintight Versace all the way. Clean and glamorous makeup and
her hair dressed down to say that she still has a casual attitude
about getting all glammed up.''
 &HT;    
 KIM CATTRALL  
 &HT;    Flaunt be thy middle name. The ``Sex and the City'' sexpot,
nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for
her role as Samantha, can work it to the hilt. She reminds
hairstylist Laurent D of a modern-day Marilyn Monroe. But that
blond bombshell never made fans blush. Just a reminder, Kim, the
Emmys aren't on cable.
 &HT;    _ ELIZABETH STEWART, New York Times Magazine: ``She has a slight
`cheese' factor and should just go with it. Wear an over-the-top
'80s look from Celine, Versace or Christian Dior.''
 &HT;    _ BRADLEY BAYOU: ``Kim has made some bad choices and good. She
knows she's sexy, but sometimes you can be a little more subtle.
Still, I love her because she has a sense of style all her own.''
 &HT;    _ RANDOLPH DUKE: ``Kim has had a phenomenal year. She just gets
better and better. She's more beautiful now than she ever has been,
and success has treated her well. I think she will go simple and
maybe a little more couture in feeling than she has in the past.''
 &HT;    _ PATRICIA FIELD and REBECCA FIELD, stylists: ``We want her to
serve it up in the style of Samantha. We'd like her to go not as
Kim Cattrall, but fiercer _ more in character. She should arrive
like the 'A' star she's become. Joan Collins, move over.''
 &HT;    _ RICCI DE MARITNO, stylist, Cloutier agency: ``Kim is the
epitome of sexiness. No matter what you put her in, it takes on a
sexy energy. I would get really slinky and sexy and nod to retro
Hollywood. You glam up Kim, and she carries it off.''
 &HT;    _ MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``Her beauty slays me. I would
grow (the hair) length, shag the top and go less blond _ it's too
cliche. I would do a deeper base with golden honey highlights.''
 &HT;    
 DEBRA MESSING  
 &HT;    Fans can't get enough of her or her show, ``Will and Grace.''
Neither could the judges when they nominated her for Outstanding
Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. As Grace, she's incredibly
accessible. But with those emerald eyes and auburn hair, she should
opt for pared-down elegance, maybe something black, when she hits
the red carpet.
 &HT;    _ MARK BADGLEY and JAMES MISCHKA: ``With such classic features,
that gorgeous hair and perfect skin, we think Debra would look
beautiful in something dark _ even black _ in a revealing cut.''
 &HT;    _ FREDERIC FEKKAI, hairstylist: ``I love Debra. For her, I like
the look of curly locks coming down around that beautiful face.
It's a little bit undone, which is a very nice look.''
 &HT;    _ GREGORY ALT, senior makeup artist at MAC Cosmetics: ``We have
grown to love Deborah as a quirky, adorable Lucille Ball type, so
it would be fun to see her let go a bit and explore her sexy side.
Smoky, plum-colored eyes with a light, rich plum gloss on her lips
would look great.''
 &HT;    _ JEANNE YANG, stylist: ``I adore her character, but she's
sometimes a little too elegant and could stand to be more funked
up. I could see what Galliano could do for her. She needs to be
more eclectic, not so gowny. It's high summer in L.A. so why not go
for something much more fun and interesting?''
 &HT;    
 LARA FLYNN BOYLE  
 &HT;    The Bedazzler studded Bob Seger T-shirt looked more MTV Music
Awards than Golden Globes, but leave it up to ``The Practice'' star
to shed her Armani district attorney duds for riskier statements by
rising designers. What will Jack Nicholson's cookie come up with
next? Note to her stylist: These are the Emmys.
 &HT;    _ RACHEL ZOE ROSENZWEIG, celebrity stylist: ``She should wear
something that accentuates her, like a bias-cut dress. If thin
actors don't want to be on the cover of every magazine as the
``starved actors,'' then they need to go with something flowy.
Maybe Chanel or Ungaro or Alberta Ferretti. Something that isn't
going to show bones.''
 &HT;    _ DAVID CARDONA, designer: ``When I dress her, I tuck the fabric
right under the rear instead of dropping it off. That way, she
looks curvy and sexy. I'd like to see her in a strapless dress,
with a slightly fuller short skirt, very Audrey Hepburn. She wants
to portray the image of a true star, not someone who is trendy.''
 &HT;    _ FREDERIC FEKKAI, hairstylist: ``I love Lara's dark hair. It's
very chic. I would love to see her play with it more because she
has a beautiful face and great eyes. I'd like to see it shoulder
length with long layers on the top that angle to her cheekbones,
and long, wispy bangs.''
 &HT;    _ JEANINE LOBELL, Stila Cosmetics and veteran makeup artist:
``She's one of those girls who makes you think, 'What is she going
to do this time?' You can make her look like Liz Taylor _ all retro
movie star _ or very modern and cool.''
 &HT;    
 LUCY LIU  
 &HT;    She and her ``Ally McBeal'' officemates might have been slighted
by Emmy judges, but as one of the leading sleuths on the upcoming
``Charlie's Angels'' film, she continues to raise her style
profile. Teaming up with Donatella Versace for the Oscars and MTV
Movie Awards clinched her place among Tinseltown's most fabulously
dressed.
 &HT;    _ RICHARD TYLER: ``I love her character on ``Ally McBeal.'' I
would like to see her in a really sexy red (dress) that plays off
her hair _ like our resort 2001 couture fire silk, chiffon jersey
dress. (It) is fitted and very low cut and would look gorgeous on
her. I also have a deep red, boned leather dress that would be
great.''
 &HT;    _ RANDOLPH DUKE: ``Her most memorable look this year was the red
Versace at the Oscars. I'd like to see her depart from that a bit.
I liked the dress, but I felt she might have been a little younger,
since her image is fun and hip.''
 &HT;    _ ETIENNE TAENAKA, celebrity hairstylist, Vidal Sassoon: ``Lucy
needs to glam it up a bit without being over the top. I love her
long hair, but I would like to cut a half fringe on her to the
cheekbone and dress it off to the side and leave the back very
loose with slight waves to make is softer.''
 &HT;    _ RACHEL ZOE ROSENZWEIG, stylist: ``Lucy can pull off anything.
She shouldn't go safe in an `Emmy' dress ... maybe Gaultier or
Ungaro. I think Hollywood has a problem of gauging what's sexy and
sleazy. To me, sexy is drama, the low back or the way a train falls
to the bottom.''
 &HT;    _ VIVIENNE TAM: ``She has an amazing style and is not afraid to
be a little different. I would put her in something
glamorous...maybe my black-and-gold sunburst-beaded dress. It has
an unusual back treatment using gold chains. Lucy could carry it
off perfectly!''
 &HT;    
 KATIE HOLMES  
 &HT;    She's America's sweetheart as Joey Potter on ``Dawson's Creek.''
And designers, stylists _ just about everyone, really _ can't wait
to sex her up. At 5 feet 8 inches and sample size, the fashion
world is at her bidding. Katie, it's time to graduate to the big
leagues.
 &HT;    _ GREGORY ARLT, senior makeup artist, MAC Cosmetics: ``Katie's
Emmy look should be hot and glam, unlike her TV character. It would
be a nice change to see her in deep, shimmering eye shadows and a
soft, pinky lip gloss.''
 &HT;    _ JEANNE YANG, stylist: ``Katie can definitely get away with
plunging necklines because she has a sweet look. It would be great
to see her in Yves Saint Laurent or Chloe. She would also look
great in Chanel. The juxtaposition of youth with such an
institution could really shake things up.''
 &HT;    _ RACHEL ZOE ROSENZWEIG, stylist: ``It's time for her to dress
her age. She would be stunning in Dolce &AMP; Gabbana. She'd be great
in Chloe, Alberta Ferretti and Michael Kors. She needs a designer
who can make her look more sophisticated. A bronzy brown with
shimmery gold makeup would be so beautiful.'' c.2000 Fairchild

 &HT;    
 ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS GOSSIP  
 &HT;    How do you say ``sweetie darling'' in French?
 &HT;    The world will know next year when ``Absolument Fabuleux,'' a
feature-length film based on the wacky British sitcom, is scheduled
to hit theatres in France.
 &HT;    The producer, Mosca Films, is still searching for its two
leading ladies _ the shrill, Lacroix-obsessed Edina and her blowsy,
drunken sidekick, Patsy _ but sources say Catherine Deneuve was
among the first to say ``non'' to the Patsy role.
 &HT;    Filming starts in January in Paris.
 &HT;    
 MOON WALK  
 &HT;    ``This movie isn't about cowboys, exactly,'' Clint Eastwood
explained on Aug. 1 at the Los Angeles premiere of his latest film,
``Space Cowboys.'' ``It's a tribute to the early guys, the pioneers
who sent rockets to the edge of outer space.''
 &HT;    ``We love cowboys for their boots and tight pants, and their
range-y, languorous, relaxed kind of air,'' said Barbara Babcock,
who plays Eastwood's wife. ``That's what Clint is like as a
director.''
 &HT;    ``He doesn't even say action,'' Marcia Gay Harden explained.
``Cowboys have that control and that stoicism. Women will always
find it attractive.''
 &HT;    The same seems true for men. All three of Eastwood's co-stars _
Tommy Lee Jones, James Garner and Donald Sutherland _ admitted that
it was admiration for Eastwood that drew them into the film.
 &HT;    ``I sent him a fan letter once,'' Sutherland said. Tommy Lee
Jones put it another way. ``I like the way he sees.''
 &HT;    On Aug. 2, Kevin Bacon corralled a big group to the Hollywood
premiere of ``Hollow Man.''
 &HT;    ``I've played a lot of men, but I've never played a monster,''
he said before the screening. ``That's an important part of being
an actor _ you can't be afraid of the monster in you.''
 &HT;    Bacon's wife, Kyra Sedgwick, described what it was like when the
monster came home.
 &HT;    ``I'd wake up every morning with black or green paint on me,''
she said.
 &HT;    For those on the set, however, the experience weighed more
heavily.
 &HT;    ``It's been such an ordeal, this movie,'' said director Paul
Verhoeven. ``It felt like a nightmare and I started to think I
would never get it.''
 &HT;    Josh Brolin assumed that that was the way Verhoeven wanted it.
 &HT;    ``Paul doesn't try to avoid a fuss,'' he said. ``He likes a fuss
_ for the best reasons.''
 &HT;    At the after-party, someone asked Elisabeth Shue if she believed
that there's a monster in everyone.
 &HT;    ``No,'' he replied, smiling. ``Just in men.''
 &HT;    
 THE VH1/VOGUE NOMINEES  
 &HT;    Get out your scorecards. The nominees have been chosen for the
2000 ``VH1/Vogue Fashion Awards,'' which will be presented live on
VH1 on Friday, Oct. 20, from the Theater at Madison Square Garden.
 &HT;    The nominees and winners are determined by a style council,
composed of fashion editors, journalists, curators, stylists,

Kidman, Chlo&AMP;euml; Sevigny and Charlize Theron.
 &HT;    _ Celebrity Style, Male: George Clooney, Russell Crowe, Samuel
L. Jackson, Jude Law and Joaquin Phoenix.
 &HT;    _ Most Fashionable Artist, Female: Toni Braxton, Macy Gray,
Faith Hill, Janet Jackson and Jennifer Lopez.
 &HT;    _ Most Fashionable Artist, Male: Beck, Enrique Iglesias, Jon Bon
Jovi, Ricky Martin and Sting.
 &HT;    _ Most Stylish Band: Destiny's Child, No Doubt, Red Hot Chili
Peppers, Sugar Ray and TLC.
 &HT;    _ Avant-Garde Designer: Miguel Adrover, Hussein Chalayan,
Nicolas Ghesquiere for Balenciaga, Viktor &AMP; Rolf, and Junya
Watanabe.
 &HT;    _ Model of the Year: Gisele Bundchen, Carmen Kass, Angela
Lindvall, Frankie Rayder and Maggie Rizer.
 &HT;    The nominees for the categories ``Designer of the Year,'' ``Most

by visitors to vogue.com and vh1.com Web sites. Visitors will then
cast their online vote for the winners.
 &HT;    
 THE CONCORDE? I'LL PASS  
 &HT;    Karl Lagerfeld's taking the slow plane. In the wake of the
recent Concorde crash in Paris, the designer said his days of
supersonic travel are over.
 &HT;    ``They should give the remaining Concordes to space museums as a
perfect futuristic dream of the 20th century that could not make it
into the 21st century _ a century the Concorde was supposed to
represent,'' he said. ``If one of only 12 crashed, it's not that
safe.''
 &HT;    But the fashion world still has at least one loyalist: Anna
Wintour says she's sticking to her supersonic ways.

 By ERIC WILSON 
 (Three color slides are available.) 
 From WWD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ Quick, what's new in Bill Blass' showroom?
 &HT;    Answer: Lots _ if you take a close look.
 &HT;    There are the familiar, comforting sights of Blass' men's-wear
fabrics, the pinstripes, the double-face cashmere and the silk
satin dresses, but something is not quite the same there either.
The fabrics have been turned just slightly on the bias, and dresses
and jackets have been deconstructed, with bits cut out here and
there.
 &HT;    It's been over six months since Paris ready-to-wear designer
Steven Slowik was named design director of the Bill Blass
collection, following Blass' retirement last year, and his
influence is now being felt in the house.
 &HT;    ``This is just the beginning of what I wanted to show as a
visual vocabulary,'' said Slowik, who landed the Blass job over the
likes of Randolph Duke and Alber Elbaz in February and has since
set up residence in Greenwich Village to take on the job full time.
 &HT;    A Detroit-born and Parsons-trained designer, Slowik closed his
signature business in Paris, where he had also worked as rtw
designer for Ferragamo, before moving back to New York with the
mission to create a collection that retains Blass' stamp of
elegance while attracting the next generation of Park Avenue
clientele.
 &HT;    Earlier this summer, he hired Lars Nilsson, who was design
director of the women's collection at Ralph Lauren, as his senior
designer to help with design and construction.
 &HT;    ``There are various ways you can approach a situation like this
and I think this is the right one,'' Slowik said. ``I know you
can't please everyone. Some customers might walk in here and say,
'Ew. Ick.' Or they might say, 'Ooh. Fabulous.'''
 &HT;    Of the dozen or so pieces Slowik is showing for early spring
deliveries, which will appear in stores in late December, there are
daytime looks such as a gray pinstripe pantsuit, and silk satin
cocktail gowns that have detached, contrasting collars.
 &HT;    ``The first thing I looked at were the classic elements of Bill
Blass,'' he said. ``I literally interviewed Mr. Blass and discussed
what those elements are. Then I brought in what I felt is me, which
is the whole idea of lightening up the construction, bridging what
I call the tradition and the future, bringing in my color sense,
and moving further into spring with bold prints and interesting
combinations of fabrics.''
 &HT;    Slowik tore the classic pantsuit apart at the seams to come up
with an ultra-lightweight construction, so it wears like a sweater,
and he cut heathered cashmere pants with only an internal seam so
that it feels more like a skirt, which he paired with an oyster
walking coat, made in Blass' classic double-face wool crepe.
 &HT;    Little black dresses are cut in elliptical shapes with a sheer
T-shirt overlay, which Slowik described as creating a sense of
geometry combined with one of softness. The feeling is also
reflected in a black wool crepe halter dress with a broad silk
satin ribbon running straight down the front and back.
 &HT;    ``There's definitely an inspiration from nature in this
collection,'' Slowik said. ``This would come in all the red and
pink colors, which literally come from roses, and the way things
are unfolding at the collar and opening up to reveal another color.
 &HT;    ``In general, it was also very important, even in the garments
that were more masculine-looking, to have a more feminine
influence. The idea of the satin linings and the colors are very
feminine, which is a look I feel is going to be strong for this
season.''
 &HT;    Slowik's last signature collection had more technical fabrics
than his work for Blass, and was cut close to the body. Slowik's
new touches include side-button closures, the slight bias cut of
the satin dresses and surprise cutouts, in which ``things look like
they fell apart, but it's definitely very intentional,'' he said.
 &HT;    ``The clothes don't always shout,'' Slowik said. ``But I think
that's what this is about. There's a certain luxury and modernity
about clothes that look stylish in a more subtle way.''

 &HT;    Logoed looks have always been the bread and butter of streetwear
lines, and the recent mania for designer labels has certainly
boosted the appeal.
 &HT;    This time around, however, the signature designs are more
decorative than obvious, often showing up as a repeated all-over
print.

 By MARCY MEDINA, with contributions from ROSE APODACA JONES,
CASSANDRA NYE and LAUREN CRAIG  
 (Two color slides are available.) 
 From WWD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    LOS ANGELES _ With Emmy-nominated TV hits such as ``Sex and the
City'' and ``Will &AMP; Grace'' making Jimmy Choo and Dolce &AMP; Gabbana
practically household names, the 52nd Annual Primetime Emmys are
poised to compete in that ``Style Superbowl'' that until now has
been dominated by the Oscars.
 &HT;    ``I think TV will give the Oscars fashion race a run for its
money,'' predicted Randolph Duke, who has dressed several of the
networks' leading ladies.
 &HT;    The nominees _ listed here _ are no strangers to the fashion
hoopla. Joining them here are actresses whom the Academy of
Television Arts and Sciences may have overlooked, but of whom
fashionistas can't get enough.
 &HT;    One thing is certain: If they don't look fabulous, it won't be
for lack of trying.
 &HT;    ``Given these women's status, they can afford the best,''
observed stylist Rachel Zoe Rosenzweig, who has worked with
Michelle Pfeiffer, Brooke Shields and Meg Ryan. ``They should all
take advantage of that access. If people don't want to deal with
the competition, have a dress custom made.''
 &HT;    So what should viewers expect on the big night? WWD surveyed the
experts _ the designers, stylists, magazine editors, hair stylists
and makeup artists _ about how the nominees and attendees should
look.
 &HT;    Many of those surveyed will also, inevitably, make their mark at
the broadcast Sept. 10.
 &HT;    
 SARAH JESSICA PARKER  
 &HT;    Everyone wants TV's ``It'' girl, as much for her willingness to
experiment with fashion on screen in her role as sex columnist
Carrie Bradshaw in ``Sex and the City'' _ which won her a
nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series _ as for
her experimentation with fashion offscreen.
 &HT;    Good thing she studied up on the collections as a front-row
guest at every key designer's show. She is the series co-producer,
you know.
 &HT;    _ STEFANO DOLCE and DOMENICO GABBANA: ``We would like to see
Sarah in a hot skirt with fringe and beading paired with a brocade
bustier and Swarovski-crystal-embroidered sandals. Sarah is daring
and has a unique way of interpreting fashion. She is not afraid to
take chances and always looks great.''
 &HT;    _ MARK BADGLEY and JAMES MISCHKA: ``She has a great, original
sense of style. She would look fab in a quirky, asymmetrical net
cocktail dress.''
 &HT;    _ MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``My favorite. Please tangle me up
in that hair! I'd love to see her a redhead _ deep red _ very
steamy.''
 &HT;    _ RANDOLPH DUKE: ``You always run the risk of what I call the
`beauty pageant parade' of dresses with all these pretty things
coming down the carpet. You need those women who have great bodies
and sex appeal to pepper it up. Sarah Jessica Parker can do that.
She's one who could pull off a hot pant or bra under a sheer top.''
 &HT;    _ DAVID GARDNER, hairstylist, Profile agency (who will be
styling Parker's hair on Emmy night): ``Seeing as she wore her hair
straight for the MTV Movie Awards, I think she will go curly and
wild. I know it's what I would like to see.''
 &HT;    
 JENNIFER ANISTON  
 &HT;    This newlywed is certainly not going to throw a housecoat over
that sexy figure. Playing sweet Rachel may have scored her a nod
for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for
``Friends,'' but she should take the high road to chic style.
 &HT;    _ RANDOLPH DUKE: ``With Brad Pitt in tow, it doesn't matter what
she wears. Jennifer will have everybody beat, hands down. The dress
I designed for her last year was a departure, which was nice
because you don't get that often. But since she tried it last year,
I think she will go more simple this year.''
 &HT;    _ RICHARD TYLER: ``Jennifer could be great in a dress that has a
touch of whimsy to it, not too serious, but still sophisticated.
She would be very beautiful in rich, strong turquoise or
aquamarine. Her body and skin are flawless, so she can wear
anything. I would like to keep her modern and very sexy.''
 &HT;    _ PAMELA DENNIS: ``On Emmy night, she's going to emanate what
she has for the past year, always classy and simply dressed. She
has a sex appeal that is uncoupled, and she and Brad are an
uncoupled couple. She won't change her look. It works for her.
She's with him, isn't she? Would you change your look?''
 &HT;    _ LAURENT D, hairstylist: ``I would give her curly, very natural
hair _ similar to Gisele Bundchen.''
 &HT;    _ DAVID CARDONA, designer (nominated along with Bob Mackie for
Outstanding Costumes for a Variety of Music Program for ``Cher:
Live in Concert''): ``Jennifer is fabulous. Ever since Brad,
whether he's the reason or not, she's had a six-pack stomach. I
love seeing her in hip-hugging skirts that accentuate her body. And
I don't think she is too skinny. I just think she's in great shape
for the first time in her life.''
 &HT;    _ JEANINE LOBELL, Stila Cosmetics and veteran makeup artist:
``Jennifer is beautiful in an approachable way. It would be odd to
see her completely painted. I'd like her tan and shimmering and
bronze. It's the look of somebody on holiday who threw on a gown.''
 &HT;    
 HEATHER LOCKLEAR  
 &HT;    This quintessential L.A. woman is now a New Yorker (``Spin
City'' tapes there) and a Seventh Avenue favorite. She has the
body, attitude and cult status that make her a dream for designers
such as Michael Kors and Dolce &AMP; Gabbana.
 &HT;    _ STEFANO DOLCE and DOMENICO GABBANA: ``We would like to see
Heather accentuate her great figure in a stretch chiffon dress with
a low neckline encrusted with floral beading and high-heel sandals.
Her hair and makeup (are) always perfect.''
 &HT;    _ PATRICIA FIELD and REBECCA FIELD, stylists: ``Urban sexy. Stay
with those above-the-knee hemlines.''
 &HT;    _ MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``She should try some layers and a
shorter length ... to the chin. A not so `salon perfect' style
would be so refreshing. She would rock as a shiny brunette.''
 &HT;    _ HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``The girl is up for anything. The
only thing that bothers me is she dresses a little too rock 'n'
roll sometimes. I'd probably glam her up a bit, maybe in Michael
Kors' gold matte top and skirt. There's also a great Vera Wang
short, one-shoulder dress that's gold on top and black on the
bottom. She can do metallics in an elegant way that shows off that
great figure.''
 &HT;    _ LAURENT D, hairstylist: ``I would give her a Farrah Fawcett
blow-dry.''
 &HT;    _ RACHEL ZOE ROSENZWEIG, stylist: ``She's such a bombshell.
She's innately sexy. She could wear a housecoat and still be sexy.
With Heather, the key is reversing what we expect of her. Play down
the hair and makeup. No cleavage. She should just walk onto that
carpet and people should be saying she's stunning, not hot.''
 &HT;    
 HALLE BERRY  
 &HT;    OK, already, the world knows you've got the bod. Enough of the
cha-cha duds. She looked stunning in that white Valentino gown
peppered with red roses when she won a Golden Globe as Dorothy
Dandridge in the HBO production.
 &HT;    Primed to scoop a second trophy for the role as Outstanding Lead
Actress in a Miniseries or Movie, she would be wise to summon the
elegant heroine she portrayed.
 &HT;    _ ELIZABETH STEWART, creative director of style, New York Times
Magazine: ``I would love to see Halle in something that's not a
bikini top, doesn't bare her midriff or have fringe. She'd look
great in a draped chiffon evening dress from Donna Karan's fall
2000 collection.''
 &HT;    _ BRADLEY BAYOU, couturier and TV host: ``She's a dream. Lately,
some of her choices have been a little out-there. When you look
like she does, you don't need to display yourself like that. But
with a body like that, you can't go wrong. Good or bad, she's
taking those chances, and God bless her.''
 &HT;    _ HAL RUBENSTEIN, fashion director, InStyle: ``There's nothing
Halle Berry can't wear. The woman radiates great energy. There's a
very gamine quality about her, and yet she has a womanly figure.
Most fun for Halle would be Galliano's resort collection, wines and
mustards that are overtly sexy yet not cheap.''
 &HT;    _ PAMELA DENNIS: ``She always picks something beautiful and
of-the-moment. She's a chameleon. She can pull off a Madonna or an
Ashley Judd, going very couture or very hot and sexy.''
 &HT;    _ PATRICIA FIELD and REBECCA FIELD, stylists: ``Serve up all
your gorgeousness and lusciousness. If you've got it, naked is
best.''
 &HT;    
 SELA WARD  
 &HT;    As InStyle's Hal Rubenstein noted, here's more proof that some
things in Hollywood can get better with age. Nominated for
Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for ``Once and Again''
(she already took home a statuette in that category in 1994 for
``Sisters''), Ward can pull off just about any look and designer.
Play up the drama, sister.
 &HT;    _ MARK BADGLEY and JAMES MISCHKA: ``Such a beauty. We would put
Sela in very classic, dramatic shapes, probably dark _ think John
Singer Sargent portraits.''
 &HT;    _ RACHEL ZOE ROSENZWEIG, stylist: ``Sela radiates beauty, even
when she's in shorts and a tank top. She's 40-something and proud
of it. I'd put her in something European. But I wouldn't rule
anything out because the Americans are now getting more edgy. She
absolutely should have something with a low back that trains behind
her.''
 &HT;    _ HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Sela Ward is just the most
smashing-looking lady, but she wears black an awful lot. If
anything, here is a woman who could wear those great jewel tones
for fall, like a carnelian gown by Richard Tyler, or the tremendous
gowns by Donna Karan. She would look spectacular in a diaphanous
dress with an uneven hem or a leather top with a full skirt.''
 &HT;    _ ETIENNE TAENAKA, celebrity hairstylist, Vidal Sassoon: ``At
44, Sela looks fabulous! She should take advantage of what she's
got. Skintight Versace all the way. Clean and glamorous makeup and
her hair dressed down to say that she still has a casual attitude
about getting all glammed up.''
 &HT;    
 KIM CATTRALL  
 &HT;    Flaunt be thy middle name. The ``Sex and the City'' sexpot,
nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for
her role as Samantha, can work it to the hilt. She reminds
hairstylist Laurent D of a modern-day Marilyn Monroe. But that
blond bombshell never made fans blush. Just a reminder, Kim, the
Emmys aren't on cable.
 &HT;    _ ELIZABETH STEWART, New York Times Magazine: ``She has a slight
`cheese' factor and should just go with it. Wear an over-the-top
'80s look from Celine, Versace or Christian Dior.''
 &HT;    _ BRADLEY BAYOU: ``Kim has made some bad choices and good. She
knows she's sexy, but sometimes you can be a little more subtle.
Still, I love her because she has a sense of style all her own.''
 &HT;    _ RANDOLPH DUKE: ``Kim has had a phenomenal year. She just gets
better and better. She's more beautiful now than she ever has been,
and success has treated her well. I think she will go simple and
maybe a little more couture in feeling than she has in the past.''
 &HT;    _ PATRICIA FIELD and REBECCA FIELD, stylists: ``We want her to
serve it up in the style of Samantha. We'd like her to go not as
Kim Cattrall, but fiercer _ more in character. She should arrive
like the 'A' star she's become. Joan Collins, move over.''
 &HT;    _ RICCI DE MARITNO, stylist, Cloutier agency: ``Kim is the
epitome of sexiness. No matter what you put her in, it takes on a
sexy energy. I would get really slinky and sexy and nod to retro
Hollywood. You glam up Kim, and she carries it off.''
 &HT;    _ MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``Her beauty slays me. I would
grow (the hair) length, shag the top and go less blond _ it's too
cliche. I would do a deeper base with golden honey highlights.''
 &HT;    
 DEBRA MESSING  
 &HT;    Fans can't get enough of her or her show, ``Will and Grace.''
Neither could the judges when they nominated her for Outstanding
Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. As Grace, she's incredibly
accessible. But with those emerald eyes and auburn hair, she should
opt for pared-down elegance, maybe something black, when she hits
the red carpet.
 &HT;    _ MARK BADGLEY and JAMES MISCHKA: ``With such classic features,
that gorgeous hair and perfect skin, we think Debra would look
beautiful in something dark _ even black _ in a revealing cut.''
 &HT;    _ FREDERIC FEKKAI, hairstylist: ``I love Debra. For her, I like
the look of curly locks coming down around that beautiful face.
It's a little bit undone, which is a very nice look.''
 &HT;    _ GREGORY ALT, senior makeup artist at MAC Cosmetics: ``We have
grown to love Deborah as a quirky, adorable Lucille Ball type, so
it would be fun to see her let go a bit and explore her sexy side.
Smoky, plum-colored eyes with a light, rich plum gloss on her lips
would look great.''
 &HT;    _ JEANNE YANG, stylist: ``I adore her character, but she's
sometimes a little too elegant and could stand to be more funked
up. I could see what Galliano could do for her. She needs to be
more eclectic, not so gowny. It's high summer in L.A. so why not go
for something much more fun and interesting?''
 &HT;    
 LARA FLYNN BOYLE  
 &HT;    The Bedazzler studded Bob Seger T-shirt looked more MTV Music
Awards than Golden Globes, but leave it up to ``The Practice'' star
to shed her Armani district attorney duds for riskier statements by
rising designers. What will Jack Nicholson's cookie come up with
next? Note to her stylist: These are the Emmys.
 &HT;    _ RACHEL ZOE ROSENZWEIG, celebrity stylist: ``She should wear
something that accentuates her, like a bias-cut dress. If thin
actors don't want to be on the cover of every magazine as the
``starved actors,'' then they need to go with something flowy.
Maybe Chanel or Ungaro or Alberta Ferretti. Something that isn't
going to show bones.''
 &HT;    _ DAVID CARDONA, designer: ``When I dress her, I tuck the fabric
right under the rear instead of dropping it off. That way, she
looks curvy and sexy. I'd like to see her in a strapless dress,
with a slightly fuller short skirt, very Audrey Hepburn. She wants
to portray the image of a true star, not someone who is trendy.''
 &HT;    _ FREDERIC FEKKAI, hairstylist: ``I love Lara's dark hair. It's
very chic. I would love to see her play with it more because she
has a beautiful face and great eyes. I'd like to see it shoulder
length with long layers on the top that angle to her cheekbones,
and long, wispy bangs.''
 &HT;    _ JEANINE LOBELL, Stila Cosmetics and veteran makeup artist:
``She's one of those girls who makes you think, 'What is she going
to do this time?' You can make her look like Liz Taylor _ all retro
movie star _ or very modern and cool.''
 &HT;    
 LUCY LIU  
 &HT;    She and her ``Ally McBeal'' officemates might have been slighted
by Emmy judges, but as one of the leading sleuths on the upcoming
``Charlie's Angels'' film, she continues to raise her style
profile. Teaming up with Donatella Versace for the Oscars and MTV
Movie Awards clinched her place among Tinseltown's most fabulously
dressed.
 &HT;    _ RICHARD TYLER: ``I love her character on ``Ally McBeal.'' I
would like to see her in a really sexy red (dress) that plays off
her hair _ like our resort 2001 couture fire silk, chiffon jersey
dress. (It) is fitted and very low cut and would look gorgeous on
her. I also have a deep red, boned leather dress that would be
great.''
 &HT;    _ RANDOLPH DUKE: ``Her most memorable look this year was the red
Versace at the Oscars. I'd like to see her depart from that a bit.
I liked the dress, but I felt she might have been a little younger,
since her image is fun and hip.''
 &HT;    _ ETIENNE TAENAKA, celebrity hairstylist, Vidal Sassoon: ``Lucy
needs to glam it up a bit without being over the top. I love her
long hair, but I would like to cut a half fringe on her to the
cheekbone and dress it off to the side and leave the back very
loose with slight waves to make is softer.''
 &HT;    _ RACHEL ZOE ROSENZWEIG, stylist: ``Lucy can pull off anything.
She shouldn't go safe in an `Emmy' dress ... maybe Gaultier or
Ungaro. I think Hollywood has a problem of gauging what's sexy and
sleazy. To me, sexy is drama, the low back or the way a train falls
to the bottom.''
 &HT;    _ VIVIENNE TAM: ``She has an amazing style and is not afraid to
be a little different. I would put her in something
glamorous...maybe my black-and-gold sunburst-beaded dress. It has
an unusual back treatment using gold chains. Lucy could carry it
off perfectly!''
 &HT;    
 KATIE HOLMES  
 &HT;    She's America's sweetheart as Joey Potter on ``Dawson's Creek.''
And designers, stylists _ just about everyone, really _ can't wait
to sex her up. At 5 feet 8 inches and sample size, the fashion
world is at her bidding. Katie, it's time to graduate to the big
leagues.
 &HT;    _ GREGORY ARLT, senior makeup artist, MAC Cosmetics: ``Katie's
Emmy look should be hot and glam, unlike her TV character. It would
be a nice change to see her in deep, shimmering eye shadows and a
soft, pinky lip gloss.''
 &HT;    _ JEANNE YANG, stylist: ``Katie can definitely get away with
plunging necklines because she has a sweet look. It would be great
to see her in Yves Saint Laurent or Chloe. She would also look
great in Chanel. The juxtaposition of youth with such an
institution could really shake things up.''
 &HT;    _ RACHEL ZOE ROSENZWEIG, stylist: ``It's time for her to dress
her age. She would be stunning in Dolce &AMP; Gabbana. She'd be great
in Chloe, Alberta Ferretti and Michael Kors. She needs a designer
who can make her look more sophisticated. A bronzy brown with
shimmery gold makeup would be so beautiful.'' c.2000 Fairchild

 By RICHARD ROEPER  
 c.2000 The Chicago Sun-Times  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a story out of Denver about a 27-year-old man in the
left field stands at Coors Field who performed what sounded like
one of the most remarkable feats in modern fan history.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning of a game between the Colorado Rockies and
the San Francisco Giants, Dan Sauvageau caught a home run ball.
</P>
<P>
   And then he caught another one.
</P>
<P>
   In the same inning.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the serendipity: Each of the blasts _ by Rockies
players Mike Lansing and Jeff Cirillo, respectively _ traveled the
same distance, an estimated 372 feet. You could have two major
leaguers standing at home plate and hitting balls off a tee from
now until Labor Day, and they couldn't duplicate that feat if they
tried.
</P>
<P>
   How many tens of thousands of loyal fans trek to the ballpark
year after year without so much as getting their palms stung by a
ball? And you're telling me this guy nabbed two dingers in the same
inning? That's like picking up Christy Turlington for a first date
only to have her say, ``This is my girlfriend Elizabeth Hurley,
mind if she tags along? She likes kegger parties, too!''
</P>
<P>
   OK, not exactly like that, but still.
</P>
<P>
   The story behind the story, though, is a bit funkier. Turns out
both home runs landed in a seating area for disabled fans and their
companions _ and Sauvageau is in the companion category, as he was
at the game with four disabled people, including his father.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we've got a scenario that plays like something from a
Farrelly brothers movie. Is it even fair to keep a home run ball if
you're an able-bodied individual sharing a seating section with
many disabled folks?
</P>
<P>
   These were the 11th and 12th home run balls caught by Sauvageau
this year. By now, you'd think he'd be tossing the souvenirs to
nearby kids or deliberately muffing them just to give someone else
a chance.
</P>
<P>
   When I was 9 years old, a Kansas City Royals pitcher named Al
Fitzmorris handed me a ball during batting practice. What a guy. I
still can't believe he's not in the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   That was the only time I ever got a major league ball, and it
was literally a gimme. Since then, I've been to approximately 300
major league games, but the closest I've come to catching a ball
was last year at Jacobs Field, when a line shot ricocheted off my
hand and landed gently in the lap of a young woman who almost
immediately got on her cell phone and started bragging about
``catching'' a foul ball.
</P>
<P>
   But each time I arrive at the park, I check out the nearby fans
_ the plan being that I'll make a spectacular but casual catch, and
then gallantly turn the ball over to a nearby moppet or a Piper
Perabo-lookalike who will swoon. Not even the Cleveland experience
of '99 deters me from this plan. I'll be 92 years old and arriving
at White Sox games in my jetpack with senior citizens parking, and
I'll still be thinking about who will get the ball when I make that
crowd-pleasing catch.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it usually works out that way when somebody makes a
catch, as illustrated by these two quick stories told to me by
White Sox fans.
</P>
<P>
   First, there's Tricia, who took her young Irish cousins, ages 12
and 15, to Comiskey Park when they were visiting Chicago earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   They were having a great time, which got even better when _ I'll
let Tricia tell the story.
</P>
<P>
   ''(A Sox player) tossed a spare ball directly to Kate (the
12-year-old), but then comes this mean, thirtysomething, drunk fan
who literally pushed Kate out of the way and caught the ball in his
gloved left hand! And he actually walked away proudly!''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry about that, Kate. I can only hope the brute one day goes
to a rugby match in Ireland and rudely shoves a Guinness-fueled fan
or three.
</P>
<P>
   Story two comes from ``Bill from the South Side,'' who was in
Section 118, Row 19, for a Sox-Yankees game when a Bernie Williams
foul ball came his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball hit the hands of the guy behind me and landed on the
seat below him,'' says Bill. ``Naturally, I went for the ball _ and
so did about seven other people. I had my entire left hand around
the ball when I heard a growling noise. One of the fans in the
scrum actually growled and bit me! I even had two teeth-shaped
scabs on my hand _ but no, I didn't hang onto the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Each time a baseball goes into the crowd, it takes with it the
potential for a miniature drama. A Colorado ballhog, a disappointed
Irish girl, a South Sider who ends up with teeth marks etched into
his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I should forget about the hero fantasies and start
thinking about a ducking strategy.

WHAT GORE'S PICK BRINGS TO THE TABLE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BILL THOMPSON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We've heard lots of reasons why Al Gore chose Sen. Joseph
Lieberman as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Such as: Having made headlines as an outspoken critic of Bill
Clinton's personal misconduct, Lieberman insulates Gore from the
president's sex scandal; as a ``centrist'' who is perceived as more
conservative than Gore on certain issues, Lieberman broadens the
appeal of the Democratic ticket; being a highly qualified,
articulate individual who has earned the respect of colleagues in
both parties, the senator from Connecticut matches up well against
Republican counterpart Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   There is some truth in all of these. Lieberman is so widely
respected, in fact, that hardly anyone could think of anything
negative to say about him once word leaked out that he would be
Gore's pick.
</P>
<P>
   But one aspect of the Lieberman selection that I haven't heard
anyone mention is the one that would seem to be most obvious:
Lieberman was the only person on Gore's vice presidential ``short
list'' who was more boring than Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Lieberman is a fine man and an outstanding public servant.
It took plenty of principle and enormous courage for him to stand
on the floor of the U.S. Senate on Sept. 3, 1998, and declare that
Clinton's sexual dalliance with a White House intern was ``not just
inappropriate'' but ``immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is a class act.
</P>
<P>
   But if anyone in Washington, D.C., is more charisma-challenged
than Gore, this is the guy. One of his Yale Law School classmates
said on television the other day that Lieberman's nickname back
then was ``senator.'' That's ``senator,'' not ``scintillating.''
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, it's hard to fault Gore for seeking out a running mate
who won't outshine him on the campaign trail. It's perfectly
understandable that a man who's been vice president for eight years
wouldn't want to play second fiddle to his own second fiddle.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Lieberman's low-key style puts him on even footing with
the laid-back Cheney, who could probably market videotapes of his
GOP convention speech as a cure for insomnia.
</P>
<P>
   If these guys face off in a televised debate this fall, nobody
will ever know who won because nobody will be awake when it's over.
</P>
<P>
   But seriously, folks, picking Lieberman for the ticket was a
brilliant if somewhat cynical maneuver by Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Republican nominee George W. Bush opted for quality and
qualifications in teaming up with Cheney, Gore selected a running
mate whose reputation and resume are unassailable. And Gore went
Bush one better by choosing a partner whose positions on a number
of issues have been so similar to the opponents' that the opponents
were hard-pressed to find fault with him.
</P>
<P>
   As a bonus, Lieberman is the first Jew ever to run on a major
party's national ticket _ which appeals not just to Jewish voters
but to all forward-thinking Americans who believe in opening doors
to those who have found them closed in the past.
</P>
<P>
   As an added bonus, Gore's running mate is automatically immune
to criticism from those who fear that to attack Lieberman might be
to invite accusations of anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   If politics is football _ and if Dennis Miller is ranting in the
booth alongside Al Michaels, it must be _ then Gore just pulled off
the equivalent of a successful double-reverse on fourth down and
forever. Nice move, Al _ that's Gore, not Michaels.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the cynical part.
</P>
<P>
   Does Al Gore really believe that the electorate is so gullible
that his choice of a Clinton critic to run for vice president will
negate the current vice president's role as Clinton's apologist in
chief _ not just in the sex scandal but in every despicable double
cross that Clinton has perpetrated against the American people?
</P>
<P>
   Gore even led the pro-Clinton pep rally on the day that the
president of the United States was impeached, proclaiming that
Clinton would go down in history as ``one of our greatest
presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Voters will judge Gore on his record, not
Lieberman's.

SPECIAL BASEBALL CARD IS A HIT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ Where can I write to Brian Seigel, the purchaser of the
Honus Wagner baseball card?
</P>
<P>
   _ J.G., Burleson, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ You may be able to reach him in care of American
Express Equipment Finance, 1851 E. First St., Suite 600, Santa Ana,
CA 92705.
</P>
<P>
   Seigel, who paid $1.265 million for the 1909 Wagner card in an
online auction, founded an equipment-financing company in 1984 with
$1,000 of his own money. He was one of the principal shareholders
when the company was sold to American Express in 1999 for $61
million.
</P>
<P>
   The card, part of an American Tobacco Co. set, is in the best
shape of the 50 Wagner cards known to exist from that set. Seigel's
purchase price is the highest ever paid for a baseball card.
</P>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ Who are the lead singers of the Righteous Brothers?
</P>
<P>
   _ S.W., Granbury, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ Bobby Hatfield and Bill Medley, who first sang together
as teen-agers in Orange County, Calif., in the early '60s.

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A clear majority of New Yorkers who believe
Hillary Rodham Clinton hurled an anti-Semitic slur at a former
campaign worker more than 25 years ago won't vote against her in
the U.S. Senate election because of it, according to one poll.
</P>
<P>
   The survey released Wednesday by Quinnipiac University shows the
first lady's support among registered Jewish voters has waned
slightly since mid-July, when accusations surfaced that she made
the profane comment the night her husband lost an Arkansas
congressional race in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clinton's denial that she used the slur, 40 percent of
the 1,203 registered voters surveyed believe the allegation, the
poll shows. However, 88 percent of those people ``say it will have
no impact on how they vote,'' said Quinnipiac pollster Mickey
Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   It could not be determined whether those voters supported or
opposed Clinton to begin with. Fewer voters, 38 percent, don't
believe the accusation.
</P>
<P>
   Among Jewish voters, Clinton continues to lead her Republican
opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, 52-36 percent. Last month, before the
slur accusations came to light, Clinton led Lazio 54-34 among
Jewish voters. But 47 percent of Jewish voters indicated they are
unclear where Lazio stands on pro-Israel issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, support of Israel has been a must in New York
elections and Mrs. Clinton out-scores Representative Lazio slightly
on this issue,'' Carroll said. ``Almost half the voters just don't
know where he stands on Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Clinton ``inched'' ahead of Lazio, 46-43 percent,
Carroll said. The poll, taken Aug. 1-7, has a 2.8-point margin of
error. A Zogby International poll released last week showed Lazio
leading Clinton, 50-42 percent.

   WILDFIRE-POLICY _ This summer's Western wildfires, the worst in
half a century, have rekindled memories of the Big Burn of 1910, a
killer blaze that consumed millions of acres in three days and
resulted in the U.S. Forest Service's fire suppression policy. That

<P>
   MORALITY-ISSUE _ The issue of declining morality has vigorously
returned to presidential politics, but with significant twists. The
rhetoric of the Republican National Convention and the choice of
Sen. Joseph Lieberman as the Democrats' candidate for vice
president indicate that soft societal values about lack of
community and integrity are ``in,'' while debate on hard-edged,

<P>
   BUSH-CHARACTER _ While it might seem a foolproof campaign
strategy for George W. Bush to impugn the integrity of the only
impeached president of the 20th century, political experts say he
needs to be careful in dealing with the character issue. Some
critics say Bush is damaging his own integrity by insisting that
his stump speeches about ``honor'' and ``values'' are not aimed at
President Clinton. About 1,000
</P>
<P>
   GENOME-SALES _ Many scientists fretted about the potential for
Celera Genomics to horde the treasures it might unearth in the
Human Genome Project, but many organizations now are deciding it's
worth it to pay the maverick company for access to its huge
database rather than wait for the federal government to make the
information available online. About 1,500

   QIUBAN VILLAGE, China _ It's election day in this watermelon-
and peach-growing village of 660 people and the elementary school
is festooned with colorful flags. One by one, peasants file into a
classroom and step behind the pink sheets to enter the voting
booth.
</P>
<P>
   To Charles Costello, director of the Carter Center's Democracy
Program, those pink sheets are a small but sure sign that democracy
is developing in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most organized I've seen it,'' he said, looking at
villagers lined up outside to await their turn.
</P>
<P>
   Costello was impressed: Qiuban not only provided secret voting
booths, but when it was all over, ballots were sorted and counted
in public, each vote hand-tallied on a large piece of paper posted
on the wall while villagers watched under the beating sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually it is the other way around _ public voting, secret
counting,'' according to a January Carter Center report.
</P>
<P>
   While all of China's 930,000 villages are required by a 1987 law
to hold elections for village chief, only an estimated one-third to
two-thirds have actually done so. And when they do, the elections
are often full of irregularities, not just on election day, but in
the whole nominating process leading up to the vote.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most serious problems of village elections _
acknowledged even by Chinese officials _ is interference from local
Communist Party bureaucrats. They often make it clear to voters
which candidate to support; in some instances, they have even
kicked an elected village chief out of office.
</P>
<P>
   Still, experts both inside and outside of China believe the
decade-long experiment with village elections has yielded real
steps toward democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot say all these elections are just meaningless,''
said Yawei Liu, a history professor at Georgia Perimeter College
who helps lead the Carter Center's China village elections project.
``To a certain extent, that's true. But you've got to see the other
side of the coin. These elections have empowered the villagers.
They've become bolder in demanding better accountability, demanding
the party can't be there forever.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not what the party had in mind when it introduced village
elections in 1987. The Chinese leadership saw them as a way to
maintain control and stability in the restive countryside, where
three-quarters of the population lives. It was also a way to make
villagers more accepting of unpopular policies, such as increased
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In a visit last week to three villages in Fujian province, the
Atlanta-based Carter Center, which is working with the Ministry of
Civil Affairs to computerize election data and develop voting
procedures, was treated to a stack of letters from villagers
complaining about manipulation of elections and other problems. Liu
saw that as a good sign _ that villagers take the elections
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Fujian is a prosperous coastal province that may be best known
for sending emigrants to every corner of the world. In the
countryside, peasants have enough to eat, children go to school,
young adults find jobs in nearby towns.
</P>
<P>
   But the villages still lag far behind urban areas. The road to
Qiuban is not paved. Of the 169 households, only about 20 have
phone lines. In Linxian village, portraits of Marx, Lenin and
Stalin hang on the classroom walls.
</P>
<P>
   In Qiuban, three men declared their candidacy for village chief
_ a farmer, a mini-bus driver and a shop owner _ none of them party
members. Official campaigning consisted of one evening of
speech-making and question-answering. A week later, all but 25 of
the 444 eligible voters cast a ballot.
</P>
<P>
   An edited video-tape of the speeches was shown to the Carter
Center delegation. For more than four hours, villagers peppered
candidates with questions: ``How will you raise our income?''
``What will you do for the elderly?'' ``How will you resolve
conflicts between the village committee and the party?'' ``How will
you fulfill your duties in the village if you work in town?''
</P>
<P>
   The three answered mostly with general pledges to do the best
job they can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was satisfied with the answers, but whether the candidates
can fulfill their promises in uncertain.'' said Wang Zipai, a
village farmer.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, a run-off had to be held between the farmer and the
mini-bus driver because neither got a majority.
</P>
<P>
   Wang Jimin, the village party chief, says elections are ``the
demand of the villagers.'' To him, democracy means that, ``all of
the people will be the master of the state, and they can chose a
leader that they trust on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   That Fujian is generally agreed to be leading this nation of 1.2
billion in electoral work is due perhaps to people like Zhang
Xiaogan, a 26-year veteran of the People's Liberation Army, who has
run the province's grassroots democratic work for 15 years as an
official of the Civil Affairs Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   In response to villagers' complaints, he has helped implement
some fundamental changes, such as requiring public posting of
village finances and allowing villagers a say in who is selected
party chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We provide glasses for people in case they need them,'' he
says excitedly while giving a tour of a polling site to an
observer. ``For those who are illiterate and can't write the name,
we have teachers to help them. If they don't trust the teachers,
they can choose any two people they want.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Shi Tianjian, a professor of political science at Duke
University who has researched village elections, said villagers
need to vote several times before they grasp what elections can do
for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually you need three rounds of elections to make the Chinese
peasants realize this is their opportunity to get rid of the bad
guy and get the good guy in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shi believes China is developing along the lines of Taiwan and
South Korea, where pressure from the grassroots level eventually
brought about open elections and an end to their authoritarian
governments.
</P>
<P>
   In mainland China, after more than a decade of voting at the
village level, direct elections have just recently begun to trickle
to townships, the next administrative level.
</P>
<P>
   Whether village elections will indeed one day lead to the
dreaded ``D-word'' _ democracy _ is not something openly discussed
among Chinese officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Ministry of Civil Affair)'s perspective is, you don't
have to talk about what it's going to lead to,'' Liu said. ``You
de-emphasize the political meaning. The more you talk about it, the
more scared the opponents of those elections are going to become.
So you just keep doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, village democracy has been getting
attention not just from foreign NGOs but from scholarly circles
within China as well.
</P>
<P>
   An independent project to promote village autonomy was started
up last December under the Unirule Institute of Economics, a
liberal Beijing think tank. ``Univillage'' has run into a few
snags, including a lack of financing and the project head getting
detained by Beijing police for a few weeks in July.
</P>
<P>
   But Zhou Hongling, a former bank manager from Hebei who says he
has been working for democracy in China for many years, insists the
project is on track. To him, the countryside is China's best hope
of political reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not too optimistic about working for democracy in the
cities,'' he said. ``But rural democratization will surpass urban
democratization.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused, then add, ``It already has.''

   JERUSALEM _ Their common enemies are microscopic. Their team
consists of both Arabs and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Medicine has long been one field that crossed lines between
Israelis and Palestinians. Building on that tradition, the Kuvin
Centre(CQ) for the Study of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, based
at Israel's Hebrew University in Jerusalem, has projects ranging
from Israel to Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world doesn't know these things go on,'' said Dr. Sanford
Kuvin, a Palm Beach, Fla. infectious disease specialist who founded
the center in 1976. His explanation for the teamwork is simple:
``Mosquitoes don't recognize borders.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuvin, 70, knows mosquitoes. In 1962, he helped develop an
antibody test for malaria, a major breakthrough in detecting the
mosquito-borne disease.
</P>
<P>
   He has testified before the U.S. Congress about AIDS and
Hepatitis B policy. And he was the medical advisor to Kimberly
Bergalis, a Florida woman who died after becoming the first
confirmed case of a patient contracting AIDS from her dentist.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, Kuvin came to Israel to meet with colleagues and saw
the potential for research in a country with high medical standards
in a region with many tropical diseases.
</P>
<P>
   He set up the center in 1976. It became a lead agency in the
fight against the Rift Valley Fever, which killed thousands of
Egyptians and threatened to eliminate Egypt's cattle stock in the
late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The collaboration between Israeli and Egyptian health workers
coincided with the peace process between their two countries.
Together, they vaccinated every head of cattle in Egypt and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, with money from the U.S. Agency for
International Development, the European Union and the German
Science Foundation, the Kuvin Centre has worked in several
countries _ including Greece, Mali, Jordan and Brazil. It also
works on projects with countries where Israel does not have full
relations _ such as Morocco and Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, the focus is on leishmaniasis(CQ), a disease that
can cause disfiguring boils and, in a less common form, death. The
disease afflicts 400,000 people a year, mainly in the Mediterranean
region, Latin America and India.
</P>
<P>
   It is carried by parasites in sand flies. The flies bite
animals, including dogs, which are then infected and carry the
disease. Other flies spread it from the infected animals to humans.
There are cures, but they involve highly toxic drugs that can
damage organs.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers collect sand fly larvae from the West Bank and
Israel, study the flies' behavior and genetic make-up. The goal is
to control the spread of the disease and find better cures.
</P>
<P>
   The project is based at the Kuvin Centre, but includes the
Palestinian Al-Quds University.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they are applying for grant money to expand the
project, including a Palestinian clinic for treating and
researching the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Ziad Abdeen, dean of research at Al-Quds and the Palestinian
coordinator on the project, said such co the shool involved in more
than 52 joint projects, Palestinians recognize that such efforts
are ``good for Palestinians and good for the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not all science,'' he said of his relations with his
Israeli peers. ``They get to know our attitudes, our culture.
Through collaboration you get to understanding, and trust.''
</P>
<P>
   The skills Palestinians learn researching leishmaniasis can be
used on other diseases, improving the young crop of Palestinian
healthworkers in their new health system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not feel inferior. I have studied at some of the best
schools in the world. But, my system is inferior. We do not have
the facilities,'' Abdeen said.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Unlike Fox Mulder of The X-Files, Russian mathematician
Alexander Golod doesn't believe the truth is out there _ he says
it's in there.
</P>
<P>
   In a four-story gray pyramid, to be precise, that rises
majestically _ and unexpectedly _ from a forest-lined potato field
alongside the main highway leading north from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Golod, an academic turned businessman, built the structure
because he believes in what he calls ``Pyramid Power,'' a force
that mankind can harness to cure AIDS and eliminate crime, civil
war, bad harvests, cancer and earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a faith healer, I am a scientist,'' said Golod, a
scruffy, pale man whose long face exudes contentment. ``As a result
of this pyramid being built, I predict that AIDS and hepatitis will
disappear (in the Moscow region) in a few years.''
</P>
<P>
   His predictions are based, he says, not on the supernatural but
on scientific truths and mathematical theorems that humans do not
yet understand. All you have to do, he says, is believe.
</P>
<P>
   And thousands of Russians, bored or disenchanted with
traditional religions, do, making Golod's pyramids _ he's already
built eight _ Meccas of the paranormal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drank the water, and I lost my headaches. I bought the
stones, and my garden bloomed,'' said a 44-year-old woman named
Lena, referring to the amulets she bought after they had been
``charged'' inside Golod's pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   As she stood in line on a recent rainy afternoon to visit the
hollow, fiberglass structure, Lena was happy to talk about her
belief in the pyramid's healing powers but refused to give her last
name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't go so far as to say it's a holy place, but there is a
current of energy that is unmistakable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Golod, who owns a used tire business and is a military defense
contractor, says the cosmos suffers disease and war because space
is distorted by negative human actions. He claims the pyramid's
measurements, based on ancient mathematical equations used by the
Egyptians, re-balance cosmic forces within the pyramid itself.
According to this logic, the bigger the pyramid, the bigger is its
influence on the natural world.
</P>
<P>
   The Moscow pyramid _ completed last December _ is Golod's
largest and most expensive project. Built without nails, the
structure took almost two years and $800,000 to complete, he says.
Costs for the others averaged about $125,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Golod's most famous pyramid is on Lake Seliger in northern
Russia, a site he chose because it was located under a hole in the
ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several months after we built this in 1997, the hole was back
to normal,'' he says excitedly, displaying what he says are before
and after pictures taken by Russian weather satellites. ``Just
think of what would happen if we built a bigger (pyramid) in the
Southern Hemisphere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You Americans, you could rid yourself of tornadoes with a few
of these,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Golod's ideas have been embraced by Russian cosmonauts, medical
doctors and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of amethysts charged at the Moscow pyramid were taken
aboard the space station Mir to promote world peace. And Russia's
Olympic rowers and wrestlers are taking Golod's rocks to the Sydney
Games this summer, hoping the stones will aid their performances.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some visitors to the pyramid are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Igor Sechin, a 31-year-old father of one, was one of hundreds of
people who came on a recent weekend to visit the pyramid out of
curiosity. He said the trip didn't make him a believer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of people who believe that pyramid will cure them are
the kind of people that will believe anything. Only those kind of
people would buy this junk,'' Sechin said, pointing to the $10
model pyramids and $1 bottles of pyramid water sold outside.
</P>
<P>
   Golod rejects charges of hucksterism. He produces reams of paper
with test results from Moscow research institutes to support his
claims that pyramids affect the natural world. A study last year by
the Moscow Institute for Experimental and Theoretical Biophysics
found that water exposed to the pyramids has ``a stimulating effect
on the ability of human cells to survive and proliferate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take me 30 years (of selling souvenirs) to recoup my
costs,'' he said, sitting in his rundown Moscow office decorated
with a five-foot-tall plastic globe. ``I'm doing what I can to
improve the planet. There is no escaping that we are all connected
to its future. I want to make the Earth a better place for my
grandchildren to live.''

</P>
<P>
   Ziad Abdeen, dean of research at Al-Quds and the Palestinian
coordinator on the project, said such cooperative projects used to
be frowned upon by other Palestinians. Now, with the school
involved in more than 52 joint projects, Palestinians recognize
that such efforts are ``good for Palestinians and good for the
peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not all science,'' he said of his relations with his
Israeli peers. ``They get to know our attitudes, our culture.
Through collaboration you get to understanding, and trust.''
</P>
<P>
   The skills Palestinians learn researching leishmaniasis can be
used on other diseases, improving the young crop of Palestinian
healthworkers in their new health system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not feel inferior. I have studied at some of the best
schools in the world. But, my system is inferior. We do not have
the facilities,'' Abdeen said.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Unlike Fox Mulder of The X-Files, Russian mathematician
Alexander Golod doesn't believe the truth is out there _ he says
it's in there.
</P>
<P>
   In a four-story gray pyramid, to be precise, that rises
majestically _ and unexpectedly _ from a forest-lined potato field
alongside the main highway leading north from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Golod, an academic turned businessman, built the structure
because he believes in what he calls ``Pyramid Power,'' a force
that mankind can harness to cure AIDS and eliminate crime, civil
war, bad harvests, cancer and earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a faith healer, I am a scientist,'' said Golod, a
scruffy, pale man whose long face exudes contentment. ``As a result
of this pyramid being built, I predict that AIDS and hepatitis will
disappear (in the Moscow region) in a few years.''
</P>
<P>
   His predictions are based, he says, not on the supernatural but
on scientific truths and mathematical theorems that humans do not
yet understand. All you have to do, he says, is believe.
</P>
<P>
   And thousands of Russians, bored or disenchanted with
traditional religions, do, making Golod's pyramids _ he's already
built eight _ Meccas of the paranormal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drank the water, and I lost my headaches. I bought the
stones, and my garden bloomed,'' said a 44-year-old woman named
Lena, referring to the amulets she bought after they had been
``charged'' inside Golod's pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   As she stood in line on a recent rainy afternoon to visit the
hollow, fiberglass structure, Lena was happy to talk about her
belief in the pyramid's healing powers but refused to give her last
name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't go so far as to say it's a holy place, but there is a
current of energy that is unmistakable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Golod, who owns a used tire business and is a military defense
contractor, says the cosmos suffers disease and war because space
is distorted by negative human actions. He claims the pyramid's
measurements, based on ancient mathematical equations used by the
Egyptians, re-balance cosmic forces within the pyramid itself.
According to this logic, the bigger the pyramid, the bigger is its
influence on the natural world.
</P>
<P>
   The Moscow pyramid _ completed last December _ is Golod's
largest and most expensive project. Built without nails, the
structure took almost two years and $800,000 to complete, he says.
Costs for the others averaged about $125,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Golod's most famous pyramid is on Lake Seliger in northern
Russia, a site he chose because it was located under a hole in the
ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several months after we built this in 1997, the hole was back
to normal,'' he says excitedly, displaying what he says are before
and after pictures taken by Russian weather satellites. ``Just
think of what would happen if we built a bigger (pyramid) in the
Southern Hemisphere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You Americans, you could rid yourself of tornadoes with a few
of these,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Golod's ideas have been embraced by Russian cosmonauts, medical
doctors and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of amethysts charged at the Moscow pyramid were taken
aboard the space station Mir to promote world peace. And Russia's
Olympic rowers and wrestlers are taking Golod's rocks to the Sydney
Games this summer, hoping the stones will aid their performances.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some visitors to the pyramid are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Igor Sechin, a 31-year-old father of one, was one of hundreds of
people who came on a recent weekend to visit the pyramid out of
curiosity. He said the trip didn't make him a believer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of people who believe that pyramid will cure them are
the kind of people that will believe anything. Only those kind of
people would buy this junk,'' Sechin said, pointing to the $10
model pyramids and $1 bottles of pyramid water sold outside.
</P>
<P>
   Golod rejects charges of hucksterism. He produces reams of paper
with test results from Moscow research institutes to support his
claims that pyramids affect the natural world. A study last year by
the Moscow Institute for Experimental and Theoretical Biophysics
found that water exposed to the pyramids has ``a stimulating effect
on the ability of human cells to survive and proliferate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take me 30 years (of selling souvenirs) to recoup my
costs,'' he said, sitting in his rundown Moscow office decorated
with a five-foot-tall plastic globe. ``I'm doing what I can to
improve the planet. There is no escaping that we are all connected
to its future. I want to make the Earth a better place for my
grandchildren to live.''

&HT;     TEXAS BORDER CITY COURTS COWBOYS TRAINING CAMP

<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ The Dallas Cowboys appear poised to trade
borders beginning with next year's training camp, exchanging this
city near the Oklahoma state line for the Mexican frontier in the
Rio Grande Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have an opportunity to have fans from other countries come
and support you, you've got to seize that moment,'' Rockport native
and Cowboys linebacker Dat Nguyen said of the possible move. ``Not
many people or organizations or teams have the opportunity to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations between a coalition of Rio Grande Valley entities
and the Cowboys continue moving forward, with the current camp in
Wichita Falls _ a city of 105,000 two hours northwest of Dallas _
the lone stall to more open discussions of the probable move.
</P>
<P>
   With the team a little more than halfway through camp, Cowboys
owner Jerry Jones refused comment about a possible move to South
Texas out of respect for Wichita Falls and Midwestern State
University, where the team has trained for three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't get into what we're going to do more than likely
until later in the fall,'' Jones said Tuesday evening. ``We're real
pleased with the way camp is going this year. McAllen is an area we
are very impressed with, but we'll see how that evolves.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunt Valley Development of Dallas is building a training complex
on a site west of the border city of McAllen. The complex is called
Sharyland Plantation, and the company hopes to lure the Cowboys
beginning next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cowboys' relocation to Sharyland remains contingent upon
various legal agreements being signed,'' said Jim Oberwetter, the
developer's vice president for governmental and public affairs.
``Progress is being made, but until the agreements are finalized
there's no assurance about the Cowboys' relocation to the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are encouraged with some forward progress.''
</P>
<P>
   That progress includes plans to lease the complex for 10 months
out of the year to South Texas Community College, and for the
cities of Mission and McAllen to each pay the Cowboys $175,000
every year of a three-year agreement, according to the Monitor
newspaper in McAllen.
</P>
<P>
   McAllen City Manager Mike Perez said Tuesday that the outline of
incentives forged among McAllen, Mission, Hidalgo County and the
Rio Grande Valley Regional Sports Authority is near completion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the ball will be in the Cowboys' court, to see if it's an
acceptable deal for them,'' Perez said. ``They have to make the
final decision, and it's never a done deal until it's signed.''
</P>
<P>
   Midwestern State president Louis Rodriguez said Tuesday that
Wichita Falls would welcome back the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had the Cowboys here for three seasons and it's been a
real positive experience,'' he said. ``They've been great guests.
Whatever happens in the future happens, but they're certainly
welcome to come back here.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys first trained in Thousand Oaks, Calif., and then
moved to Austin from 1990-97. While training camp drew more than
100,000 fans its first year in Wichita Falls in 1998, the crowds
dwindled to about half that number last year.
</P>
<P>
   Through more than half of training camp this year, the team has
drawn an estimated 28,500 fans to 21 practices. The Cowboys are set
to practice 33 times before camp breaks Aug. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Sharyland Plantation, which Hunt began building a year ago, is a
6,000-acre community with 126 acres reserved for Pepsi Sports Park,
where the Cowboys would train.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been some agreements,'' the park's athletic director,
Tuffy Martinez, said of the Cowboys' possible move, ``but it's not
a totally done deal yet. South Texas Community College will lease
those (facilities) for 10 months out of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That leaves two months. You can piece it together.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys typically train from mid-July to late August.

``Highlander: Endgame.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING 
 c.2000 Ian Spelling 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Highlander: Endgame'' is a dream come true for Adrian Paul.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when I first saw a `Highlander' poster in an
office,'' the actor says. ``I thought, `I'm going to do something
with that one day.'''
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, the athletic and handsome Paul went on to
star in ``Highlander: The Series'' as Duncan MacLeod, a
sword-swinging immortal who was as compassionate a man as he was
fierce a warrior. The series spun off from the ``Highlander''
features, the first two of which featured Christopher Lambert as
Connor MacLeod.
</P>
<P>
   Lambert turned up briefly in the series' 1992 premiere episode,
but it is ``Endgame'' (to be released nationwide by Dimension Films
on Sept. 1) that brings together Duncan and Connor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power of the movie is that relationship between Duncan and
Connor,'' Paul says by telephone from London, in town to attend his
brother's wedding. ``Everything else remains to be seen. Really, I
haven't seen the finished film, so I don't know how everything else
looks yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're calling the film `Endgame,' but I call it
`Redemption,' which was one of the other working titles. It's about
two lives, Connor's and Duncan's. They have existed for more than
350 years and what I like very much about the film, and what the
fans really haven't seen before, is the development of the
relationship between Duncan and Connor, which is accomplished
through flashbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also see the choices they made in the past that are causing
the problems they're faced with now. And they have to redeem
themselves for the wrongs they've done in the past. It all brings
them face to face with one enemy _ another immortal named Kell
(Bruce Payne) _ and they need to join forces to defeat him.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul reports that he and Lambert ``had a good time working
together'' and he adds that the film takes advantage of their
different acting and sword fighting styles.
</P>
<P>
   Also along for the adventure are two veterans of the TV series:
Jim Berns and Peter Wingfield, who reprise their respective roles
as Joe Dawson and Mythos, and Beatie Edney once again portraying
Heather, Connor's great love, who was introduced in the original
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Since the series ended, Paul has kept a fairly low profile. The
41-year-old actor, who is single and lives in Los Angeles, appeared
in two straight-to-video features, the supernatural thriller
``Convergence'' and the John Landis-directed black comedy ``Susan's
Plan'' opposite Nastassia Kinski. He also appears in a British film
entitled ``Merlin 2000,'' a fantasy that casts him as Lancelot.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Paul is plotting his next moves, which involve
writing a script, directing a high-definition film, guiding The
PEACE Fund (a foundation that helps sick, needy and abused
children) and launching his website, Adrianpaul.com.
</P>
<P>
   But busy as he may be, Paul knows better than to rule out future
``Highlander'' installments. After all, Duncan MacLeod is immortal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on how `Endgame' does, I guess,'' he says.
``There's a huge worldwide audience that watched the show ... but
will it carry over to the big screen? Do the fans of the original
`Highlander' movies want to see a new one, and a new one that
reflects six years of the show?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, everyone who comes to `Endgame' will like it.''

 (World rights. Includes B&AMP;W photo and color slide of the 2000
Mercedes-Benz ML55.) 
 By STEVE SMITH 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Assuming anyone is asking, ``Why doesn't someone build a sport
utility vehicle that goes 145 mph and accelerates from 0 mph to 60
mph in less than seven seconds,'' Mercedes-Benz would like to
present the ML55, which does all the above, despite weighing nearly
5,000 pounds, about as much as two Toyota Corollas.
 &HT;    Judging from the early sales success of the limited-edition
ML55, apparently Mercedes has found a market in discriminating
consumers who can afford the $65,545 price tag and don't mind the
EPA fuel mileage rating of 14 mpg in the city, 17 mpg on the
highway, and the requirement of premium fuel.
 &HT;    The ML55 is the highest-performing sport utility available, at
least until Porsche's SUV goes on sale. (It will be called the
Cayenne _ as in pepper _ but it is still well over a year off.)
 &HT;    The ML55 is a much-modified version of the more mainstream
M-Class, the Alabama-built Mercedes SUVs that has found favor more
with carpoolers than serious off-roaders.
 &HT;    Both the entry-level ML320 and the more powerful ML430 work
reasonably well in the dirt, but the ML55 is much more a
pavement-specific vehicle. It lacks the ML430's ground clearance to
climb over ruts and roots, and lacks tires that have a tread
pattern that can get traction in the dirt. The ML55's
steamroller-sized radial tires are excellent on dry pavement, but
would spin hopelessly in the mud.
 &HT;    The ML55 is basically an ML430 that has been customized by AMG,
an in-house Mercedes performance company that, for years, has been
taking mainstream Mercedes automobiles and making them go faster,
handle better (and, inevitably, cost more).
 &HT;    While the ML430 has a 4.3-liter, 268-horsepower V-8, the ML55
gets a 5.5-liter, 342-horsepower V-8, essentially an enlarged
version of the Mercedes SL500 sedan's 5.0-liter engine.
 &HT;    You can tell the ML55 from an ML320 or ML430 by the 55's bright
Xenon headlights, wider fender flares, different fog lights and
bumpers, and brake calipers that are painted bright red. The ML55
also sits nearly 1 inch lower to the ground than the ML320 and
ML430.
 &HT;    Inside, soft AMG-applied charcoal leather is everywhere _
covering the supportive sport seats, door trim, armrest, console,
shift knob and part of the steering wheel. Burl walnut trim is used
on the rest of the steering wheel and on the door panels and
instrument panel. There's a seven-speaker, 150-watt Bose sound
system.
 &HT;    While Mercedes offers no factory options on the ML55, there are
dealer-installed options to chose from, ranging from molded front
and rear mudflaps to an integrated Motorola telephone. A glass
sunroof is standard, as is a satellite-linked navigation system.
 &HT;    The central differences between the ML55 and its comparatively
plebeian cousins lie beneath the skin. Besides the gutsier engine,
the ML55 gets a retuned, more responsive five-speed automatic
transmission that maximizes the engine's output. The suspension,
while not much different in design, is firmer, giving enhanced
cornering ability, but a mildly harsher ride. The brakes are more
powerful.
 &HT;    All the M-class models have full-time four-wheel-drive, with a
traction control system that senses when a tire loses traction and
starts spinning, then automatically increases power to the tires
that are getting traction.
 &HT;    There's also Brake Assist, which detects when the driver is
making a panic stop, and applies full braking power more quickly
than the driver can.
 &HT;    And there's the Electronic Stability Program, which detects when
the car is about to skid to one side, and automatically applies
brakes to one or more wheels to bring the vehicle back in line.
 &HT;    These features mean more on the ML55 than on the other two
models, because it has so much power and is capable of such high
speeds.
 &HT;    It remains, however, a truck. It has a full trucklike frame and
a tall, heavy body, giving it a high center of gravity. That means
that no matter how much Mercedes or the ML55's owner wants it to be
a sports car, it isn't. If you drive it like a Porsche, making no
allowances for its extra bulk and height, eventually you'll get
into trouble, no matter how many electronic gadgets are working to
prevent it.
 &HT;    That said, the ML55 makes for a pretty amazing sport utility.
The interior is world-class, the throaty exhaust note is
invigorating and the acceleration is startling, though it does seem
to take a while to get it going from a standing start _ up to about
30 mph, it feels no faster than an ML430. Handling is excellent,
given its inherent limitations, and the ride, while rougher than
most SUVs, is tolerable on all but the roughest roads.
 &HT;    Still, the ML55 costs about $21,000 more than an ML430, which is
a fairly good performer in its own right. Besides the extra money,
you're trading the ML430's passable off-road capability for the
ML55's greater on-road performance, and I'm not sure I'd want to do
that _ I like the option of off-roading once in a while.
 &HT;    But Mercedes and AMG didn't build the ML55 for me. They built it
for the consumer who must have the latest, greatest, ultimate SUV _
and that's the ML55 in a nutshell.

   The brain is the mastermind of flavor, but tongues are where it
starts _ and some are far more sensitive than others. For example,
``super-tasters'' have the most taste buds. Because taste buds are
surrounded by nerve endings that sense not only taste but pain and
touch, super-tasters, perhaps not surprisingly, have a more
sensational taste repertoire. Bitter tastes bitterer, some sweets
taste sweeter. In this feature, Patricia Gadsby recounts how day in
a ``taste lab,'' where she learned about super-tasters _ and the
fact that we don't all live in the same taste world. Two color and
three B&AMP;W slides are available. (slugged:

 By GENE SANTORO 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    ``We didn't really believe the stories until we went out
ourselves,'' Bart Mansi says. ``That's when it really hit us.''
 &HT;    Last fall, he and other lobstermen along the Connecticut shore
kept hearing about a great lobster die-off 30 miles to the west _
one that began around the time that New York City started spraying
malathion to prevent an epidemic of West Nile encephalitis.
 &HT;    Then in early October, as they plowed into the frigid waters of
Long Island Sound, they found disastrous proof of the rumors: pot
after pot of dead lobsters, and others so weak they died a day or
two after arriving on land.
 &HT;    Worried and baffled, Mansi hooked up with biologist Mike
Loughlin, now at the National Marine Fisheries Service. During the
next couple of weeks, Loughlin examined dead lobsters up and down
the coast and took hundreds of blood samples.
 &HT;    His diagnosis: The lobsters were killed by paramoebic and
bacterial infections, but only because something had broken down
the animals' immune systems first.
 &HT;    Altogether, some 10 million pounds of lobsters died of unnatural
causes off the Connecticut and New York shores last season, and the
losses are expected to continue for several years.
 &HT;    Suggestive, disturbing and maddeningly inconclusive, the lobster
fatalities typify the environmental incidents that observers have
linked to malathion.
 &HT;    The lobstermen quickly blamed the pesticide, but sewage runoff
and other pesticides could just as easily have been the culprits.
True, the timing of the dieoff was suspicious _ malathion has been
known to kill crustaceans, and the spraying had already killed
hundreds of fish on Staten Island.
 &HT;    But it's hard to imagine that, after being diluted in millions
of gallons of water, enough of the pesticide could have drifted or
flowed into the Sound to kill the lobsters.
 &HT;    As for the pesticide's effect on people, the evidence is just as
ambiguous. Biologists say the human body can break down malathion
much faster than mosquitoes can, and most agree that the spraying
in New York was too light to cause harm.
 &HT;    Yet U.S. Poison Control Centers have a database of more than
10,000 incidents involving malathion, some of them fatal. This
spring, after a four-year review, the EPA declared that there is
``suggestive evidence'' that malathion can cause cancer. Yet an
agency representative described the danger as ``below our level of
concern.''
 &HT;    How to weigh such risks? When does paranoia become reasonable
suspicion? When does the long-term danger of spraying a mild
neurotoxin outweigh the short-term danger of a crop infestation or
a mosquito-borne disease?
 &HT;    This summer, city officials across America may ask themselves
those questions as they face the same agonizing choice that New
Yorkers faced.
 &HT;    West Nile encephalitis _ a cousin to St. Louis encephalitis _
was never seen in North America before last year and is probably
here to stay, most epidemiologists say. The next likely target is
the Southeast, with its sweltering temperatures and plentiful
mosquitoes, but no one knows when an epidemic will come or what
toll it will take.
 &HT;    In 1975, when St. Louis encephalitis struck Chicago, more than
500 people contracted the disease and 47 died; the next year only a
handful were infected.
 &HT;    Last year, when New Yorkers began dying of the disease, the city
ordered a fleet of helicopters, trucks and an airplane to spray
malathion and other pesticides for weeks. The potential epidemic
was eventually contained (with the help of cold fall temperatures),
but the long-term costs of the victory may never be known. &HT;    This year, the city isn't taking any chances. In March,
mosquitoes in Queens were found to contain West Nile viral RNA, so
the city launched an unprecedented campaign to keep mosquitoes from
breeding and hatching. Spraying pesticides such as malathion,
officials say, will remain an option.
 &HT;    In the meantime, hardware stores still sell malathion, and the
EPA can only assure that it's ``one of the least risky of the
riskiest class of pesticides.''
 &HT;    Before health officials decide to spray it over cities again,
perhaps they ought to take a look at malathion's
less-than-reassuring history _ remembering that DDT, too, once
seemed like humanity's last, best defense against mosquito-borne
diseases.
 &HT;    Better yet, as a faint buzzing begins to fill the air, officials
might want to go talk to a few lobstermen.
 &HT;    ``We're holding on by a couple of shoestrings,'' Bart Mansi
says. ``Females with eggs were killed, as well as juveniles, so we
could be looking at a seven- to 10-year cycle with a serious
downturn. The guys farther west, closer to New York _ somewhere
around 99 percent of their catch is dead, so they're not even going
out any more. And the people that sprayed this stuff are pretending
nothing's happened.''

 (Two color and three B&AMP;W slides are included.) 
 By PATRICIA GADSBY 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    A group of us, some scientists but mostly not, have just had
dinner together at the New York Academy of Sciences. We've eaten
well and settled down for the evening's lecture.
 &HT;    The speaker, from Yale University, is Linda Bartoshuk, a
specialist in human taste. She hands us each a small packet
containing a piece of filter paper saturated with a compound called
propylthiouracil, known in taste circles as PROP.
 &HT;    We're instructed to put the papers in our mouths. As my saliva
wets it, a nasty bitterness blooms. Then Bartoshuk asks for a show
of hands. How many of us tasted something? How many of us didn't?
 &HT;    Of course, Bartoshuk knows the punch line: Typically, a quarter
of the audience tastes nothing. This routine never fails to impress
an audience. Jaws go slack as hands shoot up in answer to both
questions.
 &HT;    The bottom line: We don't all live in the same taste world.
 &HT;    Researchers began suspecting as much in the 1930s, after a
chemist who was making a batch of a compound called
phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) let a puff of the crystals fly into the
air.
 &HT;    A lab colleague, who must have swallowed some of the airborne
crystals, noted how bitter they were. The astonished chemist, who
tasted nothing himself, became the first to describe ``taste
blindness'' to the bitter compound.
 &HT;    As it turned out, nontasters respond to all types of bitterness
less intensely than tasters, and the degree to which people taste
PROP can serve as a general indicator of their overall taste
capacity.
 &HT;    The inability to taste PROP is genetic and most likely due to a
recessive gene. That would fit rather nicely with Bartoshuk's
finding that there exists a subset of PROP-tasters supersensitive
to bitterness. She calls them super-tasters.
 &HT;    Looking at the three groups, you see just the sort of patterns
you'd expect for a recessive gene. Roughly 25 percent of people
tested with PROP don't taste it, consistent with two recessive
genes; 50 percent are tasters, consistent with one recessive and
one dominant gene; and 25 percent are super-tasters, consistent
with two dominant gene copies, one from each parent.
 &HT;    The distribution is slightly sex-skewed. More women than men are
super-tasters, perhaps because bitter is the skull and crossbones
of the natural world, and evolution once favored mothers with
superior poison-detecting systems.
 &HT;    What's fascinating, Bartoshuk says, is that tongue anatomy
spells out the differences among these groups. Tasters have more
taste buds than nontasters, and super-tasters have the most.
Because taste buds are surrounded by nerve endings that sense not
only taste but pain and touch, super-tasters, perhaps not
surprisingly, have a more sensational taste repertoire. Bitter
tastes bitterer, some sweets taste sweeter. Fat feels fattier, and
alcohol and chili burn more fiercely.
 &HT;    Intrigued by her discoveries, I persuaded Bartoshuk to let me
visit her lab in the Yale University School of Medicine for a
two-day immersion in taste.
 &HT;    First, Bartoshuk performs a checkup _ a spatial test of my
tongue _ by painting tastes on it one section at a time. Using
cotton swabs as brushes, she dips into various concentrations of
sodium chloride, paints the salt solutions on my tongue and asks me
to rate their intensity on a scale of zero to 100.
 &HT;    Then she brushes on sucrose to test my sense of sweet, citric
acid to test sour, and quinine to test bitter. She's aiming for
little bumps called papillae on the tongue's front, sides and back.
Those on the front are the so-called fungiforms, because they look
like button mushrooms. The foliates, supposedly leaflike, show up
as a reddish series of folds on each edge near the back.
 &HT;    Way, way back, practically down the throats of some people, lie
the circumvallates, which stand like round moated towers across the
tongue's surface in an inverted V.
 &HT;    We call the bumps of our papillae taste buds, but they're more
like Xs marking taste-bud spots: Our taste buds, for the most part,
are nested into them and much too minuscule to see.
 &HT;    Special receptor cells poke out of these tiny organs to catch
the sweet, salty, sour and bitter molecules that land in the mouth.
When tasty molecules stimulate the receptors, they in turn
stimulate nerve endings inside the tongue, and the messages
ricochet along nerves to the brain.
 &HT;    ``So this is essentially a neurological test for nerves in your
mouth,'' Bartoshuk explains. ``I'm putting solutions on areas of
the tongue where I know which nerve is innervating the tissue, and
I want you to evaluate what you're perceiving.''
 &HT;    The nerves to which she's referring are the two main cranial
nerves for taste that run from the brain to the tongue's front and
back. When she dabs sweet onto the fungiform papillae, she knows
she's stimulating the taste nerve at the front: the chorda tympani.
When she puts sweet onto the circumvallates, she's testing the
taste nerve at the tongue's back: the glossopharyngeal.
 &HT;    In addition, by dabbing on pure alcohol or capsaicin, the fiery
chemical in chilies, she can test the nerve for touch, called the
trigeminal, which sends little, pain-sensitive fibers to the
papillae.
 &HT;    Judging from the way I rate tastes, especially bitter tastes,
I'm a relatively ``strong responder,'' Bartoshuk says. ``You're not
going to have a nontaster tongue, that's for sure. The question is
just how many fungiform papillae you have.''
 &HT;    A typical nontaster's tongue has few fungiforms, a
super-taster's tongue packs loads of them, and a medium-taster's
tongue falls somewhere in between.
 &HT;    After staining my tongue blue with vegetable dye (it delineates
the fungiforms, which stay pink, from other tongue tissue),
Bartoshuk tells me there is an area of my tongue where the
fungiform papillae are missing.
 &HT;    ``Now, no big deal,'' she says. ``It suggests some trigeminal
damage.''
 &HT;    The nerves going to the mouth are vulnerable to many kinds of
insults: dental work and common viral infections among them. For
anatomic reasons, the taste nerve serving the front of the tongue,
the chorda tympani, takes the brunt of viral hits. As the nerve
travels between the brain and the tongue, it passes right under the
eardrum, the tympanic membrane. So during an ear infection, or an
upper respiratory infection affecting the ears, a virus sometimes
infiltrates this taste nerve and knocks it temporarily _ or even
permanently _ out of commission.
 &HT;    Lucky for us, our sense of taste has a system of compensation.
Normally the nerves of the tongue inhibit one another. The taste
nerve in the front, for instance, inhibits the taste nerve at the
back, and vice versa. Injure the front nerve, and there's a release
of inhibition on the signals from the back nerve, which makes up
for the deficit.
 &HT;    ``So when taste in the front goes down, taste in the back goes
up,'' Bartoshuk says.
 &HT;    But sometimes there's a cost. A loss in one nerve can lead to
exaggerated responses in the disinhibited nerve, or even conjure up
sensations that seem to have no real-world cause.
 &HT;    These ``taste phantoms,'' Bartoshuk says, ``are sensations in
the absence of stimulation.'' They come in all four of the classic
tastes, as we might expect, as well as the sour-mineral taste we
interpret as metallic.
 &HT;    The most common ``release-of-inhibition'' phantoms turn up at
the back of the tongue when the taste nerve up front sustains some
type of damage. I myself have a metallic visitor that tends to make
an appearance when I have a stuffy cold or flu, probably because
the invading virus has made it into the chorda tympani.
 &HT;    Much of what we commonly refer to as taste, of course, consists
of smell, the aroma of food in our mouths. It's not sweetness that
makes a banana banana-y; it's the scent.
 &HT;    When we're eating a banana, however, we're not aware of smelling
its scent up the back chimney of our noses. It feels as though
we're sensing it inside the cavernous laboratory of our mouths, as
part and parcel of an overall flavor. Again the brain appears at
work here, referring food-aroma to the mouth by the sensations of
touch and taste.
 &HT;    But when we eat, the brain isn't just melding taste, smell and
touch to give us the intricately flavored and textured experience
of food. It recalls the pleasures, and displeasures, associated
with the foods we're eating.
 &HT;    ``Sweetness is a deep biological pleasure,'' Bartoshuk says. It
signals safe calories in nature, and the pleasure's probably
hardwired. But most of the pleasures of eating are conditioned,
learned by experience.
 &HT;    ``Does a gourmet enjoy his expensive chocolate mousse more than
I enjoy my Hershey's bar? I don't think so. I like my Hershey's bar
a lot,'' Bartoshuk says with a big, infectious laugh.
 &HT;    So when it comes to pleasure, it probably doesn't matter much
whether we are super-tasters, medium-tasters or nontasters. Our
brains will work to calibrate pleasure to our particular sets of
chemical senses, because it wants to keep those calories coming in
so we'll survive.
 &HT;    Our noggins will make sure we enjoy our food to the max _ our
max.

 (Two color slides are included.) 
 By GENE SANTORO 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    ``We didn't really believe the stories until we went out
ourselves,'' Bart Mansi says. ``That's when it really hit us.''
 &HT;    Last fall, he and other lobstermen along the Connecticut shore
kept hearing about a great lobster die-off 30 miles to the west _
one that began around the time that New York City started spraying
malathion to prevent an epidemic of West Nile encephalitis.
 &HT;    Then in early October, as they plowed into the frigid waters of
Long Island Sound, they found disastrous proof of the rumors: pot
after pot of dead lobsters, and others so weak they died a day or
two after arriving on land.
 &HT;    Worried and baffled, Mansi hooked up with biologist Mike
Loughlin, now at the National Marine Fisheries Service. During the
next couple of weeks, Loughlin examined dead lobsters up and down
the coast and took hundreds of blood samples.
 &HT;    His diagnosis: The lobsters were killed by paramoebic and
bacterial infections, but only because something had broken down
the animals' immune systems first.
 &HT;    Altogether, some 10 million pounds of lobsters died of unnatural
causes off the Connecticut and New York shores last season, and the
losses are expected to continue for several years.
 &HT;    Suggestive, disturbing and maddeningly inconclusive, the lobster
fatalities typify the environmental incidents that observers have
linked to malathion.
 &HT;    The lobstermen quickly blamed the pesticide, but sewage runoff
and other pesticides could just as easily have been the culprits.
True, the timing of the dieoff was suspicious _ malathion has been
known to kill crustaceans, and the spraying had already killed
hundreds of fish on Staten Island.
 &HT;    But it's hard to imagine that, after being diluted in millions
of gallons of water, enough of the pesticide could have drifted or
flowed into the Sound to kill the lobsters.
 &HT;    As for the pesticide's effect on people, the evidence is just as
ambiguous. Biologists say the human body can break down malathion
much faster than mosquitoes can, and most agree that the spraying
in New York was too light to cause harm.
 &HT;    Yet U.S. Poison Control Centers have a database of more than
10,000 incidents involving malathion, some of them fatal. This
spring, after a four-year review, the EPA declared that there is
``suggestive evidence'' that malathion can cause cancer. Yet an
agency representative described the danger as ``below our level of
concern.''
 &HT;    How to weigh such risks? When does paranoia become reasonable
suspicion? When does the long-term danger of spraying a mild
neurotoxin outweigh the short-term danger of a crop infestation or
a mosquito-borne disease?
 &HT;    This summer, city officials across America may ask themselves
those questions as they face the same agonizing choice that New
Yorkers faced.
 &HT;    West Nile encephalitis _ a cousin to St. Louis encephalitis _
was never seen in North America before last year and is probably
here to stay, most epidemiologists say. The next likely target is
the Southeast, with its sweltering temperatures and plentiful
mosquitoes, but no one knows when an epidemic will come or what
toll it will take.
 &HT;    In 1975, when St. Louis encephalitis struck Chicago, more than
500 people contracted the disease and 47 died; the next year only a
handful were infected.
 &HT;    Last year, when New Yorkers began dying of the disease, the city
ordered a fleet of helicopters, trucks and an airplane to spray
malathion and other pesticides for weeks. The potential epidemic
was eventually contained (with the help of cold fall temperatures),
but the long-term costs of the victory may never be known. &HT;    This year, the city isn't taking any chances. In March,
mosquitoes in Queens were found to contain West Nile viral RNA, so
the city launched an unprecedented campaign to keep mosquitoes from
breeding and hatching. Spraying pesticides such as malathion,
officials say, will remain an option.
 &HT;    In the meantime, hardware stores still sell malathion, and the
EPA can only assure that it's ``one of the least risky of the
riskiest class of pesticides.''
 &HT;    Before health officials decide to spray it over cities again,
perhaps they ought to take a look at malathion's
less-than-reassuring history _ remembering that DDT, too, once
seemed like humanity's last, best defense against mosquito-borne
diseases.
 &HT;    Better yet, as a faint buzzing begins to fill the air, officials
might want to go talk to a few lobstermen.
 &HT;    ``We're holding on by a couple of shoestrings,'' Bart Mansi
says. ``Females with eggs were killed, as well as juveniles, so we
could be looking at a seven- to 10-year cycle with a serious
downturn. The guys farther west, closer to New York _ somewhere
around 99 percent of their catch is dead, so they're not even going
out any more. And the people that sprayed this stuff are pretending
nothing's happened.''

 (Two color and three B&AMP;W slides are included.) 
 By PATRICIA GADSBY 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    A group of us, some scientists but mostly not, have just had
dinner together at the New York Academy of Sciences. We've eaten
well and settled down for the evening's lecture.
 &HT;    The speaker, from Yale University, is Linda Bartoshuk, a
specialist in human taste. She hands us each a small packet
containing a piece of filter paper saturated with a compound called
propylthiouracil, known in taste circles as PROP.
 &HT;    We're instructed to put the papers in our mouths. As my saliva
wets it, a nasty bitterness blooms. Then Bartoshuk asks for a show
of hands. How many of us tasted something? How many of us didn't?
 &HT;    Of course, Bartoshuk knows the punch line: Typically, a quarter
of the audience tastes nothing. This routine never fails to impress
an audience. Jaws go slack as hands shoot up in answer to both
questions.
 &HT;    The bottom line: We don't all live in the same taste world.
 &HT;    Researchers began suspecting as much in the 1930s, after a
chemist who was making a batch of a compound called
phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) let a puff of the crystals fly into the
air.
 &HT;    A lab colleague, who must have swallowed some of the airborne
crystals, noted how bitter they were. The astonished chemist, who
tasted nothing himself, became the first to describe ``taste
blindness'' to the bitter compound.
 &HT;    As it turned out, nontasters respond to all types of bitterness
less intensely than tasters, and the degree to which people taste
PROP can serve as a general indicator of their overall taste
capacity.
 &HT;    The inability to taste PROP is genetic and most likely due to a
recessive gene. That would fit rather nicely with Bartoshuk's
finding that there exists a subset of PROP-tasters supersensitive
to bitterness. She calls them super-tasters.
 &HT;    Looking at the three groups, you see just the sort of patterns
you'd expect for a recessive gene. Roughly 25 percent of people
tested with PROP don't taste it, consistent with two recessive
genes; 50 percent are tasters, consistent with one recessive and
one dominant gene; and 25 percent are super-tasters, consistent
with two dominant gene copies, one from each parent.
 &HT;    The distribution is slightly sex-skewed. More women than men are
super-tasters, perhaps because bitter is the skull and crossbones
of the natural world, and evolution once favored mothers with
superior poison-detecting systems.
 &HT;    What's fascinating, Bartoshuk says, is that tongue anatomy
spells out the differences among these groups. Tasters have more
taste buds than nontasters, and super-tasters have the most.
Because taste buds are surrounded by nerve endings that sense not
only taste but pain and touch, super-tasters, perhaps not
surprisingly, have a more sensational taste repertoire. Bitter
tastes bitterer, some sweets taste sweeter. Fat feels fattier, and
alcohol and chili burn more fiercely.
 &HT;    Intrigued by her discoveries, I persuaded Bartoshuk to let me
visit her lab in the Yale University School of Medicine for a
two-day immersion in taste.
 &HT;    First, Bartoshuk performs a checkup _ a spatial test of my
tongue _ by painting tastes on it one section at a time. Using
cotton swabs as brushes, she dips into various concentrations of
sodium chloride, paints the salt solutions on my tongue and asks me
to rate their intensity on a scale of zero to 100.
 &HT;    Then she brushes on sucrose to test my sense of sweet, citric
acid to test sour, and quinine to test bitter. She's aiming for
little bumps called papillae on the tongue's front, sides and back.
Those on the front are the so-called fungiforms, because they look
like button mushrooms. The foliates, supposedly leaflike, show up
as a reddish series of folds on each edge near the back.
 &HT;    Way, way back, practically down the throats of some people, lie
the circumvallates, which stand like round moated towers across the
tongue's surface in an inverted V.
 &HT;    We call the bumps of our papillae taste buds, but they're more
like Xs marking taste-bud spots: Our taste buds, for the most part,
are nested into them and much too minuscule to see.
 &HT;    Special receptor cells poke out of these tiny organs to catch
the sweet, salty, sour and bitter molecules that land in the mouth.
When tasty molecules stimulate the receptors, they in turn
stimulate nerve endings inside the tongue, and the messages
ricochet along nerves to the brain.
 &HT;    ``So this is essentially a neurological test for nerves in your
mouth,'' Bartoshuk explains. ``I'm putting solutions on areas of
the tongue where I know which nerve is innervating the tissue, and
I want you to evaluate what you're perceiving.''
 &HT;    The nerves to which she's referring are the two main cranial
nerves for taste that run from the brain to the tongue's front and
back. When she dabs sweet onto the fungiform papillae, she knows
she's stimulating the taste nerve at the front: the chorda tympani.
When she puts sweet onto the circumvallates, she's testing the
taste nerve at the tongue's back: the glossopharyngeal.
 &HT;    In addition, by dabbing on pure alcohol or capsaicin, the fiery
chemical in chilies, she can test the nerve for touch, called the
trigeminal, which sends little, pain-sensitive fibers to the
papillae.
 &HT;    Judging from the way I rate tastes, especially bitter tastes,
I'm a relatively ``strong responder,'' Bartoshuk says. ``You're not
going to have a nontaster tongue, that's for sure. The question is
just how many fungiform papillae you have.''
 &HT;    A typical nontaster's tongue has few fungiforms, a
super-taster's tongue packs loads of them, and a medium-taster's
tongue falls somewhere in between.
 &HT;    After staining my tongue blue with vegetable dye (it delineates
the fungiforms, which stay pink, from other tongue tissue),
Bartoshuk tells me there is an area of my tongue where the
fungiform papillae are missing.
 &HT;    ``Now, no big deal,'' she says. ``It suggests some trigeminal
damage.''
 &HT;    The nerves going to the mouth are vulnerable to many kinds of
insults: dental work and common viral infections among them. For
anatomic reasons, the taste nerve serving the front of the tongue,
the chorda tympani, takes the brunt of viral hits. As the nerve
travels between the brain and the tongue, it passes right under the
eardrum, the tympanic membrane. So during an ear infection, or an
upper respiratory infection affecting the ears, a virus sometimes
infiltrates this taste nerve and knocks it temporarily _ or even
permanently _ out of commission.
 &HT;    Lucky for us, our sense of taste has a system of compensation.
Normally the nerves of the tongue inhibit one another. The taste
nerve in the front, for instance, inhibits the taste nerve at the
back, and vice versa. Injure the front nerve, and there's a release
of inhibition on the signals from the back nerve, which makes up
for the deficit.
 &HT;    ``So when taste in the front goes down, taste in the back goes
up,'' Bartoshuk says.
 &HT;    But sometimes there's a cost. A loss in one nerve can lead to
exaggerated responses in the disinhibited nerve, or even conjure up
sensations that seem to have no real-world cause.
 &HT;    These ``taste phantoms,'' Bartoshuk says, ``are sensations in
the absence of stimulation.'' They come in all four of the classic
tastes, as we might expect, as well as the sour-mineral taste we
interpret as metallic.
 &HT;    The most common ``release-of-inhibition'' phantoms turn up at
the back of the tongue when the taste nerve up front sustains some
type of damage. I myself have a metallic visitor that tends to make
an appearance when I have a stuffy cold or flu, probably because
the invading virus has made it into the chorda tympani.
 &HT;    Much of what we commonly refer to as taste, of course, consists

   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica - With no national army, a prosperous
economy and an enviable record of free, fair elections, Costa Rica
has been a beacon of peace and stability in a region beset by
military coups, civil wars and corrupt dictatorships.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months this tranquil oasis and beloved tourist
destination has been shaken by a crimewave against residents and
visitors, triggering worries that some of the outside world's
problems may finally be catching up to once-isolated, idyllic Costa
Rica.
</P>
<P>
   Local newspapers have been filled with stories of a few
sensational crimes, including a July kidnapping that resulted in a
shoot-out that left one hostage dead and three police officers
wounded. The country also saw a flurry of unflattering
international stories following the murders of two American college
students on the Caribbean coast in March.
</P>
<P>
   The high-profile cases have sparked a round of national
soul-searching in this country of 3.5 million residents, which
prides itself on being known as the ``Switzerland of Central
America'' because of its long tradition of neutrality and peace.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, a national debate over the causes and proposed
solutions to the crimewave has swirled through this capital city,
with some leaders calling for more police, more prosecutors and
stiffer penalties for criminals. Others say what is needed is a
return to traditional values.
</P>
<P>
   Even an annual religious festival in early August drew attention
to the problem, as Costa Rica's top Catholic cleric prayed for the
country to find a way to end the violence that has upset so many.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception of the citizens about the problem of insecurity
is very high,'' said Rogelio Ramos, Minister of Public Security.
``It's because we have such a long tradition of peace that a small
number of incidents can leave the country shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramos is quick to point out that even with the recent spate of
crimes, Costa Rica is still one of the safest countries in the
hemisphere, with an enviable record of catching and convicting
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the lowest index of murders in the hemisphere, less
than six for every 100,000 residents,'' he said. ``Besides that,
the judicial police solve more than 90 percent of the murders,
which means that if you commit murder here, you have a 90 percent
chance of going to jail for it. ``And more than 70 percent of all
crime here are property crimes that don't involve violence,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Those facts seem lost in the wave of public concern, however.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, one of the country's top law-enforcement officials
told reporters her agency doesn't have the resources to meet the
growing crime problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is worrying,'' said Lineth Saborio, head of the
Costa Rican Office of Judicial Investigations, the country's
equivalent of the FBI. ``The level of violence is beyond the
ability of the police to cope with.''
</P>
<P>
   Her plea for more resources came just as the government is
discussing budgets for next year. While there have been reports
that the agency might suffer some funding cuts, Ramos insisted that
the resources would be found to deal with the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Already, a new investigative team is being formed to fight
kidnappers, he said. The group will receive special training from
the Colombian police, who have lots of experience as their country
suffers the highest rate of kidnapping in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Costa Rican leaders say the increase in crime is due to several
factors, many of which plague other countries, including the United
States. The list includes poverty, a loss of traditional values of
respect for others, the influence of violent television and movies,
violent games and sites on the Internet, and an influx of mostly
poor immigrants from other countries _ some of whom turn to crime
out of desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly worrisome is the fear that juvenile delinquency _
among both boys and girls _ is on the rise. While no hard
statistics are available, news accounts paint portraits of boys
involved in petty theft and even armed crimes, while girls as young
as 12 and 13 have become part of the sex trade. Many of the
customers are foreign visitors attracted to Costa Rica because
prostitution is legal for women 18 and older.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Vargas, former governor of the province that includes San
Jose and now director of youth programs for the Salvation Army,
says the problems stem from broken homes and dysfunctional
families. He worries that the nation is already facing a generation
of lost kids who are growing up to lives of crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're seeing those that 10 years ago were delinquents are
20 years old and involved in serious crime,'' he said. ``In the
last 10 years the problem with drugs has become more acute, but
unfortunately neither the state or society gave it the proper
importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Another major worry for many in Costa Rica is that the growing
crime rate will hurt tourism, which has become one of the nation's
top industries along with agriculture and light manufacturing. Last
year, more than 1 million visitors came to Costa Rica, spending
nearly $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The March murders of Emily Howell of Lexington, Ky. and Emily
Eagen of Ann Arbor, Mich., both of whom had attended Antioch
College in Yellow springs, Ohio, stunned Costa Rica and triggered a
torrent of international publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested two young men for the crime, one of whom was
recently convicted and sentenced to 15 years in jail _ the maximum
allowed in Costa Rica for a juvenile. The other youth, who is an
adult, faces trial soon. Police are still seeking another man, a
Nicaraguan, in the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The two 19-year-old women were staying near the Caribbean resort
of Puerto Viejo when the crime occurred. The area is popular with
college students and young tourists seeking the exotic rhythms and
Caribbean flavor there, but it is also known to be more
crime-ridden than the rest of Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Niehaus, head of the Costa Rican Institute for Tourism, a
Cabinet-level agency, said tourist bookings dropped by about 1
percent in the months immediately following the killings but have
since recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of Costa Rica was shocked by the killings, and we gave our
true feelings to the families,'' he said. ``But it was an isolated
incident. The police acted immediately and two men are now in
jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Niehaus and other top officials reacted aggressively to reassure
would-be travelers that Costa Rica is still a safe destination.
Responding to an invitation from former Florida Gov. Kenneth H.
``Buddy'' MacKay Jr., who is now President Clinton's special envoy
for Latin America, Niehaus headed a delegation of officials to
Miami-Dade County in June. There they studied South Florida's
response to a rash of tourist killings and crimes in the early
1990s that triggered a similar round of negative publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very helpful,'' Niehaus said, noting that Miami had set
up special signs to help guide tourists around the city. ``We are
going to have security brochures printed for visitors to advise
them about how to travel safely, along with information on the
Internet. We're also using more bicycle police, and will have a
special branch of tourist police stationed at the most popular
destinations in Costa Rica.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials have also cracked down on the exploitation of
under-age girls for sex, making several street sweeps and raiding
brothels where the girls were available. Visitors will also soon be
given brochures at the San Jose airport _ the primary gateway for
international tourists _ warning that having sex with under-age
girls is a crime and that if caught they will be punished, Niehaus
said.
</P>
<P>
   For all the publicity and public debate, officials insist that
seasoned travelers recognize that Costa Rica's reputation as a
safe, easygoing place is still deserved. While tourists have always
been warned to watch out for pick-pockets and petty thieves, the
government seems serious about taking firm steps against the more
serious crimes that could turn their tourist-rich paradise into a
less-than-desirable destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as bad as it has been made to sound,'' Niehaus said.
``But we are taking action. Because of our peaceful reputation, if
we have one high-profile crime, it gets a lot of attention.''

   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica _ The girls giggle in their classroom. They
laugh and joke with each other as they mop the floors and clean the
bathrooms of the large, comfortable house where they live.
</P>
<P>
   Juanita, who is 14, arranges her teddy bears on her bunk bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it here,'' she says of the shelter for homeless girls
run by the Salvation Army on the outskirts of this capital city.
``It's much prettier than the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Just six months ago, Juanita was a troubled runaway, standing on
a darkened corner in San Jose's tourist district, offering to have
sex with foreign men for money.
</P>
<P>
   Children's' advocates say Central America has become a Mecca for
the sex tourism industry, fed by graphic sites on the Internet that
advertise an anything-goes atmosphere, cheap travel costs and
crackdowns in more well-known sex tourism centers like Thailand and
the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Exploitation of children _ both boys and girls _ is the seamier
underside of the trade.
</P>
<P>
   As Central America's most prosperous, stable nation and its top
tourist destination, Costa Rica has been at the center of an
international spotlight on the problem. Prostitution is legal and
regulated by the government here _ but only for women 18 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedophiles look for three things _ anonymity, poverty and
impunity,'' said Bruce Harris, director of Latin American
operations for Covenant House, a private group that works with
troubled teens in several U.S. cities, as well as in Central
America. ``They find them here. These children are desperate and
vulnerable, and the government has not assumed its responsibility
for taking care of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris cites a U.S. State Department report that estimates as
many as 3,000 underage children may be sexually exploited in Costa
Rica, as well as a United Nations committee that expressed concern
over the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Costa Rican officials say the numbers are a gross exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
   ``To give that type of number is irresponsible,'' said Lilliam
Gomez(CQ Both), the country's top prosecutor for sex crimes. ``It's
clear the problem exists, but not in that dimension.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of their country's reputation as a family-oriented
tourism gem, government officials have taken steps to combat the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   New laws have been passed outlawing sex with children, and
perpetrators face prison terms of up to 10 years. Gomez has been
promised that her understaffed division will be beefed up, although
she has to see any increase in resources.
</P>
<P>
   The government has also funded a national ``Save Our Children''
advertising campaign, featuring television and print ads reminding
the public that children are the nation's most valuable resource.
Brochures will be printed for distribution to arriving visitors,
warning that sex with children is unlawful, while government
Internet sites pushing Costa Rican tourism will do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want those kinds of people coming here, and we don't
want our country known for that type of activity,'' said Costa
Rica's Tourism Minister, Walter Niehaus. ``We take this very
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Police have also cracked down on San Jose's red-light district.
While visitors can still find legal prostitutes in a number of bars
and casinos that cater to tourists, the bands of underage boys and
girls who only a few months ago roamed the district and brazenly
propositioned foreign men are gone.
</P>
<P>
   Several well-publicized raids have swept them from the streets
and also hampered the operation of private homes that serve as
brothels.
</P>
<P>
   But under-age prostitutes are still available. Visitors need
only ask a taxi driver outside any of the downtown bars, and they
will be taken to a private home where girls clearly under the age
of 18 make themselves available, sometimes for as little as US$16.
</P>
<P>
   Niehaus says he'll soon start a program in which taxi drivers
will display stickers warning their passengers not to ask for help
in finding young girls for sex.
</P>
<P>
   Harris says the government efforts are inadequate, aimed more at
spiffing up Costa Rica's image than helping the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating,'' he said. ``Until we see a big sign at
the airport showing the pictures of foreigners behind bars instead
of this dancing around to protect the country's image, nothing will
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Vargas, director of children's' programs for the Salvation
Army and a former governor of San Jose province, says the problem
is part of a wider crisis of delinquency and drug-use among Costa
Rica's youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our society has lost its values,'' he said. ``We need a change
in attitude by the public. This problem can't be solved by the
police alone. Society must understand that if we don't help these
children, they will only grow up into lives of crime.''
</P>
<P>
   In rural Costa Rica, girls have traditionally married at a young
age, and while there are no hard statistics, there are reports that
sexual abuse of children within families is not infrequent.
Nationwide, a quarter of Costa Rican mothers have their first child
between the ages of 15 and 18, and 41 percent of children are born
to single mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Juanita _ a fictitious name, since Costa Rican law protects the
identity of minors _ began her prostitution career at age 12.
Living in a rural province, she rebelled against her parents,
sleeping with boys for fun and for pay. She ran away, lived with
the family of a friend, and then was turned over to the child
welfare agency when she got caught having sex with that family's
15-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   She was sent to the Salvation Army shelter in San Jose, but ran
away for about a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was easy to be a prostitute,'' she said. ``I went to a park
and asked around and they told me where to go. I would stand on a
corner. All my clients were foreigners. I made about 30,000 colones
(US$100) a night.''
</P>
<P>
   Her money went for clothes and drugs for her friends. But she
gave it up after growing tired of the hard life on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was ugly and cold,'' she said. ``I like it better here.''
</P>
<P>
   Maricela Barboza, a psychologist at the shelter, said most of
the girls come from broken families, where many were sexually
abused by relatives. Some, like Juanita, stay for months at the
shelter and seem ready to turn their lives around.
</P>
<P>
   But others stay only a few days to rest, clean up and eat well,
before running away again to lives of drugs and exploitation on the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so hard for us to keep them here,'' she said. ``These
girls can make as much in one night as they would earn in one month
in a regular job.''

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By CHRISTOPHER HALL  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Leiden, a walkable city on two small branches of the Rhine
River, is something more than a nice little Dutch town, as it was
once described to me by a friend who lived there.
 &HT;    Although unmistakably Dutch in appearance _ with quiet
neighborhoods of gabled, canalside houses and a small open-air
market selling North Sea herring and wax-covered wheels of Gouda _
Leiden's window on the world is larger than its population of
117,000 would indicate.
 &HT;    Almost since the founding of its university in 1575, the city
has attracted some of the brightest minds in Europe, and these days
scholars from around the world go there to teach and conduct
research. The 11,000 students who attend the University of Leiden
and fill the city's dark, smoky coffeehouses keep things from
getting too fusty.
 &HT;    Perhaps because of its academic tradition and the Netherlands'
historic role as a crossroads of international commerce, Leiden is
a city of museums. With the exception of Amsterdam, which is 35
minutes northeast by train and has a population nearly seven times
that of Leiden, no other city in the Netherlands has such a broad
range of museums _ a dozen, large and small, covering everything
from classical antiquities to the history of medicine, to
windmills.
 &HT;    And for its size, Leiden is unusually rich in historic sites.
Rembrandt was born there; the city was an early center of
publishing and medicine; and the first tulips in Holland were
planted in the university's botanical garden. In the 17th century
America's Pilgrim Fathers took refuge in Leiden before leaving for
the New World via Plymouth, England.
 &HT;    Given our brief two days there in March, my partner, Mac, and I
decided to limit our museumgoing to three or four institutions and
our historic sites to those we could see on a leisurely walk around
Leiden's compact city center. It proved to be a good plan, although
we had to make several adjustments when confronted with unexpected
closures and renovations.
 &HT;    Knowing that many of the museums are closed on Mondays, we
arrived on a Tuesday. It was a cold and gray morning on the cusp of
spring at the city's modern glass-and-steel train station.
 &HT;    Exiting through a sea of bicycles parked outside the station, we
walked 10 minutes to the Rapenburg, a handsome tree-lined canal
along which some of Leiden's most prosperous citizens built stately
homes in the 17th century, when the city was flush with money from
the production of woolen cloth.
 &HT;    We stopped briefly to leave our bags at the Hotel De Doelen, a
converted 1638 neoclassical mansion where we were spending the
night, and then continued to the university and its botanical
garden.
 &HT;    The origins of the university and of Leiden's eventual
prominence lie in a Spanish siege of the city in 1574 during the
Protestant Dutch revolt against the iron rule of Catholic Spain.
Thousands of its citizens died of starvation and disease during the
siege, and popular belief has it that the mayor, one Van der Werf,
convinced a ravenous mob not to surrender only by offering his own
body as food.
 &HT;    A nice story, but as noted with admirable candor in a booklet I
picked up at Leiden's tourist office, ``its accuracy is dubious,
since the annals show that Van der Werf had to be dissuaded from
opening the gates to the Spaniards on more than one occasion.''
 &HT;    The booklet also casts doubt on another popular belief, that the
university was a gift from William of Orange in appreciation for
Leiden's successful resistance. Instead, it appears, the Protestant
Low Countries simply needed their own university, and Leiden made
sense because it was freed early on from Spain.
 &HT;    The main ceremonial building of the university, the Academy
(Academiegebouw), occupies a former Dominican convent on the
Rapenburg. A dignified, two-story brick structure with a steep
slate roof and a domed bell tower, the Academy still resembles a
church, although it is now used for lectures and official
university functions.
 &HT;    Behind the Academy is the university's Hortus Botanicus, a
botanical garden originally laid out in 1590 as a place to grow and
study medicinal and poisonous plants. In the 16th century such
gardens were common at universities with medical schools, but the
first curator of Leiden's garden, the Flemish botanist Carolus
Clusius, eventually had the novel idea of creating a place where
all known plants would be collected and studied.
 &HT;    As a result, imports from the New World _ such as the tomato,
the potato, tobacco and corn _ were introduced into Northern Europe
through the Leiden garden. Clusius also introduced tulips to
Holland (they were originally from Turkey), first planting them in
the Hortus in 1594.
 &HT;    Over the centuries, Clusius' garden has grown into a large oasis
of old trees, flowers and thousands of plant species from around
the world, although on the day we visited the entrance was torn up
by the construction of a new winter garden (which opened in May),
and the garden still had its bare, winter look.
 &HT;    As we walked around, however, we did come across a few signs of
spring _ several beds of crocus, swelling nodes on an ancient
wisteria, and a scattering of solitary daffodils, whose yellow
blooms looked particularly vibrant under the steely sky.
 &HT;    A light drizzle eventually drove us into the garden's extensive
greenhouses, where we happily wandered through the heavy, warm air,
passing under towering tree ferns and stopping to examine a
carnivorous plant from Borneo or cerise-colored blooms sprouting
like miniature feather boas from the branches of a New Guinea
euphorbia.
 &HT;    Back outside, we retraced our steps along the Rapenburg to the
National Museum of Antiquities (Rijksmuseum van Oudheden). It's the
principal archaeological museum in the Netherlands, and we'd been
looking forward to seeing its outstanding collection of Egyptian
and Classical Greek and Roman artifacts.
 &HT;    Unfortunately, we found the museum in the midst of a major
renovation (scheduled to be completed next spring), and most of its
permanent collection was on loan or in storage. What we did see
whetted our appetites _ papyrus manuscripts, beautifully
proportioned Greek vases, translucent alabaster cups and solemn,
marble busts of eminent Romans.
 &HT;    We both enjoyed a small display devoted to the ancient Egyptian
love of beer, and also managed to peek into the museum's most
dramatic gallery (which was closed): a covered courtyard filled
with heroic-sized statuary and an entire temple of Isis rescued
from the rising waters behind the Aswan Dam.
 &HT;    We ate a light lunch at Camino Real, a cozy, two-level
restaurant that occupies a former stable just around the corner
from the Academy. Surrounded by an animated university crowd of
professorial types in worn tweed jackets and students in jeans and
T-shirts, we split a bowl of flavorful celery-onion soup and a
sandwich of cheese, smoked salmon, avocado and mixed greens on
Italian flatbread.
 &HT;    By the time we finished, the overcast sky had yielded to
brilliant blue with billowing white clouds, so we spent the rest of
the afternoon walking around Leiden's center, stopping frequently
to investigate a shop or a historic building, or to admire spring
blooms placed in the front window of a house. Here and there were
mural-sized poems painted on the sides of buildings.
 &HT;    At Pieterskerk, a large old church a block off the Rapenburg,
now used for concerts and other nonreligious functions, we saw a
memorial plaque dedicated to John Robinson, the Pilgrims' spiritual
leader.
 &HT;    The Pilgrims arrived in Leiden in 1609 and left for America in
1620, in part because they feared that cosmopolitan Leiden would
corrupt their morals. Robinson intended to join them later but
never made it, dying in Leiden in 1625.
 &HT;    We weren't able to see inside the church since it was closed,
but on a nearby pedestrian lane of pleasant shops and restaurants
(Pieterskerk-Choorsteeg) we did spot a plaque marking the site of
the Pilgrims' printing press.
 &HT;    Across from the church, at Kloksteeg 21, we sat for a while in
the quiet, grassy courtyard of the 1683 almshouse that replaced
Robinson's residence. During Leiden's golden era, well-to-do
individuals _ some getting on in years and worried about the
salvation of their souls _ built small houses where elderly poor
people could live for free.
 &HT;    The almshouses are known in Dutch as ``hofjes,'' or ``little
courtyards,'' because they were traditionally built around a common
court that had a single opening onto the street. While many of
Leiden's 35 existing hofjes are now private residences, some
courtyards are open to the public; the visitors center has a
brochure outlining a walking tour.
 &HT;    The next day we arrived at the National Museum of the History of
Science and Medicine, known as the Boerhaave Museum, just as it was
opening. It had not been high on our list of museums, but our
friend Oliver Moore, who had recently moved to the city, had
convinced us that it had more to offer than pickled brains and
scary old surgical implements. It is housed in a beautifully
renovated building where Herman Boerhaave (1668-1738), an innovator
in clinical medicine, founded one of the first teaching hospitals
in the world.
 &HT;    The collection is quirky _ ranging from exquisitely crafted
microscopes of polished brass to an amusing display of antique
apothecary shop signs from Amsterdam, each depicting a human head
with mouth agape.
 &HT;    I was particularly fascinated by a reconstruction of Leiden's
Theatrum Anatomicum, a steeply raked anatomical theater where
Boerhaave and others performed human dissections while skeletons
and other memento mori loomed overhead.
 &HT;    Later that day we toured a collection of old Dutch tile,
household furnishings and paintings at the Lakenhal Municipal
Museum (Stedelijk Museum De Lakenhal), which occupies the city's
1640 cloth hall. In the galleries we saw one of Rembrandt's
earliest dated paintings, ``An Unidentified Historical Subject,'' a
fussy mythological scene from 1625 that is far more detailed and
far less striking than his mature works.
 &HT;    Although Rembrandt first studied painting in Leiden, he became
famous only after settling in Amsterdam in 1631. His boyhood home
no longer exists, but other sites connected with his youth in
Leiden _ such as the street (Weddesteeg) where he grew up and the
Latin School on Lokhorststraat where he studied _ still survive.
 &HT;    Toward the end of the day, while on our way to the train
station, we stopped at the restored 18th-century windmill that now
houses the Valk Municipal Windmill Museum (Stedelijk Molenmuseum De
Valk). The Valk is one of about 950 windmills left in the
Netherlands, down from 10,000 about 100 years ago.
 &HT;    Oliver's wife, Ts'ai Ch'in, had encouraged us to visit the Valk,
and once inside I could see why. After a brief look at the
informative historical displays, we clambered up ladder-like steps,
passed the massive grinding wheels and stepped onto the outside
platform, where the mill's huge sails swooped precariously close to
our heads.
 &HT;    Although we had a train to catch, we lingered a few minutes,
enjoying a bird's-eye view of Leiden and the bracing feel of North
Sea wind on our faces.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By E. CLINTON HOTALING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    This has been the Whitney century at Saratoga Springs.
 &HT;    In 1900, William C. Whitney, who made millions in New York City
street railways, took over Saratoga Race Course, expanded it and
reinvigorated the whole town. Soon his cronies, notably Reggie
Vanderbilt and John Bet-a-Million Gates, were dropping hundreds of
thousands of dollars at Richard A. Canfield's casino, and Victor
Herbert and John Philip Sousa were playing the Springs.
 &HT;    In 2000, Whitney's Victorian grandstand is still the town's
symbol, and the racing season is by far the best in the country.
The high-rollers' ghosts pad about the Casino museum. The New York
City Ballet, the Philadelphia Orchestra and Britney Spears, among
others, play the Performing Arts Center. And most amazing, although
she has lowered her public profile a bit, a Whitney towers over the
resort.
 &HT;    Marylou Whitney's wealth has been a royal force in preserving
Saratoga, and when she arrives for the Whitney Gala on Friday at
the Casino in Congress Park, it will launch the season in earnest.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    A who's who of thoroughbreds and jockeys stars at Saratoga Race
Course, America's oldest major sports venue. The 36-day program was
scheduled to open on Wednesday and runs through Labor Day. After
attracting 900,000-plus fans last season, a record, the New York
Racing Association has poured more millions into this year's
purses, bringing them to $8.7 million, another record.
 &HT;    The $1 million Travers Stakes on Aug. 26 is the highlight of the
season. The $750,000 Whitney Handicap will be run next Sunday and
the $750,000 Alabama Stakes on Aug. 19.
 &HT;    The original track, now in a stable area across Union Avenue,
dates from 1847 and today's main course from 1864. The races start
at 1 p.m. every day except Tuesday, when the track is closed, and
Aug. 26, when the first post time is 12:30 p.m. General admission,
$2; $4 for the clubhouse (no short-shorts, cut-offs, tank tops).
 &HT;    Breakfast at the track from 7 to 9:30 a.m. allows you to see
workouts, the barn area, a paddock show and a starting-gate
demonstration. No reservations are required (first come first
served), though the lines are often long on nice days. Information:
(518) 584-6200.
 &HT;    The resort's other great show is at the Saratoga Performing Arts
Center on Route 50 just outside town. It seats 5,000 in the
amphitheater, with room for 20,000 more on the lawn. Among the
stars: ``Lord of the Dance'' (Aug. 13), Counting Crows and Live
with Galactic (Aug. 14), Pearl Jam (Aug. 27), the Dave Matthews
Band (Aug. 29) and Britney Spears (Aug. 30). Ticket prices for
special events range from $8 on the lawn for the Boys Choir of
Harlem to $48 for the best seats in the amphitheater for Counting
Crows and Live with Galactic. For information, call (518) 587-3330.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    In the spectacular new wing of the National Museum of Racing and
Hall of Fame, at 191 Union Ave. (www.racingmuseum.org), you can see
saddles used by Julie Krone and Bill Shoemaker, the Triple Crown
trophies won by Whirlaway, the gold-plated diamond-encrusted whip
presented to the jockey Jerry Bailey for Cigar's victory in the
Dubai World Cup in 1996, and the whip Ron Turcotte did not have to
use as Secretariat passed the eighth pole on the way to his
unforgettable 1973 Belmont Stakes triumph (the pole itself is on
the front lawn). It's all in the new Hall of Fame Heroes room, part
of an $8 million renovation.
 &HT;    The exhibits are by turns memory-jogging (the silks Steve
Cauthen wore in navigating Affirmed to his narrow triumphs over
Alydar), delightful (the mail sent to Kelso) and really odd (a
photograph of a crowd staring at Man o' War's corpse). The museum
is open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily through the racing season, then 10
a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Saturday and noon to 4:30 p.m.
Sunday. Admission is $7; (518) 584-0400.
 &HT;    Visitors can design their own sightseeing strolls past
Saratoga's lovely old homes (for a guide, you can stop by the Urban
Heritage Area visitor center across from Congress Park on Broadway
or the Chamber of Commerce booth in front of the park). One of the
most eye-opening would take in Greek revival homes from the 1820's
onward. Walk from Broadway up Division Street for three blocks to
find five examples: Nos. 1, 3 and 4 Franklin Square and Nos. 59 and
63 Franklin Street.
 &HT;    Another walk would introduce you to Congress Park and its
circa-1900 Florentine marble Tritons in a pool. Vandalized last
year, they are now repaired and furiously blowing water at each
other again.
 &HT;    Or you can drive past the racecourse on Union Avenue and through
the entrance to the wooded Yaddo artists retreat, now celebrating
its centennial, and walk through classical Italian rose and
Anglo-American rock gardens, graced with pools and century-old
statuary. Guided garden tours at 11 a.m. Tuesdays (until Labor
Day), Saturdays and Sundays are $2; (518) 584-0746.
 &HT;    Early birds can catch one of Saratoga's loveliest sights, the
thoroughbreds working out in the morning mist (from 5:30 to 10:30)
at the Oklahoma training track. The public is not allowed through
the gate but you can still get a nice view through the fence along
East Avenue, between Fifth and Union avenues. (The National Museum
of Racing offers tours that take groups inside the gate during
training; $10, which includes museum admission.)
 &HT;    The Adelphi Hotel, 365 Broadway, is a downtown landmark, its
luscious antique lobby a good place to stop for a drink. Cross the
street for a view of the hotel's glorious raised piazza, with
pierced spandrel openings, thin three-story columns, high Victorian
windows, and Renaissance and Italianate motifs. It's from 1877,
when they got the most out of a stoop.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Hotel reservations can be hard to come by through Labor Day,
especially on weekends.
 &HT;    Now into its first full racing season, the 112-room Hilton
Garden Inn, 125 South Broadway, (518) 587-1500, fax (518) 587-7800,
has an indoor pool, exercise room and business center. The price is
middle range, considering that this town's rates assume everybody
has hit an exacta. Rooms are spacious and loaded with amenities,
including high-speed Internet access, microwave, hair dryer,
refrigerator and a safe big enough for a laptop; from $189 through
Labor Day, then $99 to $179.
 &HT;    At the 42-room Downtowner Motel, (888) 480-6160, fax (518)
584-2907, under new management, I was happy to step around four
cast members of ``Grease,'' starring at the Performing Arts Center
but just then doing situps on the floor around the indoor pool.
Rooms have been nicely redone, are cheerful and very up to date;
from $137 through Labor Day, then $75. It's smack in the middle of
everything at 413 Broadway.
 &HT;    Budget: At the southern end of Broadway, but within a healthy
walk of downtown, is the 18-room St. Charles Motel, 188 Broadway,
(518) 584-2050, fax (518) 584-6216, with cozy rooms starting at
$125 through Labor Day, then $55.
 &HT;    The Locust Grove Motel is actually in a locust grove about three
and a half miles south of town, at 2838 Route 9, Malta; (888)
256-2878, fax (518) 580-1817. It has two 16-unit buildings and two
cabin units. Rooms have kitchenettes, at $99 through Labor Day,
then $50.
 &HT;    Luxury: In its second season, the Saratoga Arms, 495-497
Broadway, (518) 584-1775, fax (518) 581-4064, is a magnificently
restored Second Empire brick hotel dating from 1870, the year Henry
James visited Saratoga. He would have loved this 16-room hotel
rescued from demolition by Kathleen and Noel Smith. Rooms have
antique furnishings and high ceilings; several have fireplaces and
clawfoot tubs; all have voice mail, data ports, cable TV and CD
players; a full Irish breakfast is served. Rooms from $275 through
Labor Day, then from $150.
 &HT;    The 168-room Holiday Inn, at 232 Broadway, (518) 584-4550, fax
(518) 584-4417, is the perfect starting gate for walks into
Congress Park or past the period homes on and off Circular Street.
It has a full-scale restaurant and bar and a heated outdoor pool.
Many of the newly appointed rooms have views of the park or town.
Room prices range from $219 through Labor Day, then $150.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Chez Sophie Bistro, 2853 Route 9, Malta, (518) 583-3538, is like
a trip to France, serving memorable fare that belies its setting: a
converted diner in Malta, three and a half miles south of town. It
is run by Sophie Parker, the French-born chef, and her husband,
Joseph, a sculptor, assisted by their son, Paul. A recent meal
included chanterelles in a reduction of chicken stock and sherry; a
salad of baby field greens and organic lettuces, and swordfish
pan-sauteed with a sherry wine vinegar vinaigrette, sweet red
peppers and shallots. The cheese plate included St. Agur, Reblochon
and crottin de Chavignol. Dinner for two with a modest bottle of
wine: $110 to $120.
 &HT;    The hottest place in town is Chianti, 208 South Broadway, (518)
580-0025, with an open kitchen and glowing burnt-sienna decor.
Owned by the irrepressible David Zecchini, from Rome, and his wife,
Maria, it features the bold tastes of their 31-year-old chef,
Fabrizio Bazzani, from Verona. Popular specialties: an appetizer of
carpaccio in truffle oil with a Gorgonzola sauce, porcini risotto
and a white chocolate gelato requiring a week of penance. Dinner
for two with wine: $100.
 &HT;    Out Union Avenue, just before you hit Saratoga Lake, is the
comfortable Longfellows Inn and Restaurant, 500 Union Ave., (518)
587-0108, created from two dairy barns. High on many diners' lists:
the bourbon-glazed salmon and pan-seared tournedos. Dinner for two
with wine comes to about $100.
 &HT;    Joseph DeVivo, talented scion of a well-known Saratoga family,
is the maestro of Maestro's, 371 Broadway, (518) 580-0312, where
you dine to the accompaniment of recorded jazz and blues in the
heart of town. Specialties include osso bucco, crab cakes and
freshly made pastas. Dinner and wine for two: $70.
 &HT;    With its Southern fried chicken, such Louisiana specialties as
Creole jambalaya, and red snapper Provencal, Hattie's, 45 Phila
St., (518) 584-4790, is the real deal for bargain hunters. At this
convivial down-home restaurant, two can dine with a bottle of wine
for $50; there is also a late menu, with many items under $7, from
10:30 p.m. to 12:30 a.m.
 &HT;    At Ashleigh's, 506 Broadway, (518) 580-0329, you can get a fine
breakfast, such as a sausage-potato-cheese omelet, for under $7. Or
a lunch of grilled chicken with bacon, cheese and barbecue sauce on
a roll, under $7. Or, starting this season, a steak, seafood or
pasta dinner for two with wine for less than $40. It's a pleasant,
airy spot, and this being Saratoga, it's in a corner of a
magnificent Romanesque revival building.

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY MARIALISA CALTA  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Every year, as my husband and I pack the car for our August
vacation, we look around at the impossibly green, impossibly
beautiful Vermont landscape and ask each other if we are crazy.
 &HT;    Why would anyone leave Vermont in the summer, when there are so
many swimming holes to splash in, so many country fairs to visit,
so many trails to hike?
 &HT;    Why would anyone leave during the time of year when our
down-country friends would trade in their theater tickets to stay
even in the sagging old farmhouse we live in, and a chance to watch
the sun set over the mountains and hear the crickets at night?
 &HT;    One of my closest friends comes to Vermont from the Upper West
Side of Manhattan each summer with her husband and two children,
renting a house not far from ours. She delights in going fishing
and canoeing, taking walks and shopping at the local farmers'
market. She and her family love Vermont, and every year Dirk and I
have the opportunity to see our home state anew through their eyes.
 &HT;    I realize once again how lucky we are to live within walking
distance of a pond that features both good swimming and excellent
boating, and a general store where the owners not only know our
names but also extend credit.
 &HT;    In summer, the night sky offers northern lights and shooting
stars, swooping bats and symphony-quality thunderstorms. There are
farms to visit and potters' studios and small gallery shows by
wonderful artists. There are mountains to climb and, in nearly
every village, a Vermont institution: the ``creemee'' stand,
offering soft-serve ice cream in vanilla, chocolate and maple.
 &HT;    So why, come August, do we pack our two children and our dog and
way, way too much stuff into our Subaru wagon and take a grueling,
16-hour drive north? Prince Edward Island, our destination, is,
after all, not that much different from Vermont. Cows graze in
pastures that slope to the water's edge. Towns are small and
manageable, and people are reserved but friendly. ``Vermont with
ocean'' is how we describe Prince Edward to our stay-home friends.
 &HT;    While others may seek cultural stimulation on their vacations,
my husband and I see our few weeks off as an opportunity to get
some much-needed exercise and simplify our lives. We live in a
place that offers plenty of opportunity for both.
 &HT;    But whether or not we've brought it on ourselves, we have
certainly managed to complicate our lives. We spend many more hours
driving our kids to sports and school events than contemplating
nature, and much more time absorbed in our work than working out on
country roads.
 &HT;    Our lives are cluttered with the trappings of contemporary
America _ computers and portable phones, TV and videos, stores
offering way too much stuff and credit cards offering way too much
money to buy it with.
 &HT;    The main reason anyone who lives in a vacation destination
leaves it for another is simple: we live here. We're not on
vacation.
 &HT;    While my New York friends Pam and Carl may spend their Vermont
days splashing with their kids, I spend mine e-mailing, faxing and
phoning _ not to mention laundering, shopping, cooking and
cleaning.
 &HT;    I can't remember the last time I went fishing with my daughters
(who, at 15 and 12, would now regard me as demented if I were to
suggest it), or did much of anything else with them except drop
them at the pond or _ more to their liking _ at the nearest mall.
 &HT;    I know people who take ``at home'' vacations, visiting all the
attractions they never get a chance to see, but I don't think I
could manage it. My home is my workplace, and it's hard to get out
the door to go recreate while the phones are ringing.
 &HT;    So each summer we drive north to impose our fantasies of a
slower paced life on the Prince Edward Islanders. We do almost
nothing for days on end and marvel at how laid-back the islanders
are.
 &HT;    The friends we have made there do seem to have more time for
music and visiting, but that's probably because we are the ones who
are dropping by, urging them to pick up their fiddles.
 &HT;    Surely they have just as much laundry to do, and I often hear
their children clamoring to go to ``town'' (as the capital city,
Charlottetown, is called) and shop the malls. I've noticed a
proliferation of cell phones since we first started going there
about 10 summers ago.
 &HT;    Last August the carpenter who built the cabin we own gave us his
pager number. The rest of the year we communicate with him by fax
and e-mail.
 &HT;    For two or three weeks, we fancy ourselves part of something a
little purer, somewhat less materialistic and more genteel than
what we experience at home _ just as, I think, Pam feels when she
leaves the hubbub of her neighborhood.
 &HT;    And it works. Our life on vacation is less crazy and
materialistic, and more genteel. I go biking and berry-picking with
my daughters, and the four of us sleep outside some nights and
watch northern lights and meteor showers even more spectacular than
we see at home in darkness that, since we are miles from an
electric light, seems more absolute than in Vermont.
 &HT;    The weekly trip to the Laundromat seems like a pleasant outing
compared with the daily load or two I do routinely at home. Even a
trip to the carwash is a maritime adventure: The one in Souris _
the town closest to our cabin _ offers a ridiculously spectacular
ocean view. I can count fishing boats and sea gulls while vacuuming
the red island clay from the floor mats.
 &HT;    Food shopping is a treat: we delight in seeking out fishermen
and local gardeners to sell us some of what we will eat each
evening. And cooking on the tiny propane stove or over a campfire
at our cabin is much more fun than it is at home, where the
microwave and the food processor make the chore more mechanical. We
play hearts by candlelight and read big fat books that we have no
time for back in Vermont.
 &HT;    Most important for me is the fact that I get to spend several
weeks without hearing a phone ring or a fax beep, or checking any
sort of mail whatsoever.
 &HT;    We leave our home, in fact, for the same reason people in New
York or Paris or any other world-class vacation destination leave
theirs: for a change of scenery and a change of pace.
 &HT;    Travelers often indulge in the fantasy that the people in the
places they visit lead lives that are more civilized, or more down
to earth, or more ``spiritual'' than their own workaday existences.
In truth it is the travelers themselves _ separated from familiar
rooms and belongings _ who are forced to focus more on who they are
and what is important to them.
 &HT;    We return, of course, to stacks of mail and desks full of the
work that piled up while we were away. But if time and distance
have worked their magic, we return also with a renewed appreciation
for where we live, and a sense of pride that people ``from away''
will travel long distances to gaze at the views we take for
granted.
 &HT;    Recently, some of our friends from Prince Edward Island, who
usually stick very close to home, sent us an e-mail message that
said they were contemplating a vacation this year. They are
thinking of coming to Vermont. We can't wait to show them how
laid-back we are.

 By WILLIAM T. TOMICKI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;     Q:  My wife and I are headed to London. We want to be treated
like royalty, but we don't have a king's ransom to spend. Are we
dreaming or does a hotel exist that can wow us?
 &HT;     Q:  The Rubens at The Palace will treat you and your wife like
a king and queen without breaking your wallet. This hotel is
perfectly located opposite Buckingham Palace in the heart of London
and is within easy reach of St. James' Park, historic sites, the
financial district and West End theaters
 &HT;    The Rubens provides guests with outstanding personal service,
thanks to the congenial general manager, Jonathan Raggett. Every
modern business and leisure convenience has been provided here, yet
the owner, the innovative Bea Tollman, has furnished The Rubens in
a luxurious residential fashion with rich fabrics and antiques. I
know of no other hotel that so thoughtfully fills their room desks
with essential office supplies.
 &HT;    The Rubens' assets include the popular Cavalry Bar done in a
classic British military theme; The Palace Lounge for tea and a
quiet read overlooking the historic Royal Mews; The Library
Restaurant for the finest British and international cuisine; and
The Carvery for traditional roasts and more.
 &HT;    Be it a business or vacation stay, The Rubens, a member of the
Red Carnation Hotel Collection, is truly a memorable experience run
by snappy, kind people who pride themselves on the fact that no
detail is overlooked and no request is too large. Rates start at
$250 a night, double occupancy. For more information, call (800)
858-8471, or visit www.redcarnationhotels.com on the Web.
 &HT;     Q: . My girlfriend and I are planning a vacation to Mexico and
are searching for several intimate, high-quality hotels. We want to
stay away from chain hotels. Any suggestions?
 &HT;     A:  Mexico Boutique Hotels is a collection of member properties
that are characterized by uniqueness and their high level of
service.
 &HT;    The hotels in the Mexico Boutique Hotel group have less than 50
rooms. Style of accommodation varies and often includes villas,
casitas and bungalows. Some play on a sense of grandeur, while
others return to the basics of palm-thatched cottages.
 &HT;    To see the complete selection of Mexico Boutiques Hotels, visit
www.mexicoboutiquehotels.com on the Web.
 &HT;     Q:  My fiancee and I really enjoy being in the great outdoors,
and for his birthday I would love to give him something we could
both use when we go hiking or biking.
 &HT;     A:  For the latest outdoor gadgets and toys, turn to Motorola.
They have just released their latest line of two-way radios, the
Talkabout T6300 series.
 &HT;    These new two-way radios feature just about everything an
adventure enthusiast could want _ current weather reports; audible
storm-warning alerts; a built-in clock, alarm and stopwatch; a
noise filter to protect against unwanted noise in the surrounding
environment; and the radios are dust and shock resistant. They
provide 532 signals so you can be sure to find an unused channel.
 &HT;    With a range of up to two miles (depending upon terrain), these
gadgets are great for rural and urban settings alike. For the
city-dweller, these gadgets are useful at concerts and the mall and
are an excellent way for parents to stay in contact with their
families. With a retail price between $129 to $179 per radio, the
T6300 series is quite affordable.
 &HT;    Motorola also offers a wide range of extras such as
voice-activated headsets and a wall-mountable battery-charging
station, which allows the radios to be used as an intercom system.
 &HT;    Overall, the Motorola Talkabouts are at the top of today's
market in terms of quality, versatility and functionality. The
T6300 series will become available nationwide in September.
 &HT;     Q:  My family has strong Italian roots, but I've never
experienced any of the legendary neighborhoods in American cities
that I've often heard about. Trips to New York and San Francisco
felt too touristy. Are there any legitimate Italian neighborhoods
left to explore?
 &HT;     A:  A lively one can be found in Boston's North End. Visit on a
late Saturday afternoon in summer, when the air is warm and
fragrant with the lingering aromas of lunch, and the whole
neighborhood seems to pause before the rigors of the evening meal.
 &HT;    Wander around and explore the side streets. You might find a
sweet old lady with a lemonade stand, or a strolling parish priest
saying buona sera to the locals.
 &HT;    To purchase olive oils and foodstuffs, visit Salumeria Italiano
at 151 Richmond St., a few blocks from the Old North Church and
Paul Revere's home.
 &HT;    For a truly authentic touch, head to Salem Street and Polcari's
Coffee, a spice store that's really a catch-all grocery for the
locals. Engineers who miss their old neighborhood work weekends as
clerks. Enjoy the banter as folks drop in to buy chestnut flour or
flavorings for homemade liqueurs. Tape a dollar to the collection
poster for the saint whose festival is coming up. If you're lucky,
there will be a miniparade to collect all the offerings.
 &HT;    With its narrow streets, the North End is best reached by cab or
subway _ anything to avoid parking and the epic nuisance of the Big
Dig, Boston's traffic nightmare. Visitor information is available
at www.northendboston.com.
 &HT;     Q:  I will be traveling to Southern France and would like to
see some ancient sites. Do you have any suggestions that will put
me in the heart of ancient France?
 &HT;     A:  The recently renovated Hotel de la Cite near Carcassonne is
now giving historical, cultural and lifestyle tours of their area
in the legendary Southwest region of Languedoc-Roussillon.
 &HT;    Carcassonne is Europe's largest and most perfectly preserved
medieval city. Among the highlights of the escorted tours are Roman
ruins, a 13th-century dungeon, a 14th-century palace, an
11th-century abbey and famous castles. Cities visited include
Arques, Castelnou, Limoux, Narbonnes and Toulouse.
 &HT;    The fully escorted half-day tours range in price from $14 to $70
per person, and full-day tours are approximately $88 to $103 per
person, including all transportation and entrance fees.
 &HT;    Renovated in 1999, the Hotel de la Cite was formerly an
Episcopal palace and today is a member of Orient-Express hotels. It
combines magnificent neo-gothic stained-glass windows and mosaic
floors with five-star amenities.
 &HT;    The hotel features fine gourmet cuisine plus less-formal dining
options to accommodate a wide variety of tastes. For more
information or reservations, call (800) 223-6800, or visit
www.hoteldelacite.com on the Web.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Readers are invited to submit questions to William Tomicki, P.O.
Box 5148, Santa Barbara, Calif. 93150. Although he cannot answer
each query individually, selected questions will be included in his
column. Mr. Tomicki, who logs over 150,000 miles each year, is the
publisher of ENTREE, a travel newsletter.

 (Color slide included.) 
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Planning a road trip this fall? Here are some newly published
travel guides that can help with the journey.
 &HT;    ``Literary Trips: Following in the Footsteps of Fame,'' edited
by Victoria Brooks (GreatestEscapes.com Publishing, 2000; $19.95),
is a personal and occasionally quirky look at the places that
literary greats such as Bruce Chatwin, Agatha Christie and Ernest
Hemingway made famous.
 &HT;    Divided into geographic areas, the home turf of each literary
figure is nicely evoked by a guest writer. For example, Richard
Taylor writes an homage to Bruce Chatwin, Yvonne Geoffrey Hope
muses about the England of A.A. Milne and Elaine Glusac waxes
poetic about Garrison Keilor's Minnesota.
 &HT;    There's also practical information that true devotees can
devour. For example, it's possible to sleep where Bruce Chatwin did
at the Melanka Lodge in Alice Springs, Australia. Or drink in El
Floridita, Ernest Hemingway's favorite Havana bar. It's a fun read
for the literary-minded.
 &HT;    For some visitors to New York, architecture is the single best
reason to come to the Big Apple. So they'll applaud the fourth
edition of ``The AIA Guide to New York City,'' by Norval White and
Elliott Willensky (Three Rivers Press, 2000; $35).
 &HT;    At more than 1,000 pages, this brick-shaped book is filled with
prose that is sharp and opinionated, as the writers point out the
best, the worst and the strangest structures on the sidewalks of
New York.
 &HT;    The Chrysler Building may be one of he most famous in New York,
but the authors say ``don't miss the lobby, an Art Deco confection
of African marble and chrome steel.'' Rockefeller Center merits
being called ``an island of architectural excellence.''
 &HT;    As for Trump Tower, developer Donald Trump's ``fantasyland for
the affluent shopper,'' the authors write that Trump's aesthetics
``are still more akin to malt liquor than to Veuve Cliquot.''
 &HT;    ``Kids' New York,'' by Christopher Maynard (Dorling Kindersley
Travel Guides, 2000; $7.95) is for younger visitors to the big
city. In a book with as many color photographs as descriptive
passages, Maynard makes dozens of good suggestions for what to do
with the kids in New York City. They range from Saturday-morning
storytelling sessions at the bronze statue of Hans Christian
Andersen in Central Park to the American Museum of the Moving Image
and the baseball batting cages at Chelsea Piers.
 &HT;    This should keep kids and parents busy for at least a week, as
should a sister guide, ``Kids London,'' by Simon Adams (Dorling
Kindersley Travel Guides, 2000; $7.95), when they go to Britain.
 &HT;    Lonely Planet is always on the cutting edge of guidebooks, and
this season they have two new series of note. The ``Read This
First'' series is aimed at first-time travelers, but even veteran
road warriors could benefit from its advice.
 &HT;    ``Read This First: Europe,'' by Paul Harding (Lonely Planet,
2000; $14.99) is filled with loads of practical information,
examples and profiles of every European country. That's a lot to
jam into a 400-plus-page book, but Harding does an admirable job.
 &HT;    There's information on passports, health and packing, culled
from years of Lonely Planet tips. And the country profiles, while
brief, are not only informative but provide itineraries for
travelers who might have three days, a week, even a month or two.
That's especially useful for first-time travelers, who are famous
for trying to see too much in too little time.
 &HT;    Another guide in the new series, ``Read This First: Central &AMP;
South America,'' by Conner Gorry (Lonely Planet, 2000; $14.99),
does the same for Latin America.
 &HT;    Lonely Planet's ``World Food: Turkey,'' by Dana Valent and Jim
and Perihan Masters (Lonely Planet, 2000; $11.99) is smartly
written and wonderfully illustrated with color photographs.
 &HT;    As more American travelers focus on the delights of eating
native cuisine, a guide like this is indispensable. That's
especially true in Turkey, a country with fantastic food that,
unfortunately, is not well-known here.
 &HT;    A glossary and dictionary helps matters considerably, but the
guide goes way beyond food descriptions. There are useful entries
on the types of eateries one encounters, from ``lokanta,'' a basic
place, to a fancier ``restoran'' to ``pideci,'' a Turkish version
of a pizza parlor. There's a look at regional specialties, markets
and the history of the cuisine as well. Look for forthcoming Lonely
Planet World Food guides to such countries as Mexico, Morocco and
Vietnam.
 &HT;    The most unusual travel guides of the year have to be ``Fodors'
to Go.'' They're the size of perhaps four credit cards stacked
together and come with magnetic covers. They unfold,
accordion-style, and easily fit into a shirt pocket.
 &HT;    The brief text and photographic illustrations are perfect for
the traveling businessperson with little time and even less space
for luggage. A guide like ``48 Hours in London'' (Fodor's, 2000;
$4.95) has a step-by-step two-day itinerary for exploring the city.
It comes complete with maps, lunch and dinner suggestions,
flea-market and afternoon-tea recommendations and even a few
write-ups on shops and museums. It's a marvel of miniaturization,
as is ``Italian for Travelers'' (Fodor's, 2000; $4.95), another in
the series that promises to help readers ``speak Italian right
away.'' It certainly beats carrying a dog-eared phrase book.

 PLEASE NOTE: Optional-trim indicators are included in this

 &HT;    
 (Color slide included.) 
 By ADELE MALOTT 
 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Repositioning cruises offer some of the best values in the
travel business. And the fall cruise season _ a time when cruise
lines begin moving their ships to new locations _ is a good
opportunity to try one.
 &HT;    The Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) cites these
advantages for repositioning cruises:
 &HT;     _ ONE-OF-A-KIND ITINERARIES.  Because ships are moving from one
part of the world to another, the combination of ports visited is
unique. Often these itineraries include ocean or Panama Canal
crossings as well as ports not usually visited on other sailings.
 &HT;     _ VALUE.  Two-for-one fares, air-inclusive offers and a variety
of off-season promotional rates make cruise prices very attractive.
 &HT;     _ SPECIAL ENTERTAINMENT.  Cruise lines may enhance their
repositioning cruises with entertainment that isn't always offered
on other cruises.
 &HT;     _ EXTRA DAYS.  Longer itineraries allow more time at sea.
 &HT;    However, you should be aware that cruise lines may use
repositioning voyages to train new staff or to try new shore trips,
giving an experimental flavor to the cruise.
 &HT;    Contact your travel agent about these repositioning cruises or
others that will be offered this fall:
 &HT;    _ America Cruise Lines, which sails the waterways of the U.S.
East Coast year-round, will be in Baltimore on Nov. 4 before
heading to Jacksonville, Fla., for the winter months.
 &HT;    _ Costa Cruises Lines leaves Europe from Genoa to head for the
Caribbean Nov. 3 and 17. Ports of call: the Bahamas, British Virgin
Islands, Canary Islands, Guadeloupe, Leeward Island, Madeira,
Morocco and Spain.
 &HT;    _ Holland America Line moves five vessels from Alaska to the
Caribbean on trips ranging from 17 to 22 days. Departures are in
September and October with 17- or 22-day cruises that pass through
the Panama Canal.
 &HT;    _ Norwegian Cruise Line's Norwegian Wind leaves Vancouver Sept.
18 to sail a special 11-day Hawaiian Island itinerary before moving
on to the Caribbean.
 &HT;    _ After its inaugural season in Bermuda, the Pacific Princess
leaves New York on Oct. 29 to move to the Holy Land. There will be
16 days at sea with port calls in Ponta Delgada and Lisbon,
Portugal; Gibraltar; Barcelona; Cannes; Laverno; and Rome.
 &HT;    _ Royal Olympic moves its Stella Solaris from the Mediterranean
to the Caribbean with a Dec. 1 sailing from Piraeus, Greece. Ports
include Naples, Capri and Civitavecchia in Italy; Nice, France;
Cartagena, Spain; Tangier, Morocco; Lisbon and Madeira, Portugal;
San Juan; and Fort Lauderdale.
 &HT;    _ Seabourn Cruise Line has a Three Continent Discovery on its
Legend beginning Oct. 20 in Lisbon. Available in segments of six,
13 or 19 days, the itinerary has stops in Funchal, Madeira; Dakar,
Senegal; Bridgetown, Barbados; Virgin Gorda, BVI; San Juan; and
Fort Lauderdale.
 &HT;    
 BETTER BREATHING CARIBBEAN CRUISE  
 &HT;    The Better Breathing Club of Norwalk Hospital, in Norwalk,
Conn., is offering a cruise through the Eastern Caribbean for
travelers with chronic pulmonary diseases. Arrangements will be
made for those needing supplemental oxygen in flight and during the
cruise.
 &HT;    The cruise is aboard Celebrity's The Century, which leaves from
Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Nov. 4 for a week's cruise with stops in San
Juan, St. Maarten, St. Thomas and Nassau.
 &HT;    Traveling with the group will be a pulmonary physician, nurses
and respiratory therapists. Prices start at $1,018, including port
charges. Air, insurance, oxygen and special equipment is extra. For
more information, call (800) 536-9383.
 &HT;    
 $1,000 SAVINGS  
 &HT;    First European Cruises is offering a $1,000 savings per person
on September and October sailings aboard the Mistral in the Eastern
Mediterranean. It sails round trip from Venice on seven-day cruises
to Dubrovnik, Katakolon, Santorini, Mykonos, Rhodes and Piraeus
(Athens). Discounted departure dates are Sept. 2, 9, 16, 23 and
Oct. 7, 14, 21 and 28.
 &HT;    The cruise-only promotional rates start at $1,250/double for an
outside cabin. Round-trip airfare add-ons from Venice are available
from 50 gateways and for $950 from the East Coast, $1,200 West
Coast. For more information, call (888) 983-8767, or visit

 &HT;    
 NEW HAWAIIAN SHIP  
 &HT;    Starting Dec. 9, the United States Lines' first ship, the ms
Patriot (formerly Holland America Line's Nieuw Amsterdam), will
begin cruise vacations to four Hawaiian islands on a seven-night

Northwest.
 &HT;    All departures include two nights on Amtrak between California
and Portland, Ore., with travelers boarding the Coast Starlight at
any of its regular stops between San Diego and Sacramento.
Departures on the 10-night programs start Nov. 9, while seven-night

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By CHRISTOPHER HALL  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Leiden, a walkable city on two small branches of the Rhine
River, is something more than a nice little Dutch town, as it was
once described to me by a friend who lived there.
 &HT;    Although unmistakably Dutch in appearance _ with quiet
neighborhoods of gabled, canalside houses and a small open-air
market selling North Sea herring and wax-covered wheels of Gouda _
Leiden's window on the world is larger than its population of
117,000 would indicate.
 &HT;    Almost since the founding of its university in 1575, the city
has attracted some of the brightest minds in Europe, and these days
scholars from around the world go there to teach and conduct
research. The 11,000 students who attend the University of Leiden
and fill the city's dark, smoky coffeehouses keep things from
getting too fusty.
 &HT;    Perhaps because of its academic tradition and the Netherlands'
historic role as a crossroads of international commerce, Leiden is
a city of museums. With the exception of Amsterdam, which is 35
minutes northeast by train and has a population nearly seven times
that of Leiden, no other city in the Netherlands has such a broad
range of museums _ a dozen, large and small, covering everything
from classical antiquities to the history of medicine, to
windmills.
 &HT;    And for its size, Leiden is unusually rich in historic sites.
Rembrandt was born there; the city was an early center of
publishing and medicine; and the first tulips in Holland were
planted in the university's botanical garden. In the 17th century
America's Pilgrim Fathers took refuge in Leiden before leaving for
the New World via Plymouth, England.
 &HT;    Given our brief two days there in March, my partner, Mac, and I
decided to limit our museumgoing to three or four institutions and
our historic sites to those we could see on a leisurely walk around
Leiden's compact city center. It proved to be a good plan, although
we had to make several adjustments when confronted with unexpected
closures and renovations.
 &HT;    Knowing that many of the museums are closed on Mondays, we
arrived on a Tuesday. It was a cold and gray morning on the cusp of
spring at the city's modern glass-and-steel train station.
 &HT;    Exiting through a sea of bicycles parked outside the station, we
walked 10 minutes to the Rapenburg, a handsome tree-lined canal
along which some of Leiden's most prosperous citizens built stately
homes in the 17th century, when the city was flush with money from
the production of woolen cloth.
 &HT;    We stopped briefly to leave our bags at the Hotel De Doelen, a
converted 1638 neoclassical mansion where we were spending the
night, and then continued to the university and its botanical
garden.
 &HT;    The origins of the university and of Leiden's eventual
prominence lie in a Spanish siege of the city in 1574 during the
Protestant Dutch revolt against the iron rule of Catholic Spain.
Thousands of its citizens died of starvation and disease during the
siege, and popular belief has it that the mayor, one Van der Werf,
convinced a ravenous mob not to surrender only by offering his own
body as food.
 &HT;    A nice story, but as noted with admirable candor in a booklet I
picked up at Leiden's tourist office, ``its accuracy is dubious,
since the annals show that Van der Werf had to be dissuaded from
opening the gates to the Spaniards on more than one occasion.''
 &HT;    The booklet also casts doubt on another popular belief, that the
university was a gift from William of Orange in appreciation for
Leiden's successful resistance. Instead, it appears, the Protestant
Low Countries simply needed their own university, and Leiden made
sense because it was freed early on from Spain.
 &HT;    The main ceremonial building of the university, the Academy
(Academiegebouw), occupies a former Dominican convent on the
Rapenburg. A dignified, two-story brick structure with a steep
slate roof and a domed bell tower, the Academy still resembles a
church, although it is now used for lectures and official
university functions.
 &HT;    Behind the Academy is the university's Hortus Botanicus, a
botanical garden originally laid out in 1590 as a place to grow and
study medicinal and poisonous plants. In the 16th century such
gardens were common at universities with medical schools, but the
first curator of Leiden's garden, the Flemish botanist Carolus
Clusius, eventually had the novel idea of creating a place where
all known plants would be collected and studied.
 &HT;    As a result, imports from the New World _ such as the tomato,
the potato, tobacco and corn _ were introduced into Northern Europe
through the Leiden garden. Clusius also introduced tulips to
Holland (they were originally from Turkey), first planting them in
the Hortus in 1594.
 &HT;    Over the centuries, Clusius' garden has grown into a large oasis
of old trees, flowers and thousands of plant species from around
the world, although on the day we visited the entrance was torn up
by the construction of a new winter garden (which opened in May),
and the garden still had its bare, winter look.
 &HT;    As we walked around, however, we did come across a few signs of
spring _ several beds of crocus, swelling nodes on an ancient
wisteria, and a scattering of solitary daffodils, whose yellow
blooms looked particularly vibrant under the steely sky.
 &HT;    A light drizzle eventually drove us into the garden's extensive
greenhouses, where we happily wandered through the heavy, warm air,
passing under towering tree ferns and stopping to examine a
carnivorous plant from Borneo or cerise-colored blooms sprouting
like miniature feather boas from the branches of a New Guinea
euphorbia.
 &HT;    Back outside, we retraced our steps along the Rapenburg to the
National Museum of Antiquities (Rijksmuseum van Oudheden). It's the
principal archaeological museum in the Netherlands, and we'd been
looking forward to seeing its outstanding collection of Egyptian
and Classical Greek and Roman artifacts.
 &HT;    Unfortunately, we found the museum in the midst of a major
renovation (scheduled to be completed next spring), and most of its
permanent collection was on loan or in storage. What we did see
whetted our appetites _ papyrus manuscripts, beautifully
proportioned Greek vases, translucent alabaster cups and solemn,
marble busts of eminent Romans.
 &HT;    We both enjoyed a small display devoted to the ancient Egyptian
love of beer, and also managed to peek into the museum's most
dramatic gallery (which was closed): a covered courtyard filled
with heroic-sized statuary and an entire temple of Isis rescued
from the rising waters behind the Aswan Dam.
 &HT;    We ate a light lunch at Camino Real, a cozy, two-level
restaurant that occupies a former stable just around the corner
from the Academy. Surrounded by an animated university crowd of
professorial types in worn tweed jackets and students in jeans and
T-shirts, we split a bowl of flavorful celery-onion soup and a
sandwich of cheese, smoked salmon, avocado and mixed greens on
Italian flatbread.
 &HT;    By the time we finished, the overcast sky had yielded to
brilliant blue with billowing white clouds, so we spent the rest of
the afternoon walking around Leiden's center, stopping frequently
to investigate a shop or a historic building, or to admire spring
blooms placed in the front window of a house. Here and there were
mural-sized poems painted on the sides of buildings.
 &HT;    At Pieterskerk, a large old church a block off the Rapenburg,
now used for concerts and other nonreligious functions, we saw a
memorial plaque dedicated to John Robinson, the Pilgrims' spiritual
leader.
 &HT;    The Pilgrims arrived in Leiden in 1609 and left for America in
1620, in part because they feared that cosmopolitan Leiden would
corrupt their morals. Robinson intended to join them later but
never made it, dying in Leiden in 1625.
 &HT;    We weren't able to see inside the church since it was closed,
but on a nearby pedestrian lane of pleasant shops and restaurants
(Pieterskerk-Choorsteeg) we did spot a plaque marking the site of
the Pilgrims' printing press.
 &HT;    Across from the church, at Kloksteeg 21, we sat for a while in
the quiet, grassy courtyard of the 1683 almshouse that replaced
Robinson's residence. During Leiden's golden era, well-to-do
individuals _ some getting on in years and worried about the
salvation of their souls _ built small houses where elderly poor
people could live for free.
 &HT;    The almshouses are known in Dutch as ``hofjes,'' or ``little
courtyards,'' because they were traditionally built around a common
court that had a single opening onto the street. While many of
Leiden's 35 existing hofjes are now private residences, some
courtyards are open to the public; the visitors center has a
brochure outlining a walking tour.
 &HT;    The next day we arrived at the National Museum of the History of
Science and Medicine, known as the Boerhaave Museum, just as it was
opening. It had not been high on our list of museums, but our
friend Oliver Moore, who had recently moved to the city, had
convinced us that it had more to offer than pickled brains and
scary old surgical implements. It is housed in a beautifully
renovated building where Herman Boerhaave (1668-1738), an innovator
in clinical medicine, founded one of the first teaching hospitals
in the world.
 &HT;    The collection is quirky _ ranging from exquisitely crafted
microscopes of polished brass to an amusing display of antique
apothecary shop signs from Amsterdam, each depicting a human head
with mouth agape.
 &HT;    I was particularly fascinated by a reconstruction of Leiden's
Theatrum Anatomicum, a steeply raked anatomical theater where
Boerhaave and others performed human dissections while skeletons
and other memento mori loomed overhead.
 &HT;    Later that day we toured a collection of old Dutch tile,
household furnishings and paintings at the Lakenhal Municipal
Museum (Stedelijk Museum De Lakenhal), which occupies the city's
1640 cloth hall. In the galleries we saw one of Rembrandt's
earliest dated paintings, ``An Unidentified Historical Subject,'' a
fussy mythological scene from 1625 that is far more detailed and
far less striking than his mature works.
 &HT;    Although Rembrandt first studied painting in Leiden, he became
famous only after settling in Amsterdam in 1631. His boyhood home
no longer exists, but other sites connected with his youth in
Leiden _ such as the street (Weddesteeg) where he grew up and the
Latin School on Lokhorststraat where he studied _ still survive.
 &HT;    Toward the end of the day, while on our way to the train
station, we stopped at the restored 18th-century windmill that now
houses the Valk Municipal Windmill Museum (Stedelijk Molenmuseum De
Valk). The Valk is one of about 950 windmills left in the
Netherlands, down from 10,000 about 100 years ago.
 &HT;    Oliver's wife, Ts'ai Ch'in, had encouraged us to visit the Valk,
and once inside I could see why. After a brief look at the
informative historical displays, we clambered up ladder-like steps,
passed the massive grinding wheels and stepped onto the outside
platform, where the mill's huge sails swooped precariously close to
our heads.
 &HT;    Although we had a train to catch, we lingered a few minutes,
enjoying a bird's-eye view of Leiden and the bracing feel of North
Sea wind on our faces.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By E. CLINTON HOTALING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    This has been the Whitney century at Saratoga Springs.
 &HT;    In 1900, William C. Whitney, who made millions in New York City
street railways, took over Saratoga Race Course, expanded it and
reinvigorated the whole town. Soon his cronies, notably Reggie
Vanderbilt and John Bet-a-Million Gates, were dropping hundreds of
thousands of dollars at Richard A. Canfield's casino, and Victor
Herbert and John Philip Sousa were playing the Springs.
 &HT;    In 2000, Whitney's Victorian grandstand is still the town's
symbol, and the racing season is by far the best in the country.
The high-rollers' ghosts pad about the Casino museum. The New York
City Ballet, the Philadelphia Orchestra and Britney Spears, among
others, play the Performing Arts Center. And most amazing, although
she has lowered her public profile a bit, a Whitney towers over the
resort.
 &HT;    Marylou Whitney's wealth has been a royal force in preserving
Saratoga, and when she arrives for the Whitney Gala on Friday at
the Casino in Congress Park, it will launch the season in earnest.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    A who's who of thoroughbreds and jockeys stars at Saratoga Race
Course, America's oldest major sports venue. The 36-day program was
scheduled to open on Wednesday and runs through Labor Day. After
attracting 900,000-plus fans last season, a record, the New York
Racing Association has poured more millions into this year's
purses, bringing them to $8.7 million, another record.
 &HT;    The $1 million Travers Stakes on Aug. 26 is the highlight of the
season. The $750,000 Whitney Handicap will be run next Sunday and
the $750,000 Alabama Stakes on Aug. 19.
 &HT;    The original track, now in a stable area across Union Avenue,
dates from 1847 and today's main course from 1864. The races start
at 1 p.m. every day except Tuesday, when the track is closed, and
Aug. 26, when the first post time is 12:30 p.m. General admission,
$2; $4 for the clubhouse (no short-shorts, cut-offs, tank tops).
 &HT;    Breakfast at the track from 7 to 9:30 a.m. allows you to see
workouts, the barn area, a paddock show and a starting-gate
demonstration. No reservations are required (first come first
served), though the lines are often long on nice days. Information:
(518) 584-6200.
 &HT;    The resort's other great show is at the Saratoga Performing Arts
Center on Route 50 just outside town. It seats 5,000 in the
amphitheater, with room for 20,000 more on the lawn. Among the
stars: ``Lord of the Dance'' (Aug. 13), Counting Crows and Live
with Galactic (Aug. 14), Pearl Jam (Aug. 27), the Dave Matthews
Band (Aug. 29) and Britney Spears (Aug. 30). Ticket prices for
special events range from $8 on the lawn for the Boys Choir of
Harlem to $48 for the best seats in the amphitheater for Counting
Crows and Live with Galactic. For information, call (518) 587-3330.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    In the spectacular new wing of the National Museum of Racing and
Hall of Fame, at 191 Union Ave. (www.racingmuseum.org), you can see
saddles used by Julie Krone and Bill Shoemaker, the Triple Crown
trophies won by Whirlaway, the gold-plated diamond-encrusted whip
presented to the jockey Jerry Bailey for Cigar's victory in the
Dubai World Cup in 1996, and the whip Ron Turcotte did not have to
use as Secretariat passed the eighth pole on the way to his
unforgettable 1973 Belmont Stakes triumph (the pole itself is on
the front lawn). It's all in the new Hall of Fame Heroes room, part
of an $8 million renovation.
 &HT;    The exhibits are by turns memory-jogging (the silks Steve
Cauthen wore in navigating Affirmed to his narrow triumphs over
Alydar), delightful (the mail sent to Kelso) and really odd (a
photograph of a crowd staring at Man o' War's corpse). The museum
is open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily through the racing season, then 10
a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Saturday and noon to 4:30 p.m.
Sunday. Admission is $7; (518) 584-0400.
 &HT;    Visitors can design their own sightseeing strolls past
Saratoga's lovely old homes (for a guide, you can stop by the Urban
Heritage Area visitor center across from Congress Park on Broadway
or the Chamber of Commerce booth in front of the park). One of the
most eye-opening would take in Greek revival homes from the 1820's
onward. Walk from Broadway up Division Street for three blocks to
find five examples: Nos. 1, 3 and 4 Franklin Square and Nos. 59 and
63 Franklin Street.
 &HT;    Another walk would introduce you to Congress Park and its
circa-1900 Florentine marble Tritons in a pool. Vandalized last
year, they are now repaired and furiously blowing water at each
other again.
 &HT;    Or you can drive past the racecourse on Union Avenue and through
the entrance to the wooded Yaddo artists retreat, now celebrating
its centennial, and walk through classical Italian rose and
Anglo-American rock gardens, graced with pools and century-old
statuary. Guided garden tours at 11 a.m. Tuesdays (until Labor
Day), Saturdays and Sundays are $2; (518) 584-0746.
 &HT;    Early birds can catch one of Saratoga's loveliest sights, the
thoroughbreds working out in the morning mist (from 5:30 to 10:30)
at the Oklahoma training track. The public is not allowed through
the gate but you can still get a nice view through the fence along
East Avenue, between Fifth and Union avenues. (The National Museum
of Racing offers tours that take groups inside the gate during
training; $10, which includes museum admission.)
 &HT;    The Adelphi Hotel, 365 Broadway, is a downtown landmark, its
luscious antique lobby a good place to stop for a drink. Cross the
street for a view of the hotel's glorious raised piazza, with
pierced spandrel openings, thin three-story columns, high Victorian
windows, and Renaissance and Italianate motifs. It's from 1877,
when they got the most out of a stoop.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Hotel reservations can be hard to come by through Labor Day,
especially on weekends.
 &HT;    Now into its first full racing season, the 112-room Hilton
Garden Inn, 125 South Broadway, (518) 587-1500, fax (518) 587-7800,
has an indoor pool, exercise room and business center. The price is
middle range, considering that this town's rates assume everybody
has hit an exacta. Rooms are spacious and loaded with amenities,
including high-speed Internet access, microwave, hair dryer,
refrigerator and a safe big enough for a laptop; from $189 through
Labor Day, then $99 to $179.
 &HT;    At the 42-room Downtowner Motel, (888) 480-6160, fax (518)
584-2907, under new management, I was happy to step around four
cast members of ``Grease,'' starring at the Performing Arts Center
but just then doing situps on the floor around the indoor pool.
Rooms have been nicely redone, are cheerful and very up to date;
from $137 through Labor Day, then $75. It's smack in the middle of
everything at 413 Broadway.
 &HT;    Budget: At the southern end of Broadway, but within a healthy
walk of downtown, is the 18-room St. Charles Motel, 188 Broadway,
(518) 584-2050, fax (518) 584-6216, with cozy rooms starting at
$125 through Labor Day, then $55.
 &HT;    The Locust Grove Motel is actually in a locust grove about three
and a half miles south of town, at 2838 Route 9, Malta; (888)
256-2878, fax (518) 580-1817. It has two 16-unit buildings and two
cabin units. Rooms have kitchenettes, at $99 through Labor Day,
then $50.
 &HT;    Luxury: In its second season, the Saratoga Arms, 495-497
Broadway, (518) 584-1775, fax (518) 581-4064, is a magnificently
restored Second Empire brick hotel dating from 1870, the year Henry
James visited Saratoga. He would have loved this 16-room hotel
rescued from demolition by Kathleen and Noel Smith. Rooms have
antique furnishings and high ceilings; several have fireplaces and
clawfoot tubs; all have voice mail, data ports, cable TV and CD
players; a full Irish breakfast is served. Rooms from $275 through
Labor Day, then from $150.
 &HT;    The 168-room Holiday Inn, at 232 Broadway, (518) 584-4550, fax
(518) 584-4417, is the perfect starting gate for walks into
Congress Park or past the period homes on and off Circular Street.
It has a full-scale restaurant and bar and a heated outdoor pool.
Many of the newly appointed rooms have views of the park or town.
Room prices range from $219 through Labor Day, then $150.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Chez Sophie Bistro, 2853 Route 9, Malta, (518) 583-3538, is like
a trip to France, serving memorable fare that belies its setting: a
converted diner in Malta, three and a half miles south of town. It
is run by Sophie Parker, the French-born chef, and her husband,
Joseph, a sculptor, assisted by their son, Paul. A recent meal
included chanterelles in a reduction of chicken stock and sherry; a
salad of baby field greens and organic lettuces, and swordfish
pan-sauteed with a sherry wine vinegar vinaigrette, sweet red
peppers and shallots. The cheese plate included St. Agur, Reblochon
and crottin de Chavignol. Dinner for two with a modest bottle of
wine: $110 to $120.
 &HT;    The hottest place in town is Chianti, 208 South Broadway, (518)
580-0025, with an open kitchen and glowing burnt-sienna decor.
Owned by the irrepressible David Zecchini, from Rome, and his wife,
Maria, it features the bold tastes of their 31-year-old chef,
Fabrizio Bazzani, from Verona. Popular specialties: an appetizer of
carpaccio in truffle oil with a Gorgonzola sauce, porcini risotto
and a white chocolate gelato requiring a week of penance. Dinner
for two with wine: $100.
 &HT;    Out Union Avenue, just before you hit Saratoga Lake, is the
comfortable Longfellows Inn and Restaurant, 500 Union Ave., (518)
587-0108, created from two dairy barns. High on many diners' lists:
the bourbon-glazed salmon and pan-seared tournedos. Dinner for two
with wine comes to about $100.
 &HT;    Joseph DeVivo, talented scion of a well-known Saratoga family,
is the maestro of Maestro's, 371 Broadway, (518) 580-0312, where
you dine to the accompaniment of recorded jazz and blues in the
heart of town. Specialties include osso bucco, crab cakes and
freshly made pastas. Dinner and wine for two: $70.
 &HT;    With its Southern fried chicken, such Louisiana specialties as
Creole jambalaya, and red snapper Provencal, Hattie's, 45 Phila
St., (518) 584-4790, is the real deal for bargain hunters. At this
convivial down-home restaurant, two can dine with a bottle of wine
for $50; there is also a late menu, with many items under $7, from
10:30 p.m. to 12:30 a.m.
 &HT;    At Ashleigh's, 506 Broadway, (518) 580-0329, you can get a fine
breakfast, such as a sausage-potato-cheese omelet, for under $7. Or
a lunch of grilled chicken with bacon, cheese and barbecue sauce on
a roll, under $7. Or, starting this season, a steak, seafood or
pasta dinner for two with wine for less than $40. It's a pleasant,
airy spot, and this being Saratoga, it's in a corner of a
magnificent Romanesque revival building.

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY MARIALISA CALTA  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Every year, as my husband and I pack the car for our August
vacation, we look around at the impossibly green, impossibly
beautiful Vermont landscape and ask each other if we are crazy.
 &HT;    Why would anyone leave Vermont in the summer, when there are so
many swimming holes to splash in, so many country fairs to visit,
so many trails to hike?
 &HT;    Why would anyone leave during the time of year when our
down-country friends would trade in their theater tickets to stay
even in the sagging old farmhouse we live in, and a chance to watch
the sun set over the mountains and hear the crickets at night?
 &HT;    One of my closest friends comes to Vermont from the Upper West
Side of Manhattan each summer with her husband and two children,
renting a house not far from ours. She delights in going fishing
and canoeing, taking walks and shopping at the local farmers'
market. She and her family love Vermont, and every year Dirk and I
have the opportunity to see our home state anew through their eyes.
 &HT;    I realize once again how lucky we are to live within walking
distance of a pond that features both good swimming and excellent
boating, and a general store where the owners not only know our
names but also extend credit.
 &HT;    In summer, the night sky offers northern lights and shooting
stars, swooping bats and symphony-quality thunderstorms. There are
farms to visit and potters' studios and small gallery shows by
wonderful artists. There are mountains to climb and, in nearly
every village, a Vermont institution: the ``creemee'' stand,
offering soft-serve ice cream in vanilla, chocolate and maple.
 &HT;    So why, come August, do we pack our two children and our dog and
way, way too much stuff into our Subaru wagon and take a grueling,
16-hour drive north? Prince Edward Island, our destination, is,
after all, not that much different from Vermont. Cows graze in
pastures that slope to the water's edge. Towns are small and
manageable, and people are reserved but friendly. ``Vermont with
ocean'' is how we describe Prince Edward to our stay-home friends.
 &HT;    While others may seek cultural stimulation on their vacations,
my husband and I see our few weeks off as an opportunity to get
some much-needed exercise and simplify our lives. We live in a
place that offers plenty of opportunity for both.
 &HT;    But whether or not we've brought it on ourselves, we have
certainly managed to complicate our lives. We spend many more hours
driving our kids to sports and school events than contemplating
nature, and much more time absorbed in our work than working out on
country roads.
 &HT;    Our lives are cluttered with the trappings of contemporary
America _ computers and portable phones, TV and videos, stores
offering way too much stuff and credit cards offering way too much
money to buy it with.
 &HT;    The main reason anyone who lives in a vacation destination
leaves it for another is simple: we live here. We're not on
vacation.
 &HT;    While my New York friends Pam and Carl may spend their Vermont
days splashing with their kids, I spend mine e-mailing, faxing and
phoning _ not to mention laundering, shopping, cooking and
cleaning.
 &HT;    I can't remember the last time I went fishing with my daughters
(who, at 15 and 12, would now regard me as demented if I were to
suggest it), or did much of anything else with them except drop
them at the pond or _ more to their liking _ at the nearest mall.
 &HT;    I know people who take ``at home'' vacations, visiting all the
attractions they never get a chance to see, but I don't think I
could manage it. My home is my workplace, and it's hard to get out
the door to go recreate while the phones are ringing.
 &HT;    So each summer we drive north to impose our fantasies of a
slower paced life on the Prince Edward Islanders. We do almost
nothing for days on end and marvel at how laid-back the islanders
are.
 &HT;    The friends we have made there do seem to have more time for
music and visiting, but that's probably because we are the ones who
are dropping by, urging them to pick up their fiddles.
 &HT;    Surely they have just as much laundry to do, and I often hear
their children clamoring to go to ``town'' (as the capital city,
Charlottetown, is called) and shop the malls. I've noticed a
proliferation of cell phones since we first started going there
about 10 summers ago.
 &HT;    Last August the carpenter who built the cabin we own gave us his
pager number. The rest of the year we communicate with him by fax
and e-mail.
 &HT;    For two or three weeks, we fancy ourselves part of something a
little purer, somewhat less materialistic and more genteel than
what we experience at home _ just as, I think, Pam feels when she
leaves the hubbub of her neighborhood.
 &HT;    And it works. Our life on vacation is less crazy and
materialistic, and more genteel. I go biking and berry-picking with
my daughters, and the four of us sleep outside some nights and
watch northern lights and meteor showers even more spectacular than
we see at home in darkness that, since we are miles from an
electric light, seems more absolute than in Vermont.
 &HT;    The weekly trip to the Laundromat seems like a pleasant outing
compared with the daily load or two I do routinely at home. Even a
trip to the carwash is a maritime adventure: The one in Souris _
the town closest to our cabin _ offers a ridiculously spectacular
ocean view. I can count fishing boats and sea gulls while vacuuming
the red island clay from the floor mats.
 &HT;    Food shopping is a treat: we delight in seeking out fishermen
and local gardeners to sell us some of what we will eat each
evening. And cooking on the tiny propane stove or over a campfire
at our cabin is much more fun than it is at home, where the
microwave and the food processor make the chore more mechanical. We
play hearts by candlelight and read big fat books that we have no
time for back in Vermont.
 &HT;    Most important for me is the fact that I get to spend several
weeks without hearing a phone ring or a fax beep, or checking any
sort of mail whatsoever.
 &HT;    We leave our home, in fact, for the same reason people in New
York or Paris or any other world-class vacation destination leave
theirs: for a change of scenery and a change of pace.
 &HT;    Travelers often indulge in the fantasy that the people in the
places they visit lead lives that are more civilized, or more down
to earth, or more ``spiritual'' than their own workaday existences.
In truth it is the travelers themselves _ separated from familiar
rooms and belongings _ who are forced to focus more on who they are
and what is important to them.
 &HT;    We return, of course, to stacks of mail and desks full of the
work that piled up while we were away. But if time and distance
have worked their magic, we return also with a renewed appreciation
for where we live, and a sense of pride that people ``from away''
will travel long distances to gaze at the views we take for
granted.
 &HT;    Recently, some of our friends from Prince Edward Island, who
usually stick very close to home, sent us an e-mail message that
said they were contemplating a vacation this year. They are
thinking of coming to Vermont. We can't wait to show them how
laid-back we are.

 By WILLIAM T. TOMICKI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;     Q:  My wife and I are headed to London. We want to be treated
like royalty, but we don't have a king's ransom to spend. Are we
dreaming or does a hotel exist that can wow us?
 &HT;     Q:  The Rubens at The Palace will treat you and your wife like
a king and queen without breaking your wallet. This hotel is
perfectly located opposite Buckingham Palace in the heart of London
and is within easy reach of St. James' Park, historic sites, the
financial district and West End theaters
 &HT;    The Rubens provides guests with outstanding personal service,
thanks to the congenial general manager, Jonathan Raggett. Every
modern business and leisure convenience has been provided here, yet
the owner, the innovative Bea Tollman, has furnished The Rubens in
a luxurious residential fashion with rich fabrics and antiques. I
know of no other hotel that so thoughtfully fills their room desks
with essential office supplies.
 &HT;    The Rubens' assets include the popular Cavalry Bar done in a
classic British military theme; The Palace Lounge for tea and a
quiet read overlooking the historic Royal Mews; The Library
Restaurant for the finest British and international cuisine; and
The Carvery for traditional roasts and more.
 &HT;    Be it a business or vacation stay, The Rubens, a member of the
Red Carnation Hotel Collection, is truly a memorable experience run
by snappy, kind people who pride themselves on the fact that no
detail is overlooked and no request is too large. Rates start at
$250 a night, double occupancy. For more information, call (800)
858-8471, or visit www.redcarnationhotels.com on the Web.
 &HT;     Q: . My girlfriend and I are planning a vacation to Mexico and
are searching for several intimate, high-quality hotels. We want to
stay away from chain hotels. Any suggestions?
 &HT;     A:  Mexico Boutique Hotels is a collection of member properties
that are characterized by uniqueness and their high level of
service.
 &HT;    The hotels in the Mexico Boutique Hotel group have less than 50
rooms. Style of accommodation varies and often includes villas,
casitas and bungalows. Some play on a sense of grandeur, while
others return to the basics of palm-thatched cottages.
 &HT;    To see the complete selection of Mexico Boutiques Hotels, visit
www.mexicoboutiquehotels.com on the Web.
 &HT;     Q:  My fiancee and I really enjoy being in the great outdoors,
and for his birthday I would love to give him something we could
both use when we go hiking or biking.
 &HT;     A:  For the latest outdoor gadgets and toys, turn to Motorola.
They have just released their latest line of two-way radios, the
Talkabout T6300 series.
 &HT;    These new two-way radios feature just about everything an
adventure enthusiast could want _ current weather reports; audible
storm-warning alerts; a built-in clock, alarm and stopwatch; a
noise filter to protect against unwanted noise in the surrounding
environment; and the radios are dust and shock resistant. They
provide 532 signals so you can be sure to find an unused channel.
 &HT;    With a range of up to two miles (depending upon terrain), these
gadgets are great for rural and urban settings alike. For the
city-dweller, these gadgets are useful at concerts and the mall and
are an excellent way for parents to stay in contact with their
families. With a retail price between $129 to $179 per radio, the
T6300 series is quite affordable.
 &HT;    Motorola also offers a wide range of extras such as
voice-activated headsets and a wall-mountable battery-charging
station, which allows the radios to be used as an intercom system.
 &HT;    Overall, the Motorola Talkabouts are at the top of today's
market in terms of quality, versatility and functionality. The
T6300 series will become available nationwide in September.
 &HT;     Q:  My family has strong Italian roots, but I've never
experienced any of the legendary neighborhoods in American cities
that I've often heard about. Trips to New York and San Francisco
felt too touristy. Are there any legitimate Italian neighborhoods
left to explore?
 &HT;     A:  A lively one can be found in Boston's North End. Visit on a
late Saturday afternoon in summer, when the air is warm and
fragrant with the lingering aromas of lunch, and the whole
neighborhood seems to pause before the rigors of the evening meal.
 &HT;    Wander around and explore the side streets. You might find a
sweet old lady with a lemonade stand, or a strolling parish priest
saying buona sera to the locals.
 &HT;    To purchase olive oils and foodstuffs, visit Salumeria Italiano
at 151 Richmond St., a few blocks from the Old North Church and
Paul Revere's home.
 &HT;    For a truly authentic touch, head to Salem Street and Polcari's
Coffee, a spice store that's really a catch-all grocery for the
locals. Engineers who miss their old neighborhood work weekends as
clerks. Enjoy the banter as folks drop in to buy chestnut flour or
flavorings for homemade liqueurs. Tape a dollar to the collection
poster for the saint whose festival is coming up. If you're lucky,
there will be a miniparade to collect all the offerings.
 &HT;    With its narrow streets, the North End is best reached by cab or
subway _ anything to avoid parking and the epic nuisance of the Big
Dig, Boston's traffic nightmare. Visitor information is available
at www.northendboston.com.
 &HT;     Q:  I will be traveling to Southern France and would like to
see some ancient sites. Do you have any suggestions that will put
me in the heart of ancient France?
 &HT;     A:  The recently renovated Hotel de la Cite near Carcassonne is
now giving historical, cultural and lifestyle tours of their area
in the legendary Southwest region of Languedoc-Roussillon.
 &HT;    Carcassonne is Europe's largest and most perfectly preserved
medieval city. Among the highlights of the escorted tours are Roman
ruins, a 13th-century dungeon, a 14th-century palace, an
11th-century abbey and famous castles. Cities visited include
Arques, Castelnou, Limoux, Narbonnes and Toulouse.
 &HT;    The fully escorted half-day tours range in price from $14 to $70
per person, and full-day tours are approximately $88 to $103 per
person, including all transportation and entrance fees.
 &HT;    Renovated in 1999, the Hotel de la Cite was formerly an
Episcopal palace and today is a member of Orient-Express hotels. It
combines magnificent neo-gothic stained-glass windows and mosaic
floors with five-star amenities.
 &HT;    The hotel features fine gourmet cuisine plus less-formal dining
options to accommodate a wide variety of tastes. For more
information or reservations, call (800) 223-6800, or visit
www.hoteldelacite.com on the Web.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Readers are invited to submit questions to William Tomicki, P.O.
Box 5148, Santa Barbara, Calif. 93150. Although he cannot answer
each query individually, selected questions will be included in his
column. Mr. Tomicki, who logs over 150,000 miles each year, is the
publisher of ENTREE, a travel newsletter.

SHOPPING AROUND: TOP TRAVEL TOMES FOR FALL

 (Color slide included.) 
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Planning a road trip this fall? Here are some newly published
travel guides that can help with the journey.
 &HT;    ``Literary Trips: Following in the Footsteps of Fame,'' edited
by Victoria Brooks (GreatestEscapes.com Publishing, 2000; $19.95),
is a personal and occasionally quirky look at the places that
literary greats such as Bruce Chatwin, Agatha Christie and Ernest
Hemingway made famous.
 &HT;    Divided into geographic areas, the home turf of each literary
figure is nicely evoked by a guest writer. For example, Richard
Taylor writes an homage to Bruce Chatwin, Yvonne Geoffrey Hope
muses about the England of A.A. Milne and Elaine Glusac waxes
poetic about Garrison Keilor's Minnesota.
 &HT;    There's also practical information that true devotees can
devour. For example, it's possible to sleep where Bruce Chatwin did
at the Melanka Lodge in Alice Springs, Australia. Or drink in El
Floridita, Ernest Hemingway's favorite Havana bar. It's a fun read
for the literary-minded.
 &HT;    For some visitors to New York, architecture is the single best
reason to come to the Big Apple. So they'll applaud the fourth
edition of ``The AIA Guide to New York City,'' by Norval White and
Elliott Willensky (Three Rivers Press, 2000; $35).
 &HT;    At more than 1,000 pages, this brick-shaped book is filled with
prose that is sharp and opinionated, as the writers point out the
best, the worst and the strangest structures on the sidewalks of
New York.
 &HT;    The Chrysler Building may be one of he most famous in New York,
but the authors say ``don't miss the lobby, an Art Deco confection
of African marble and chrome steel.'' Rockefeller Center merits
being called ``an island of architectural excellence.''
 &HT;    As for Trump Tower, developer Donald Trump's ``fantasyland for
the affluent shopper,'' the authors write that Trump's aesthetics
``are still more akin to malt liquor than to Veuve Cliquot.''
 &HT;    ``Kids' New York,'' by Christopher Maynard (Dorling Kindersley
Travel Guides, 2000; $7.95) is for younger visitors to the big
city. In a book with as many color photographs as descriptive
passages, Maynard makes dozens of good suggestions for what to do
with the kids in New York City. They range from Saturday-morning
storytelling sessions at the bronze statue of Hans Christian
Andersen in Central Park to the American Museum of the Moving Image
and the baseball batting cages at Chelsea Piers.
 &HT;    This should keep kids and parents busy for at least a week, as
should a sister guide, ``Kids London,'' by Simon Adams (Dorling
Kindersley Travel Guides, 2000; $7.95), when they go to Britain.
 &HT;    Lonely Planet is always on the cutting edge of guidebooks, and
this season they have two new series of note. The ``Read This
First'' series is aimed at first-time travelers, but even veteran
road warriors could benefit from its advice.
 &HT;    ``Read This First: Europe,'' by Paul Harding (Lonely Planet,
2000; $14.99) is filled with loads of practical information,
examples and profiles of every European country. That's a lot to
jam into a 400-plus-page book, but Harding does an admirable job.
 &HT;    There's information on passports, health and packing, culled
from years of Lonely Planet tips. And the country profiles, while
brief, are not only informative but provide itineraries for
travelers who might have three days, a week, even a month or two.
That's especially useful for first-time travelers, who are famous
for trying to see too much in too little time.
 &HT;    Another guide in the new series, ``Read This First: Central &AMP;
South America,'' by Conner Gorry (Lonely Planet, 2000; $14.99),
does the same for Latin America.
 &HT;    Lonely Planet's ``World Food: Turkey,'' by Dana Valent and Jim
and Perihan Masters (Lonely Planet, 2000; $11.99) is smartly
written and wonderfully illustrated with color photographs.
 &HT;    As more American travelers focus on the delights of eating
native cuisine, a guide like this is indispensable. That's
especially true in Turkey, a country with fantastic food that,
unfortunately, is not well-known here.
 &HT;    A glossary and dictionary helps matters considerably, but the
guide goes way beyond food descriptions. There are useful entries
on the types of eateries one encounters, from ``lokanta,'' a basic
place, to a fancier ``restoran'' to ``pideci,'' a Turkish version
of a pizza parlor. There's a look at regional specialties, markets
and the history of the cuisine as well. Look for forthcoming Lonely
Planet World Food guides to such countries as Mexico, Morocco and
Vietnam.
 &HT;    The most unusual travel guides of the year have to be ``Fodors'
to Go.'' They're the size of perhaps four credit cards stacked
together and come with magnetic covers. They unfold,
accordion-style, and easily fit into a shirt pocket.
 &HT;    The brief text and photographic illustrations are perfect for
the traveling businessperson with little time and even less space
for luggage. A guide like ``48 Hours in London'' (Fodor's, 2000;
$4.95) has a step-by-step two-day itinerary for exploring the city.
It comes complete with maps, lunch and dinner suggestions,
flea-market and afternoon-tea recommendations and even a few
write-ups on shops and museums. It's a marvel of miniaturization,
as is ``Italian for Travelers'' (Fodor's, 2000; $4.95), another in
the series that promises to help readers ``speak Italian right
away.'' It certainly beats carrying a dog-eared phrase book.

 PLEASE NOTE: Optional-trim indicators are included in this

 &HT;    
 (Color slide included.) 
 By ADELE MALOTT 
 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Repositioning cruises offer some of the best values in the
travel business. And the fall cruise season _ a time when cruise
lines begin moving their ships to new locations _ is a good
opportunity to try one.
 &HT;    The Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) cites these
advantages for repositioning cruises:
 &HT;     _ ONE-OF-A-KIND ITINERARIES.  Because ships are moving from one
part of the world to another, the combination of ports visited is
unique. Often these itineraries include ocean or Panama Canal
crossings as well as ports not usually visited on other sailings.
 &HT;     _ VALUE.  Two-for-one fares, air-inclusive offers and a variety
of off-season promotional rates make cruise prices very attractive.
 &HT;     _ SPECIAL ENTERTAINMENT.  Cruise lines may enhance their
repositioning cruises with entertainment that isn't always offered
on other cruises.
 &HT;     _ EXTRA DAYS.  Longer itineraries allow more time at sea.
 &HT;    However, you should be aware that cruise lines may use
repositioning voyages to train new staff or to try new shore trips,
giving an experimental flavor to the cruise.
 &HT;    Contact your travel agent about these repositioning cruises or
others that will be offered this fall:
 &HT;    _ America Cruise Lines, which sails the waterways of the U.S.
East Coast year-round, will be in Baltimore on Nov. 4 before
heading to Jacksonville, Fla., for the winter months.
 &HT;    _ Costa Cruises Lines leaves Europe from Genoa to head for the
Caribbean Nov. 3 and 17. Ports of call: the Bahamas, British Virgin
Islands, Canary Islands, Guadeloupe, Leeward Island, Madeira,
Morocco and Spain.
 &HT;    _ Holland America Line moves five vessels from Alaska to the
Caribbean on trips ranging from 17 to 22 days. Departures are in
September and October with 17- or 22-day cruises that pass through
the Panama Canal.
 &HT;    _ Norwegian Cruise Line's Norwegian Wind leaves Vancouver Sept.
18 to sail a special 11-day Hawaiian Island itinerary before moving
on to the Caribbean.
 &HT;    _ After its inaugural season in Bermuda, the Pacific Princess
leaves New York on Oct. 29 to move to the Holy Land. There will be
16 days at sea with port calls in Ponta Delgada and Lisbon,
Portugal; Gibraltar; Barcelona; Cannes; Laverno; and Rome.
 &HT;    _ Royal Olympic moves its Stella Solaris from the Mediterranean
to the Caribbean with a Dec. 1 sailing from Piraeus, Greece. Ports
include Naples, Capri and Civitavecchia in Italy; Nice, France;
Cartagena, Spain; Tangier, Morocco; Lisbon and Madeira, Portugal;
San Juan; and Fort Lauderdale.
 &HT;    _ Seabourn Cruise Line has a Three Continent Discovery on its
Legend beginning Oct. 20 in Lisbon. Available in segments of six,
13 or 19 days, the itinerary has stops in Funchal, Madeira; Dakar,
Senegal; Bridgetown, Barbados; Virgin Gorda, BVI; San Juan; and
Fort Lauderdale.
 &HT;    
 BETTER BREATHING CARIBBEAN CRUISE  
 &HT;    The Better Breathing Club of Norwalk Hospital, in Norwalk,
Conn., is offering a cruise through the Eastern Caribbean for
travelers with chronic pulmonary diseases. Arrangements will be
made for those needing supplemental oxygen in flight and during the
cruise.
 &HT;    The cruise is aboard Celebrity's The Century, which leaves from
Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Nov. 4 for a week's cruise with stops in San
Juan, St. Maarten, St. Thomas and Nassau.
 &HT;    Traveling with the group will be a pulmonary physician, nurses
and respiratory therapists. Prices start at $1,018, including port
charges. Air, insurance, oxygen and special equipment is extra. For
more information, call (800) 536-9383.
 &HT;    
 $1,000 SAVINGS  
 &HT;    First European Cruises is offering a $1,000 savings per person
on September and October sailings aboard the Mistral in the Eastern
Mediterranean. It sails round trip from Venice on seven-day cruises
to Dubrovnik, Katakolon, Santorini, Mykonos, Rhodes and Piraeus
(Athens). Discounted departure dates are Sept. 2, 9, 16, 23 and
Oct. 7, 14, 21 and 28.
 &HT;    The cruise-only promotional rates start at $1,250/double for an
outside cabin. Round-trip airfare add-ons from Venice are available
from 50 gateways and for $950 from the East Coast, $1,200 West
Coast. For more information, call (888) 983-8767, or visit

ARMSTRONG TACKLES HIS OWN CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ Training camp ended Wednesday, but Bruce
Armstrong is just getting started.
</P>
<P>
   Taking it slow following surgery to repair his anterior cruciate
ligament in his left knee, Armstrong is building to the point where
he can play in next Sunday's exhibition game against Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who will turn 35 Sept. 7, still believes there's
something left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt,'' said Armstrong, dressed in his usual black.
``With the pads on and to get back out there and go through the
drills and to see yourself be able to get off the ball . . . it's
the same things I've been doing for decades. I don't feel like
there's that much difference.''
</P>
<P>
   He's been working on the same practice field, but on his own. He
was running and getting himself in shape to pass Bill Belichick's
grueling running test. He also passed his physical Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the pads on against live competition, you have to get
over the fear that something could go wrong with an injury. I've
been hurt before and I play with confidence that nothing will go
wrong with that repair,'' Armstrong said. ``That's not to say that
nothing will go wrong. Football is a violent game. I'm comfortable
enough physically where I feel like nothing's going to stop me from
doing the job.''
</P>
<P>
   He has returned to the Patriots for the 14th year under
different circumstances. No matter how you translate it, he was cut
by the team in February and he wasn't asked to return until the
week before training camp's July 17 start. He took a significant
paycut, from $3.5 million to $440,000, but he has a chance to earn
a little more than $2 million in incentives if a lot of things fall
right.
</P>
<P>
   The former Pro Bowl tackle says that doesn't matter to him
anymore. Whether he feels bitterness over what happened he hides it
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I dwelled on that I wouldn't be able to accomplish what I
want to accomplish,'' he said. ``So I don't dwell on it.''
</P>
<P>
   After going through more rigorous training, he doesn't regret
making a comeback. ``The rehab is hard and it's painful,'' said
Armstrong. ``If you're rehabbing to get on with the rest of your
life, it's not as hard as rehabbing to get back on the football
field four or five months later. If I had those kind of doubts, I
wouldn't have been as goal-oriented. My goal was to get back on the
football field.''
</P>
<P>
   He said if he didn't love football, he wouldn't have come back.
After all, why would he have bothered? He's made enough money to
last a lifetime. Why would he return for a minimum salary?
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing in all of this is that sometimes you lose sight
of all the things that you love and would miss about the game,'' he
said. ``I went through that. I went through it every day I was out,
and I came to the conclusion I had to play again because in my mind
it wasn't over and if I could get through the physical stuff then
I'd be all right. I've gotten past the toughest part of the
physical part _ the rehab. Now, it's getting into football shape.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he looked at his career and his life in the offseason,
and he didn't want to be an athlete hanging on. He wanted to be an
athlete contributing to a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to be in a situation where you're like Willie
Mays and you're out there on the field and most of the diehard fans
are watching you play at a level you can't play at anymore. That's
the stage I don't want to get to,'' Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite watching most of camp from the sideline, he seems to be
in step with the new offense, which is really the old offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a hybrid of the one we had here three years ago,''
said Armstrong. ``Some of the terminology is different. A lot of
play-action and a lot of the runs are exciting and it looks good.
You know what we are capable of three years ago and you hope to get
back to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong has not, like many of his teammates, come out with
giddy statements about the new coaching staff. Part of it is
because he doesn't want to knock the old one. Part of it is he's
learned, through maturity, not to be premature in celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty much in a situation where I'm in a watch mode, just
getting back on the field and all. You really have to be careful
with statements you make,'' he said. ``My whole thing is results
and I think that's how everybody should be judged. I think at the
end of this thing, no matter how great the attention to detail was,
if we end up 6-10 or 4-12 then all of a sudden it wasn't a good
idea and this regime was no better than any other. If you end up
10-6 or 12-4 then I think that's the more appropriate time to be
talking about how one situation was better than the other.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Armstrong has been all about, a survivor of the
great losing and appreciative of the rare winning moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '94, when we won seven games in a row and we made the
playoffs for the first time, we had never experienced that,'' said
Armstrong. ``Then in 1990 (a 1-15 season), we actually had the
Dolphins beat the first game and then the fullback sneaks out of
the backfield, catches a pass and we lose by 1 point. Then we go to
Indy, we win and we're 1-1, you're feeling good and you lose 14 in
a row. That year I made the Pro Bowl and the AFC won. I remember
Art Shell coming up to me and telling me, `I feel glad for you.' It
makes you think about how hard it is when you don't win.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the team didn't win the second half of the season
(2-6), which coincided with his knee injury. Most players would
have shut down. Not Armstrong. He kept plodding along. He was
charged with 12.5 sacks, but nobody understood how badly he was
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was extremely happy with the way I played last year,'' said
Armstrong. ``If I couldn't play anymore, then I couldn't play
anymore. I was hurt. I knew it. Everybody knew it. You can't always
be out there 100 percent. That doesn't happen in football. You go
out and do the best you can and play the hardest you can play.
That's all anyone's ever asked.''
</P>
<P>
   While he was unemployed, Armstrong spoke often to longtime
friend Ben Coates, who has since hooked on with the Baltimore
Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss him,'' said Armstrong. ``I still talk to him two or
three times a week. It's one of those things that happens. I wished
it didn't. I'll miss him on the field and I'll miss him more off
the field. Our friendship is bigger than the game. He'll be my
friend the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Armstrong, there'll be those asking whether Coates has
anything left, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm biased,'' said Armstrong. ``I think he's one of the
greatest players to ever play the game. Whatever is going to
happen, he'll be able to prove it on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Coates said of Armstrong, ``He's got serious tread left on those
tires. How can anyone think Bruce Armstrong doesn't have something
left?''

HOLYFIELD SERIOUS ABOUT RUIZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ There is one reason Evander Holyfield is taking
seriously the presence of Chelsea's John Ruiz in the ring opposite
him Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield knows from experience that underdogs have teeth, too.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield was a 25-1 underdog to beat Mike Tyson in November
1996. In a poll of 49 boxing writers conducted by USA Today only
one, this one, picked him to stop Tyson. Everyone else felt an
ambulance would be needed to get him out of the ring.
</P>
<P>
   It was. To take a half-conscious and bloody Tyson to the
hospital for stitching. That is why being a 4-1 favorite to win the
vacant World Boxing Association heavyweight title at the Paris
Hilton has not convinced Holyfield of what much of the boxing world
believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times I was taken for granted. And when people did, I
whipped them,'' Holyfield said Wednesday. ``I realized that if I
take this man for granted, the same thing could happen to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I been in the position he's in before, when people didn't give
me a chance. That's why I won.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield has now won the heavyweight title three times, and if
he can claim the vacant WBA version once again he would become the
only man to gain that belt four times.
</P>
<P>
   It would be an historic moment, although many claim it is
tainted by the fact the title became vacant only after Lennox
Lewis, the man who last defeated Holyfield, had it taken from him
for choosing to fight Michael Grant in April for more money than he
would have received for fighting Ruiz, who was the mandatory No. 1
contender.
</P>
<P>
   When Lewis and Holyfield agreed to a rematch, they also agreed
contractually that the winner's next title defense would be against
the WBA's top contender. That was Ruiz, a former stablemate of
Lewis's a few years back.
</P>
<P>
   But after Lewis won, he refused to fight Ruiz next, apparently
believing the title was safe with him. It was not and even his
lawyers acknowledged that this week when they withdrew their appeal
of a federal court decision that said Lewis could give up the WBA
portion of the title or fight Grant next, but he could not do both.
</P>
<P>
   And so Holyfield now finds himself, at 37, suddenly thrust back
into title contention at a time when it appeared his career was
either over or headed toward a lengthy string of fights to get
himself back in position to do what he has said for years is his
destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to retire as undisputed heavyweight champion,''
Holyfield said. ``I believe that's my destiny. Become undisputed
and that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   To do that he must get by Ruiz, who many in boxing have
dismissed as a journeyman who won his ranking through the
manuvering of his promoter, Don King. The truth, however, is that
he got there the same way Grant and so many others have risen to a
title fight _ by winning most of the time and avoiding the other
top contenders.
</P>
<P>
   The difference with Ruiz is that he at least volunteered to risk
his No. 1 rank against Grant, who was the WBA's No. 2 contender,
with the winner getting the title shot with Lewis. Grant refused
and Lewis then took the lesser of the two challenges, destroying
Grant in less than two rounds, which brings us back to the king of
the underdog's and his present situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a choice,'' Holyfield said of Lewis's decision that
opened the door for him to another heavyweight title fight.
``Lennox and I both signed two contracts with that clause in it. He
signed it twice. But people around him made him feel the undisputed
title isn't worth nothing. Then when you give it up, the same
people say you're not worth as much money. That's the networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People told me to do the same thing after I beat Tyson. They
told me to go right to Lewis but I had a mandatory (defense) to
make. Just because I beat Tyson don't make me bigger than boxing.
You got to have respect for the rules and regulations. Heck, Lennox
is the recipient of two of 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a reference to the fact that Lewis was handed the WBC
title originally without fighting for it after Riddick Bowe refused
to defend it against him after he'd won the undisputed crown from
Holyfield. Then he got it a second time after Tyson was stripped
and he was allowed to fight Oliver McCall for the vacated WBC
title, a match he won with ease.
</P>
<P>
   So now Lewis controls two-thirds of the recognized major belts
(if such a thing still exists) and someone will win the third
Saturday night. Holyfield believes that will be him because he
believes what the rest of the world does not. He believes Ruiz is a
challenger, not a cadaver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm preparing for a better person than I see,'' Holyfield
said. ``They all fight better when they fight me. They can be
half-dead and they fight better when they fight me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had a problem getting up for fights because for some
reason people see me and they all think they can whip me. Old
fighters think that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I fought (George) Foreman, Joe Frazier (who was nearly
50 at the time) came up to me and said, `I can whip you!' After I
beat Foreman (who twice knocked Frazier cold) he realized maybe
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they look at me and say, `The guy really isn't that big.'
I guess I'm the kind of guy who gives people hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Until, Holyfield didn't need to add, the fight starts.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lewis's promoter, Panos Eliades, sued Ruiz and manager Norman
Stone Wednesday, claiming he's still owed $10,000 from King for a
fight Ruiz had with Jerry Ballard when he was still under a
promotional contract with Eliades. Stone dismissed the suit as of
no importance, which is true when you're in line to make $1.5
million . . . As predicted, WBA welterweight champion James Page
did not arrive in Las Vegas at the final press conference and will
not defend his title Saturday against No. 1 contender Anthony ``Sox
Heads'' Lewis. King claims this is all about money. Page claims
it's about not being told of the fight until a week before the
match. Where the truth lies, someone will have to sort out, but it
will probably cost Page his title _ although Nevada State Athletic
Commission executive director Marc Ratner said he did not think the
commission could suspend Page because he had not applied for a
boxing license in Nevada and hence is not under their jurisdiction.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Joan Maimonis talks about Tupperware with an almost evengelical
fervor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great product,'' she says, arranging a display of the
colorful plastics just before a party in a home just south of
Boston. ``My kids and my husband are my passion, but I also love
Tupperware.''
</P>
<P>
   Maimonis is one of the leading Tupperware managers in the
nation. Last year the mother of three earned more than $60,000.
Listening to her talk Tupperware, she gives the impression of
leading a total Tupperlife, but she claims to work, on average,
only 20 hours a week, adjusting her schedule to fit around the
needs of her family. That flexibility, she says, is the best part
of the job.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999 Maimonis and her unit of 40 sales representatives sold
$395,000 worth of Tupperware. This year she wants to beat the
annual sales record of $425,000 for a single unit in her
distributorship, Damigella Tupperware in Everett, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very challenge-oriented,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   With her upbeat, outgoing personality, Maimonis seems the sort
of person who could sell anything, but Tupperware isn't just
anything, as she and other devotees attest. In the world of plastic
containers, it's the gold standard. Tupperware may cost two or
three times as much as other plastic storage, but millions of
consumers are willing to pay higher prices for what they apparently
believe is a superior product.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a staggering statistic: A Tupperware party starts every
two seconds somewhere in the world, according to Tupperware
spokesman Stuart Rosenberg. Last year more than 100 million people
worldwide attended Tupperware parties, and bought $1 billion worth
of Tupperware. The hottest markets are now in Asia, Latin America,
and Europe. Last year, the company began selling on TV shopping
channels, in shopping mall kiosks, and on the Internet
(www.tupperware.com), but home parties still account for most of
the sales. Indeed, the parties seem to have a life of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all networking,'' Maimonis says. ``In 13 years, I've
never had to advertise.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, the party is at Eileen Mulvoy's house. While Maimonis
arranges her Tupperware on a table in the living room, Mulvoy is
busy in the kitchen, preparing snacks and chatting with her guests.
Most are young mothers, as she is, but there are a few older women,
too. Young or older, they're all veteran Tupperware partygoers,
``Tupperbabies,'' says Mulvoy. ``We grew up going to Tupperware
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to it is socialization,'' says Kathleen Hanley,
Mulvoy's mother. ``The young mothers like to get out for an evening
and get together. We used to do it. We still do. I've owned 99
pieces of Tupperware and they've all ended up in somebody else's
house.''
</P>
<P>
   Tupperware comes with a lifetime warranty that covers cracking,
chipping, peeling, and breaking. It's guaranteed against just about
everything but loss and theft, the twin banes of Tupperware
fanciers everywhere. Tupperware is a coveted status symbol. The
company is known for its innovative designs; pieces are featured in
museum collections, including those of New York's Museum of Modern
Art, the Chicago Athenaeum Musem of Architecture and Design, the
San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and, of course, the Museum of
Food Containers at Tupperware company headquarters in Kissimmee,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Earl Tupper's invention
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tupperware came to be in the mid-1940s when Earl Tupper, of
Berlin, N.H., was experimenting with new uses for one of his
inventions, a durable, lightweight, odorless plastic used to make
gas masks during World War II. Tupper devised plastic containers
with a ``burping'' airtight seal that kept food fresh in the
refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Tupperware products were introduced in department and hardware
stores in 1946. The timing was perfect. The postwar building/baby
boom was under way; suburbia was beginning to sprawl. However,
Tupperware didn't really take off until the late 1940s, when
several Stanley Home Products representatives began demonstrating
the ``burping'' seal at their home parties. It wasn't long before
the Tupperware party became a familiar feature of American life.
</P>
<P>
   Tupperware no longer burps. ``It whispers,'' Maimonis says,
easing a lid onto a bowl. Her sales presentation owes something to
her years as a teacher. ``It's made of Lexar,'' she says, holding
up a piece of Rock 'N Servec freezer-to-microwave ware. ``And what
is Lexar?''
</P>
<P>
   ``They make bulletproof vests and airplane windshields out of
it,'' offers Jennifer Watson, who recently hosted a Tupperware
party and obviously remembers the details.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Maimonis is on to another product, FridgeSmart containers,
which feature an adjustable ventilation system that accommodates
every kind of produce, from ``heavy breathing'' vegetables such as
broccoli to ``low-breathers'' like strawberries.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can put your celery in here and it will last six weeks. No
joke,'' she says. ``You can go to Europe and come back and your
celery will still be fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
``More fun than work''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maimonis attended her first Tupperware party 13 years ago. She
was impressed by the product and even more impressed by the fact
that the Tupperware consultant who ran the party made $150 for two
hours of work. ``It looked more like fun than work,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She was newly married and teaching high school Spanish full
time, but she and her husband, Peter, a scientist, were planning to
start a family. Maimonis figured selling Tupperware would allow her
to make money and set her own schedule. After her first child was
born, she quit her teaching job and took up selling Tupperware
part-time. Just after she gave birth to her second child, her old
car gave out. She knew Tupperware provides its managers with cars,
so she became a manager.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, her unit has expanded to include 40 consultants.
Some have full-time jobs in nursing, teaching, and the business
world and sell Tupperware part-time to supplement their incomes.
Some are mothers who want a part-time job with flexible hours so
they can care for their children.
</P>
<P>
   Maimonis presents the product at an average of two parties each
week. She trains new consultants and acts as a kind of
godmother/cheerleader/instructor to her flock. Making sure her
consultants are happy and productive is an important part of her
job because she receives a percentage of their sales.
</P>

   Maimonis says she reached her present income level only in the
last few years, when she ``got serious'' about selling Tupperware.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to give the impression that it takes 13 years to
make that much money,'' she says. ``Some people reach that level
after only two or three years.''

   On a Monday night a few weeks after the Mulvoy party, Maimonis
attends the semimonthly Damigella Tupperware sales rally at the
Sheraton Hotel in Wakefield, Mass. The atmosphere is one of a giant
Tupperware party, with lots of socializing and snacking along with
the Tuppertalk. About 200 women of all ages have come from New
Hampshire, Maine, and Rhode Island, as well as Massachusetts. A few
have brought along young children and infants. There's one male
manager there, too, who takes some kidding, but doesn't seem to
mind. According to Tom Damigella, who, with his wife, Rita, owns
the distributorship, it's not unusual in other parts of the country
for men to sell Tupperware. Back in the 1940s, Damigella's parents
were among the first consultants to sell Tupperware.
</P>
<P>
   Maimonis shepherds her consultants together in two rows of
seats. About 20 members of her unit are there, among them Susan
Mavrogiannis, who has been a consultant for a year a a half. Before
her children were born, she worked in a library. She'd never sold
anything in her life, she says, but that wasn't a problem. A hard
sales pitch isn't part of the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has to push it on anybody,'' she says. ``It's
Tupperware.''

WAIT SIX MONTHS BEFORE TREATING DECK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My new deck is all pressure-treated wood. It has the
floorboards, of course, and a 2 x 4 handrail, spindles, and boxed
posts. How can I paint the different parts, including the lattice?
And how long should you wait before painting a new deck?
</P>
<P>
   P.J., Quincy, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. With all the different parts that decks are made of, this is
a good time to mention how each part should be treated. For
starters, it is best to wait six months before treating
pressure-treated wood. The reason is that pressure-treated wood is
green (full of water) when installed, and green wood will not take
a sealer, paint, or stain until it dries out, which takes six
months.
</P>
<P>
   The floorboards can be left to weather, sealed with a clear
sealer, or stained with a semitransparent stain. Weathering
requires no further maintenance; sealer will last about a year;
stain will last three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   The 2 x 4 railing and bottom rail should be primed and painted,
because no stain or any other treatment will stand up to the
beating these rails take. Or, use a semitransparent stain, similar
to that on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   For the balusters, or spindles, and posts, use two coats of a
solid latex stain. For the lattice, let pressure-treated lattice
weather. Trying to paint or stain lattice is miserable work; just
picture yourself doing it. If you want color, buy vinyl lattice. It
comes in three or four colors, one of which might be satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My oil-based solid stain still peels and flakes. What's wrong
and what can I do about it?
</P>
<P>
   ARTHUR GIACOMARRA, Northborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing really is wrong; the person who sold you the stain may
have said an oil-based solid stain will not peel. That is what is
wrong. Solid stains, latex or oil, and paints _ anything that forms
a film _ will peel under just the right conditions, usually
moisture behind the stain or paint.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason your stain peeled may be that it was applied too
thickly. You may be able to fix your problem by sanding and
scraping, then applying two coats of the same stain, in thin coats.
And be sure to brush the stain in thoroughly with a brush. That is
the best way to apply it.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment least likely to peel is a semitransparent
oil-based stain, and this must be applied to bare wood.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My very large skylights were replaced with Lexan plastic
three years ago. Now, I am getting marks and globs of pollen and
blossom from trees on the Lexan. The stuff seems to be adhering to
the Lexan. How can I clean it off?
</P>
<P>
   ERIC CODY, Harvard, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Almost any plastic seems to be sensitive to airborne
particles, and that is why I suggest replacing any plastic with
plate glass. Glass will stand up to any abuse except a blunt force,
and plate glass is remarkably strong.
</P>
<P>
   For the spots and blobs, try cleaning them with vinegar, but try
this on a small area to make sure it does not affect the Lexan.
Rubbing alcohol might also help, but again, do a small area to test
for any adverse effects.
</P>
<P>
   And here's what I found in my files to clean plexiglas, acrylic,
and other plastics: VRS Acrylic Cleaner, also for chrome, crystal,
glass, and ceramic. Unfortunately, the information did not include
where to find this stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Also, call the Lexan people and see what they have to say.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Want a better tip on how to tie wind chimes so they will make
the proper sound when the wind blows? Susan McAndrew of Carlisle,
Mass. tried to retie her chimes with nylon fishing line, and said
it didn't work. So she asked the handyman what should be used.
</P>
<P>
   The handyman thought the nylon line was not flexible enough to
allow proper movement of the chimes, and suggested thin polyester
cord, or to check out what other chimes use.
</P>
<P>
   And here is what K. Hubbard of Duxbury, Mass. suggested, in a
postcard: ``I use dental floss to repair things. It works. I sent
for a decoration of several colored plastic circles that move with
the wind. The plastic string with it was a loss. Dental floss
secured it and it is still swinging away. You might want to file
this.''
</P>
<P>
   We certainly will file it, with thanks. Maybe, someday, there
will be as many uses for dental floss as there are for duct tape.
</P>
<P>

----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I installed a gas log in my fireplace. It runs on propane,
and since the draft is not very good, I get a lot of soot and smoke
in the house. I heard of a draft booster that fits on top of the
chimney. Would that work? And where can I buy one?
</P>
<P>
   JOHN PETROV, Sherborn, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. A draft booster should work, and you might find a chimney-top
model at a fireplace shop or other dealer in stoves and heaters.
Or, Energy Unlimited of Wayland.
</P>
<P>
   You may have to install a special aluminum or stainless-steel
flue liner, because when gas is burned, the products can eat
through a masonry flue.
</P>
<P>
   Another alternative is to install a power vent on your gas log,
one that powers the fumes out through a wall, via a PVC pipe.

TALK ABOUT .400 IS RESERVED FOR TED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It's still the voice of Zeus, almighty god of
hitting. Reached via telephone at his Florida home Wednesday
morning, Ted Williams _ the last big leaguer to hit .400 _ bellowed
this about Nomar Garciaparra:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gonna tell you something I've been saying for two months.
I think he's gonna hit .400. I really do. He's a great young
hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   They talk.
</P>
<P>
   The Kid, who turns 82 Aug. 30, talks to the young shortstop who
is making a serious run at the plateau that has eluded all
big-league hitters since 1941.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Ted the other day,'' Garciaparra said before
Wednesday's series finale against the Angels. ``He's awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   The feeling is mutual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw a better looking righthanded hitter,'' stated Ted.
``And I saw the great (Joe) DiMaggio and I saw Willie Mays and
(Roberto) Clemente and all those guys. The only one that I'd say
was a better hitter than him _ Hank Aaron was a great hitter. But
Garciaparra, he has got style and beauty of swinging.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra is only in his fourth full season but has a chance
to become the latter-day Ted (imagine driving through the Nomar
Tunnel when the Big Dig is finally done in 30 years). Making one of
the few serious runs at .400 in the last half century, Garciaparra,
who went 1 for 3 in the Sox' 4-2 victory, is hitting .385.
</P>
<P>
   As every card-carrying member of Red Sox Nation knows, Nomie
won't talk about .400. It is an absolute interview stopper. For
most players, it would be a flattering query, but not for
Garciaparra. It's a walk-off question, like asking Bill Walton
about Patty Hearst. You'd have better luck getting Sean Penn or
Jose Canseco to talk about Madonna.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox are in the midst of a goofy five-city tour through
Oakland, Seattle, Boston (yes, the Hub was squeezed into this
junket), Anaheim, and Texas, and at every stop there's a columnist
eager to talk to Garciaparra about .400. The writers wonder why
they've read so little from Garciaparra on the subject. They are
warned by those who interview Garciaparra daily.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)Make it your last question. He won't talk about
it.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of (the reporters) respect my feelings on it,''
Garciaparra said.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra was in a small slump before this game. Normally
torrid playing in front of his hometown fans (like Ted, Nomar is a
Mexican-American, raised in Southern California), he went 0 for 7
in the first two games at Edison Field. He had not gone hitless in
three straight games since May of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   He batted .452 in June and .388 in July. The last time he was at
.400 was when he was hitting .403 July 20.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle first baseman John Olerud (then with the Blue Jays) was
batting .400 as late as Aug. 2 in 1993, but finished at .363.
George Brett's 1980 charge had him hitting .400 Sept. 20. Brett
finished at .390. Tony Gwynn hit .394 in the abbreviated 1994
season and Rod Carew finished at .388 in 1977. Those are the only
other serious runs at .400 _ other than Williams's own .388 in 1957
_ since Williams turned the trick. All were lefthanded hitters. No
righty batter has hit better than .380 since DiMaggio's .381 of
1939.
</P>
<P>
   All of the above also took more pitches and walked more than
Garciaparra. Williams walked 145 times in 1941. Garciaparra's
career high for bases on balls is 51. He's walked 41 times this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish that he was a little more selective there,'' said
Williams, hours before Garciaparra drove Matt Wise's first pitch
for a three-run home run in the third inning. ``If you know he's
gonna be swinging _ and the pitchers all know it _ do you think the
first strike or two the pitchers are gonna give him the best shot
that they got? He'll get a tough pitch, never an easy pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hurts himself a little bit there, but he's got that
reputation now and he'll lay off it for a while, and finally
they'll say, `I'm gonna get ahead' and pow!''
</P>
<P>
   Former teammate Mo Vaughn added, ``It's going to be hard, but he
can do it. He hits the ball so hard all over the place. It's tough
to defense him. Plus, he's got great speed. If anybody can do it,
he can.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of doughnuts in Anaheim set him back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy does it hurt,'' remembered Ted. ``This late in the year,
every time you get a hit it might go up a point, but every time you
go hitless it's three or four points down. Jeez. But you tell him a
couple of games don't mean a thing. One day he'll be right there in
reach again.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams's .406 in 1941 drew relatively little attention and was
overshadowed by DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak. DiMaggio walked
off with the MVP even though Ted noted, ``I hit .400 and I thought
that was pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it meant as much then as it should have,''
Williams acknowledged. ``Very few guys in baseball history have
done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Very few. In fact, there's only one living person who knows what
it's like to hit .400 in the major leagues, and he's sharing his
knowledge with the young man who might be next to do it.

<P>
   SOMERVILLE, Mass. _ There is no mystery behind the genesis of
i-Glow.com, a Web site aimed at girls who play or enjoy sports;
neither is it a get-rich-quick-via-IPO scheme from which the
founders plan to bolt in six months without a backward glance. It
didn't take exhaustive market research, extensive surveys, or
academic think tanks for Brooke Bartletta and Jamie Eslinger to
know, almost from the moment they met last summer, that i-Glow
needed to be born.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, said Bartletta, it all came about simply because ``this
is something we wish we had when we were growing up.''
</P>
<P>
   So on Sept. 1, the Davis Square-based i-Glow.com officially will
be launched. Aimed primarily at girls 10 to 16, the site will
include interviews with celebrity athletes, often conducted by
young i-Glow reporters; message boards on which girls can interact
with each other; experts to answer girls' questions and offer
advice; and surveys in which girls will be able to share their
views or stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really about a community, a safe place for girls to ask
questions and learn more,'' said Eslinger, 26, the co-founder and
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want them to feel that they own the site, and they do,''
added Bartletta, 28, co-founder and CEO. ``We're designing it based
on the things that they told us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The girls,'' continued Eslinger, ``have spoken.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the things girls have been saying for years is that
playing isn't meant to be so serious. In fact, in a 1992 survey
published in Melpomene Journal, 76.3 percent of girls 6 to 12 cited
``fun'' as the main reason to be physically active. So the site
will have games, jokes, polls, sports-related horoscopes, a place
to send e-cards to a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls play sports for a number of reasons,'' said Bartletta.
``To compete, to get in shape, to stay healthy, be social, hang out
with their friends, to have fun. We'd like to offer them as many
resources as humanly possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the site's name has a touch of sly humor: it wasn't long
ago, said Barletta, that active girls didn't dare sweat, they
merely glowed.
</P>
<P>
   The two women met just last summer, when Bartletta, who worked
in the interactive marketing department at America Online, called
on Eslinger at Beyond Interactive, an on-line advertising agency,
in Ann Arbor, Mich. Both had been active in sports _ Bartletta
played lacrosse, volleyball, and tennis in high school; Eslinger
had hopes of a basketball scholarship _ and Eslinger had majored at
Smith in women's studies with an emphasis on women's sports. Soon
they were having dinner, and a plan was hatched.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost magical,'' recalled Eslinger.
</P>
<P>
   The angst over whether to quit their jobs and go for it was less
than one might expect. For her part, Bartletta loves sports, had
always wanted to own a business, long been interested in serving
girls and hoped to do something of real worth. This fit the bill.
``It was kind of a now or never feeling for me,'' she said.
``Somebody else would do this eventually and if it wasn't me I
would be really bummed.''
</P>
<P>
   For Eslinger, the venture may be even more meaningful. When she
was 17, playing high school basketball back in Twin Falls, Idaho,
and hoping to snag a scholarship to play college ball, she went in
for a routine sports physical, where a lump was found in her arm
and she was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Disease, a form of cancer. In
an eyeblink, Eslinger discovered what it felt like to be on the
outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``My athletic career was stopped, all of a sudden halted, not
because I chose that but because my body just happened to be ill,''
said Eslinger, now in her eighth year of remission. ``It was
something that was taken away from me. I loved sports more than
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   She switched gears, enrolling at Smith and exploring new avenues
for a career in sports, and by her junior year, she was able to
walk on the basketball team and play again. ``Everything in my life
has pointed to this,'' she said of the internet venture.
</P>
<P>
   With Boston a hotbed of technology, education and sports, the
two women quit their jobs, packed up and headed East. By February,
an early version of their site first appeared on the Web, meant to
solicit response and suggestions from girls, and that morphed into
the soft-launch site that will exist until the more-extensive Sept.
1 rollout. Surviving so far on private financing, the women are now
turning their efforts toward seeking investors and advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Featured on the soft-launch site is an interview with soccer
star Julie Foudy, conducted at Foxboro Stadium during the recent
Gold Cup tournament, by 13-year-old Lindsay Fresta of Dighton.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's my favorite woman soccer player,'' said Fresta, adding
that her friends and soccer teammates ``are still talking about
it.'' She likes the site, she said, ``because it helps girls notice
that looks aren't everything.''
</P>
<P>
   At 13, Fresta is nearing the danger zone: studies show that many
girls quit playing sports when they turn 14, as they are bombarded
with new images and expectations. According to the US Department of
Health, 30.6 percent of freshmen girls particiate in high school
sports, but that drops to 17.3 percent for seniors. ``We want to
engage these girls at an early age,'' said Bartletta, ``to let them
know that what they are doing is important.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the community aspect that perhaps most impressed Caroline
Silby, a sports psychologist and author of the just-published
``Games Girls Play: Understanding and Guiding Young Female
Athletes.'' With people beginning to realize that not only are a
record number of girls playing sports but that they bring unique
physical, emotional and psychological needs with them, she said,
``it's very hard to find information. To even find a book for kids
is difficult.'' Coupling information from experts _ a dietitian and
athletic trainer will soon be added to the psychology grad student
currently on-line _ with the chance to share their own stories,
said Silby, shows girls ``you don't have to be a superstar for us
to value what you say.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartletta and Eslinger heard them loud and clear last winter
when, on nothing but word-of-mouth, hundreds of girls replied
electronically to a query on the site asking them to share the
reasons they play sports. ``We were just floored,'' said Bartletta.
``They feel very strongly about the sports they play, and they're
so passionate. It was a good test for us in terms of making the
leap. We were right on the verge and it was yeah, this is why we're
doing this. It really does make a difference.''

FIRMS AGREE TO BUILD A BETTER MODEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I &UR;  &LR; recently bought my last modem, a US Robotics device that
offers speeds of up to 56,000 bits per second, and usually delivers
about 50,000. But 50 kilobits is far slower than today's DSL and
cable modem systems, and I'm looking to step up to broadband.
</P>
<P>
   But what about those who can't? There are still millions of
people for whom high-speed digital Net connections are out of
geographic or financial range. For years to come, these people will
be saddled with slow analog modems.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the low speed of these modems may not be their worst
drawback. Ironically, nobody knows this better than those with
high-speed Internet access. I've got it here at the Globe, and so I
can download multimegabyte files in a minute or two. And yet, what
makes the service really valuable is that it's always on. That
means I can call up a Web page at a whim, or fire off an e-mail
with a click.
</P>
<P>
   Most Web pages come up almost as fast on a 56K modem as they do
here at the Globe, and it takes almost exactly as long to send a
brief e-mail. But with a modem, there's a dialing delay to clutter
up the process. And if you're stingy like me, and have just one
phone line, using the Internet stops you from getting or receiving
voice phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   DSL and cable modem services are popular in large part because
they eliminate the need to dial, free up your voice line, and
provide ``always-on'' service. These are pleasures that analog
modem users can never fully enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   But soon they'll be able to get pretty close. It turns out that
the 56K modem isn't the last word in analog data transmission after
all. By year's end, modem makers say they'll have prepared a new
modem standard called V.92 that can provide what might be called
``almost-always-on'' Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot to like about the new plan _ the absence of
fratricidal stupidity, for instance. In 1997, two incompatible
techniques were invented for making 56K modems, and the industry
practically self-destructed before finally adopting the uniform
V.90 standard.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the modem makers, fearful of repeating the 56K sales
slump of 1998, are all singing from one hymnal. They've already
begun tests to ensure their products all work together. The
official V.92 standard is set for final ratification by the
International Telecommunications Union in September, and the first
V.92 products should be on sale in time for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   So what will consumers get from the new standard? Well, there's
a bit of a speed bump. Remember that today's V.90s only receive
data at 56K; the fastest you can send data is just 33K. Under V.92,
the upload speed should rise to about 48K. Since most modem users
don't send a lot of data, this amounts to a marginal improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The other two enhancements look a lot more useful. When two
modems meet, they go through an elaborate ``handshaking'' process
to settle on the right speed and data protocols. They repeat this
process every time, as if they'd never met before. But most modem
users always dial the same number, so the protocols never change.
</P>
<P>
   V.92 takes advantage of this fact. ``The modem begins to become
intelligent and becomes familiar with the circuit you're dialing
into,'' says Mike Tramontano, marketing director of Motorola Inc.'s
modem software operation in Mansfield. A full handshake happens the
first time you dial a number; on redials, most of the process is
skipped. Tramontano says this cuts dial-up time in half.
</P>
<P>
   The new modems will also have a built-in ``hold'' feature. If a
phone call comes in while you're surfing, a signal will flash on
your monitor. You'll be able to interrupt the Internet connection,
take the phone call, then hop right back on to the Net without
having to redial. Again, the modem's ability to remember the
characteristics of a phone line is supposed to make the reconnect
quick and reliable.
</P>
<P>
   V.92 won't help you download three-megabyte music files any
faster. For tasks like that, there's no substitute for brute
bandwidth. But for the sort of workaday Web surfing and e-mailing I
usually do, a quick Internet connection can be more valuable than a
fast one. Besides, dial-up service is still cheaper than broadband,
and the new V.92s should hit the market in just a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, my new US Robotics box might not be my last
modem after all.

DUKE'S ON THE INTERNET STUMP, CAMPAIGNING TO BEAT THE BLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You know what the presidential campaign needs? A little more
outrage, that's what. In years past, the Republican National
Convention was known to get the blood boiling in certain liberal
ZIP codes. But with all that hand-holding and hugging going on this
year, the only folks watching are the insomniacs _ and maybe the
saccharine manufacturers. It's hard to get riled up about
dispassionate complacency, or whatever it's called.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a candidate worth hating. He's a compassionate
fascist who wants to make gun ownership mandatory. He proposes a
fat tax on people who take up too much room. The budget surplus:
He's all for it. Even his chief handler admits that the candidate
is a shallow opportunist who would sell out for the highest price.
</P>
<P>
   Get that man on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Duke, of course, is the gonzo creation of ``Doonesbury''
cartoonist Garry Trudeau. The chain-smoking character has stepped
off the comic pages to run for president with a high-tech,
multimedia campaign. Of course, he has a Web site,
www.duke2000.com. (``If you don't work that into your article in at
least six places, you're as ungrateful as you are drop-dead
gorgeous,'' the candidate says, speaking through Trudeau.)
</P>
<P>
   Duke is brought to life by the latest animation and
motion-capture technologies, which can add a bit of
unpredictability to the mix. The campaign was launched in February
at the US Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen, Colo., where a 3-D version
of Duke spoke to the audience in real time _ until the computer
crashed, that is. Duke, originally modeled after writer Hunter S.
Thompson, has ingested a fair share of pharmaceuticals over the
years, so it could have been an acid flashback.
</P>
<P>
   So what brings Trudeau, who won a Pulitzer Prize for drawing
``little pictures of the Nixon White House,'' to the Internet?
``I'm not drawn for the usual reasons _ greed and fear _ because
I'm neither poor nor scared about the future of my industry,'' he
says in an e-mail interview. However, he notes that when he gave a
talk at Stanford University earlier this year, some of the students
had never read ``Doonesbury'' in a newspaper, but had seen it
online. ``Although I personally love the little static black and
white drawings I've spent my life sketching on rag paper (and can't
foresee ever giving up), I am skeptical that a generation that's
grown up experiencing the world through screens will support comics
as I've known them.''
</P>
<P>
   That same generation, though, has also grown up with instant
``top 10'' lists, frank discussions of presidential private parts,
and dancing excretory products on ``South Park.'' How do you do
satire in such an age? ``This question _ how do you top reality? _
has been asked for as long as I've been working. I heard it a lot
during Watergate,'' says Trudeau, who contends that there are more
satirists working today than ever before. Indeed, anyone who feels
like it can produce parody on the Internet: Witness Zack Exley of
Somerville, who was threatened by George W. Bush for his mock
campaign site.
</P>
<P>
   But certainly, most amateur satirists don't actually have the
privilege of receiving such threats. It's hard to shock anyone
these days. ``The main difference is that the taste bar has not
only been lowered, but buried. Anybody can say anything,'' Trudeau
says. ``I think `South Park' might have marked the end of all
satiric restraint in mainstream popular culture. After all, if
you're not going to be offended by a singing turd, then what's
left? It's not political shenanigans that have become so extreme as
to resist parody _ it's the tools of parody that have reached their
limit.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Duke. He's always been what Trudeau describes
as ``a towering symbol of ignorance and bigotry,'' more of a
farcical figure than a satirical character. Trudeau insists the
whole campaign is strictly for entertainment. ``I mean, obviously,
we're trashing everything Duke stands for _ his naked opportunism,
his self-aggrandizement, his callousness and corruption. But it's
not with any grandiose agenda in mind,'' says Trudeau. He doesn't
want us to care one way or another about Duke: He just wants us to
be entertained by him.
</P>
<P>
   And you have to admit, that's what politics is all about these
days, anyway. Duke works as a candidate precisely because his
extremes are so entertaining. None of that bland,
middle-of-the-road pandering for this guy. (On censorship: ``You
have to remember that one person's porn site is another person's
social life.'') None of that namby-pamby multiculturalism for this
fellow. He's right out there with those recycled platitudes,
promising to ``be the ferret in the pants of the government'' and
``to build a bridge back to the 20th century.'' And he even
balanced out his ticket with the perfect prepackaged running mate:
Kathie Lee.
</P>
<P>
   If the Duke campaign proves anything (and Trudeau doesn't harbor
any pretensions here), it's that a candidate these days can succeed
only if he is a master of all mediums. His site (that's
www.duke2000.com, OK?) features a weekly video, and this week's is
a harangue about the Internet and personal privacy. It crashed my
computer just as Duke got to the part about abolishing the census
for women and minorities. As much as we love to hate this guy, his
candidacy is doomed.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Back when Trudeau started drawing ``Doonesbury,'' college kids
were united around issues like civil rights and the Vietnam War.
What does the Net generation have? Napster. ``It hasn't escaped me
that none of my three kids has purchased a CD since Christmas,'' he
says. ``We're raising a nation of pirates. As a professional
troublemaker, I'm pleased, of course. But as a content provider,
I'm appalled. Either way, there's no turning back. We all better
adapt.''

CAN'T MAKE IT TO GRACELAND? SOME OPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You probably have plans in place to observe the 23d anniversary
of Elvis's death (has it really been that long?) on Wednesday. But
if you've been too busy to arrange an appropriate commemoration,
you may be interested in suggestions for solemnizing the day in
``Elvis &AMP; You,'' a new paperback tome (626 pages) from Penguin
Putnam subtitled ``Your guide to the pleasures of being an Elvis
fan.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not too late to make plans to attend Elvis Tribute Week,
the official event organized by Graceland. But if you can't be in
Memphis, there are things you can do right where you are to honor
his memory. Co-authors Laura Victoria Levin and John O'Hara,
suggest reaching out to comfort fellow fans in need of consolation.
Send flowers or a wreath to Graceland. Place an ``In Memoriam'' ad
in your local newspaper to ``remind your community of Elvis's
legacy.'' Conduct a candlelight vigil, like the one held each year
at Graceland. If you have money to burn, consider ordering an
Elvis-related casket, decorated as a parcel and stamped ``Return to
Sender,'' custom-made by a Dallas funerary artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elvis &AMP; You'' is a reference for fans, by fans. ``The fan
scene is just so vast,'' Levin said from New York, where she's a
free-lance journalist. ``The book just grew and grew. Everything we
found out we wanted to put in. It was a labor of love. I hope that
comes across.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin has been hooked on Elvis since adolescence. ``I'm one of
those fans who was catapulted into puberty by Elvis,'' she said.
``One day I said: wait a minute, he's a man. Wow.''
</P>
<P>
   Her co-author comes at Elvis ``more from the music angle,''
Levin said. Between the two of them, they've got the Elvis fan
scene pretty well covered. Among the 33 chapter titles are Elvis
and Food, Elvis and Air Travel, Elvis and Art, Elvis Impersonators,
Your Elvis Shrine, Motion Picture Elvis, and, of course, The Music.
Each has ideas for fans who want to immerse themselves in the Elvis
experience, which may explain why there's no chapter titled Elvis
and Drugs. But the authors don't shy from the subject which was,
after all, part of Elvis's life, and death.
</P>
<P>
   One of Levin's aims in writing the book was to dispel the notion
that Elvis fans are wackos who believe that he never really died.
``Almost nobody thinks he's still alive,'' she said, ``but the
media always seem to find these fringe people. That drives Elvis
fans wild.''
</P>
<P>
   She wants people to know that there's a lot more to being an
Elvis fan. ``Real friendships are formed in the Elvis community,''
she said. ``There are Elvis fans all over the world. And so many of
them are involved in charities. Elvis gave away millions to
charities during his life, and it's a huge thing for the fan clubs
to raise money for charities he was interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   As Levin and O'Hara note, in many ways, Elvis is even more
popular now than he was when he was alive. ``Elvis &AMP; You'' provides
a guide to the scope of the phenomenon. Elvis just keeps getting
bigger and bigger, as younger people discover him and his music.
According to Levin, half the people who visit Graceland are under
30. And young people are among the most active fans on the
Internet, which has a staggering number of Elvis-related sites.
</P>
<P>
   This book, exhaustive as it seems, won't be the last word on
Elvis, far from it. The final chapter, titled Elvis in the Future,
has a quote from Wolfman Jack, ``Two thousand years from now
they'll still be hearing about Elvis Presley.''

   Lieberman! Of course! Why, it's the obvious choice for veep,
especially when you factor out all the charismatic fellows from
important states.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone's praising the choice, but that's standard operating
procedure these days; if Al Gore had appeared at a news conference
with a monkey on his shoulder, and announced that Screechy the
Lemur would be his Veep, Dems would praise the choice, and
Republicans would let it be known how much they admire Screechy.
``I worked with him during the budget battles,'' former Speaker of
the House Newt Gingrich said, ``and although we were adversaries, I
admired his diligence, command of the details, and ability to pick
nits out of my back hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Blah, blah. Politics nowadays are one long answer to Rodney
King's plaint: Yes, it seems we can all get along. It makes you
long for someone to stop with the nice-talk, do a spit-take on CNN:
``Lieberman? Joe the Drone? Nice guy, but listening to him orate
isn't exactly like flossing with a Roman Candle. The man's a cross
between Alfred E. Newman on downers and Droopy with a mouthful of
Novacain. What was Al Gore thinking?''
</P>
<P>
   Good question. Perhaps Gore feared that Dick Cheney would
monopolize the vexatious-prostate demographic. Perhaps Gore needed
moral cover _ and Lieberman is now portrayed as Gandhi from
Connecticut, with superhuman ethical abilities that cancel out
Gore's evasions. New, concentrated Joe detergent _ gets out even
the toughest White-House Coffee stains!
</P>
<P>
   The real question, however, is what Sen. Lieberman was thinking.
He is, by all accounts, a sharp and decent fellow. Moral, upright,
ethical, all those old Scout virtues. And that's why it's sad to
watch him clamber in the sack with Gore. Let's remember two key
moments in the impeachment drama. Lieberman issued a stern, sad
denunciation of his old friend Bill. The president, said Lieberman
in his nerdy warble, ``had extramarital relations with an employee
half his age and did so in the workplace in the vicinity of the
Oval Office. Such behavior is not just inappropriate. It is
immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   Right. Now, let's recall Al Gore's speech on the White House
lawn, where he insisted President Clinton was the by-gosh bestest
president a fella could have, and he was proud to be his
bootlicking vassal. Or words to that effect. So one has to ask: Why
does Sen. Lieberman want to be Veep for an immoral creep's
apologist?
</P>
<P>
   Power, of course. Next stupid question?
</P>
<P>
   OK, what does he bring to the ticket? Well, as the first Jewish
Veep choice, he breaks a precedent. Much will be made of how much
is not being made of Lieberman's religion. It startles one to
realize that it's taken this long to name a Jew for this position.
At this rate, we can expect black presidents and female Veeps of
Arab or Hispanic extraction around the time we admit the Pluto
Colony to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   He also brings diversity of opinion, although it's hard to see
why this matters. Supposedly, Cheney was named to bolster George W.
Bush's lack of foreign policy expertise. If the Russians moved into
Ukraine, the Dems suggest, Bush would hide in the well of his desk;
Cheney would pry him out, slap him, and present the options.
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman is in a different position. On many issues he
holds positions contrary to Gore: Parental notification. Missile
defense. School vouchers. Letting municipalities sue gun makers.
Gore won't change his mind on any issue because Joe has another
opinion _ in fact, the reverse will happen. Surely Lieberman knows
that he's the one who'll be carrying Gore's water, drinking it, and
pronouncing it to taste like champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Does anyone look forward to hearing Lieberman explain why he's
now in favor of all the things he used to oppose? Have a nice ride,
Joe. Hope it's worth it.

NEW SCHOOL YEAR PROMPTS QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Should we push our daughter, who will attend her second year
of middle school in the fall, to join extracurricular activities?
She is not a natural joiner and we've always had to encourage her
to try out the normal after-school activities (e.g., soccer). As
she gets older, she is more resistant to doing anything. We don't
want to overload her but we also don't want her to be isolated and
miss out.
</P>
<P>
   A. Whatever you do, don't push! Even if she's tempted by a
particular activity, your suggestion alone could turn her off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important to a typical 12- or 13-year-old to feel
she's in charge of her life,'' says Margaret Sagarese, coauthor of
``The Roller-Coaster Years: Raising Your Child Through the
Maddening Yet Magical Middle School Years'' (Broadway).
</P>
<P>
   In other words, what to you may be asuggestion seems to her like
butting in, which is why she's so quick to fly off the handle. What
you're suddenly arguing about has little to do with the subject at
hand and everything to do with her need to feel in control.
</P>
<P>
   As you suspect, however, extracurricular activities are
important; they can turn her on to new interests and new friends.
Here are some strategies from Sagarese:
</P>
<P>
   --Avoid assumptions about what she'd like. She may be bored or
tired of the sport or instrument she's played for eight years,
think it's babyish, or perceive that the crowd she wants to be part
of won't think it's cool.
</P>
<P>
   --Find someone else, a favorite teacher or her best friend's
mother to suggest an activity you think might be perfect for her.
</P>
<P>
   --Avoid talking about what you did at her age. Her developmental
job is to separate from you. The more you compare her to you, the
less she feels like she's staking out her own territory and the
farther afield she has to go to do it.
</P>
<P>
   --Convey the assumption that, of course, she'll join an activity
without getting specific. Not, ``I bet you'd like this,'' but:
``What club are you thinking of joining?''
</P>
<P>
   --Be available to facilitate any choice she makes: ``By the way,
if you want to join a club that meets at night, I'm happy to drive
you back to school.''
</P>
<P>
   --Back off once you make these forays.
</P>
<P>
   There is one caveat: If your child doesn't pursue any activity
and she has problems socializing in general and/or doesn't seem to
have even one friend to hang out with, she may be lonely and
unhappy, possibly even the victim of teasing. Ask a teacher to help
you put together an objective social profile of your child. If
warranted, seek professional help.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Q. My son is enrolled in a preschool program for the fall that
requires him to be toilet trained. I'm in a panic because we aren't
having any success yet. I'd like to take the pressure off and let
it happen when it happens, but I'm afraid I don't have that luxury.
Do you think we can send him in pull-ups?
</P>
<P>
   A. The National Association for the Education of Young Children,
the most rigorous accreditation program in the country, subscribes
to the same theory you do: Toilet training happens best when it's
on a child's timetable.
</P>
<P>
   NAEYC prefers preschools not to mandate toileting as a
prerequisite for enrollment, but Massachusetts regulations leave
room for preschools to require it. Even when schools do, however,
they usually aren't rigid about it, reassures NAEYC associate
executive director Marilou Hyson.
</P>
<P>
   Call your director, tell her your concerns, and see if she isn't
more relaxed about toileting than you expect. (I promise this won't
be the first such call she gets!)
</P>
<P>
   ``If the school is rigid about this, you might want to see what
else it's rigid about,'' cautions Hyson.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, however, the weeks left before school are
plenty of time for a child to train if he's ready, which means he's
interested in and aware of his body's functions. If you have been
pushing even a little, back off entirely. Leave the potty out in
the bathroom, but don't talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   That in itself may do the trick, says Ann Stadtler, director of
the Brazelton Touchpoints Center at Children's Hospital in Boston.
Her responsibilities include ``toilet school.''
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't work, she offers two steps that will
sufficiently prepare him for the toileting routine at preschool:
</P>
<P>
   --Set aside five minutes a day where your toddler routinely sits
on the potty with a book without you in the room. Tell him, ``You
don't have to do anything. This is just for you to get comfortable
sitting on the potty.'' Praise him for sitting, even if there's no
output.
</P>
<P>
   --After he masters that for a week, even without output, dress
him in underwear for two hours in the morning. If he has several
dry days, add a two-hour period in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   As for pull-ups, they are widely disliked by preschool teachers,
who say they give parents a sense of progress but actually slow
things down. Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   --When it comes to absorbency, pull-ups are more like diapers
than underpants. ``If a toddler wets, it's not uncomfortable, so
there's no incentive to use the toilet,'' says Carol Mancini, lead
toddler teacher at Lexington Playcare Center in Lexington.
</P>
<P>
   --When it comes to shape, they're more like underpants. ``If
there's a bowel movement, pull-ups don't control as well as a
diaper. Leakage can be messy and humiliate a child, plus it
requires a whole outfit change, which can take 10 minutes. That
takes them away from play and makes them unhappy,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   It also removes the teacher from the classroom. ``If you're
doing that two or three or four times a morning,'' says Mancini,
``that's a lot of time away from programming.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Our daughter is entering ninth grade at the high school. We
have not liked her friends for the last two years and see this as
an opportunity for her to find more appropriate and motivated
friends. Any suggestions would be welcome.
</P>
<P>
   A. High school often opens vistas for a child without parents
doing anything. ``Sit tight for six weeks and see if there isn't a
natural shifting,'' says parent educator Susan Panzarine, author of
``A Parent's Guide to the Teen Years'' (Checkmark).
</P>
<P>
   If there isn't, or if the new friends are an extension of the
old ones, she offers three suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   --Don't judge on appearances, especially not on piercings,
tattoos, or hairstyles.
</P>
<P>
   --Instead of saying, ``I don't like Joanne, I don't think she's
a good influence,'' try this: ``I notice you spend most of your
time with Joanne. Tell me about her. What makes her special for
you?''
</P>
<P>
   --Encourage her to try a new activity (see above).
</P>
<P>
   If there's no sign of change in friends by late October, and
especially if your concerns deepen, seek a professional
consultation with someone who has experience with teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My son will attend an independent school for the first time
this fall, in the sixth grade. The obstacle we face is his concern
and sadness about leaving the friends he has known for many years.
He is afraid they will reject him and not want to be his friend
anymore. My wife and I know we need to make special efforts to help
him stay connected, but would like to do more to help him accept
this change.
</P>
<P>
   A. Simply being empathetic may help more than anything else:
``It is hard to leave friends you've been with all these years.''
</P>
<P>
   This is an approach parents often avoid for fear it will make
matters worse. (We're much more likely to pooh-pooh concerns:
``It'll be fine, honey.'') In fact, validating a child's concern
lets him know you have heard him and that his fear is reasonable,
not crazy. That corroboration alone may enable him to move beyond
his worry to brainstorm solutions: ``What ideas do you have to make
sure you stay in touch with your neighborhood friends?''
</P>
<P>
   Two possibilities: signing him up for community sports and
hooking him up with a neighborhood child who made this transition
and stayed close to public school friends.
</P>
<P>
   It's normal for a child to worry he'll lose touch with friends;
worrying he'll be rejected is a bit of a twist, says educator
Janine Bempechat, associate professor at the Harvard Graduate
School of Education and author of ``Getting Our Kids Back on Track:
Educating Children for the Future'' (Jossey-Bass.)
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to find out what that means,'' she says. ``Is he
being teased? Is there a stigma (to attending independent school)
in peers' eyes?''
</P>
<P>
   Negative feedback from friends could make him feel bad about his
choice. Her advice is to get the stereotypes out in the open so
they don't fester: ``What do your friends think about the school
you're going to?''
</P>
<P>
   If he's balking about going altogether, remind him that this is
something you (hopefully) all agreed to, reiterate the reasons why,
and remind him he can go back to public school after the first year
(or whatever you are comfortable with).
</P>
<P>
   If he is seriously, visibly distraught, it's another story.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to know your child's temperament and ability to
tolerate anxiety,'' says Bempechat. ``At some point, a deposit is
worth losing if a child is literally sick.''
</P>
<P>

   SOUTH PARIS, Maine _ There are many surprising things about the
remote western Maine county of Oxford. You can, for instance, visit
Paris, Sweden, Peru, Denmark, Mexico, Lisbon, Poland, and Norway
here, and they're all within a half-hour's drive.
</P>
<P>
   Or, you could visit a small underfunded garden in the middle of
one of the state's ugliest commercial strips that has twice been
voted their favorite public New England garden by readers of
People, Places &AMP; Plants, the six-state region's leading gardening
periodical.
</P>
<P>
   The McLaughlin Foundation Garden &AMP; Horticultural Center has been
open threeyears, the result of a herculean and controversial effort
to save the 3 1/2 acres that a South Paris grocery clerk named
Bernard McLaughlin created over 60 years before his death in 1995
at age 97. Last month, the property was placed on the National
Register of Historic Places as a cultural landscape.
</P>
<P>
   If ever a garden seemed slated to die with its owner, it was
this one. There were no provisions for its protection in
McLaughlin's will, and it's on a busy corner amid auto dealerships,
gas stations, and even a railroad line, in a relatively poor part
of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   So how did it win the reader's poll, which drew 1,720
respondents last year?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best-known garden in Maine because it's been in the
headlines so much,'' said Paul Tukey, publisher and editor of
People, Places &AMP; Plants, based in Falmouth, Maine, and Lebanon,
Conn. ``And it's been around for 60 years before that.''
</P>
<P>
   Those decades left a powerful legacy of good will.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I've traveled through New England working on stories, I've
found all sorts of people who made an annual pilgrimage to that
garden and who are growing plants that Bernard McLaughlin gave
them,'' said Tukey.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Farmer's son
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The eldest of six children born on an Aroostook County potato
farm, where he helped his father in the fields for half the year,
McLaughlin
</P>
<P>
   had an innate sensitivity that was seeking a way to express
itself. Each winter he took the train to Palm Beach, Fla., to cook
at the Breakers Hotel. Handsome and fastidious, he developed an
appreciation for fine food, fine linen, and china, and most of all
for the estate gardens he saw around him. When World War I brought
some years of prosperity to Limestone, Maine, he amazed his family
by remodeling their spare homestead into a Dutch Colonial showcase.
A splendid rock garden replaced his parents' flowerless yard.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunities were even more limited in the Depression, but in
1936, McLaughlin finally had a place for his own garden when he
married a longtime aquaintance, Rena Tribou, who had inherited a
26-acre gentleman's farm the previous year in South Paris from her
father, a retired ship's captain. Bride and groom were in early
middle-age; they adopted Tribou's nephew.
</P>
<P>
   Not that McLaughlin and his wife were wealthy. The 1929 crash
had taken care of that. He worked as a grocer, his wife worked as a
clerk, and they gradually sold off all but 3 1/2 acres as
development encroached.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McLaughlin had a rich life behind his garden gate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Secret garden''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a secret garden situation,'' recalled Carolyn Jenson,
of Farmington, Maine. ``So many people in the town didn't know it
was there. There was a dilapidated fence and the rickety gate that
was open so that people who knew it was open could go in. So it was
mostly people who were master gardeners in the state who came.''
</P>
<P>
   With his background as a professional chef, McLaughlin also
enjoyed cooking gourmet meals for ladies who visited, Jenson
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very handsome right up until the time he died,'' she
said, ``and he loved women and was especially gracious to them. He
wasn't a talker. He was a listener.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenson described McLaughlin as ``a very soft-spoken, radiant,
peaceful man who had a very deep faith in the divine and a love of
beauty.'' When she met him through the Maine Iris Society, Jenson
had just lost eight members of her family in rapid succession and
was deep in mourning. ``I got so much moral support from visiting
him and his garden that it refocused me from grief to the beauty of
nature. There was such peace in that garden. Then I found I wasn't
alone, that others were visiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Over 25 years of visiting, Jenson went home with many plants
from that garden that now thrive in the 3-acre mountaintop garden
and nursery, Maine Cottage Garden, that McLaughlin inspired her to
create.
</P>
<P>
   ``His plants live on as a memorial to him,'' she said. ``I have
about a thousand people who visit every summer through word of
mouth. It's my way that I can share beauty with people. It grows
out of a belief in the creativity of God.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lovingly tended
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, 3,000 gardeners a year from all over New England,
but especially from Maine, visited McLaughlin's garden. The first
thing he would do each morning at dawn was head outside with
pruning shears and a bucket and work his way from one end of the
garden to the other, deadheading so visitors would be greeted only
by flowers in perfect bloom.
</P>
<P>
   His specialties included ferns planted between the stone walls
of an old ox-cart trail to the rear of the property, the irises he
bred, peonies, hostas, a large collection of unusual lilacs and
wildflowers, including masses of yellow lady-slippers, and a large
collection of unusual lilacs.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin worked in the garden until he was 96, Jenson said:
``He used two little lady's spades to get himself up and down off
his knees. And one day he couldn't get up and he called for help
and nobody heard him. It was several hours before someone found
him, and it frightened him. And he gave up the garden that day.''
</P>
<P>
   After McLaughlin tried unsuccessfully to donate his garden to
the local historical society, Jenson said. She spent six months
arranging for the University of Maine extension service to take
over the garden through a codicil to McLaughlin's will. She said
she thought the garden had been saved until she got a call from a
realtor after McLaughlin's death saying the will had never been
changed and the property was for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why the lawyer didn't do it,'' Jenson said. ``I
was very disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   The will, written decades before, stipulated that the house and
land be sold and the proceeds distributed among several relatives,
a friend, and three orphanages.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Protest gathering
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The following June, a ``save the flowers'' demonstration on the
corner of Route 26 and Western Avenue outside the garden attracted
about 30 people, made $300, and launched a movement to preserve the
garden.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Dassler, a St. Louis native with a freshly minted master's
degree in historic preservation from Columbia University, read
about the protest in the paper and attended subsequent meetings.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin's son was already removing the many of the most
valuable plants from the garden, including lady-slippers, clematis,
peonies, and irises. McLaughlin's garden records, books, and home
furnishings also vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Dassler decided to devote three months of her organizational
know-how to the effort _ and has been at it ever since. ``I felt if
I didn't try to do something and this is made into an auto parts
store, how could I drive through town again?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Things quickly got ugly. The dozen or so preservationists,
including Dassler, Jenson, and Dorothy Zug, a Quaker and
professional fund-raiser, were charged with being meddling, elitist
outsiders. There were threats and prank calls. More support came
from Portland and other parts of Maine than South Paris, whose
residents and local businesses stayed away from the controversey.
</P>
<P>
   Jenson drove four hours round-trip from her home to participate
and said she ran up a phone bill of hundreds of dollars a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were many times when we thought it wouldn't be saved,''
she said, ``but then things would turn around. The right people
would get involved at the right time or money would come in at a
crucial time. It's been a very thrilling journey to me to be part
of this wonderful group of people.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fund-raising drive
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The estate's executor signed a purchase and sale agreement that
gave the new McLaughlin Foundation six months to raise $200,000 in
financing. It was a cliffhanger. The Garden Conservancy provided
the group with transitional nonprofit status. No millionaire
stepped foward with an open checkbook. The largest donation was
$10,000 and the average was $50 to $100, said Dazzler. But $80,000
toward a down payment and operating costs was raised by the
deadline and the US Department of Rural Development guaranteed the
mortgage. Still, the group had to find five banks willing to share
the risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was incredibly complex,'' said Dassler. ``We were advised
you need an endowment of at least $300,000 for something like this,
and instead, we're starting off with a big mortgage.''
</P>
<P>
   The staff includes 1 1/2 gardeners. As director, Dassler has
lost none of her enthusiasm. Her duties range from writing grants
to occasionaly making lunches in the tearoom.
</P>
<P>
   The garden continues to be discovered. More people visited on
Memorial Day weekend this year (6,000) than in all of 1999. Local
participation is rising, partly thanks to projects with local
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news, say those involved, is that two adjacent
properties, which help buffer the garden from local commerce, are
for sale. Also, the garden itself has a long way to go before it
returns to the level at which McLaughlin maintained it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet today, McLaughlin's garden is again open free to the public,
as it was during his life. Revenue comes from donations and grants,
a small plant sale area, a gift shop in the sturdy oak barn, and
the tranquil tearoom that serves lunches and refreshments to the
sound of classical music in the 1840 farmhouse where the
McLaughlins lived. Like the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in
Boston, it feels like a secret spot where time has stopped in a
calmer era, while the frenetic world of commerce whirls outside its
gate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The McLaughlin Garden is open free to the public daily from 8 a.m.
to 8 p.m., May to October. The tearoom serves lunches Wednesdays
through Saturdays, from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., through Labor Day.
Visitors from Boston should take Exit 11 off the Maine Turnpike and
follow Route 26 one hour north of Portland. For more information,
call 111-111-1111.

IT'S TIME TO BE WILD ABOUT MUSHROOMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The wet, humid weather that has left spirits sagging and
vacations soggy is also bringing an unseasonably vivid display of
wild mushrooms to back yards, forests, and fields.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're working in your garden or walking along a road or
strolling in the woods, this summer offers an unusual opportunity
to view a wide variety of mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's bad for beachgoers is good for mushrooms,'' says
Lawrence Millman, a writer and avid mushroomer who lives in
Cambridge, Mass. ``I walked to meet a friend for dinner in Harvard
Square. En route, I found 12 different kinds of mushrooms. And I
wasn't looking. I was hurrying, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not seeing as many as I see in a good fall, but for summer
viewing, this is spectacular.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Chris DeNuzzio, a naturalist at the Cape Cod Museum
of Natural History in Brewster, led a group of children on a
mushroom walk and found 16 different kinds in 20 minutes. ``They're
coming up and they're magical,'' DeNuzzio says. ``The kids couldn't
believe the colors and diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Mushrooms are members of the fungus kingdom, more closely
related to animals than plants, with cell walls made of chitin, the
same material as a lobster's shell.
</P>
<P>
   They are the fruit of a vast network of underground root-like
hyphae that can stretch for miles, making some of these fungi the
largest living things on Earth. They also live a long time. If you
have mushrooms in your yard, the fungus that produces them could
date back to the forest that stood on your land before it was
cleared for development.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't hurt the fungus to pick its mushrooms any more than
it hurts an apple tree to pick its apples, but the mushroom could
hurt you. While some wild mushrooms such as morels (which fruit in
May) are quite delicious, others are quite deadly. The false morel
is a look-alike that is not only poisonous, but also produces the
same chemicals used in rocket fuel and will partially vaporize if
you drop it in a hot skillet. So don't take a chance. Enjoy wild
mushrooms for their odd appearance, not their flavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually know someone who died from eating wild mushrooms.
They were picked from someone who was fairly knowledgeable, and
obviously they made a terrible mistake,'' says Barbara Pryor,
spokeswoman for the New England Wildflower Society in Framingham,
Mass. ``We tell people not to eat any plants unless they know what
they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Some common mushrooms you'll see while the soil stays damp
include mycenas, little parasols that sprout overnight in
short-lived circles called fairy rings. As the fungus underground
grows, the rings get a little larger with each appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Amanitas look like toadstools topped in classic red caps with
little spots. ``They include some of the most deadly mushrooms we
know of,'' says Framingham State College professor Margaret
Carroll, who teaches a two-day course on identifying fungi with her
husband David Hibbard.
</P>
<P>
   Coral mushrooms look like cream-colored cauliflower and appear
on dead pine trees in the fall, but they're blooming early now,
says DeNuzzio, because of all the rain.
</P>
<P>
   Look for orange, red, or brown boletus around pine groves.
``They're very spongy,'' Carroll says, ``and when you look at the
underside you see tubes instead of gills.''
</P>
<P>
   You'll often find these near waxy Indian pipes, a parasitic
translucent flower with no chlorophyll for feeding itself. It
receives sugars from the boletus, who, in turn, get sugar from the
pine trees, which themselves get nutrients from soil enriched by
the mushrooms. Wild orchids have a similar symbiotic relationship
with fungus and often can't grow without them.
</P>
<P>
   Russulas (pronounced rush'ella) and lactarius both have mushroom
caps that look like concave bowls poking through the ground. Break
off a lactarius and it will ooze a thick milky white latex-like
substance, while russulas won't.
</P>
<P>
   There are also still some puffballs around. Squeeze them and the
spores puff out like smoke, to the delight of children. Related
earth stars have hard leathery outer husks, but those peel back in
the shape of a star to expose a puff ball inside.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone wondering how to get rid of mushrooms in the lawn,
Carroll offers one word of advice. Don't. ``They don't last long,''
she says, ``and all fungi improve the soil.''
</P>
<P>
   Think of them as earthworms that reach for miles and
occasionally sprout toadstools.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Carroll and David Hibbard lead a two-session course on
identifying fungi, Sept. 13 and 18, at the New England Wildflower
Society headquarters in Framingham. Call 508-877-7630, ext. 3303.

snake on the rear deck, and added other clues that the S is a
different reptile than the basic Boxster, first introduced in 1997.

<P>
   Visual hint: Look for five-spoke wheels, a third large air

the rear.
</P>
<P>
   Hands-on fact: When the Boxster debuted it arrived with a
2.5-liter flat-six engine that delivered 201 horsepower. Porsche
billed this as ``affordable'' and managed to deliver on that
promise even while maintaining solid Porsche quality. The only
complaints heard were from those who thought it underpowered.
</P>
<P>
   That's debatable unless you consider any Porsche that's not a
head-snappin' rocket to be underpowered, but Porsche must have
heard enough consumer whining, because this year the basic engine
is a 2.7-liter that cranks out 217 horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   If you want more than that, you've got to move to the Boxster S,
with its 3.2-liter engine and intake manifold from the 911. Now
you're talking 250 horsepower, almost midway in the power range
from the basic Boxster to the standard 911. It's a significant step
up toward that higher-end Porsche line _ a big enough step that
would have me wondering, if I were to buy a Porsche, if the 911
Cabriolet I tested a few weeks ago is tens of thousands of dollars
better than the S. You've got a $7,000 question in deciding between
a Boxster and Boxster S. With the S, you've got a $30,000 question
when you're also ogling the 911 Cabriolet.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Cabriolet has got that little seat in the back where
you can toss stuff and the Boxster does not. But with its engine
tucked right behind the driver, the Boxster ends up with good
luggage/stuff space under both the front and rear decks _ and
that's a great thing in a two-seat roadster.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, room is a great quality of the Boxster. Big
luggage up front, other luggage in the back, flat materials tucked
into a thin but wide shelf behind the seats, you've got storage
space for long trips.
</P>
<P>
   You've also got deep wells on both sides for the feet, so even
tall folks, hunkered down into the firm, supportive seats, have
plenty of legroom. Headroom, because you sit low, is plentiful as
well, and the cabin feels quite wide.
</P>
<P>
   From the driver's seat you peer over a nose that is virtually
the same as a 911 snout (I hear Porsche will be differentiating
them in later models) and that gives you the classic
bulging-fenders-as-guides feel of driving a Porsche.
</P>
<P>
   The three-spoke steering wheel has its third spoke at the
bottom, leaving the top half of the circle open for a clean view of
the scalloped gauges: tachometer at the center with a digital speed
readout at the bottom, an analog speedometer to the left, fuel and
oil gauges to the right. Below, in a packed horizontal line, is an
array of warning lights.
</P>
<P>
   Hands on the wheel, fenders and gauges to guide you, take it for
a spin.
</P>
<P>
   First, you realize that 250 horsepower suits this car just fine.
It's not a car that would run with the 911 at top end, but it's
clear that it is a car that could take you far faster than you
should drive, far faster than you should get there.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly impressive is the torque band between 4,000 and
6,000 rpms. You're already cruising at high speed when you hit four
grand and it wants to just keep on running.
</P>
<P>
   But let's step back and ask what we can do that is both fun and
legal. Sure, you can weave in and out of highway traffic at high
speed in this rig, but that's not what you should do and it's not
why Porsche built it this way.
</P>
<P>
   Take it on a twisting road, one with hills, big curves, quick
curves, decreasing radius curves. Now tell yourself you are in a
hot roadster. Play.
</P>
<P>
   Your suspension can handle it. Independent front and rear,
you've got struts with control arms up front, along with coil
springs and an antiroll bar. In the rear, trailing arms locate the
struts and you've also got coil springs and antiroll bar.
</P>
<P>
   What this means is that even in tight cornering and hard
braking, when you might expect nose-diving, dipping, torsional body
twist, understeer or oversteer, you get none of these.
</P>
<P>
   The Porsche holds as firm as it holds any line on which you run
it. The only thing you'll find tossed side to side or front to back
will be you. So tighten your seat belt and enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Nice Touch:
</P>
<P>
   --The polished aluminum levers, in the driver's door sill, that
open the front and rear lids. They are big, easy to find, and easy
to use.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance:
</P>
<P>
   --The plastic rear window. If it's got to be plastic in order to
be packed into the limited space above the engine, then make it out
of better plastic. This one rumbled in the wind and was already
displaying permanent dimples and crease marks.

GOLDSTEIN'S DARK TALE OF PHYSICS AND PASSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOROTHY CLARK  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
PROPERTIES OF LIGHT 
A Novel of Love, Betrayal, and Quantum Physics 
By Rebecca Goldstein 
Houghton Mifflin, 224 pp., $23 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Properties of Light'' could be called a work of science
fiction: The science is physics, the fiction is about passion _
intellectual, familial, erotic. Like physics, passion has its
problems, enigmatic and even paradoxical. It is the questions
posited by quantum mechanics that bring three physicists together,
and the search for resolution (with its attendant variables, some
of them hidden) that brings about the collapse of their world.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fifth novel by Rebecca Goldstein, of Cambridge,
Mass. A 1996 recipient of a MacArthur Foundation ``genius grant,''
she earned a Princeton doctorate in the philosophy of science and
taught philosophy for 10 years before publishing her first novel,
the highly acclaimed ``The Mind-Body Problem,'' in 1983. Her
previous works have often featured Jewish characters and addressed
women's lives as well as themes in Judaism and philosophy. While
``Properties of Light'' is a departure, it isn't so very radical;
Goldstein hasn't abandoned her probing blend of scholarship,
creativity, and spirituality. And she makes the physics
fascinating, deciphering some of the complexities to whet a
reader's appetite. Still, quantum physics is esoteric to its core,
a property Goldstein sometimes takes for granted, so that the
uninitiated are left to grope for clarity.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, this dark story is brilliantly told. It centers on
the fractured lives of Justin Childs, Samuel Mallach, and Samuel's
daughter, Dana; on their professional collaboration; and Justin and
Dana's love affair. Goldstein's style is magnetic, with a poetic
economy: ``The essential fact is that I hate her,'' Justin Childs
states in the one-line opening paragraph.
</P>
<P>
   Justin, once a promising young physicist, is sometimes the
narrator of the novel, sometimes trading chapters with the voice of
a dispassionate unknown observer. Justin has taken a professorship
at a prestigious university where his idol, Samuel Mallach, has
long been a faculty member. Mallach, who early in his career had
received praise from Albert Einstein, is an embittered eccentric
who has been relegated to teaching the entry-level ``Physics for
Poets.'' He disdains the scientific community that shunned him,
refusing to recognize his groundbreaking work: the creation of an
objective model for quantum mechanics, the hidden-variable model,
which would enable the measurement of objective reality. (The
character of Mallach was inspired by real-life physicist David
Bohm, whose career was propelled into obscurity after his peers
rejected the ``hidden variables'' formulation of quantum mechanics
he presented in 1952. He died, virtually unknown, in 1992.) In
Justin's view, it was a punishment to which the great physicist
took ``with an unbecoming gladness. . . . Having lost his physics,
together with his senses, to the devastations of vast sorrow, he
was desperately seeking it in poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin proposes working with Mallach on continuing Einstein's
quest for a unified field theory merging relativity and quantum
mechanics. The younger man's motives don't seem entirely pure,
however; though he believes that Mallach has descended into lunacy,
Justin is convinced that some spark of the life force remains and
is determined to ``get the glorious physics out from him.'' Devoted
to her father, Dana Mallach joins the physicists' equation. Her
intentions raise curiosity as well, with her seduction of Justin
just hours after they meet, on his first visit to the Mallach home.
</P>
<P>
   While Justin is working with the Mallachs, he is pressed into
service on a research project by the chairman of the physics
department, Dietrich Spencer. What Justin doesn't know is that
Spencer is Mallach's archrival; the resulting complications spare
neither Justin nor Dana. The characters appear to represent the
phenomenon of ``quantum nonlocality,'' which is, the unknown
narrator explains, ``the feature whereby particles, having once
been subjected to quantum entanglement, will forever after continue
to assert, even when widely separated, instantaneous influences
over one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Reading ``Properties of Light'' is almost like watching a movie
with superb special effects that leave you marveling at their
execution. The novel requires intensive focus, however; the tale is
deftly layered with intriguing turns, some of them deceptively
subtle, others that shockingly exceed what they had anticipated.

DRIVING SCHOOL GOES FULL THROTTLE TO TEACH CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Teach your children well . . . .''
</P>
<P>
   That's Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, but this is not what they
had in mind: Strap your teenage daughters into the driver's seat of
a car. Send them squealing through an obstacle course; crunch the
car's anti-lock brake system through a series of chattering stops;
``chase'' another car at 55 miles per hour and try to stop when it
does; or race at 55 toward an ``obstacle'' and, just 50 feet from
it, try to get around it.
</P>
<P>
   But that is just what Charles and Rebecca Ruff of Waterville,
Maine, did with their daughters, and it was among the best and most
important gifts a parent can give a child.
</P>
<P>
   Teach your children well . . . to survive emergency situations
when they are driving.
</P>
<P>
   The Ruff daughters, Sydney, 16, and Sarah, 19, spent a day with
the staff of the Stevens Advanced Driver Training program
(www.skidschool.com) on an abandoned airport runway in Concord,
N.H. Sarah has had her license for four years, Sydney for a week.
Demographically, Sarah is reaching the age when drivers get
confident, even cocky, and do risky things that can get them into
trouble. Drivers Sydney's age tend to be cautious, trying to do
things right, but inexperience is their big threat.
</P>
<P>
   Parents ought to be concerned when we send our children out in a
car. Standard driver training covers the basics, but it simply is
not set up to teach the emergency techniques, the understanding of
a car's capabilities _ and limits _ that an advanced driver
training course can offer.
</P>
<P>
   Sending a teenager out behind the wheel, says Sandy Stevens, the
school's founder, ``is really the first time for us that we put our
children in danger; that we know they're in mortal jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   Think about that. Does your young driver know just how hard you
can safely turn a car to avoid danger? Whether the car he drives
has ABS and, if it does, the proper brake and steering sequence to
use in an emergency? How much distance it takes to stop a car going
50 miles per hour? Do you?
</P>
<P>
   That's where the Stevens program comes in.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all we do,'' Stevens tells a class of young drivers
and a few adults (including Rebecca Ruff) before they hit the
runway. No racing. No high-performance training. Just handling
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   It is training that weaves the intricacies of emergency driving
into a whole safety net over the course of a day.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the ABS.
</P>
<P>
   A training car races down the edge of a runway, one wheel on the
pavement, the other in the grass. At about 55 miles per hour, the
driver slams on the brakes and the car skids to a straight stop.
The students examine the skid marks, which reveal the magic of ABS.
Sensors ``watch'' each wheel for lockup and the beginning of an
uncontrolled skid. The brake is released momentarily on the locking
wheel, and then reapplied. Looking at the staggered marks the tires
made in both grass and pavement, students can see how the brakes at
each wheel were off and on at various times.
</P>
<P>
   That's stopping.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens says that one fear many drivers have in an emergency
situation _ an object or animal in the road, say _ is a fear of
turning so hard they will tip over. The approach: Teach them how
hard you can, in fact, turn a car in one direction, and then,
again, in another. It does you no good, he says, if you turn one
way to avoid something in the road, but continue off the road into
a tree.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the cones come in. The cones form a slalom course.
The challenge is to get through them at increasing speeds, right up
until the tires are squealing.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew MacDonald, a Stevens instructor, takes the Ruff sisters
through the cones a few times. In a run at about 35 miles per hour,
they laugh nervously. You want to begin your turn around a cone
before your bumper reaches it, he tells them. As you make turns
back and forth, your hands should be in constant motion. If they
stop, you are in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney, new to driving, handles the course at speed somewhere in
the high 20s, then edges into the low 30s. She gets the hang of it.
Sarah is a natural, her steering constant and graceful.
</P>
<P>
   Both come away surprised at how fast 35 miles per hour can seem.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see 35 on highway signs all the time,'' says Sydney. ``It
never seemed very fast to me.'' Neither gets the car through the
course at more than 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for the kids to feel they're going too fast,''
adds Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   Next they chase a ``dog.'' That's a cone tied to a rope that
leads from a bumper about two car lengths away. Driving beside the
lead car, bumper even with the ``dog,'' the Ruff sisters reach 50
miles per hour, watching for the lead car's brakelights. When they
go on, they slam their own brakes. Neither stops short of the lead
car and as they slide by, they realize had they been directly
behind, they would have slammed into it. Stevens explains that even
a perfect reaction time would leave the chase car's front bumper
even with the lead car's front bumper.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how close I follow on the highway,'' Sarah Ruff says,
shaking her head.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's time to combine what they have learned.
</P>
<P>
   The trick: a pair of lights forms a ``gate'' on the runway. They
will drive through the gate toward a wall of cones 50 feet away. As
they reach the lights, only one will come on indicating left or
right turn around the obstacle. The goal: drive around the obstacle
(the width of a travel lane), get back into the original lane, and
exit through a pair of cones.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Ruffs go through without braking, reaching speeds in
the 30s. Then they are told to stomp their brakes at the lights,
keep them on, and keep steering around the obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   Before the test they had been asked which should come first:
steering or braking. Sarah said steer, then brake. Sydney said
brake, then steer. Sydney later admitted she guessed right. Sarah
said, ``I though for sure that would just make you skid.''
</P>
<P>
   What they learned is the dynamics of braking and weight. If you
steer first, the weight of your car transfers heavily to the front
wheel on the outside of the turn. Applying the brakes after
steering amplifies this effect and you lose control _ often
tragically if you are in an SUV.
</P>
<P>
   Braking first puts the weight on both front wheels. Now you can
steer with them, even as ABS does its magic. At 55 miles per hour,
the Ruff girls learn how to get out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah says that in driver training she was taught that
emergencies had three solutions: speed up, slow down, turn.
</P>
<P>
   Now they know a car's astounding capabilities and how to use
them in an emergency. And that's more than most adults know.
</P>
<P>
   Teach your children well.

<P>
   FRIENDSHIP LONG ISLAND, Maine _ It's 5:30 a.m., and ``the
lobster doc'' is making her monthly house calls in the intertidal
zone.
</P>
<P>
   Biologist Diane Cowan flips over seaweed-wrapped rocks left
exposed to the air only at the lowest of low tides. She grabs the
juvenile lobsters hiding underneath, some of them as small as jelly
beans, others as large as hamsters. She inspects and measures about
30 baby lobsters in the dawn light, injecting tiny metallic tags
into their muscle tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, lobbies,'' she coos at them soothingly, even as they rear
their baby claws defensively and thrash around in margarine
containers. But she also finds them tasty. ``I'm definitely going
to see you on my plate some day,'' she says, addressing a hearty
youngster.
</P>
<P>
   Cowan, who has been called ``the Jane Goodall of lobsters,'' is
a mediator of sorts in an intensifying lobster war. A fierce debate
is raging between lobstermen, who are bringing in astronomical
catches, and scientists and regulators, who warn that the
overreliance on juvenile lobsters _ too young to have produced many
offspring _ threatens the longterm viability of the lobster
population.
</P>
<P>
   But what is missing amid all the heated rhetoric is conclusive
data. That's where Cowan comes in.
</P>
<P>
   Founder and head scientist of the Lobster Conservancy in
Friendship, she enjoys the respect of both camps. For eight years,
she has been tagging juvenile lobsters, building a database and
learning about the lobster lifecycle. The tags help her track how
fast the lobsters are maturing and how far they are traveling.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, Cowan is amassing a body of knowledge to bring to a
debate that she says now relies too much on hunches.
</P>
<P>
   Cowan is as passionate about lobsters as anyone has ever been.
But she's not an ideologue or a ``tree-hugger,'' she says. And
she's not particularly interested in weighing in on rules or
worst-case scenarios, because they are based on so little
information.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone agrees human beings don't know much about
lobsters, beyond how to steam or bake them. It is difficult to
study creatures that dwell in the dark recesses of frigid waters,
and few have done so.
</P>
<P>
   The 39-year-old Cowan wants desperately to collect so much data
lobsters will no longer be a mystery. And so, hopefully, there will
never be a major crisis in the Gulf of Maine like the mysterious
malady that already has devastated lobsters in Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I love about lobstering is that it's
individual businessmen fishing a wild animal that roams around free
and happy,'' Cowan said. ``I just think there's something
philosophically good about that.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that lobsters, the most valued catch in the
fishing industry from Maine to North Carolina, are the subject of
heated emotions. The crustaceans are essential to life and
livelihood in Maine, which produces half of America's yearly
lobster catch.
</P>
<P>
   Last year yielded the highest catch on record, at 53.1 million
pounds, worth $183 million to fishermen. It's no wonder so many
lobstermen contest the contention made by some regulators and
scientists that the population is overfished and could crash at any
moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never seen fisheries persist over the long term when
they've been fished at these rates,'' said Steven Murawski, a
biologist at the National Marine Fisheries Service.
</P>
<P>
   Cowan prefers not to make such pronouncements, but a lobster
disaster is the last thing she wants to see. So she lives on
Friendship Long Island, where the winter population is three, her
only power is solar, and she has to haul water 530 paces from a
well when the pipes freeze. All to be near the lobsters, and maybe,
one day, save them from extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Michigan and schooled in New York state, Cowan became
obsessed with lobsters after she chose them for a seventh-grade
report. Even back then high school classmates signed her yearbook
to ``the lobster lady.''
</P>
<P>
   In a Boston University graduate program at the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution, she stayed up all night to watch the
nocturnal crustaceans for eight, 10, even 18 hours. She learned
lobsters have complex social behaviors never before catalogued.
They build shelters, do housekeeping, groom themselves, and visit
each other at night, looking for potential mates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a regular soap opera,'' Cowan said. ``They're not chimps,
but they do some pretty cool things.''
</P>
<P>
   (Those cool things do not include ``holding hands'' on the ocean
floor or mating for life, as some animal rights activists have
claimed, Cowan said.)
</P>
<P>
   Since graduate school, Cowan has sacrificed career advancement
in the name of pure science. She taught for a few years at Bates
College and the University of Southern Maine, but found it
interfered with her field work when the tides were just right. So
for three years, Cowan waitressed at a seafood restaurant that
agreed to schedule her shifts around the tides.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more to science than looking at numbers,'' Cowan said.
``There's some intuitive part of it you have to be there for.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Cowan founded the Lobster Conservancy, although it was
mostly just her and a Web page (lobsters.org). Grants and donations
_ including the house she lives in _ have allowed her to expand and
hire a fellow biologist. This year the nonprofit has a $90,000
budget.
</P>
<P>
   The Conservancy's major project revolves around the most
signficant discovery of Cowan's career. In 1992, a couple of
lobstermen's sons showed her something scientists had never seen:
juvenile lobsters, thought to dwell only in deep, inaccessible
waters, living in intertidal zones.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Cowan's lobster tagging project has grown to include
more than 50 volunteers working at 24 sites from Isle au Haut,
Maine, to Manomet, Mass. They have thus far tagged 10,000 lobsters.
</P>
<P>
   Cowan tags the lobsters with a piece of metal, not much bigger
than a grain of sand, that carries six microscopic barcodes. In her
monthly visits, she rediscovers about 10 percent of previously
tagged lobsters. When she finds one a second time, she snips off
the leg with the tag inside, since lobsters can regenerate body
parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's doing amazing work,'' said Murawski. ``It's giving us
intimate details about local populations.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowan has earned respect from lobstermen as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fishermen all help her, and they sure wouldn't help her if
they didn't like her,'' said lobsterman and lifelong Friendship
resident Henry Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't have as many nice things to say, though, about the
new laws regulators are passing. ``They're really foolish laws,''
he complains.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists, however, are calling for even stricter rules. A
report released by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission
in June recommended increasing the minimum legal size for lobsters
and establishing trap-free sanctuaries.
</P>
<P>
   They point out that 95 percent of the lobsters landed are barely
over the minimum size, too young to have produced many offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Cowan agrees the pressure on lobsters has been high, that more
need to be allowed to grow up. But scientists know so little about
the animal, it's impossible to say anything with certainty, she
says.
</P>
<P>
   So her immediate goal is to keep tracking juvenile lobsters. To
that end, she's readying a lobster pound on the island to watch the
lobsters, if it works out, for the rest of her life.
</P>
<P>
   As hard as she works, the biologist has a sense of humor about
the creature she has built her life around. In her island home,
every refrigerator magnet and most every picture on the wall
features a lobster.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors are often surprised, Cowan said, to discover she eats
lobster ``as often as possible.'' Some Canadian observers this week
were so shocked at the dinner Cowan served they left their steamed
lobsters untouched in favor of corn-on-the-cob.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're delicious. I think it's normal to eat them,''
Cowan said. ``As a human, I'm a predator. They have a much better
life than a lot of the things we eat.''

<P>
   BOSTON _ After problems with a new computer system, Northeastern
University unintentionally admitted 25 percent too many freshmen
for this fall, forcing the school to scramble after housing and
teachers just weeks before about 600 extra students are set to
arrive.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected crush of freshmen will heavily strain the
university, from parking to classrooms to dining halls. In 1997, in
an effort to make the institution ``smaller and better,''
Northeastern decided to limit its freshman class to 2,800. This
fall it expects between 3,400 and 3,500 students to show up for
classes.
</P>
<P>
   Looking on the bright side, administration officials say that
the situation is a sign of the university's growing popularity and
that it won't hamper their efforts to improve the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us a short-term management issue,'' said Richard
Freeland, president of Northeastern and the architect of the
university's move to boost its prestige. ``It doesn't in any way
undercut the long-term strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Northeastern has slimmed down from about 50,000
students in the 1980s to its current 18,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   The admissions miscalculation will require freshmen to live with
extra roommates, others to commute from home, and some to hunt for
the few apartments available in Boston. Students in all years will
have to cram into crowded conference rooms and wake up earlier for
classes. And department heads will have to work long hours to
interview, train, and supervise new instructors.
</P>
<P>
   To keep class size under control and arrange for enough
classrooms, the administration is even considering eliminating the
coveted ``activities period,'' 1 1/2 hours during lunch two days a
week, designated for student group meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to affect everything _ the use of dining
facilities, health center facilities, (the workload) for financial
aid advisers,'' said Kerryann Driscoll, 23, a senior and president
of the student government association. ``Upperclassmen may not get
the classes they want and may have to sit in crowded classes, while
freshmen are going to have to live in triples instead of doubles.''
</P>
<P>
   Colleges often have trouble calculating exactly how many
freshmen will decide to attend each fall, but, based on past
experience, they are usually able to estimate within a few
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard something quite as dramatic as Northeastern's
case,'' said Brad Quin, executive director of admission enrollment
at the College Board, a New York-based umbrella organization for
universities. ``This is a complete aberration. . . . I think
Northeastern's case likely had more to do with university activity
than a sea change in student interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Professors at the university blamed the glitch on the admissions
office's new computer system, PeopleSoft, which they said set off
an unforeseen series of errors. Admissions officials admit that
when they converted to the new system, they lost the names of
hundreds of students interested in applying.
</P>
<P>
   The loss, professors say, prompted the administration to direct
deans, department chairs, and professors to call and encourage
students who had been accepted to attend Northeastern. In the past,
professors say, the administration welcomed the lobbying of top
students. But this year, they say, the administration pushed for
the lobbying of as many students as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Admissions officials said they did encourage more lobbying this
year, but denied the effort had anything to do with their computer
woes.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in his career, Bill Kirtz, a journalism
professor, said he was handed a list this spring of a half-dozen
phone numbers of prospective undergraduates, which surprised him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone was asked to do some calling, it was the chairman of
the department,'' Kirtz said. ``But I was happy to help out. I
never saw this as a sign of weakness of the university.''
</P>
<P>
   And some officials at the university now believe the campaign to
lure accepted students paid off _ all too well.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has given us an official reason for why this
happened,'' said James Stellar, dean of the college of arts and
sciences. ``But we certainly did things to make ourselves more
attractive this year. That mission may have conflicted with proper
enrollment management.''
</P>
<P>
   The surge of extra students, which includes about 700 additional
transfer students, mainly falls into Stellar's lap. The college of
arts and sciences has 400 more students this year, burdening most
liberal arts departments.
</P>
<P>
   The journalism department, for example, was slated to accept 55
to 60 freshmen. Now, they're expecting 90 to 100 freshmen and 30
transfer students. Last year, the art and architecture department
had 83 freshmen; this year 151 freshmen will join 250 other
students at Northeastern majoring in the subject, making it
difficult for the department's 11 professors to teach and advise
all the students. And communications studies, which had planned on
65 freshmen, is set to take 154 of the incoming students.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem, some professors say, is that the rush to accept
students reduced the quality of the freshman class. James R. Ross,
the acting director of the journalism department, said some of his
freshmen should have never been accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge problem, and I don't think anyone has the
vaguest handle on it,'' he said. ``We have some folks with verbal
SAT scores that will make it very difficult to handle our
journalism curriculum. When I look at the scores, I wonder whether
some of these kids are going to make it. This year is going to be a
pretty serious setback for our department.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, admissions officials say, the average SAT score of this
year's freshman class is 1,133, compared to last year's 1,128.
</P>
<P>
   While many upper-echelon colleges experienced an uptick in the
size of their freshman classes this year, the increase usually
amounted to little more than a few percentage points, admissions
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Boston University, which had a target of about 4,000 freshmen,
is expecting 4,100 first-year students; Boston College expects to
exceed its goal of 2,150 students by only about five students;
Tufts University is right on target with 1,200 students; and
Brandeis University should surpass its target of 800 students by
about 65 freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   Although Northeastern officials admit they're scurrying to meet
student needs, they say the situation is under control.
</P>
<P>
   They're hiring more professors and advisers, renting rooms at
Simmons and Emmanuel colleges nearby, building new dormitories, and
beefing up resources to help students find off-campus housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no tents, no hotel rooms, and no sleeping on
couches,'' said Sandra King, director of university relations.

<TEXT>
<P>
   We all have our own private list of the most indelible screen
images in movie history.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's Clark Gable carrying a kicking and screaming Vivien
Leigh up that Atlanta staircase in ``Gone With the Wind'' (l939),
Marlon Brando astride his motorcycle in ``The Wild One'' (l954), or
Humphrey Bogart clicking those steel balls in ``The Caine Mutiny''
(l954).
</P>
<P>
   Most lists would also include that high shot of Gary Cooper
walking alone down a sunbaked street in the revered l952 movie
``High Noon.''
</P>
<P>
   There's something about the spare purity of that black and white
film (produced by Stanley Kramer, directed by Fred Zinneman and
written by Carl Foreman) that rendered it less a Western than a
story of commitment transcending time and genre: the upright
sheriff torn between love and duty.
</P>
<P>
   So why would anyone want to mess with it? Why remake it in color
as TBS (who will air the movie on Aug. 20) has done?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not,'' Australian director Rod Hardy quickly snaps back.
Then, more seriously, he admits it was a question he himself
wrestled with.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the project was brought to me I checked with a number of
people, under age 30, and discovered that almost 95 percent of them
hadn't seen the film,'' he recalls. ``And I thought it was wrong
for us just to leave that film on American Movie Classics or
wherever it turns up. If at least five people who see our picture
want to take the journey back to see the wonderful classic that it
was, then I feel we've done some good.''
</P>
<P>
   Casting was crucial in the original. It included Gary Cooper,
one of Hollywood's greatest actors and screen stars, as Sheriff
Will Kane, Grace Kelly, as Amy Kane, making her film debut _
transcendently lovely, if just a little wooden _ and Katy Jurado
doing her one-note Mexican firebrand act as Helen Ramirez. The 84
minute film would be difficult to erase from the memory of anyone
who saw it.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy selected craggy Tom Skerritt (``Picket Fences'') for the
Cooper slot, blonde and beautiful Susanna Thompson (``Once And
Again'') to fit into the Grace Kelly bridal gown, and Maria
Conchita Alonso for Jurado's spirited Helen Ramirez, the woman who
loved and lost the sheriff and thinks his new bride is a wuss. Reed
Diamond, who played the troubled Mike Kellerman on ``Homicide: Life
on The Street,'' is Harvey Pell, the unready deputy sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   With his cast assembled, with screenwriter T.S Cook fine-tuning
Foreman's original screenplay, Hardy made a crucial decision: not
to alter the story in any appreciable way but to modernize it by
emphasis rather than by jarring concessions to the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The two women _ the new Quaker wife and the fiery Latin lover _
were symbols rather than characters in the original. As befits a
21st century version, we learn more about them than simply that
they both love the same man.
</P>
<P>
   Alonso's Ramirez, in particular, is far from the Latin
stereotype of the Jurado original. She's a successful, hardheaded
career woman who lives by her own rules, likes the action in this
little frontier town and hasn't given up on corralling the sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's Amy Kane is an older, wiser bride than Grace Kelly's
version. She has waited for the right man to come along, but now
that she has him, it looks as if she is prepared to give him up
without a fight. However, the character has been given some
background that explains her revulsion for conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women were treated in a whole lot different way then than they
are today,'' Hardy explains. ``So we adjusted the female roles. We
didn't give them that many more scenes _ we just tilted the scenes
a little more towards them.''
</P>
<P>
   The two women have a scene that was not in the original movie:
Amy confronts Helen in her hotel room as they both prepare to leave
town on the noon train, to find out which of them Will Kane really
loves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of my favorite scenes in the picture,'' Rod Hardy
says. ``It lifts the female characters up without disrespecting the
original era in which it was set.''
</P>
<P>
   The original movie was shot in black and white on a Burbank
studio back lot. ``One of the reasons why the first movie had a
particular look to it,'' Hardy explains, ``was that they were
forever trying to get rid of the palm trees and get the studio
buildings out of the shot. It created a sense of low angles, which
was just fabulous for the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we used the Rocky Mountains near Calgary, Canada, as a
backdrop. Our camera could go 360 degrees to capture it all, so
there's much more a sense of open air and open space.''
</P>
<P>
   A big feature of the original was the ``real time'' of the
action. Sheriff Kane had 85 minutes to gather help in the gun fight
with Frank Miller, the man he sent to prison and who was coming to
town at noon to kill him. The sense of time running out was created
for the original in the editing process after the film was
finished.
</P>
<P>
   In the new picture, Hardy shot the clock countdown as he went
along. ``If anything, we were able to take advantage of our modern
day filmmaking techniques and give it more of an edge,'' he says,
``which I hope adds to the drama of the enemy's arrival. I think
it's a terrific moment in the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Old version vs. new one _ so who wins?
</P>
<P>
   Tom Skerritt insists, ``We're not trying to replace it. But Rod
Hardy played it like you'd play a good poker hand. You're dealt the
cards, you play with those cards as best you can. I think he came
up with a winning hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Madsen's villain, Miller, unfortunately looks more as if
he belongs in an episode of ``The Sopranos'' than in the dust of
the old west.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any of us had a prayer of trying to make this
film anywhere as good as the original,'' he said, adding, ``I saw
it when I was a kid. It's one of those movies that a generation of
people will never forget. Now we're bringing it to a new generation
who never saw the first one.''
</P>
<P>
   But Maria Conchita Alonso says she prefers the new film. ``I
rented the original. You know, I wasn't so crazy about it. I loved
the story and all the actors were good for that time. But our movie
has a quicker pace, our characters show a wider range of emotion.
We live in a time where our pace is faster, faster, faster and
that's what we want to see in movies today.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough, but what is glaringly absent is the haunting music
from the original: remember Tex Ritter's ``Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My
Darlin'''? The producers argue that in the l952 film the theme was
used to keep the love story element alive. If they had gone with
that theme in the new film they would have been criticized for
staying too close to the original.
</P>
<P>
   But that song spells ``High Noon'' to a whole generation. How it
will be missed!

 (World rights. Includes B&AMP;W photo and color slide of the 2000
Mercedes-Benz ML55.) 
 By STEVE SMITH 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Assuming anyone is asking, ``Why doesn't someone build a sport
utility vehicle that goes 145 mph and accelerates from 0 mph to 60
mph in less than seven seconds,'' Mercedes-Benz would like to
present the ML55, which does all the above, despite weighing nearly
5,000 pounds, about as much as two Toyota Corollas.
 &HT;    Judging from the early sales success of the limited-edition
ML55, apparently Mercedes has found a market in discriminating
consumers who can afford the $65,545 price tag and don't mind the
EPA fuel mileage rating of 14 mpg in the city, 17 mpg on the
highway, and the requirement of premium fuel.
 &HT;    The ML55 is the highest-performing sport utility available, at
least until Porsche's SUV goes on sale. (It will be called the
Cayenne _ as in pepper _ but it is still well over a year off.)
 &HT;    The ML55 is a much-modified version of the more mainstream
M-Class, the Alabama-built Mercedes SUVs that has found favor more
with carpoolers than serious off-roaders.
 &HT;    Both the entry-level ML320 and the more powerful ML430 work
reasonably well in the dirt, but the ML55 is much more a
pavement-specific vehicle. It lacks the ML430's ground clearance to
climb over ruts and roots, and lacks tires that have a tread
pattern that can get traction in the dirt. The ML55's
steamroller-sized radial tires are excellent on dry pavement, but
would spin hopelessly in the mud.
 &HT;    The ML55 is basically an ML430 that has been customized by AMG,
an in-house Mercedes performance company that, for years, has been
taking mainstream Mercedes automobiles and making them go faster,
handle better (and, inevitably, cost more).
 &HT;    While the ML430 has a 4.3-liter, 268-horsepower V-8, the ML55
gets a 5.5-liter, 342-horsepower V-8, essentially an enlarged
version of the Mercedes SL500 sedan's 5.0-liter engine.
 &HT;    You can tell the ML55 from an ML320 or ML430 by the 55's bright
Xenonheadlights, wider fender flares, different fog lights and
bumpers, and brake calipers that are painted bright red. The ML55
also sits nearly 1 inch lower to the ground than the ML320 and
ML430.
 &HT;    Inside, soft AMG-applied charcoal leather is everywhere _
covering the supportive sport seats, door trim, armrest, console,
shift knob and part of the steering wheel. Burl walnut trim is used
on the rest of the steering wheel and on the door panels and
instrument panel. There's a seven-speaker, 150-watt Bose sound
system.
 &HT;    While Mercedes offers no factory options on the ML55, there are
dealer-installed options to chose from, ranging from molded front
and rear mudflaps to an integrated Motorola telephone. A glass
sunroof is standard, as is a satellite-linked navigation system.
 &HT;    The central differences between the ML55 and its comparatively
plebeian cousins lie beneath the skin. Besides the gutsier engine,
the ML55 gets a retuned, more responsive five-speed automatic
transmission that maximizes the engine's output. The suspension,
while not much different in design, is firmer, giving enhanced
cornering ability, but a mildly harsher ride. The brakes are more
powerful.
 &HT;    All the M-class models have full-time four-wheel-drive, with a
traction control system that senses when a tire loses traction and
starts spinning, then automatically increases power to the tires
that are getting traction.
 &HT;    There's also Brake Assist, which detects when the driver is
making a panic stop, and applies full braking power more quickly
than the driver can.
 &HT;    And there's the Electronic Stability Program, which detects when
the car is about to skid to one side, and automatically applies
brakes to one or more wheels to bring the vehicle back in line.
 &HT;    These features mean more on the ML55 than on the other two
models, because it has so much power and is capable of such high
speeds.
 &HT;    It remains, however, a truck. It has a full trucklike frame and
a tall, heavy body, giving it a high center of gravity. That means
that no matter how much Mercedes or the ML55's owner wants it to be
a sports car, it isn't. If you drive it like a Porsche, making no
allowances for its extra bulk and height, eventually you'll get
into trouble, no matter how many electronic gadgets are working to
prevent it.
 &HT;    That said, the ML55 makes for a pretty amazing sport utility.
The interior is world-class, the throaty exhaust note is
invigorating and the acceleration is startling, though it does seem
to take a while to get it going from a standing start _ up to about
30 mph, it feels no faster than an ML430. Handling is excellent,
given its inherent limitations, and the ride, while rougher than
most SUVs, is tolerable on all but the roughest roads.
 &HT;    Still, the ML55 costs about $21,000 more than an ML430, which is
a fairly good performer in its own right. Besides the extra money,
you're trading the ML430's passable off-road capability for the
ML55's greater on-road performance, and I'm not sure I'd want to do
that _ I like the option of off-roading once in a while.
 &HT;    But Mercedes and AMG didn't build the ML55 for me. They built it
for the consumer who must have the latest, greatest, ultimate SUV _
and that's the ML55 in a nutshell.
 &HT;

&HT;     PICKING THE TOOLS CAN MAKE OR BREAK THE KITCHEN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RUTH FANTASIA  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ ``Dishwasher safe'' are perhaps the two most
important words when buying kitchen tools. After that, you're on
your own.
</P>
<P>
   With knives and pots and pans, the advice has long been ``buy
the best you can afford.'' Better quality knives hold an edge
longer, are easier to sharpen and are less tiring to use because
they are more comfortable in your hand. Professional-style pots and
pans are heavier duty, more forgiving of fluctuations in burner
temperatures and have more secure handles than less expensive or
discount store cookware.
</P>
<P>
   But what about those little tools that receive almost constant
use in the kitchen? Which ones should you pick up for a couple of
dollars at the discount store and when should you plop down big
bucks at one of the gourmet kitchen stores?
</P>
<P>
   We found that price and brand names aren't nearly as important
as how you cook.
</P>
<P>
   Basting brushes: How do you normally use a basting brush? If
you're going to be slathering sauce on chicken parts, buy a round
brush to reach inside the creases on the meat's surface. For
brushing pastry layers or loaves of bread with melted utter, a flat
brush will be easier to use. If you're going to use it over hot
coals or have to reach inside an oven, look for one with a long
handle, which usually costs a little more than a short-handled
brush. Natural boar bristles are more expensive than their
synthetic counterparts and generally don't perform significantly
better.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, consider how you're going to clean the brush. If you're
going to throw it in the dishwasher with the flatware, a plastic
handle will generally hold up better than either finished or
unfinished wood. One thing to avoid: metal bands that attach the
bristles to the handle. They're prone to rust.
</P>
<P>
   Round, long-handled, boar-bristle brush: $8 at Williams-Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   OXO Good Grips 1 1/2-inch wide plastic and synthetic brush:
$4.50 at Bed Bath and Beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Manual can openers: If you're going to fork out the big bucks
for anything, make it this item. Nothing is more uncomfortable than
trying to open a can of coffee with a flimsy hunk of stainless
steel with a knob attached. Those with hard plastic, squarish
handles are better but for a few dollars more you can get a large
handled, softly padded job that rolls the can through smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   OXO Good Grips manual can opener: $10 at William-Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Measuring spoons: The first thing to know about buying measuring
spoons (and cups) is that they tend to take a lot of abuse banging
around in kitchen drawers. The second thing to know is when they
are dented, they are no longer accurate. You have several options:
Buy a thin, cheap set and replace as needed; buy an expensive set
that's heavy-duty enough to withstand the junk drawer; or buy a set
that is mid-range in price in both price and weight.
</P>
<P>
   Ekco 4-piece set: $1.76 at Wal-Mart
</P>
<P>
   Oneida 4-piece set: $6.19 at Bed Bath &AMP; Beyond
</P>
<P>
   5-piece set: $9 Williams-Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Pastry blenders: Price and brand name are of no consequence.
Look for a blender with a few heavy-duty blades instead of one with
a slew of wires. We found out in a hurry that the wired models
(which are widely available) can't cut butter. The wide blade
model, on the other hand, took on chilled shortening and cold
butter without a problem.
</P>
<P>
   OXO Good Grips pastry blender: $6.99 at Bed Bath &AMP; Beyond
</P>
<P>
   Cooks Club Perfect Grip blender: $5.99 at Lechters.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Rubber spatulas: Once almost guaranteed to turn orange if left
in the same room with spaghetti sauce or melt at the mere hint of
heat, the spatula has evolved in recent years to a high-tech
marvel. Now most are heat resistant and some even come with a
non-stain warranty. While the pricier ones have all the options
(even colors), some are too heavy to use comfortably. Look for a
spatula that turns in your hand comfortably, yet is sturdy enough
to push around thick batters.
</P>
<P>
   Large stain-free, heat resistant spatula from iSi (via
Internet): $7.99
</P>
<P>
   Pyrex heat resistant spatula: $1.44 at Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable peelers: Considering there is virtually no way to
sharpen a vegetable peeler, find the kind that's the most
comfortable for you to use. You'll just have to replace it when the
blade has dulled. There are various types to choose from, including
comfortable large-handled models, shiny non-rusting aluminum ones
and the old reliable one like Mom used.
</P>
<P>
   Heuck vegetable peeler: $1.24 at Wal-Mart
</P>
<P>
   Aluminum vegetable peeler: $10 at Williams-Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Wooden spoons: Astonishing as it may seem, there are reasons why
someone would spend $9-$11 on a single wooden spoon. First, the
more expensive spoons are made from tightly-grained woods that
don't stain as easily (and become unattractive) as your average
maple spoon. Also, the various woods come in interesting colors so
people with kitchens that are so small they're forced to display
their utensils in crocks on the counter have nice things to look
at.
</P>
<P>
   Boxwood spoon (14-inch): $11 at Williams Sonoma
</P>
<P>
   Set of three wooden spoons by Ekco: $1.44 at Wal-Mart.

 By BOB SIKORSKY 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Here are two letters on the same topic:
 &HT;    Dear Bob: Can you tell me the correct way to rotate tires,
including the full-size spare _ in other words, a five-tire
rotation. I've received conflicting advice from mechanics and tire
dealerships. Is there a preferred method? Gus Meredian, Kansas
City, Mo.
 &HT;    Dear Bob: Thought you might be interested in the enclosed AAA
recommendation and diagram for rotating tires using the spare in
the rotation. Marvin Landstein, Wantagh, N.Y.
 &HT;    A. There is a preferred way to rotate five tires (the spare must
be a full size tire and not the funny, donut space-saver spare) and
both AAA and the Tire Industry Safety council concur on how it
should be done.
 &HT;    Perhaps the reason you have received conflicting advice on
rotation patterns is that there are two ways to rotate the five
tires depending on whether your car is front-wheel drive or
rear-wheel/four-wheel drive.
 &HT;    For front-wheel drive vehicles rotate as follows:
 &HT;    The spare goes to the right rear, right rear to left front, left
front to left rear, left rear to right front and right front, you
guessed it, goes to being the spare.
 &HT;    Now for rear- and four-wheel drive vehicles:
 &HT;    The spare goes to the right rear, right rear to right front,
right front to left rear, left rear to left front and left front
becomes the spare.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Dear Bob: I have a 1999 Toyota Corolla. When I drive it between
70 mph and 75 mph, my steering wheel shimmies. Is there anything
that you know of that could be causing the problem. The tires have
been balanced. Vincent Lofaro, Hicksville, N.Y.
 &HT;    A. Steering wheel shimmy or shake is usually caused by wheels
being out of balance. While there are other causes, such as bad
struts and other front end parts, I doubt if these are at fault
because your car is practically new. These parts should be in good
condition.
 &HT;    Even though you've had the tires balanced, the job may not have
been done correctly. I'd have them rebalanced, perhaps even
requesting that the tires first be static balanced (using a bubble
balancer). After this is done, have them dynamically balanced while
the wheels are on the car.
 &HT;    This checks-and-balances routine may just pick up and correct
the slight out-of-balance characteristics in one or both front
tires that is causing the steering wheel to shimmy.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Dear Bob: I have a 1998 Grand Marquis GS that seems to be a
hard-road car. I can feel the manholes in the street and on rough
roads it rocks and rolls. I had a 1990 Grand Marquis LS that was a
pleasure on the road and straightened out the bumps.
 &HT;    Is there anyway I can get the car to ride more smoothly? Anthony
Graziano, Manorville, N.Y.
 &HT;    A. Those manholes can be rough, especially if they don't have a
cover on them.
 &HT;    The 1998 Mercury Marquis received a major redesign, including
the suspension. The Watt's linkage rear suspension is meant to give
the car improved directional control. In layman's terms this means
the vehicle won't sway or dip under hard cornering or in severe
cross winds. Simply stated, the vehicle has a much stiffer
suspension than previous years' models.
 &HT;    Additionally, the front suspension was revised, supposedly to
make the Grand Marquis handle better (read: stiffer suspension up
front to give more steering precision), so you have a recipe for a
firmer riding car than your 1990 Marquis.
 &HT;    Also, your older model was the top-of-the-line LS or Luxury
edition and your new Marquis is the GS entry-level model, so you
have the ingredients for a firmer ride and more taut handling. And,
on top of this, your present car may have a handling package, which
would make the whole vehicle much more road and driver sensitive.
 &HT;    So what can you do? Well for starters you could try a different
set of tires. You probably have ``handling'' tires now, which
provide for a much firmer ride. A switch to luxury or soft-ride
tires may help.
 &HT;    Softer shocks and or struts will also help. And if your vehicle
has a rear air suspension system, the shock and spring rates could
be recalibrated to provide a softer ride.
 &HT;    As you see, there is no easy _ or inexpensive _ answer.

 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ One major flaw for many young workers is that
they don't pay enough attention to detail. Those coming from
college are used to doing a term paper or a thesis or studying for
an exam. The day-to-day activities are just little things.
</P>
<P>
   In the working world, though, the day-to-day activities are
everything. If you don't handle them well, you won't be assigned
any big projects.
</P>
<P>
   But you can also be done in by perfectionism. Older workers in
particular have to watch out for this, because many started their
careers in the pre-computer era, when companies had larger work
forces than they do today. There is more competition from more
directions, and speed has become more critical. Having a good
solution today might be more crucial than having a better one a
month from now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your father would rather be right than president,'' my mother
used to say. It wasn't always said with the deepest of admiration.
</P>
<P>
   So how do you balance the yin and the yang, and make sure you
don't get yanked into the unemployment office? Here are three
things that will help:
</P>
<P>
   _ Get into the habit of doing it right.
</P>
<P>
   We all make mistakes when we're facing a tight deadline, but
most jobs have a few lulls when you can catch your breath. Use
those times to develop good habits.
</P>
<P>
   Can you organize your desk so you don't waste time hunting for
things? Are there computer shortcuts you can create to ease
repetitive tasks? Can you hunt for better job-related resources,
from mentors to reference books?
</P>
<P>
   Think about what seems to be slowing you down. If you're a slow
writer, for example, practice a few speed-writing exercises _ or
think about ways you can avoid writing, such as by relying more on
graphics or oral presentations.
</P>
<P>
   This is the time when you can be a perfectionist. Look back at a
project you did a year ago and think about how you could have done
it better. Can that insight help you with your next project?
</P>
<P>
   _ Look at your whole workload.
</P>
<P>
   Take a moment to consider all the tasks you are expected to do
and how many hours per week you are supposed to work. Are you
allocating enough time for the most important tasks?
</P>
<P>
   Those who feel overwhelmed sometimes devote too much time to
relatively unimportant tasks. Do you really have to read your
e-mails as soon as they come in, or could you check them once or
twice a day? If you're deep in concentration, do you really need to
stop and answer that phone? Are there any tasks you could be doing
while you're commuting, such as reading reports or making phone
calls?
</P>
<P>
   (We're talking about commuters who can do those things safely,
of course, not those who are trying to prove that Charles Darwin
was right.)
</P>
<P>
   Unless you're a union leader or feel you're being treated
unfairly, don't complain about the size of your workload. Everyone
has to do more work. Bosses might not spell it out for you, but
that often means you will have to cut corners. What tasks can you
skip or gloss over that will do the least harm?
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean you can't make constructive suggestions to
your boss, such as reducing the number of staff meetings, but don't
harp on them. Many workers get two hours of extra work, then spend
three hours complaining about them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make a good last impression.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly first impressions are crucial, but you also want to
give people a happy ending, especially if things have been rushed
or unpleasant.
</P>
<P>
   If you get bad service at a restaurant, you may never return.
But if the maitre d' notices the sloppy service and offers you a
free dessert or bottle of wine, you will be a lot more forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Don't underestimate the value of a sincere apology. If you make
a mistake or say something you regret, tell the people involved
that you're sorry, and do it quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody with half a brain knows that things in most jobs are
more hectic than they used to be, but if you can end your
interaction on an upbeat note, people will have faith in you. Many
a newspaper columnist has salvaged a mediocre column by tacking on
a funny or charming or insightful ending.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure I'll come up with one a year from now.
</P>
<P>

   GERMAN START-UP STORY, WITH A ROMANTIC TWIST
</P>
<P>
   ECOM-GERMAN-INTERNET-START-UP _ Torsten Schmale and Christian
Wessel started Inubit, their Berlin-based business-to-business
software and services company, in December after their respective
girlfriends decided that they had had enough of listening to them
complain about their jobs. The women, who work together at another
company, persuaded Dr. Schmale, a software developer for Siemens,
and Wessel, a consultant with Roland Berger &AMP; Partners, a
management consulting firm, to meet. They did, and quickly hit upon
an idea for a technology platform that would enable
business-to-business marketplaces. Here, a report on their work _
and the wave of business-to-business start-ups in Germany. By Sally

 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   BERLIN _ Torsten Schmale and Christian Wessel started Inubit,
their Berlin-based business-to-business software and services
company, in December after their respective girlfriends decided
that they had had enough of listening to them complain about their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The women, who work together at another company, persuaded Dr.
Schmale, who was bored with his job as a software developer for
Siemens, and Wessel, who was sick of his job as a consultant with
Roland Berger &AMP; Partners, a management consulting firm, to meet.
They did, and quickly hit upon an idea for a technology platform
that would enable business-to-business marketplaces. In doing so,
they joined a wave of business-to-business start-ups in Germany.
(After the business idea was hatched, the couples got married.)
</P>
<P>
   The beginnings of Germany's Internet start-up revolution can be
traced to June 1999, when eBay purchased Alando.de, a German online
auction company, for $43 million. Since then, the start-up scene
has accelerated, causing investor interest to shift from businesses
selling to consumers to those servicing other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The emerging business-to-business climate is healthy and likely
to continue growing. Indeed, Forrester Research, a market research
firm in Cambridge, Mass., predicts that by 2004, Germany will lead
Europe with 26 percent of all e-commerce activity, followed by
Britain, with 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The business-to-business landscape in Germany, however, will
look different from its early-stage counterpart in the United
States. A crucial difference is that in Germany, corporate players
are recognizing the importance of the business-to-business market
almost in tandem with start-ups. DaimlerChrysler, Bayer, Volkswagen
and Siemens are creating e-commerce marketplaces to procure goods
or have plans to do so, and both SAP and Intershop Communications
are also interested in expanding into such commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big companies were faster in realizing the potential of
business-to-business e-commerce in Germany than in the U.S.,'' said
Reinhard Edelmann, an investment manager with Technologieholding, a
Berlin venture-capital firm.
</P>
<P>
   One result, said Thorsten Wichmann, the chief executive of
Berlecon Research, a research and analysis firm also in Berlin, is
that ``niche markets are where start-ups are coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Inubit is focusing on European niche markets, along with other
start-ups, including Newtron.de, Surplex.de and Portum.de. (The
``de'' stands for Deutschland.) Inubit has built a
business-to-business technology platform and is planning to join
with established companies to create industry-specific
marketplaces. So far, Inubit has one partner, the Floramedia Group,
a horticulture company with a pan-European presence.
</P>
<P>
   Even if big companies are quicker on the draw in Germany, enough
business-to-business start-ups have taken root in the last six
months to spawn more than 100 online marketplaces, according to
Berlecon's research.
</P>
<P>
   Inubit, as is typical for a German business-to-business company,
is fashioning itself as a European company _ one that needs to
adapt to multiple countries, cultures and languages from the
get-go.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at the European market, which is like the
worldwide market. From an organizational perspective, it's the
same,'' Wessel explained. ``If you're a B-to-B start-up in Germany,
it doesn't make sense to stay in the German market. We programmed
our technology so that if someone comes in and says he's from
Spain, he gets Spanish content.''
</P>
<P>
   This approach, according to Edelmann, of Technologieholding, is
what distinguishes European e-commerce ventures from American ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're used to dealing with other cultures,'' he said, ``and
Americans are not.''
</P>
<P>
   Many American companies add multiple language abilities to their
technology only after they stake a claim in the United States
market, Edelmann said, rather than integrating them from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Multiple languages are just the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The European market is not homogenous like the U.S. market,''
said Patrick Sheehan, the managing director for the United States
division of 3i Group, a venture capital firm in London. ``There are
quite different market conditions in each country.''
</P>
<P>
   European companies have to take into account the different
business processes, tax systems, cultures, market structures, labor
laws and governments from country to country.
</P>
<P>
   ``To address your market, you have to have a whole different set
of business approaches,'' Wessel said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the level of technological adoption _ which varies widely
from southern to northern Europe _ is an issue: A European
technology company must have different strategies for, say, wired
Sweden and analog Spain.

<P>
   Congress will soon begin debating the need for legislation to
protect consumer privacy on the Internet. The chances of such
legislation passing quickly are small, given that the issues are
complicated, the economic and political stakes are high and the
technology is changing constantly.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, though, there are many steps that consumers can
take to protect themselves. Many of these measures will prove
useful to Internet shoppers even if consumer-privacy laws become a
reality.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the use of ``cookies,'' which are pieces of computer
code dropped from Web sites onto users' hard drives. Cookies
collect information about sites visited, purchases made and
passwords created, as well as any personal information disclosed
during a Web-site visit.
</P>
<P>
   Cookies are not always bad. Benign ones make Web sites run
efficiently and help operate features such as online shopping
carts.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the recent brouhaha over privacy springs from a new
capability to correlate previously anonymous information with
people's e-mail and street addresses, which are sometimes reused or
even sold to third parties.
</P>
<P>
   This sharing can simply result in unwanted e-mail messages or
junk mail. But more disturbing is the possible disclosure of
sensitive information.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible to browse without surveillance? No, not
completely _ but it is possible to move about the Internet in
stealth mode. Some methods are in the hands of Web users
themselves, others in the growing number of companies that sell
privacy as part of their packages.
</P>
<P>
   While Anonymizer.com was one of the earliest, there are now
literally hundreds of so-called remailers. These intermediaries
will remove all revealing information, such as your name or e-mail
address, from your e-mail messages before sending them on to their
destinations.
</P>
<P>
   The Electronic Privacy Information Center, at www.epic.org,
maintains a list of reliable remailers, nd if you follow the links
on its Web site to ``privacy tools,'' it offers tips. There are
also encryption programs such as Zero-Knowledge Systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Infomediaries'' such as Enonymous and PrivaSeek act on behalf
of consumers, collecting personal information and providing to Web
sites only what the users allow.
</P>
<P>
   A new infomediary company, Youknowbest.com, is coming online
this summer. The company, based in Celebration, Fla., is expected
to work as if it were a combination consumer reporter, personal
shopper and guard dog. It will enable consumers to create private
profiles at the youknowbest.com Web site and to use the site to
solicit information _ from price to service records, from color to
safety _ for thousands of products. At the same time, the consumers
can review how youknowbest.com and other customers rank merchants
on adherence to privacy and security standards.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the various computer programs and Web-based
businesses that protect privacy, you can help safeguard it
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important ways is to disclose as little personal
information as possible, says Jason Catlett, president of
Junkbusters.com, a company that works with other businesses to
develop what he calls consensual approaches to marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't give your identity online or, at the very least,
minimize the sites at which you register,'' he says. ``Under United
States law, there is almost no protection for data, and the
consumer has no recourse if information is misused.''
</P>
<P>
   The Junkbusters Web site, at www.junkbusters.com, offers
detailed instructions on how to use your browser to turn off
cookies, to alert you when a cookie is offered or to accept cookies
only from trusted sites. Junkbusters also offers a filter to
dispose of banner ads, which are used in tracking.
</P>
<P>
   For those with fond memories of playing cops and robbers, the
new company Guidescope Inc., at www.guidescope.com, has a product
that allows consumers to ``zap'' advertisements permanently,
thereby disposing of them not only from their own screens but also
from those of other Guidescope users. The banished ad is sent to a
central database that functions like a blacklist. When other
Guidescope users visit the Web source of the offending ad, they
won't see it at all.
</P>
<P>
   Catlett also advises consumers to maintain separate e-mail
accounts: one for personal messages, one for business and one for
ordering information or products. The last is easiest to abandon if
junk e-mail messages become intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   Catlett does not think that the privacy policies posted on many
Web sites are worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are vague and often incomprehensible,'' he says, ``and
always subject to change.''
</P>
<P>
   If you insist on perusing the policies, he adds, watch for seals
from business-monitoring groups that attest to the companies'
adherence to consumer-privacy standards.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Geraghty, the director of marketing at youknowbest.com, says
that caution is essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is the only two-way media that most people
consume,'' Geraghty says, ``and it's very powerful. You buy a TV,
and RCA doesn't know what you watch. You buy the newspaper, and no
one there knows what section you read first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your computer, on the other hand, is telling your secrets
without your knowledge,'' he says. ``Our take is that this is your
information, not theirs.''

&HT;     TALK IS RIPE ABOUT MERGERS IN CALIFORNIA WINE INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JENNY STRASBURG  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A Kendall-Jackson executive has denied reports
that the vintner plans to merge with fellow California heavyweight
Beringer. But nobody is denying that the wine industry is in merger
mode.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no deal with Beringer,'' said Jim Caudill, the
Kendall-Jackson Wine Estates public relations vice president. ``It
is not accurate that one will be announced this week or next.''
</P>
<P>
   Beringer officials declined to comment on talk of a merger with
Kendall-Jackson. That is not to say that Beringer is not shopping
for a partner or two or three.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at our annual report, you will see that we have
talked about acquisitions as being one of our strategies for growth
for a number of years,'' said Mora Cronin, vice president of public
relations and corporate affairs for Beringer.
</P>
<P>
   She would not say how or if Kendall-Jackson would fit into the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Beringer Wine Estates, a publicly traded company based in Napa
County, had 1999 revenue of $376 million, according to the
company's annual report.
</P>
<P>
   Sonoma County-based Kendall-Jackson had 1999 revenue of $308.6
million, according to the privately owned company.
</P>
<P>
   Caudill also said ``it is not accurate'' that Kendall-Jackson is
in talks with Mondavi about merging.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall-Jackson, Beringer and Mondavi, like Sebastiani, Gallo
and Korbel, are among the best-known and top-producing labels with
significant operations in the heart of California's wine country.
</P>
<P>
   As Northern California wineries embark on the harvest and crush,
the market is ripe for mergers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the companies are starting to become more global, and
they're facing global competition,'' said Gladys Horiuchi,
communications manager for the Wine Institute, a nonprofit, San
Francisco-based trade and public policy organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's talk of needing to consolidate in order to become a
global player,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian, European and Asian markets for premium wines are among
the fastest-growing segments for California vintners. The state
already produces nine out of every 10 bottles of American wine sold
internationally, Horiuchi said.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign buyers ``like the cutting-edge, free-spirited
lifestyle'' California evokes, in addition to the quality of its
grapes and the reputation of California cuisine, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But as hundreds of new labels have flooded restaurant menus and
supermarket shelves in the United States, competition has
stiffened.
</P>
<P>
   About 3 percent of Kendall-Jackson's sales are international, a
figure Caudill off-handedly called pitiful compared to the
company's goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to move to 10 percent and beyond,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beringer's international sales in recent years have accounted
for 2 to 4 percent of its totals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say that in the future we'll be looking at exports much
more seriously,'' Cronin said, declining to disclose specific
goals.
</P>
<P>
   As for Kendall-Jackson's search for the right partner, Caudill
said, ``For the last couple of years, it has been widely reported
that we were exploring a lot of options. We continue to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Beringer Wine Estates includes Chateau St. Jean, Chateau
Souverain, Meridian Vineyards, Stags' Leap and St. Clement.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall-Jackson Wine Estates includes the La Crema Estate
Winery, Edmeades Estate Winery, Pepi and Camelot.

 &HT;    Connected McAuliffe keeps Democrats close to the `money men'
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Terry McAuliffe is standing on the stage of the
Staples Center, site of what he habitually calls ``the greatest
convention ever, `` when he takes a call from Mayor Richard
Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe has been itching to talk to Riordan all morning, ever
since he learned that Riordan, a Republican who helped bring the
Democratic convention here, was scheduled to speak at the other
convention in Philadelphia that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick!'' McAuliffe shouts into his cell phone.''I thought you
were endorsing us and going to be a Democrat!''
</P>
<P>
   Pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to start disrupting, throw like marbles out, I want
you to disrupt this thing, Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   Pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, I got great plans here. I think we have a good ticket
here, but get out of Philadelphia and get back here.''
</P>
<P>
   Pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to make theirs look like a kiddie show. We got
everything here. I'm actually in the arena right now. It looks
spectacular!''
</P>
<P>
   Meet Terry McAuliffe, master of the (Democratic) universe, the
uber fund-raiser of American politics. At 43, McAuliffe has perhaps
raised more money for the Democratic Party than anyone, ever _ from
the first $238,000 he raised for President Carter in 1979 at the
age of 21, to the record $26.5 million he raised for Democrats in a
tribute to President Clinton last May.
</P>
<P>
   As one of Clinton's closest friends, McAuliffe has raised the
money for Clinton's legal defense fund, his not-yet-built
presidential library in Arkansas and Clinton's 1996 re-election
effort. By some reckonings, he has helped raise $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   Now, McAuliffe is chairman of the committee responsible for
mounting the Democratic convention, called in by Clinton and Vice
President Gore at the 11th hour to salvage an operation facing
perilous financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   There was an $11 million budget shortfall to cover, messy labor
disputed to solve and the small matter of what to do with 25,000 to
50,000 anticipated demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the really big problems, such as how to allocate
precious convention floor passes to Really Important Members of
Congress, all of whom insisted on more passes than they were
allocated.
</P>
<P>
   With Gov. George W. Bush riding a strong post-convention bounce,
the heat is on McAuliffe and convention organizers to deliver a
strong Democratic convention for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tremendous amount of pressure on us,'' McAuliffe
says. ``We know we have to deliver a convention that works.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to provide energy and excitement for the Gore
campaign,'' he continues. ``He's got to come out of this convention
like a turbo-charged booster rocket.''
</P>
<P>
   The rocket metaphor aptly describes McAuliffe. To spend a day in
Terry's World is to enter a testosterone-filled universe where egos
roam large and connections are the coin of the realm.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe combines the brashness of Jerry McGuire, the fictional
Hollywood sports agent, with the enthusiasm of Mary Poppins.
</P>
<P>
   Terry-speak is the colloquial of the consumate deal maker.
Financial contributors are ``the money guys.'' Greetings include
``Are you pumped?'' or ``Light the candle!'' or ``You're the man.''
</P>
<P>
   Volume is important and attitude is everything. An Irish
Catholic who has made a fortune in real estate and a host of
private ventures _ much of it from contacts established through his
fundraising _ McAuliffe grins a lot and laughs in a deep baritone.
He cajoles. He needles. He jokes. His attention span is short, so
motion is important.
</P>
<P>
   When all else fails, he succeeds because he is best friends with
the most powerful man in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, everyone knows that I talk to the
president every day, everyone knows that I talk to the vice
president and everyone knows that I talk to Hillary,'' McAuliffe
says.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe is the grease that keeps the Democratic Party working.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry is probably one of the most popular people in our
party,'' says Senate minority leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.).
``Because of his energy, because of his loyalty, because of his
incredible organizational skills, because of who is.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent morning, McAuliffe is sitting around a small, round
table in his 42nd floor office overlooking the downtown. Photos
decorate the walls. There is McAuliffe and his wife and three older
children sitting with the Clintons at the millennium party on the
Washington mall; another with McAuliffe standing between Rep.
Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In his in-basket, there is an dire plea for $50,000 to help pay
for a convention party honoring a Democratic member of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), then in the hunt for the vice
presidential pick, has already left an urgent message. McAuliffe
calls Harkin in Iowa. The conversation is off the record.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, McAuliffe grins and whistles through his teeth, ``He
wants it bad.''
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe is then briefed on new plans to allow the
demonstrators space directly across the street from the
convention's entrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been worse,'' convention lawyer Jeff Modisett
tells McAuliffe.
</P>
<P>
   But McAuliffe is staring at Lou Vaion center, McAuliffe takes 30
minutes to see how the hall is coming together. The podium is in
place, but the arena is mostly a jumble of cables, speakers and
sawdust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky!'' McAuliffe shouts to Ricky Kirschner, the convention
producer. ``Come on, pump up. The greatest show ever!''
</P>
<P>
   Out of McAuliffe's ear shot, production director Tom Gorman says
that the last three weeks have been nothing but problems but
credits McAuliffe with providing badly needed leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``He encourages people to get in there and solve it,'' says
Gorman. ``The guy can pick up the phone and get anybody. That
helps.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gore begged McAuliffe to take the chairman's job after
former Colorado Gov. Roy Romer left, McAuliffe knew there were
money problems.
</P>
<P>
   What he didn't know was that the city host committee, charged
with raising the convention money, was short at least $4 million
and he had a week to find $4 million to pay contractors to start
work at Staples.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe and Riordan turned to the city council for a bail out,
cajoling the 15 member body to pony up $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe quickly declared that the money problems were over to
squelch negative stories that he feared would tag the convention a
loser. The claim was part bravado.
</P>
<P>
   While he and Riordan closed the immediate shortfall, the actual
amount they needed to finish the convention kept growing.
</P>
<P>
   The host committee is still short up to $2 million, but
McAuliffe insists the money problems are over. ``In 21 years of
doing this, when I say it's done, it's done,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, spin master James Carville calls to ask
McAuliffe for favor at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a guy get more done,'' Carville says later.
``He doesn't have sticks. He just has carrots. He can just call
people and they send him checks.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Carter was so impressed with McAuliffe that he made him
finance director at the Democratic National Committee. He was 23.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has assembled perhaps the longest Roledex of
``money guys'' of anyone in the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people ask for help,'' says Brian Hardwick, the DNC's
finance director. ``Terry asks for the money. In fundraising you
have to ask for it, but he makes people feel good about it. He
jokes about it. He says, 'oh come on, a man of your stature can do
much more than that,' stuff like that.''
</P>
<P>
   DNC Chairman Ed Rendell says a month before the May gala, which
set the fund-raising record for a single event, McAuliffe assembled
a group of 25 donors to meet Gore.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe introduced everyone to Gore, Rendell says, announcing
that each had contributed twice as much as they had actually
pledged to give.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talked about you in such glowing terms and with jokes and
fun and laughter, that Terry was upping the ante on these people
right in front of their eyes, in front of the vice president of the
United States, and they were loving it!'' says Rendell.
</P>
<P>
   It's two o'clock and McAuliffe has just hit the first snag of
the day. Assistant Jessica Smith informs him that Spago, one of
L.A.'s trendiest restaurants, can't give him a dinner reservation
until too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them you were really famous,'' Smith offers meekly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we'll see if we have any juice,'' McAuliffe says,
instructing Smith to call ``the guy who owns the place.''
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe knows a lot of people in politics, but he is almost
culturally illiterate. He gleefully tells the story of going to the
late Pamela Harriman's house, seeing former Illinois Sen. Paul
Simon, and being introduced to someone else named Paul Simon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say to him, Are you Senator Simon's son?'' he cackles.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe attends more meetings, but he can't stop talking about
the $15 million Republicans raised at two fundraisers in
Philadelphia. ``Shameless,'' he happily tells three reporters who
call.
</P>
<P>
   Then he laughs at his own chutzpah. ``The Republicans are really
going to love that coming from me!'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Good news arrives in the form of McAuliffe's assistant, who
tells him he is on at Spago ``for the whole evening.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear that?'' McAuliffe says. ``We're on for the whole
evening.''
</P>
<P>
   En route to Spago, McAuliffe makes no apologies for the
controversial $1.3 million in cash he put up so the Clintons could
purchase their home in New York, or the fundraising excesses of the
1996 election, which he blames on the DNC not the Clinton-Gore
committee that he chaired.
</P>
<P>
   His only regret about the loan to the Clintons _ subsequently
abandoned after a media backlash -_ was that he nearly forgot to
tell his wife, Dorothy, about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, everybody is with you when you are winning,'' he says,
summing up his friendship with Clinton. ``Your true friends are
with you when the chips are down.''
</P>
<P>
   At Spago, McAuliffe's newest friend is GiGi Bose, a manager of
the restaurant who fawns over McAuliffe and sends out an appetizer
of salmon tartar served in a cracker ice cream cone.
</P>
<P>
   During dinner, McAuliffe spots a Lebanese oilman who he calls a
``billionaire.'' He stops by his table and returns with the news
that the oilman has offered to pick up the dinner tab.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if I was going to have one friend in the world, it
would be this man,'' says the benefactor in accented English,
stopping by the table later.
</P>
<P>
   But McAuliffe still has one more friend to make before the
evening is done: Chris, the waiter, who McAuliffe learns was a Gulf
War veteran.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe urges Chris to call him if he wants to drop by the
convention after it starts. He rises from the table and leads the
group in a round of applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks, Chris,'' McAuliffe says, smiling broadly. ``You're the
next mayor!''

<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Chad Carvin wept during the 1996 U.S. Olympic
Swimming trials. Watching at home on television, on a couch that
held him prisoner, he cried as soon as he saw the first event. Then
he turned off the set for good. His heart, already under a doctor's
care, couldn't take much more.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, at the 2000 trials, Carvin wept again. He had
finished second in the 400-meter freestyle. He would be going to
Sydney to represent the United States in the Summer Olympics. For
any athlete, this would be an emotional moment. For Carvin, it was
transcendent.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Judie, explained it best. ``For us, making the
Olympic team is a luxury,'' she said. ``Four-and-a-half years ago,
all we could think about was whether he would keep living.''
</P>
<P>
   In late 1995, Carvin's roommate at the University of Arizona
returned home to find the star swimmer groggy, semiconscious. In
despair over his chronic fatigue, his sanity strained by the
elusiveness of a diagnosis, Carvin had swallowed a bunch of pills,
hoping to end his own life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately,'' his mother said, ``it's the only thing in his
life that Chad has ever failed at.''
</P>
<P>
   In the hospital two days after the suicide attempt, a vigilant
doctor finally spotted the problem. A virus had infected Carvin's
heart, diminishing its capacity. By the time the disease was
detected, the doctor estimated his heart was pumping at less than
50 percent its normal rate, perhaps as low as 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Carvin had been training like any other
world-class distance swimmer. If he had continued at that pace, the
doctor said he could have killed himself without the pills.
</P>
<P>
   To repair the damage, Carvin had to take mild doses of
medication, plus rest, rest, rest and rest. For 90 days, he had to
demand almost nothing from his body, except that, like a broken
bone, it repair itself. He spent a good part of that time in
Southern California, on his parents' couch in Laguna Hills. Back at
school, he needed a handicapped parking placard for his car.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery period challenged him, almost like swimming. It
warded off depression, which had become as dangerous as his heart
condition. Judie Carvin noticed her son had started looking happy
as soon as he heard the diagnosis, even though doctors could not
say whether the damage to his heart was permanent. They thought he
might never swim again.
</P>
<P>
   But he was relieved just to end the mystery, to understand why
routine workouts left him in agony, why he had become so pale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was crazy,`` Chad told his mother in the hospital.
``I knew something was wrong with me, but I didn't know what it
was. Now, I know it's my heart, and I can fix it.``
</P>
<P>
   After his 90 days of immobilization, Carvin's doctor told him he
could start exercising, take a little bike ride around town. He
rode 24 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Moderation is simply not in Carvin's makeup. But he did
reconcile himself to missing the Games and to the notion his world
would not end. When the swimming started in Atlanta, he didn't turn
off the television in tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to come around and watch the Olympics,'' he said.
``I'd been through therapy and dealt with the emotional feelings. I
knew a lot of the people on the national team. I enjoyed watching
them and watching them chase their dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Carvin knew he would be doing the same in Sydney. He returned to
the pool and re-established himself as a premier distance
freestyler. Then, in 1997, his body failed him again. He developed
a bulging disk in his back. This injury was less frightening than
the heart condition, but perhaps more discouraging. Carvin couldn't
help but wonder if he was cursed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like it was all slipping away from me again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, he didn't attempt suicide. Or at least, he never
publicly admitted to it, and Carvin has been very candid about the
1995 attempt on his life. He is not proud of the episode, but he
believes his survival can be a lesson to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've given speeches about what I've been through, and
everybody gets very emotional,'' he said. ``I wouldn't share my
story if I didn't think it could help other people.''
</P>
<P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's 400-meter final, the crowd seemed especially fond
of Carvin, who qualified for the Olympic team by finishing second
to Klete Keller. Several pockets of spectators chanted Carvin's
name before the race. Everyone seemed to know his story.
</P>
<P>
   His cheering section included Phil Towle, a former
psychotherapist who works with sports figures, including Dick
Vermeil, who coached the St. Louis Rams to a Super Bowl title last
season. Carvin's agent sought out Towle in 1998, and since then,
Towle has tried to help Carvin take it easy on himself.
</P>
<P>
   The swimmer has strong emotions. Some fuel him. Some consume
him. It's the reason he wept in '96 and wept on Wednesday, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't necessarily see it as a bad thing,'' he said, a little
smile forming. ``As long as I'm not crying in the race.''

   Casting is everything when it comes to making these reality TV
shows work. And the Joe Lieberman choice looks like it's really
going to enliven things on the island _ oops, at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Yup, this week it's the Democrats' turn for their national
jamboree in Los Angeles. But despite Al Gore's choice of the Jewish
senator from Connecticut as his running mate, the broadcast
networks are giving the Democrats the same narrow time slots they
gave the Republicans a couple of weeks ago. Of course, all that
could change in a hurry with breaking news.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, ABC again pushes ``Monday Night Football'' to 7:00 p.m.
to allow for a live hour of convention coverage at 10:00 p.m. CBS
will cover the proceedings during ''48 Hours.'' And NBC, well,
they'll catch up on Wednesday. Only PBS is devoting a full evening
to the festivities, beginning at 8.
</P>
<P>
   Cable, meanwhile, picks up the slack big time, with
gavel-to-gavel on C-SPAN and extensive coverage and analysis on
MSNBC, CNN and Fox News. And don't forget Jon Stewart and ``The
Daily Show'' on Comedy Central each night at 11.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's agenda highlights? Speeches by President Clinton and
the Democratic senate candidate in New York ... Hillary somebody.

DRIVING SCHOOL GOES FULL THROTTLE TO TEACH CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Teach your children well . . . .''
</P>
<P>
   That's Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, but this is not what they
had in mind: Strap your teenage daughters into the driver's seat of
a car. Send them squealing through an obstacle course; crunch the
car's anti-lock brake system through a series of chattering stops;
``chase'' another car at 55 miles per hour and try to stop when it
does; or race at 55 toward an ``obstacle'' and, just 50 feet from
it, try to get around it.
</P>
<P>
   But that is just what Charles and Rebecca Ruff of Waterville,
Maine, did with their daughters, and it was among the best and most
important gifts a parent can give a child.
</P>
<P>
   Teach your children well . . . to survive emergency situations
when they are driving.
</P>
<P>
   The Ruff daughters, Sydney, 16, and Sarah, 19, spent a day with
the staff of the Stevens Advanced Driver Training program
(www.skidschool.com) on an abandoned airport runway in Concord,
N.H. Sarah has had her license for four years, Sydney for a week.
Demographically, Sarah is reaching the age when drivers get
confident, even cocky, and do risky things that can get them into
trouble. Drivers Sydney's age tend to be cautious, trying to do
things right, but inexperience is their big threat.
</P>
<P>
   Parents ought to be concerned when we send our children out in a
car. Standard driver training covers the basics, but it simply is
not set up to teach the emergency techniques, the understanding of
a car's capabilities _ and limits _ that an advanced driver
training course can offer.
</P>
<P>
   Sending a teenager out behind the wheel, says Sandy Stevens, the
school's founder, ``is really the first time for us that we put our
children in danger; that we know they're in mortal jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   Think about that. Does your young driver know just how hard you
can safely turn a car to avoid danger? Whether the car he drives
has ABS and, if it does, the proper brake and steering sequence to
use in an emergency? How much distance it takes to stop a car going
50 miles per hour? Do you?
</P>
<P>
   That's where the Stevens program comes in.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all we do,'' Stevens tells a class of young drivers
and a few adults (including Rebecca Ruff) before they hit the
runway. No racing. No high-performance training. Just handling
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   It is training that weaves the intricacies of emergency driving
into a whole safety net over the course of a day.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the ABS.
</P>
<P>
   A training car races down the edge of a runway, one wheel on the
pavement, the other in the grass. At about 55 miles per hour, the
driver slams on the brakes and the car skids to a straight stop.
The students examine the skid marks, which reveal the magic of ABS.
Sensors ``watch'' each wheel for lockup and the beginning of an
uncontrolled skid. The brake is released momentarily on the locking
wheel, and then reapplied. Looking at the staggered marks the tires
made in both grass and pavement, students can see how the brakes at
each wheel were off and on at various times.
</P>
<P>
   That's stopping.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens says that one fear many drivers have in an emergency
situation _ an object or animal in the road, say _ is a fear of
turning so hard they will tip over. The approach: Teach them how
hard you can, in fact, turn a car in one direction, and then,
again, in another. It does you no good, he says, if you turn one
way to avoid something in the road, but continue off the road into
a tree.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the cones come in. The cones form a slalom course.
The challenge is to get through them at increasing speeds, right up
until the tires are squealing.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew MacDonald, a Stevens instructor, takes the Ruff sisters
through the cones a few times. In a run at about 35 miles per hour,
they laugh nervously. You want to begin your turn around a cone
before your bumper reaches it, he tells them. As you make turns
back and forth, your hands should be in constant motion. If they
stop, you are in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney, new to driving, handles the course at speed somewhere in
the high 20s, then edges into the low 30s. She gets the hang of it.
Sarah is a natural, her steering constant and graceful.
</P>
<P>
   Both come away surprised at how fast 35 miles per hour can seem.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see 35 on highway signs all the time,'' says Sydney. ``It
never seemed very fast to me.'' Neither gets the car through the
course at more than 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for the kids to feel they're going too fast,''
adds Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   Next they chase a ``dog.'' That's a cone tied to a rope that
leads from a bumper about two car lengths away. Driving beside the
lead car, bumper even with the ``dog,'' the Ruff sisters reach 50
miles per hour, watching for the lead car's brakelights. When they
go on, they slam their own brakes. Neither stops short of the lead
car and as they slide by, they realize had they been directly
behind, they would have slammed into it. Stevens explains that even
a perfect reaction time would leave the chase car's front bumper
even with the lead car's front bumper.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how close I follow on the highway,'' Sarah Ruff says,
shaking her head.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's time to combine what they have learned.
</P>
<P>
   The trick: a pair of lights forms a ``gate'' on the runway. They
will drive through the gate toward a wall of cones 50 feet away. As
they reach the lights, only one will come on indicating left or
right turn around the obstacle. The goal: drive around the obstacle
(the width of a travel lane), get back into the original lane, and
exit through a pair of cones.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Ruffs go through without braking, reaching speeds in
the 30s. Then they are told to stomp their brakes at the lights,
keep them on, and keep steering around the obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   Before the test they had been asked which should come first:
steering or braking. Sarah said steer, then brake. Sydney said
brake, then steer. Sydney later admitted she guessed right. Sarah
said, ``I though for sure that would just make you skid.''
</P>
<P>
   What they learned is the dynamics of braking and weight. If you
steer first, the weight of your car transfers heavily to the front
wheel on the outside of the turn. Applying the brakes after
steering amplifies this effect and you lose control _ often
tragically if you are in an SUV.
</P>
<P>
   Braking first puts the weight on both front wheels. Now you can
steer with them, even as ABS does its magic. At 55 miles per hour,
the Ruff girls learn how to get out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah says that in driver training she was taught that
emergencies had three solutions: speed up, slow down, turn.
</P>
<P>
   Now they know a car's astounding capabilities and how to use
them in an emergency. And that's more than most adults know.
</P>
<P>
   Teach your children well.

BOXSTER S IS A STEP UP TOWARD HIGHER-END PORSCHES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gershwin would have named it differently.
</P>
<P>
   S'Fast.
</P>
<P>
   S'Powerful.
</P>
<P>
   S'Agile.
</P>
<P>
   S'Boxster.
</P>
<P>
   But Porsche put the ``S'' last: Boxster S, curled it like a
snake on the rear deck, and added other clues that the S is a
different reptile than the basic Boxster, first introduced in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Visual hint: Look for five-spoke wheels, a third large air
intake in the front spoiler, and a centered twin exhaust port at
the rear.
</P>
<P>
   Hands-on fact: When the Boxster debuted it arrived with a
2.5-liter flat-six engine that delivered 201 horsepower. Porsche
billed this as ``affordable'' and managed to deliver on that
promise even while maintaining solid Porsche quality. The only
complaints heard were from those who thought it underpowered.
</P>
<P>
   That's debatable unless you consider any Porsche that's not a
head-snappin' rocket to be underpowered, but Porsche must have
heard enough consumer whining, because this year the basic engine
is a 2.7-liter that cranks out 217 horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   If you want more than that, you've got to move to the Boxster S,
with its 3.2-liter engine and intake manifold from the 911. Now
you're talking 250 horsepower, almost midway in the power range
from the basic Boxster to the standard 911. It's a significant step
up toward that higher-end Porsche line _ a big enough step that
would have me wondering, if I were to buy a Porsche, if the 911
Cabriolet I tested a few weeks ago is tens of thousands of dollars
better than the S. You've got a $7,000 question in deciding between
a Boxster and Boxster S. With the S, you've got a $30,000 question
when you're also ogling the 911 Cabriolet.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Cabriolet has got that little seat in the back where
you can toss stuff and the Boxster does not. But with its engine
tucked right behind the driver, the Boxster ends up with good
luggage/stuff space under both the front and rear decks _ and
that's a great thing in a two-seat roadster.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, room is a great quality of the Boxster. Big
luggage up front, other luggage in the back, flat materials tucked
into a thin but wide shelf behind the seats, you've got storage
space for long trips.
</P>
<P>
   You've also got deep wells on both sides for the feet, so even
tall folks, hunkered down into the firm, supportive seats, have
plenty of legroom. Headroom, because you sit low, is plentiful as
well, and the cabin feels quite wide.
</P>
<P>
   From the driver's seat you peer over a nose that is virtually
the same as a 911 snout (I hear Porsche will be differentiating
them in later models) and that gives you the classic
bulging-fenders-as-guides feel of driving a Porsche.
</P>
<P>
   The three-spoke steering wheel has its third spoke at the
bottom, leaving the top half of the circle open for a clean view of
the scalloped gauges: tachometer at the center with a digital speed
readout at the bottom, an analog speedometer to the left, fuel and
oil gauges to the right. Below, in a packed horizontal line, is an
array of warning lights.
</P>
<P>
   Hands on the wheel, fenders and gauges to guide you, take it for
a spin.
</P>
<P>
   First, you realize that 250 horsepower suits this car just fine.
It's not a car that would run with the 911 at top end, but it's
clear that it is a car that could take you far faster than you
should drive, far faster than you should get there.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly impressive is the torque band between 4,000 and
6,000 rpms. You're already cruising at high speed when you hit four
grand and it wants to just keep on running.
</P>
<P>
   But let's step back and ask what we can do that is both fun and
legal. Sure, you can weave in and out of highway traffic at high
speed in this rig, but that's not what you should do and it's not
why Porsche built it this way.
</P>
<P>
   Take it on a twisting road, one with hills, big curves, quick
curves, decreasing radius curves. Now tell yourself you are in a
hot roadster. Play.
</P>
<P>
   Your suspension can handle it. Independent front and rear,
you've got struts with control arms up front, along with coil
springs and an antiroll bar. In the rear, trailing arms locate the
struts and you've also got coil springs and antiroll bar.
</P>
<P>
   What this means is that even in tight cornering and hard
braking, when you might expect nose-diving, dipping, torsional body
twist, understeer or oversteer, you get none of these.
</P>
<P>
   The Porsche holds as firm as it holds any line on which you run
it. The only thing you'll find tossed side to side or front to back
will be you. So tighten your seat belt and enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Nice Touch:
</P>
<P>
   --The polished aluminum levers, in the driver's door sill, that
open the front and rear lids. They are big, easy to find, and easy
to use.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance:
</P>
<P>
   --The plastic rear window. If it's got to be plastic in order to
be packed into the limited space above the engine, then make it out
of better plastic. This one rumbled in the wind and was already
displaying permanent dimples and crease marks.

<P>
   PARIS _ The momentum of violence, once launched in ethnic or
nationalist movements, is like the forest fires now devastating the
western United States _ hard to contain until they burn themselves
out.
</P>
<P>
   France has begun the most far-reaching effort in years to find a
compromise solution for Corsica's campaign for autonomy, or
independence, while a nationalist leader who favored the dialogue
has been assassinate.
</P>
<P>
   The Basque pro-independence underground ETA has resumed its
campaign of murders, despite having proclaimed a cease-fire.
Northern Ireland seems to be edging its way toward accommodation in
a local government, but the threat of killing is not wholly
overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has just suffered a bloody bomb attack in the center of
Moscow. There is as yet no evidence of who is responsible. But,
just as they did after the still unsolved apartment bombings a year
ago, officials say it must be the doing of Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   At their recent Okinawa meeting, the G-8 world leaders included
international terrorism on their list of serious concerns requiring
concerted action.
</P>
<P>
   Much more frequent and menacing however, in a considerable
number of countries, is the terrorism of domestic organizations
trying to advance some kind of separatist cause.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century, especially in central Europe, nationalist
movements were the expression of liberalism against old imperial
autocracies, a way of asserting peoples' right to speak for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   American President Woodrow Wilson promoted the right of
``self-determination'' as a basic principle for the peace
settlements after World War I, which he had called the ``war to end
wars'' and to save democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But nowadays, in democratic countries, it must be supposed that
resorting to organized murder for such a cause reflects a lack of
majority support. Where there is strong support, democracy can find
other means to deal with the issue, such as the quiet divorce
between the two components of Czechoslovakia, the strong regional
prerogatives in post-Franco Spain or ``devolution'' of some
legislative power in the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   The logic of ``they only understand force'' can be denied, and
the denial becomes a challenge to the habits, the assumptions, the
sense of powerful identity developed by militants as their reason
for existence.
</P>
<P>
   They give it up with great reluctance because clandestine
semi-warfare has become their way of life. Their demand for
independence can become less of a goal than an excuse to go on
fighting regardless.
</P>
<P>
   Peace, for all its golden halo, can become a threat to their
view of themselves and their aspirations, and therefore be
resisted, though necessarily with the argument that anything less
than triumph is betrayal of the cause.
</P>
<P>
   This is true of many people in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,
minorities but adamant ones, whose fight is not a civil war in the
sense that they already see themselves as absolutely separate. It
is, however, a civil war in the sense that they want to live in the
same land.
</P>
<P>
   The question becomes the relative priority of principles, how
much of other cherished expectations is peace worth? It can devolve
into a conflict of abstractions, even of semantics, so that the
real issues of life, and death, are obscured by apparent heroics.
</P>
<P>
   The French Socialist government's plan for Corsica has been
publicly opposed by its Minister of Interior, Jean-Pierre
Chevenement, who argues that his staunch belief in the meaning of
the French republic was proclaimed ``one and indivisible'' after an
argument between centralists (Jacobins) and regionalists
(Girondins.)
</P>
<P>
   This is now being taken by some as an argument to preclude any
kind of regional differentiation, or federalistic tendency, not
only on the national scene but by extension to a federalist
organization of European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the pledge of allegiance to the United States flag says it
represents ``one nation, indivisible,'' but certainly it does not
for a moment cast doubt on federalism as the country's basic
structure. It was written in 1892, well after the American Civil
War, of course, and later endorsed by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Just what ``indivisible'' means in terms of a living, evolving
society seeking basic unity is necessarily open to interpretation
by the politics of the time and place.
</P>
<P>
   The long traditional strain between central and regional has
been exacerbated in Europe by the new superior layer of authority
establishing itself, the European Union, and one day perhaps,
though surely not soon, the United Nations may even be recognized
as the ultimate center of law.
</P>
<P>
   The argument will go on. But the very fact that the debate is
more open than ever, legitimized as in France for example by
dialogue, makes the use of violence on its behalf worse than
criminal; it is, in effect, irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   It becomes violence for no more than for its own sake, and that
must be recognized. &QL;

&HT;     COURT CLEARS WAY FOR LESBIAN HARASSMENT SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BOB EGELKO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A lesbian teacher who said she had been harassed
and denied a promotion by her Southern California school district
because of her sexual orientation will get her day in court.
</P>
<P>
   The state Supreme Court unanimously denied review Wednesday of a
lower-court ruling reinstating a suit by Dawn Murray, an
award-winning biology teacher, against the Oceanside Unified School
District in San Diego County.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate ruling said the state law that has prohibited job
discrimination against homosexuals and lesbians since 1992 also
prohibited workplace harassment based on sexual orientation.
Anti-harassment protection was made explicit by a new law that took
effect this year, but the court said the former law also banned
harassment as a type of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, hired in 1983, said in her suit that she had been
subjected to insults, sexually suggestive remarks and
rumor-mongering by fellow employees, starting in September 1993.
When she complained to an administrator, she said, she was told she
would face discipline if she pressed the issue.
</P>
<P>
   She said administrators had brushed off her complaints about
obscene graffiti painted outside her classroom three times between
December 1994 and February 1996. She said her lesbianism, which
wasn't known to all her colleagues, had been disclosed at a 1995
teachers' meeting by an administrator, who ignored expressions of
hostility from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Murray also said the district had discriminated against her by
failing to promote her to student activities director in 1993,
failing to give proper recognition to a statewide teaching award
she had received in 1995, and unfairly canceling a class and
disciplining her based on unfounded complaints by a parent and a
fellow teacher.
</P>
<P>
   A San Diego Superior Court judge dismissed all of the suit
except the complaint about the promotion, saying the
anti-discrimination law then in effect did not cover harassment.
The 4th District Court of Appeal disagreed this April, ruling that
harassment so severe that it caused an ``abusive working
environment'' was a form of discrimination, whether based on sex,
race or sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Murray now works for a teachers' union but is scheduled to
return to Oceanside High School in the fall, according to her
lawyer, Myron Quon of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hoped the ruling would prompt the district to settle
the case. District lawyer Daniel Shinoff declined to comment.

   BEETHOVEN (Undated) _ What can possibly be left to say about
Beethoven at this late date? A great deal, it must be hoped, for
the Bard Music Festival is devoting the next two weekends and a
third in November to the composer, and these are truly talkative
affairs. It used to be, a quarter-century ago, that you had a
biography (the classic ``Thayer's Life of Beethoven,'' perhaps, as
revised and edited by Elliot Forbes) and an LP set of the
symphonies and you thought you had a fix on the composer. Now the
book and CD shelves groan, yet Beethoven seems to grow only more
mysterious and fragmented, both in his personage and in his
meanings for our time. He has, as academics like to say, been
``problematized.'' By James R. Oestreich.

   ELLIS-ISLAND (New York) _ As the first ferry of the morning
pulled away from Liberty Island, I found myself nearly alone on

boarded with me in the Battery, clutching tickets allowing them to
ascend into the statue's crown. Instead of an admission card, I was
holding photocopies of some postcards, written in Yiddish and dated
in the spring of 1912. I was bound for the next stop, Ellis Island,
and an appointment with an ancestor. He was my paternal
grandfather, my namesake, the link in my lineage between Old World
and New. By Samuel G. Freedman.

&HT;     WEB TERMINALS A WINNER AT BASEBALL PARK 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUSTINO AGUILA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Forget the restroom, or even the food. For some,
a break in the action at a San Francisco Giants game at Pacific
Bell Park means a run for the Web.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case for Ray Tuleya.
</P>
<P>
   Tuleya, 35, is an admitted Seattle Mariners fan. But the day may
come when he transfers his fan loyalties to San Francisco's home
team.
</P>
<P>
   During a Giants game Wednesday against the Milwaukee Brewers,
Tuleya took a break in the bottom of the first inning and headed
for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Since Friday, Giants fans have had limited Internet access at
one of five Web stations at the park, making it the first Major
League Baseball stadium to provide such a service.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco-based Streetspace Inc. installed the space-age
looking computers located on three levels of the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Tuleya was checking his e-mail, it happened: Bill
Mueller hit a home run for the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I missed it,'' said Tuleya, who moved here recently to
teach mathematics at Serra High School in San Mateo. ``I guess
that's all right. There will be more home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, good seats, views and access to the Internet made it a
great first outing at Pacific Bell Park, Tuleya said, adding that
being able to check his e-mail is a perk.
</P>
<P>
   The Web Stations are free, but don't provide full access to the
Internet because the service operates as a closed network powered
by Pacific Bell's high-speed digital subscriber line, or DSL.
</P>
<P>
   Stations allow users to send or receive e-mail, find movie
schedules, make restaurant reservations, look up baseball
statistics, read the day's news headlines and get other types of
information.
</P>
<P>
   Streetspace last year installed similar terminals at cafes and
shops in Berkeley. The company recently installed the sleek little
machines in the ballpark to give people access to e-mail as well as
selected sponsor sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are pretty much living on line these days. If there's a
break in the action or people are just walking around, it's a great
way to keep in touch,'' Michael Wranovics, vice president of
marketing at Streetspace, said recently.
</P>
<P>
   While the service is free to users, they must first register
with Streetspace to access the sites. The baseball team also does
not pay for the devices, which are supported by five sponsors.

ON `TIPPECANOE' AND OTHER SONGS, TOO

  (ART ADV: Photo NYT5 of Aug. 9 has been sent to NYT photo clients.
Nonsubscribers can purchase one-time rights by calling 888-603-1036
or 888-346-9867.) 
 By JAMES BARRON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is about memory: Oscar Brand's, and America's. Brand
remembers how, before soft money and sound bites, before attack ads
and tightly scripted conventions, presidential candidates were
something to sing about. He remembers songs like ``Tippecanoe and
Tyler, Too,'' and before one can interrupt _ Brand, you're only 80,
and that's not old enough for you to know this stuff firsthand _ he
is doing ``Get on the Raft With Taft.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep Cool with Coolidge?'' It was hot when Brand was young: he
was 9 when Coolidge left the White House. But ``Roosevelt the Cry''
did not pass his lips as a child _ that was 1 minute 14 seconds for
Teddy, not Franklin D.
</P>
<P>
   ``These songs were part of the texture of American life,'' he
says. ``I'd learn them without even realizing it.''
</P>
<P>
   But wait. The man who is singing these red-blooded songs about
candidates of yesteryear is a Canadian-American _ born in Winnipeg,
he wrote a tune he says could have become the Canadian national
anthem. ``Something to Sing About,'' it is called. ``Any Canadian
knows the chorus,'' he declares flatly, ``but they said, `We want a
French song,' so that's why `O Canada.'''
</P>
<P>
   So _ our refrain here _ why American campaign songs?
</P>
<P>
   The explanation is long and winding. In order, more or less: the
leg that was two inches shorter than the other (the search for a
surgeon brought his family to New York when he was a teenager), the
years in the U.S. Army in World War II (he spent the war in New
York, as section chief of a psychology unit and, later, as editor
of a newspaper for psychiatric patients), the questioning by an
investigator from the House Un-American Activities Committee in the
1950s (``I was anti-Communist, or at least anti-Stalinist, but I
said I couldn't testify to something I didn't know firsthand''),
the work as curator of the Songwriters' Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but the campaign songs?
</P>
<P>
   He holds this truth to be self-evident: Politics is politics,
but in the old days, everyone did it while singing. And that led,
in a way that seemed seamless, to how Brand worked campaign songs
into a 1968 show called ``How to Steal an Election.'' This being an
election year, one should not be surprised that a revival is
opening in Los Angeles on Saturday; Annette Bening and Rob Reiner
will preside over a gala next week. And, for the second time since
1952, Brand has made a campaign-song recording: ``Presidential
Campaign Songs, 1789-1996'' (Smithsonian Folkways Recordings).
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays there are those who consider campaign songs, like
bumper stickers, irrelevant. Brand dissents.
</P>
<P>
   ``You watch the Bush convention? What was the big song? `God
Bless America.' That's not a new song. I'm not crazy about it.
Woody hated it. `This Land Is Your Land,' it was originally called
`God Blessed America to Me.''' Brand sings it the way he says his
buddy Woody _ Guthrie, his name to you and me _ sang it on the
radio: different, angrier lyrics, not the words you memorized as a
child. ``He changed it afterward,'' Brand says.
</P>
<P>
   The mention of radio signals another digression. For 55 years,
Brand has had a folk song show on WNYC _ Guthrie was a frequent
guest. Brand had written to the station when he was discharged from
the Army and had been told to go on the air one Saturday night,
then the next. Then he was told to go ``across the street.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Across the street'' meant City Hall _ the city owned and
operated the station until a few years ago. Brand's summons came
after he had featured a G.I. singing from a German songbook he had
brought home.
</P>
<P>
   So, across the street he went.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little voice from behind the desk said, `You're Brand?'''
Brand says. This in a squeaky voice, with an explanation: ``I make
fun of him with the voice, but I think he was the great mayor.'' He
is imitating Fiorello La Guardia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `mayor.' He said, `We hear you're singing Nazi songs
on the air.' I said, `Your honor, these are not Nazi songs, these
are old German songs, from the Hundred Years War. There are no Nazi
songs among them. It's an old lieder book.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `What do I tell these people who are calling and
saying, ``What are we paying this man to do that?'' ' I said, `Sir,
I don't get paid.' He said, `That'll do it,' and went right back to
work as if I wasn't there.'' He told O'Dwyer, Impellitteri, Wagner,
Lindsay, Beame and Koch the same thing. ``Every time there was a
problem, I'd meet the mayor, and it would last until I said, `I
don't get paid.'''
</P>
<P>
   A mention that he has been in broadcasting about as long as Joe
Franklin leads down another byway: once, they were paired as
presenters at the Emmy Awards. ``He was short, and I was tall. It
was a funny sight. I was told, `If he talks a lot, see if you can
get him off.' I got the signal: get off. So I picked him up and
carried him off.''
</P>
<P>
   Our refrain again: The campaign songs?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to have a name that's rhymable. Adams is not easy to
do.'' He sings John Adams' big song, to the tune of ``The
Star-Spangled Banner.''
</P>
<P>
   `` `Get on a Raft with Taft,' that rhymes very well,'' he says.
``But it has no meaning when you have a man weighs 370 pounds in
the raft. Still, you get a good song, you could almost get a man
elected on that.''

`A LA HORA SENALADA' (`HIGH NOON') RETORNA A LA PANTALLA
</HEADLINE>
  Con 2 fotografias de color: 1) Susanna Thomson y Tom Skerritt; 2)
foto de cerca de Tom Skerritt; en escenas de ``A La Hora Senalada''
(``High Noon''). 
 Por IVOR DAVIS 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Cada uno conserva su propia lista de escenas cinematograficas
inolvidables.
 &HT;    Tal vez incluye Clark Gable transportando a una furiosa Vivian
Leigh por las escaleras en ``Lo que el viento se llevo'' (1939),
Marlon Brando subido a su motocicleta en ``The Wild One'' (1953),
Humphrey Bogart mostrando su paranoia en ``El Motin del Caine''
(1954).
 &HT;    Y entre esas escenas seguramente muchos incluyen una panoramica
de Gary Cooper caminando solo por una calle calcinada por el sol en
el filme de 1952 ``A La Hora Senalada'' (``High Noon'').
 &HT;    Esa excelente pelicula hecha en blanco y negro, producida por
Stanley Kramer, dirigida por Fred Zinneman y con guion de Carl
Foreman, trascendio el genero de las peliculas del Oeste al narrar
la historia de un honesto alguacil dividido entre su amor por una
mujer y su deber.
 &HT;    Por lo tanto, que necesidad hay de hacer otra version en colores
como la concretada por la red de cable TBS, el Turner Broadcast
System? (La pelicula sera transmitida el 20 de agosto).
 &HT;    El director australiano Rod Hardy, encargado de la nueva
version, reconoce que el mismo tuvo que lidiar con ese
interrogante.
 &HT;    ``Cuando me ofrecieron el proyecto,'' dice, ``consulte a varias
personas que tenian menos de 30 anos. Asi descubri que el 95 por
ciento de ellas nunca habian visto el film original. Y pense que
era hora de rodar una nueva version. Si eso hace que los
espectadores deseen ver el maravilloso clasico, entonces, sentire
que logre algo bueno.''
 &HT;    La seleccion del elenco de la version de 1952 fue crucial.
Incluia a Gary Cooper, uno de los grandes astros de Hollywood,
quien hacia el rol del alguacil Will Kane, a Grace Kelly, en su
debut cinematografico, y a Katy Jurado, la gran actriz mexicana,
quien hacia el rol de Helen Ramirez. La pelicula, de 84 minutos de
duracion, es muy dificil de olvidar.
 &HT;    Hardy eligio a Tom Skerritt (``Picket Fences'') para el papel
encarnado primero por Cooper, a la bella Susanna Thompson (``Once
And Again'') para que se pusiera en la piel de Grace Kelly, y a
Maria Conchita Alonso para hacer el papel de Helen Ramirez, la
mujer que amo y perdio al alguacil.
 &HT;    Reed Diamond, que encarno a Mike Kellerman en el programa de
television ``Homicide: Life on The Street'' es Harvey Pell, el
ayudante del alguacil, no muy dispuesto a morir en el
enfrentamiento con los villanos de turno.
 &HT;    Una vez obtenido el elenco, Hardy pidio al guionista T.S Cook
que lo ayudara a actualizar la historia sin alterarla.
 &HT;    Las dos mujeres, la recien casada, una cuaquera, y la osada
amante latina, eran simbolos antes que personajes en la version
original. En la nueva version, el espectador descubre mas facetas
en esos personajes.
 &HT;    Ramirez, en particular, tiene que ver muy poco con el
estereotipo latino que encarno Jurado. Ella es una mujer exitosa,
que vive obedeciendo a sus propios conceptos, le gusta la accion y
no ha perdido las esperanzas de volver a atraer al alguacil.
 &HT;    En cuanto a Amy Kane, es una novia mas madura e inteligente que
la version ofrecida por Grace Kelly. Una vez que ha conseguido a su
principe azul, parece que esta dispuesta a cederlo a su rival sin
presentar lucha.
 &HT;    ``Las mujeres eran tratadas en esa epoca de una manera muy
diferente a la actual,'' explica Hardy. ``Por lo tanto, ajustamos
los roles femeninos. No es que les hayamos dado mas escenas.
Simplemente orientamos las escenas un poco mas hacia ellas.''
 &HT;    Pero las dos mujeres tienen una escena que no figuraba en la
pelicula original: Amy confronta a Helen en su cuarto de hotel
cuando ambas se aprestan a abandonar la poblacion en el tren del
mediodia.
 &HT;    ``Es para mi una de las escenas favoritas de la pelicula,'' dice
Rod Hardy. ``Y eso porque en un Oeste repleto de machismo vemos una
escena que exalta los personajes femeninos sin afectar el periodo
historico en que transcurre. E, ironicamente, aunque las mujeres
aparecen con mas fortaleza, la escena sirve para exaltar al
personaje masculino.''
 &HT;    La pelicula original fue filmada en blanco y negro, en un
estudio de Burbank. En esta nueva version, se han buscado los
espacios abiertos y el color. Y aunque eso reduce la claustrofobia
que sentia el personaje interpretado por Cooper, ciertamente
permite ubicar la historia en un contexto mas cercano al del
Salvaje Oeste.
 &HT;    ``Una de las razones de que el filme tenia una extrana
perspectiva,'' dice Hardy, ``es que los camarografos debian evitar
filmar las palmeras y los edificios cercanos. Eso creo una
sensacion de angulos bajos que dio fabulosos resultados en la
pelicula.
 &HT;    ``Pero nosotros usamos Calgary, Canada, que tiene como telon de
fondo a las montanas Rocosas. Nuestra camara pudo explorar en todas
direcciones. Por lo tanto logramos mayor sensacion de espacio
abierto.''
 &HT;    Otra de las caracteristicas del film original fue el ``tiempo
real'' de 84 minutos con que contaba el alguacil Kane para buscar
ayuda en su enfrentamiento con el villano Frank Miller. La
sensacion de que el tiempo se terminaba fue creada en la version de
1952 en la sala de montaje, una vez la pelicula fue concluida.
 &HT;    Hardy filmo con cuenta progresiva a medida que iba filmando.
``Tratamos de aprovechar las tecnicas de filmacion moderna, a fin
de darle mas suspenso,'' dice. ``Y creo que eso contribuye al
climax, cuando llega al pueblo Miller (Michael Madsen), el enemigo
de Kane. Creo que es un momento de gran impacto en la pelicula.''
 &HT;    Vieja version, vs. nueva. Cual es la que triunfa?
 &HT;    Tom Skerrit senala que ``no es nuestra intencion reemplazar al
original. Pero Rod Hardy hizo la nueva version como un jugador de
poquer que ha recibido buenas cartas. Y creo que ha venido con una
mano ganadora.''
 &HT;    Madsen dice por su parte, ``no creo que ninguno de nosotros haya
tenido la esperanza de hacer una pelicula tan buena como la
original. La vi cuando era nino y creo que es inolvidable. Lo que
intentamos hacer es ofrecer una version moderna para personas que
no vieron la gran pelicula interpretada por Gary Cooper.''
 &HT;    Pero Maria Conchita Alonso dice que aunque admira el film de
1952, prefiere la nueva version. ``Nuestra pelicula tiene un ritmo
mas rapido, nuestros personajes muestran una mayor gama de
emociones,'' indica. ``Vivimos en una epoca en que todo transcurre
con mucha rapidez, y eso es lo que mucha gente desea ver cuando
observa una pelicula.''
 &HT;    Todo eso esta muy bien. Pero hay algo que falta en la nueva
version. La bella melodia cantada por Tex Ritter: ``Do Not Forsake
Me, Oh My Darlin.''
 &HT;    Los productores dicen que el tema fue enfatizado en la pelicula
de 1952 para mantener viva la historia de amor, pero que si
hubieran repetido el tema, hubieran menudeado las criticas. Muchos
hubieran dicho que la nueva version es demasiado cercana a la
original.

COMMENTARY: GORE'S CHOICE: A SOBER JOY IN VALIDATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOYCE PURNICK    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At least as interesting as Al Gore's calculations in
choosing a conspicuous Jew as his running mate has been the
emotional response of New York Jews of every stripe and station.
</P>
<P>
   As Jesse Jackson so indiscreetly once observed, New York is
universally considered a Jewish city (RIP Hymie), even though the
number of Jews among the 7.5 million inhabitants has dwindled from
3 million to barely 1.1 million. But New York has had two Jewish
mayors (two and a half if you count Fiorello La Guardia). One of
the state's two senators is Jewish and he isn't the first.
</P>
<P>
   New York is home to neighborhoods where a non-Jew is a rarity,
to Jewish organizations, schools, synagogues, cultural
institutions, universities, hospitals. Jewish men and women are
threaded throughout public and political life.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, New York is a place where being Jewish and
prominent is no big deal. You wouldn't have expected the Lieberman
selection to turn Jewish New York topsy-turvy in a city where being
Jewish and prominent is no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   Think again. Overwhelmingly, Jewish New Yorkers are exultant,
exuding the kind of pride we haven't seen since Israel won the
Six-Day War in 1967. ``I'm personally just elated,'' said Abraham
Biderman, a commissioner in the administration of Edward Koch, and
an Orthodox Jew. ``The symbolism of this is so powerful. Wherever I
go, talking to Jews of any affiliation, this sense of euphoria is
difficult for many people to express.''
</P>
<P>
   A Jewish colleague admitted that she cried when she heard the
news. Jewish men and women, interviewed by newspapers and on
television, were gleeful. Anecdotally, it sure seems that the
disapproving are few, the delighted many.
</P>
<P>
   Why such excitement in a city where Jews are ubiquitous, in a
country where many consider Jews so powerful that detractors say
they control the news media, Hollywood, the banks and politics?
</P>
<P>
   Part of the answer is that New York City is one thing, the
nation is another. The reaction must reflect the Jewish history of
persecution, a people's well-earned fear of disappointment and
worse.
</P>
<P>
   But the core reason is no doubt emotional and very human. Many
Jews _ and many non-Jews _ still feel as though they are on the
outside looking in, however large their accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   It is no accident that many Jewish New Yorkers never gave
Lieberman a chance to be Gore's running mate. Too risky, they said.
Too much anti-Semitism out there.
</P>
<P>
   That calculation may have been as personal as it was political,
a reflection of what women feel sitting at an otherwise all-male
meeting, what blacks, Latinos, Asians and gays feel when they are
excluded. It's a sensibility reflected in debates about affirmative
action, which continues to aggravate tensions between blacks and
Jews. ( Lieberman's spokesman, Dan Gerstein, said Wednesday that
the senator was ``in sync'' with Gore's support of affirmative
action, but Lieberman said in 1995 that it was ``dividing us.'')
</P>
<P>
   That feeling is nebulous, hard to describe because it's what
isn't there. I remember going to a conference on ``Rethinking New
York'' a few years ago, and watching 12 white males talk about the
future of one of the most diverse cities in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being erased, invalidated,'' I wrote at the time.
``At its most fundamental level, exclusion is not about political
correctness or quotas or ideology. It is not ultimately a political
matter, but a human one.''
</P>
<P>
   That, I think, is why the Lieberman selection thrilled so many
Jews, even in New York. It is validation. Just as the prospect of a
President George W. Bush naming Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice
to his cabinet would be validation for African-Americans (and
legitimate, compared to that show in Philadelphia).
</P>
<P>
   Recognition does not come about passively. It happens through
political calculation ( Gore needed Lieberman's reputation for
moral rectitude) and through policies like affirmative action; an
imperfect tool, but one at least aimed at inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore ticket raises all sorts of political questions, from
whether it will help Hillary Rodham Clinton (probably not;
coattails rarely do), to whether Lieberman's nomination will mean
much to Gore in the long run (how many people vote for vice
presidents?).
</P>
<P>
   Even more interesting: Will those so offended by affirmative
action recognize that in a way, the selection of Lieberman was a
prime example of same? Worth pondering when the euphoria breaks.
</P>

TAKING THE CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER M. NICHOLS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thomas and the Magic Railroad
</P>
<P>
   Alec Baldwin, Peter Fonda, Mara Wilson, Michael E. Rodgers and
with the voices of Eddie Glen, Neil Crone, Colm Feore
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Britt Allcroft
</P>
<P>
   G _ 89 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Thomas the Tank Engine from the PBS children's series ``Shining
Time Station'' chugs between the real-life community of Shining
Time and his home base on the imaginary Island of Sodor. As always,
he's trying to be really useful, and here the job is to prevent
steam engines like himself from being ground to scrap by a mean
diesel.
</P>
<P>
   Allies include Mr. Conductor ( Baldwin), a miniature figure of
boundless energy and cheer who transports himself between the two
worlds by blowing on his whistle and disappearing in a cloud of
gold dust. But pretty soon he runs out of the stuff, which consigns
him to the sidelines except when he happens to be close enough to
the action to hurl a bolt of his wild optimism.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, on to the second problem, which is that Lady, the steam
engine of all steam engines, who is counted on to save Thomas and
the others, now sits stranded inside Muffle Mountain in the care of
a morose gentleman named Burnett Stone ( Fonda). Years earlier,
Lady lost her will to produce steam when Stone let her down in a
tight situation. Now some magic is needed to get her stoking, not
to mention Stone, who sits staring into the fire and mumbling
sorrowfully. (What did they feed Fonda?)
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Stone's granddaughter, Lily ( Wilson), helps
provide enough spark to get everybody back on track.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE _ None.
</P>
<P>
   SEX _ None.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY _ None.
</P>
<P>
   FOOTNOTE _ Parents in tow will be fascinated by the dead-game
performances of Baldwin, who adds another notch to his range, and
Fonda (last sighted as a sleazy record producer in ``The Limey''),
who may be a little leonine but does a passable sweet old grandpa.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-8 _ Thanks largely to Baldwin's gusto, the film rolls up
its sleeves and gets down to business, which small children will
appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Nutty Professor II: The Klumps
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Murphy, Janet Jackson, Larry Miller, John Ales
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Peter Segal
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 _ 105 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Lewis invented someone similar in 1963. In Eddie Murphy
movies, he's become Sherman Klump, an amiable fat-boy professor and
scientific genius dogged by Buddy Love ( Murphy), a lean, vile
demon who erupts from inside Sherman to embarrass him at the most
inopportune moments. For example, every time Sherman goes to seal
the romantic deal with the lovely Denise (Jackson), out pops Buddy
to make a shambles of the proceedings with his lewd shenanigans. On
the podium, Buddy shocks an academic gathering by taking over
Sherman and talking dirty.
</P>
<P>
   To get rid of Buddy, Sherman fires up several acres of lab
equipment and purges himself of his Buddy gene. But there is a
disastrous side effect: Sherman starts to lose his intelligence. No
longer is he able to fully expound on his latest invention: a pink
fluid that makes people young again. Not unreasonably, the elixir
catches the attention of the pharmaceutical community, which offers
Sherman's university $150 million. That, of course, interests the
dean ( Miller) and Buddy, now out on his own, who is determined to
steal a beaker of the material from a fridge at Papa Klump's.
</P>
<P>
   Meet the Klumps: Granny, Mama, Papa, Young Papa and Ernie. All
are played by Murphy, and occasionally they all gather to wipe out
an all-you-can-eat place and cheer on Sherman and Denise. But Buddy
spikes the elixir, so that now it makes everything big as well as
young. Maybe it's time to put Buddy back inside Sherman.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE _ None.
</P>
<P>
   SEX _ All the Klumps talk up sex, especially the elderly Klumps,
who practice what they preach (thankfully not on screen, at least
not graphically). Oh, yes, and a giant hamster has his way with the
dean.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY _ Along with sex, much toilet talk.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 10 _ Common sense indicates that this isn't the best
film for the small ones.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11 AND UP _ Parents should decide, but there's no real
harm.
</P>
<P>
   What Lies Beneath
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Pfeiffer, Harrison Ford, Diana Scarwid, Miranda Otto,
James Remar, Amber Valletta
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Robert Zemeckis
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 _ 130 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Odd how the front door opens by itself and won't stay closed.
And a certain picture keeps toppling, breaking the glass in its
frame. The dog is acting weird. Also, the tub keeps filling to the
rim. Claire Spencer (Pfeiffer) is not drawing a bath, nor is her
husband, Norman (Ford), a prominent university geneticist. Their
daughter is away at school. So who is that woman in the steamy
bathroom?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a ghost in my house,'' Claire tells a psychiatrist.
``I saw her in the water by the bathtub.'' The doctor advises her
to get a ouija board and look into the matter. Norman, preoccupied
with his work in the way people like Norman always are in this kind
of movie, is both concerned about and annoyed with his wife, a
budding semi-hysteric made none the calmer by too little to do
around the stunning lakeside property that they have inherited from
his father.
</P>
<P>
   When Claire first mentions sensing another presence, Norman
suggests that it could be his father rattling around the house,
assessing the renovations. Very funny. No, this apparition is young
and blond. At first Claire suspects that it could be the woman next
door, who seems to have disappeared after some nasty altercations
with her husband. But when the Spencer computer turns itself on a
few times, she uses it to track a set of initials and positively
identify her friend in the bathroom as one Madison Elizabeth Frank,
a student who has been missing.
</P>
<P>
   The movie makes no secret of the fact that Norman had an affair
with Maddie. From there, though, you are on your own.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE _ At its climax, the film becomes extremely violent.
For one thing, Claire and Norman should stay away from bathtubs.
</P>
<P>
   SEX _ The neighbors may be having problems, but they are noisy
love-makers. As for the Spencers, their sex life is discussed and
sometimes partly in view, with discreet fadeouts. At one point
Claire becomes possessed with the spirit of Maddie, which heats up
the suggestiveness considerably.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY _ Some, but it is appropriate and used sparingly.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 12 _ This isn't for them, or shouldn't be. The
violence is realistic, and the frights are too intense.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 12 AND UP _ The young ran riot in ``Scream'' and the like,
and here the old folks take a comparatively sedate crack at it.
Drawn by the horror genre, some teen-agers might be entertained by
people their parents' age wheezing around that territory. Others
won't be.

 &HT;    Hokum-filled `Child' is an adult-size hoax
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Bless the Child'' and pity the audience. The latest cinematic
struggle of good vs. evil swipes everything it can from ``The
Omen,'' ``The Exorcist,'' ``End of Days,'' ``Stigmata'' and other
Catholic/satanic epics, all while managing to bore the pants off
you.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Basinger plays psychiatric nurse Maggie O'Connor, whose
junkie sister Jenna (Angela Bettis) drops by one Christmas season,
abandoning her newborn daughter in Maggie's care. Oh, incidentally,
the star of Bethlehem has recently begun to shine anew in the sky.
Hmmm.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, Cody (Holliston Coleman) has grown into a sweet
but borderline-autistic child who starts to evince some odd gifts.
She resurrects a dead pigeon, and when she enters a church, the
bank of sleeping votive candles flame to life, and the statue of
the Madonna starts to weep. Hmmm.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this has something to do with the serial murders of
children in the city (supposedly New York, but ``Bless'' was shot
in Toronto). Five 6-year-olds have turned up dead, and all of them
share Cody's birthdate. Hmmm!
</P>
<P>
   Enter Jenna, supposedly clean, now married to New Age guru Eric
Stark (Rufus Sewell), founder of a runaway youth ministry called
New Dawn. But whose new dawn is it? Could it be . . . Satan's?
</P>
<P>
   An occult custody battle ensues, as Stark spirits Cody away to
his postmodern lair inside a rundown tenement. In case we doubt his
Evil Purpose, every time Maggie goes near the place, she has
visions of computer-generated demons flying around the eaves.
</P>
<P>
   This is a job for detective John Travis (Jimmy Smits), a cult
specialist. ``He was instrumental in breaking that Santeria case
last summer,'' enthuses a colleague, which is just one of the
movie's many howlers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if Travis is such a whiz, you wonder why none of the
cops, having noticed that all the murdered children were born on
the same day of the same year, haven't gone through hospital birth
records and placed every kid with the same birthday under
surveillance and protection. Um, duh!
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of movie where one character sees a gang of
Stark's goons waiting for her outside a coffee shop. Does she
calmly phone the police, or take refuge in the bathroom? No. She
hands a second character a gun, her only tool of self-defense, and
rushes out onto the street unarmed, where she is 100 percent likely
to be killed.
</P>
<P>
   On top of the convenient lapses of logic and common sense,
director Chuck Russell (``The Mask,'' ``Eraser'') encourages his
actors to ham it up. Poor Basinger frowns, clenches her jaw and
borders on hysteria for two hours, just as she did in her last
bomb, ``I Dreamed of Africa.'' No one is immune, however. Sewell
mugs and glowers. Christina Ricci, in a small role as a runaway
cult member, seems almost too embarrassed to say some of her lines.
And the estimable Ian Holm is given a single scene as a learned
churchman, barking about the forces of darkness from his
wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bless the Child'' is based on a book that must have been very
popular at airport bookstores. Apparently, the novel's Cody was the
mesenger of the Egyptian goddess Isis, born to battle the forces of
some kind of evil stone. The movie transforms those plot points
into hoary Christian symbols and cliches, cynically manipulating
church iconography for maximum box office lucre.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a brief special-effects manifestation of the devil
himself, we get several appearances by spiritual helpmates. There's
a kindly black janitor who assures Smits he isn't alone in his
investigation; a nice lady on the subway who helps Maggie and the
kid get away from the bad guys; and a bearded dude who looks a lot
like Jesus who saves Maggie from a car wreck before vanishing into
thin air.
</P>
<P>
   Lazy stuff like this makes ``Bless'' play like a feature version
of ``Touched by an Angel.'' Only, an episode with the occasional
decapitation, millions of swarming rats and a deus ex machina
featuring computer-generated angelic creatures that could make even
Della Reese suffer sugar shock. In the end, ``Bless the Child'' is
a demonstration of the evil of banality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bless the Child''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kim Basinger and Jimmy Smits. Rated R for violence,
drug content and brief profanity. At metro theaters. 1 hour, 50
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A junky would-be religious thriller.

 &HT;    `Eyes' a slightly smeared look at Tammy Faye
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raccoon-eyed from mascara and a double set of false lashes,
dazed from prescription drugs and studio lights, Tammy Faye Bakker
was a cheerful-spooky icon of the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   A crying, Jesus-loves-you kewpie doll you alternately wanted to
hug and throttle, she chirped and sang praise and tirelessly worked
with her husband, Jim, for their theme-park ministry, whose success
would be their undoing. She came across as a stumpy drag queen in
the throes of religious ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   The rise and fall of the PTL Club and the Bakkers' marriage
makes a fascinating story. But somewhes,'' along with another
couple accused of pushing the Bakkers out of their first TV
ministry.
</P>
<P>
   You can't blame them, but it makes the documentary lopsided. The
movie gets revenge on Hahn by showing a clip of her Playboy video,
rolling around half-naked with a crucifix while intoning on the
audio, ``I would just like people to know the real me.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie also deals with Tammy Faye's drug addiction, which
caused her to ramble hazily around the PTL set while the cameras
ran, culminating in her woozy attempt to walk out of a plane at
30,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyes'' benefits from interviews with Jim Bakker, and his
children with Tammy Faye, Jamie Bakker and Tammy Sue Bakker
Chapman. The kids' memories of the media turmoil that engulfed them
during the PTL scandal helps humanize the family. So does Tammy
Faye's bout with cancer, which brought her closer to the runaway
Tammy Sue.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, we get a glimpse of what made Tammy Faye more
than just a Bible-thumping Kathie Lee: She took risks, among other
things being the first in television evangelism to discuss and
reach out to gay men with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't label people. I refuse to label people,'' Tammy Faye
says on a visit to her one-time talk-show partner, the gay comic
Jim J. Bullock. ``God didn't make any junk.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end, the filmmakers content themselves with hanging
out with Tammy Faye as she gets glam head shots made by celeb
photographer Greg Gorman, dumbfounding a makeup artist who
discovers that her lips and eyes are permanently lined. Even in the
bizarre world of Hollywood, she stands out as, um, different. She
makes the studio rounds, pitching series ideas (``Tammy's Terrific
Teens'') to Steven Chao, hipper-than-thou president of USA Cable,
who patronizes her as if she's just beamed in from Mars. Other
executives don't return her calls. The film wraps up with her
reunion with second husband Roe Messner, the contractor who built
Heritage U.S.A., then was jailed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its unevenness, the film conveys Tammy Faye's mix of
delicacy and steely resilience, and it's always watchable.
``Roaches, Tammy Faye and Cher'' are Bullock's nominees for those
most likely to survive a holocaust. You believe him. The success of
``Eyes'' is in convincing you that Tammy Faye is worthy of a
documentary. But in doing so, it makes you wish for one more
thorough and objective than this.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Eyes of Tammy Faye''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   A documentary about Tammy Faye Bakker Messner, narrated by
RuPaul Charles. Rated PG-13 for some sexual content. 1 hour, 19
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: An uneven but entertaining look at the former PTL
diva.

   ``The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle'' PG (brief mild
language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robert De Niro, Rene Russo
</P>
<P>
   and Jason Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   The live-action and animated comedy drags the heroic squirrel
and moose into the 21st century, and into three dimensions. The
movie front-loads its clever bits, and its second half offers
diminishing returns. It keeps you awake with its throwaway sight
gags, retro tone recalling ``Austin Powers'' and its pop culture
japes. (SM) 1 hour, 32 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Momma's House'' PG-13 (crude humor, sexual,
</P>
<P>
   profanity and some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Martin Lawrence
</P>
<P>
   and Nia Long.
</P>
<P>
   It's one super-sized Martin Lawrence. As an FBI agent on a
neighborhood stakeout to capture a vicious bank robber, Lawrence
dons layer upon layer of prosthetics to impersonate a 325-pound,
small-town granny in Cartersville (the movie, however, was filmed
in Los Angeles). The results may be predictable, but with
Lawrence's manic comedic timing they are also occasionally quite
funny. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 39 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Bless the Child'' R (violence, drug content
</P>
<P>
   and brief profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kim Basinger
</P>
<P>
   and Jimmy Smits.
</P>
<P>
   A junky would-be religious thriller about a little girl with
special powers. The latest cinematic struggle of good Vs. evil, the
film swipes everything it can from ``The Omen,'' ``The Exorcist,''
``End of Days,'' ``Stigmata'' and other Catholic/Satanic epics, all
while managing to bore the pants off you. (SM) 1 hour, 50 minutes.
D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Blood Simple'' R (violence, sex, nudity and language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Dan Hedaya,
</P>
<P>
   Frances McDormand
</P>
<P>
   and M. Emmet Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   The Coen brothers' first film is back in all its devilishly
degenerate glory. Re-released in a spruced-up but still-smirking
so-called director's cut, the movie is pretty much exactly as it
was when it hit theaters in 1984. That is, a good-old-boy gothic
full of flashy camera angles and trashy people. What's astonishing
is how much of the Coens' unique talent was evident from the start.
(ERG) 1 hour, 37 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm a Cheerleader'' R (profanity and sexual themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Natasha Lyonne
</P>
<P>
   and Clea DuVall.
</P>
<P>
   Call it ``Girl, Intercepted.'' Megan (Natasha Lyonne) is a
cheerleader shipped off to a homosexual rehab center called True
Directions because of certain ``telling'' signs. There's potential
here for some funny, nasty satire, but filmmaker Jamie Babbit soon
backs off the risky stuff. The funniest thing in the movie is
RuPaul as a rehab counselor who proudly disowns his gay past and
wears a ``Straight is Great'' T-shirt. (ERG) 1 hour, 25 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicken Run'' G
</P>
<P>
   Featuring the voices of Mel Gibson
</P>
<P>
   and Miranda Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Set on a chicken farm in 1950s Britain, the movie is about some
hens' repeated attempts to fly the coop after their villainous
owner decides there's more money in chicken pies than in chickens.
If you're in the mood for something offbeat and wackily deadpan,
this may be just your kind of amiably bird-brained entertainment.
(ERG) 1 hour, 22 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Color of Paradise'' PG (thematic elements)
</P>
<P>
   In Persian with subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mohsen Ramezani
</P>
<P>
   and Hossein Mahjub.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of a young sightless boy, it's a gorgeous meditation on
blindness, both physical and spiritual. Filled with dread and
beauty, director Majid Majidi's film summons the power of a fable,
suggesting that those with sight can be the blindest of all.
Stunningly shot by Mohammad Davudi, the film puts an emphasis on
the boy's hands stretching out into the natural world. (SM) 1 hour,
30 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Coyote Ugly'' PG-13 (sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Piper Perabo,
</P>
<P>
   Adam Garcia, Maria Bello
</P>
<P>
   and John Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   Dog-face hideous. The come-on is five hot chicks serving liquor
in a rowdy fun-time saloon (they splash whiskey across the bar and
set it afire; they douse each others' T-shirts with big pitchers of
water). But it's really the slapdash story of a young waif, a
struggling songwriter aching for stardom in New York City.
``Coyote'' is profoundly stupid and earnestly inept at conveying a
story. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 34 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``Croupier'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Clive Owen
</P>
<P>
   and Alex Kingston.
</P>
<P>
   This 1998 film involves a struggling author who takes a job at a
casino running a roulette wheel to look for writing inspiration.
Soon he's convinced to join a robbery scheme. ``Croupier'' has more
on its mind than danger and plot twists. It's a fascinating,
hard-edged portrait of a man who swears he doesn't gamble. (SM) 1
hour, 31 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Eyes of Tammy Faye'' PG-13 (some sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   A documentary about
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Faye Bakker Messner,
</P>
<P>
   narrated by RuPaul Charles.
</P>
<P>
   The rise and fall of evangelical diva Tammy Faye Bakker Messner,
the PTL Club and her marriage to Jim Bakker makes a fascinating
story. But somewhere along the way, directors Fenton Bailey and
Randy Barbato turned the subject of their documentary into its
mascot. Often captivating and informative, but full of gaps and
lacking key interviews. (SM) 1 hour, 19 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Gladiator'' R (extreme violence,
</P>
<P>
   perverse sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Russell Crowe.
</P>
<P>
   Two thousand _ or, if you want to add computer effects, 200,000
_ thumbs up for Ridley Scott's spectacle starring Russell Crowe as
a Roman general, who returns to the Colosseum to take revenge on
the odious Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). The battles staged
before the mob of mindless ancient Romans are the film's
centerpieces, but its brave heart (so to speak) is Crowe. (ERG) 2
hours, 33 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone in 60 Seconds'' PG-13 (sexuality,
</P>
<P>
   profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nicolas Cage
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas Cage plays Memphis Raines, a reformed car thief called
back behind the wheel when his little brother bungles a deal for a
British crime lord. If you sit through the usual formula garbage,
``Gone'' delivers a long, harrowing car chase that easily outdoes
the motorcycle finale in ``M: I-2.'' A few IQ points may be lost
while watching the flick. But you'll be having too much fun to
care. (SM) 1 hour, 59 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollow Man'' R (graphic violence,
</P>
<P>
   nudity, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Bacon
</P>
<P>
   and Elisabeth Shue.
</P>
<P>
   A high-tech fusion of ``The Invisible Man'' and ``Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde,'' it lets director Paul Verhoeven (``Starship Troopers,''
``Total Recall'') show off some gruesome, state-of-the-art computer
effects and exercise his gleeful brand of brutal action. But his
filmmaking energy is wasted on a weak script and characters so
two-dimensional, they're virtually all transparent. (SM) 1 hour, 54
minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the One
</P>
<P>
   That I Want'' Unrated (contains strong profanity
</P>
<P>
   and sexual subject matter)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Margaret Cho
</P>
<P>
   Filmed over two nights in San Francisco, it's standup comic
Margaret Cho's raunchy and hilarious act. Some memorable bits
include comparisons of straight and gay porn and recalling her one
sexual experience with a woman. She also details the idiocies of TV
execs during her experiences as the star of the very first
Asian-American sitcom (``All-American Girl''). (SM) 1 hour, 36
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Loser'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jason Biggs
</P>
<P>
   and Mena Suvari.
</P>
<P>
   It's mostly a bore. Jason Biggs is Paul, a scholarship student
fresh from a small Midwestern town who arrives in New York City
with full-blown naivete. He meets Dora (Mena Suvari), a bright,
Gothic-styled American beauty who's sleeping with the college's
uppity, self-absorbed English lit professor (Greg Kinnear). Paul
and Dora getting together is no surprise, but it takes an eternity
to happen. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 38 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Mad About Mambo'' PG-13 (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring William Ash
</P>
<P>
   and Keri Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Can't really dance to it. Set in Belfast, the picture focuses on
a soccer-mad Catholic lad (William Ash) who joins a dance class to
improve his game. There he falls for a beauty (Keri Russell) who's
rich, spoiled and Protestant. As a comedy, the movie has some good
moments (the Troubles are gently but effectively lampooned). But as
a romance, well, it doesn't help that the stars have zero
chemistry. (ERG) 1 hour, 40 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene'' R (sexual content, crude
</P>
<P>
   humor, profanity and some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jim Carrey
</P>
<P>
   and Renee Zellweger.
</P>
<P>
   Those impish filmmaking Farrelly brothers, Peter and Bobby,
prove yet ag and Janet Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The big problem in ``Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'' is the
nutty professor. This sequel to the 1996 hit seems designed for
video: You want to fast-forward through all the parts focused on
tubby scientist Sherman (Eddie Murphy) so you can get back to the
rest of his family (played by Murphy, Murphy, Murphy and Murphy,
plus a fat kid). Murphy is jaw-droppingly funny. But the script is
simply not nutty enough. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Old Man and the Sea'' Unrated.
</P>
<P>
   A live-action animated short.
</P>
<P>
   This 'toon, based on an Ernest Hemingway novel, is, like the
author's word choice, deceptively simple and strikingly beautiful.
It's everything a moviegoer would expect, but didn't get, from
``Fantasia/2000.'' (Bob Longino) 22 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patriot'' R (strong war violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mel Gibson,
</P>
<P>
   Heath Ledger and Jason Isaacs.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Gibson single-handedly wins the American Revolution, among
other historicae program in the '50s are summoned into service to
repair the thing. The best part of the film is watching these
veterans play off each other like seasoned pros on the Senior Tour.
(ERG) 2 hours, 15 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunshine'' R (nudity, sex and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ralph Fiennes,
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Ehle and Rosemary Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Though overlong (three hours) and not a very smiley-face story
(the title is ironic), this bleak, sweeping epic is still worth
your time and effort. Oscar-winning director Istvan Szabo
(``Mephisto'') examines the first half of the 20th century through
the painful prism of three generations of a Jewish family in
Hungary. Ralph Fiennes plays the central male in each passage along
with a fine supporting cast. (ERG) 3 hours. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Thomas and the Magic Railroad'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Alec Baldwin
</P>
<P>
   and Peter Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't always stay on track. For anyone older than 6 or who
isn't already a fan of the British TV series, this could be
subtitled ``The Little Engine That Couldn't.'' Things start to go
wrong in a magical land where talking trains are menaced by a
bullying diesel and their protector, Mr. Conductor (Alec Baldwin).
It's not total a wreck, but avoid being railroaded into sitting
through it unless there's no choice. (ERG) 1 hour, 20 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``What Lies Beneath'' PG-13 (terror, violence, sensuality
</P>
<P>
   and brief profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michelle Pfeiffer
</P>
<P>
   and Harrison Ford.
</P>
<P>
   What lies beneath ``What Lies Beneath'' is a script that could
have come from a 1970s TV movie. Narratively old-fashioned, but
boosted by star performances from Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison
Ford and suspenseful direction, it's a lovingly crafted throwback
to haunted-house movies that relied more on suggestion and slowly
building creepiness than over-the-top effects. (SM) 2 hours, 10
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``X-Men'' PG-13 (sci-fi action violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Halle Berry, Hugh Jackman,
</P>
<P>
   Anna Paquin, Patrick Stewart
</P>
<P>
   and Ian McKellen.
</P>
<P>
   ``X-Men'' never comes close to classic status. The best movie to
work this superhero turf lately was the shamelessly entertaining
``The Matrix.'' But director Bryan Singer and his collaborators
treat the comic's mythology with seriousness and respect (unlike
other recent, slapdash comic adaptations ``Spawn'' and ``Blade'').
It's an engaging popcorn movie in a summer that's littered with
duds. (SM) 1 hour, 44 minutes. B-

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Bibleman, In God's Armor
</P>
<P>
   Action figures often hurl invective, but seldom do they pause in
mid-light-saber swipe for a bit of spiritual uplift. So it is with
Bibleman, who in the video ``Shattering the Prince of Pride''
interrupts his duel with the prince to call attention to Proverbs
29:23, about a man's pride bringing him low.
</P>
<P>
   Pride takes a fall in the latest Bibleman adventure, his ninth,
to be released on Aug. 22 by Pamplin Entertainment of Portland,
Ore. Gossip, lies, fear, anger and doubt have gone down in earlier
episodes. Pamplin, according to its promotional literature,
``provides products that nurture families and promote godly
values.'' Long a prominent genre, Christian videos imply
evangelical fervor, but this is not the case with Bibleman, who for
all his biblical citations _ and each clash has one _ relies as
much on reasonableness and common sense.
</P>
<P>
   Bibleman adventures involve the tribulations of young children
threatened by the insidious agents of anger, pride or other hurtful
spiritual conditions, as is the hero himself. Only a careful
assessment of the danger and a measured response will prevail. If
that sounds dire, the series keeps a dry sense of humor about
itself, with tongue-in-cheek observations and asides. Each episode
also takes a break for a musical number, rock to rumba. The
violence, mainly light-saber duels, is jokey, and the children are
kept out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Bibleman is played by Willie Aames, who also writes and directs
the 50-minute episodes. In 1995 Pamplin proposed an action hero for
a children's religious series and asked Aames, a television actor
and born-again Christian, in effect to step into that phone booth
and become Bibleman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this is the dumbest thing I've ever heard,'' Aames
said the other day. Having considered the concept, he suggested
that Bibleman not fly but ``just be a guy who does extraordinary
things.'' Like Batman, in other words, albeit with intimations of
Robocop. At the beginning of each episode, a distraught businessman
named Miles Peterson stands in a rainstorm lamenting his empty
existence. Dumping the contents of his briefcase, he flings himself
to the ground and discovers a Bible buried in the mud. Miles has
found the way.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bruce Wayne of ``Batman,'' he retires to his mansion,
Eaglegate Manor, and together with his Robin, a lightly armored
young man named Cipher, and a talking computer named UNICE, he
awaits spiritual calls of distress from children and their parents.
Current adventures, aimed at 6- to 12-year-olds, include an
archfiend who hangs out with his flunkies in the sewer, and an
elaborate dressing ritual each time Miles Peterson transforms
himself into Bibleman. ``Helmet of salvation,'' intones Cipher,
``breastplate of righteousness, belt of truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales are in the 75,000-cassette range for each episode, Aames
said. The price is $12.99. Any proselytizing comes after the show.
``It's OK to be proud of our accomplishments, but not prideful in
our actions,'' Bibleman says after ``Shattering the Prince of
Pride.'' If children are interested in Jesus, they are advised to
talk to their parents or their pastor. Then they too ``can put on
the full armor of God.''
</P>

   NEW RELEASES
</P>
<P>
   The Cider House Rules
</P>
<P>
   At an orphanage in Maine during World War II, Dr. Wilbur Larch
(Michael Caine, left) performs abortions, assisted by the teen-ager
Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire), whom Dr. Larch regards as his protege
until the day the boy is lured away by a dashing bomber pilot (Paul
Rudd) and his dazzling blond girlfriend, Candy Kendall (Charlize
Theron). In his new life Homer works in an apple orchard, has an
affair with Candy and steps in to help a young woman (Erykah Badu)
in an incestuous situation. A distillation of only a sliver of John
Irving's novel, Lasse Hallstrom's film, Stephen Holden wrote in The
New York Times, nevertheless makes ``a gentle, beautifully acted
fable about a young man's journey into the world.''
</P>
<P>
   _ 1999. Miramax. $107.37: DVD, $32.99. 125 minutes. Closed
captioned. PG-13. Release date: Aug. 15.

<P>
   Erin Brockovich
</P>
<P>
   With two children to support, Erin (Julia Roberts) goes to work
for an ambulance-chasing lawyer named Ed Masry (Albert Finney) and
turns up evidence that a power company has been killing and maiming
people with chromium emissions. Combining a feisty attitude with
short skirts and tight blouses, Erin generates more attention than
the average investigator, and soon Ed has the country's largest
lawsuit on his docket. Early on, Steven Soderbergh's film crackles
with Erin's abrasivesness. Later it becomes ``a doggedly
conventional crusader-for-justice Hollywood soap opera'' (A.O.
Scott).
</P>
<P>
   _ 2000. Universal. $22.98; DVD, $26.98. 127 minutes. Closed
captioned. R. Release date: Aug. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Titus
</P>
<P>
   Julie Taymor's film turns Shakespeare's bloody tale into a fluid
time-traveling fantasia of violence and revenge that has the look
of a sophisticated video game. When the Roman general Titus slays
Tamora's eldest son before her eyes, she and her black servant and
lover (Harry Lennix) plot horrendous vengeance. Staying faithful to
the original text while floating in a surreal time-collapsed world,
`` Taymor discovers many unsettling contemporary resonances''
(Stephen Holden).
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai
</P>
<P>
   In his deconstruction of the samurai epic and gangster movie,
Jim Jarmusch composes a ruminative, bittersweet visual essay on
brutality, honor and tribalism. A modern-day samurai named Ghost
Dog (Forest Whitaker) is pledged to serve a gangster (John Tormey),
a Mafia soldier in a nameless American city. A dreamy collagist
score by RZA and a witty, moving performance by Whitaker help this
film about race relations in a culture unable to think clearly
about the subject. ``This movie seems to suffer from a similar
indecision about itself'' (A.O. Scott).
</P>
<P>
   -1999. Artisan. $112.18; DVD, $24.98. 116 minutes. Closed
captioned. R. Release date: Aug. 15.

<P>
   Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a
theater release, appeared on television or been on videocassette in
earlier editions.
</P>
<P>
   JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS. That's Dennis Hopper under that curly
coiffure, playing Pelias and providing one of the high points of an
often entertaining account of Jason, the hero of Greek legend, and
his quest for the golden fleece. In the NBC mini-series half the
characters drown before they make much of an impression, but, Neil
Genzlinger wrote in The New York Times, ``calamities, not character
studies, are the main attraction here, and several ones the
Argonauts blunder into are skillfully served.'' 2000. Artisan.
$49.98; DVD, $19.98. 179 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   THE WAR ZONE. The most disturbing events in Tim Roth's film take
place in a cement bunker, but the real battlefield is the rural
English home where a teen-ager named Tom (Freddie Cunliffe) looks
at his own family with helpless rage and astonishment. Preoccupied
with a new baby, Tom's mother (Tilda Swinton) has no time for him,
and his father (Ray Winstone) is having sex with his older sister
(Lara Belmont). Treating the pain of this household as literally
unspeakable, Roth favors extreme understatement in a film shot,
Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ``with cool blue-green
tones and spare, painterly precision.'' 1999. New Yorker. $89.99.
99 minutes. No rating.

 &HT;    A football film for the funny bone
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pro football comedy ``The Replacements'' isn't just about
scab players. After the fictional Washington Sentinels football
team goes on strike, replacements are also hired for the pro
cheerleaders. They're strippers.
</P>
<P>
   You can't say Warner Bros. doesn't know how to put butts into
movie theater seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Replacements'' has got it all. Bone-crunching plays.
Boneheaded comedy (the team kicker, a wire-thin Welsh soccer
player, puffs cigs while booting field goals). And a dumb-as-dirt
pep squad whose sideline lap-dance cheers cause the opposition to
fumble a lot.
</P>
<P>
   After a barroom brawl, the jailed scabs line dance to ``I Will
Survive.'' They protect their quarterback by pulling guns and
popping a few into the expensive car of the striking pro player
who's giving all of them such a hard time.
</P>
<P>
   Come game time, there's commentator John Madden (playing
himself), furiously sketching out one of the scab team's ridiculous
plays for a TV audience that's beginning to really like this misfit
team.
</P>
<P>
   Not since ``The Longest Yard'' have moviegoers had this much
dumb football to cheer about.
</P>
<P>
   And dumb it is.
</P>
<P>
   Keanu Reeves stars as scab quarterback Shane ``Footsteps'' Falco
(yes, it's as dumb a name as you'll find at the movies), a
promising player who wound up as a guy who strips barnacles off the
boats of the rich. Gene Hackman plays coach Jimmy McGinty, lured
out of retirement to lead the scab team. Brooke Langton
(``Swingers'') plays Falco's love interest.
</P>
<P>
   They're joined by a gang of actors representing all kinds of
misfits turned gridiron grunts _ from two 2-ton music-industry
security guards and one sumo wrestler to an overaggressive convict
and a foaming-at-the-mouth cop.
</P>
<P>
   While there's plenty in this movie that's mildly funny, ``The
Replacements'' is nothing more than a high school romp.
</P>
<P>
   The striking pro players strut around in a pack, taunting the
scabs like they're all at recess. And while Reeves and Langton do
generate a few sparks, their relationship is so coyly stagedhe One
That I Want.'' The stand-up comic's filmed concert takes us through
her upside-down experiences as the star of the very first

   For the ABC show, she was coerced to drop 30 pounds in two weeks
and behave more ``Asian'' in order to successfully portray herself

caused her kidneys to fail, and the eventual cancellation of her
series inspired her to drink herself into oblivion, choose the
wrong boyfriends and finally struggle back to sobriety.

<P>
   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica - With no national army, a prosperous
economy and an enviable record of free, fair elections, Costa Rica
has been a beacon of peace and stability in a region beset by
military coups, civil wars and corrupt dictatorships.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months this tranquil oasis and beloved tourist
destination has been shaken by a crimewave against residents and
visitors, triggering worries that some of the outside world's
problems may finally be catching up to once-isolated, idyllic Costa
Rica.
</P>
<P>
   Local newspapers have been filled with stories of a few
sensational crimes, including a July kidnapping that resulted in a
shoot-out that left one hostage dead and three police officers
wounded. The country also saw a flurry of unflattering
international stories following the murders of two American college
students on the Caribbean coast in March.
</P>
<P>
   The high-profile cases have sparked a round of national
soul-searching in this country of 3.5 million residents, which
prides itself on being known as the ``Switzerland of Central
America'' because of its long tradition of neutrality and peace.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, a national debate over the causes and proposed
solutions to the crimewave has swirled through this capital city,
with some leaders calling for more police, more prosecutors and
stiffer penalties for criminals. Others say what is needed is a
return to traditional values.
</P>
<P>
   Even an annual religious festival in early August drew attention
to the problem, as Costa Rica's top Catholic cleric prayed for the
country to find a way to end the violence that has upset so many.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception of the citizens about the problem of insecurity
is very high,'' said Rogelio Ramos, Minister of Public Security.
``It's because we have such a long tradition of peace that a small
number of incidents can leave the country shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramos is quick to point out that even with the recent spate of
crimes, Costa Rica is still one of the safest countries in the
hemisphere, with an enviable record of catching and convicting
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the lowest index of murders in the hemisphere, less
than six for every 100,000 residents,'' he said. ``Besides that,
the judicial police solve more than 90 percent of the murders,
which means that if you commit murder here, you have a 90 percent
chance of going to jail for it. ``And more than 70 percent of all
crime here are property crimes that don't involve violence,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Those facts seem lost in the wave of public concern, however.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, one of the country's top law-enforcement officials
told reporters her agency doesn't have the resources to meet the
growing crime problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is worrying,'' said Lineth Saborio, head of the
Costa Rican Office of Judicial Investigations, the country's
equivalent of the FBI. ``The level of violence is beyond the
ability of the police to cope with.''
</P>
<P>
   Her plea for more resources came just as the government is
discussing budgets for next year. While there have been reports
that the agency might suffer some funding cuts, Ramos insisted that
the resources would be found to deal with the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Already, a new investigative team is being formed to fight
kidnappers, he said. The group will receive special training from
the Colombian police, who have lots of experience as their country
suffers the highest rate of kidnapping in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Costa Rican leaders say the increase in crime is due to several
factors, many of which plague other countries, including the United
States. The list includes poverty, a loss of traditional values of
respect for others, the influence of violent television and movies,
violent games and sites on the Internet, and an influx of mostly
poor immigrants from other countries _ some of whom turn to crime
out of desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly worrisome is the fear that juvenile delinquency _
among both boys and girls _ is on the rise. While no hard
statistics are available, news accounts paint portraits of boys
involved in petty theft and even armed crimes, while girls as young
as 12 and 13 have become part of the sex trade. Many of the
customers are foreign visitors attracted to Costa Rica because
prostitution is legal for women 18 and older.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Vargas, former governor of the province that includes San
Jose and now director of youth programs for the Salvation Army,
says the problems stem from broken homes and dysfunctional
families. He worries that the nation is already facing a generation
of lost kids who are growing up to lives of crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're seeing those that 10 years ago were delinquents are
20 years old and involved in serious crime,'' he said. ``In the
last 10 years the problem with drugs has become more acute, but
unfortunately neither the state or society gave it the proper
importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Another major worry for many in Costa Rica is that the growing
crime rate will hurt tourism, which has become one of the nation's
top industries along with agriculture and light manufacturing. Last
year, more than 1 million visitors came to Costa Rica, spending
nearly $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The March murders of Emily Howell of Lexington, Ky. and Emily
Eagen of Ann Arbor, Mich., both of whom had attended Antioch
College in Yellow springs, Ohio, stunned Costa Rica and triggered a
torrent of international publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested two young men for the crime, one of whom was
recently convicted and sentenced to 15 years in jail _ the maximum
allowed in Costa Rica for a juvenile. The other youth, who is an
adult, faces trial soon. Police are still seeking another man, a
Nicaraguan, in the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The two 19-year-old women were staying near the Caribbean resort
of Puerto Viejo when the crime occurred. The area is popular with
college students and young tourists seeking the exotic rhythms and
Caribbean flavor there, but it is also known to be more
crime-ridden than the rest of Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Niehaus, head of the Costa Rican Institute for Tourism, a
Cabinet-level agency, said tourist bookings dropped by about 1
percent in the months immediately following the killings but have
since recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of Costa Rica was shocked by the killings, and we gave our
true feelings to the families,'' he said. ``But it was an isolated
incident. The police acted immediately and two men are now in
jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Niehaus and other top officials reacted aggressively to reassure
would-be travelers that Costa Rica is still a safe destination.
Responding to an invitation from former Florida Gov. Kenneth H.
``Buddy'' MacKay Jr., who is now President Clinton's special envoy
for Latin America, Niehaus headed a delegation of officials to
Miami-Dade County in June. There they studied South Florida's
response to a rash of tourist killings and crimes in the early
1990s that triggered a similar round of negative publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very helpful,'' Niehaus said, noting that Miami had set
up special signs to help guide tourists around the city. ``We are
going to have security brochures printed for visitors to advise
them about how to travel safely, along with information on the
Internet. We're also using more bicycle police, and will have a
special branch of tourist police stationed at the most popular
destinations in Costa Rica.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials have also cracked down on the exploitation of
under-age girls for sex, making several street sweeps and raiding
brothels where the girls were available. Visitors will also soon be
given brochures at the San Jose airport _ the primary gateway for
international tourists _ warning that having sex with under-age
girls is a crime and that if caught they will be punished, Niehaus
said.
</P>
<P>
   For all the publicity and public debate, officials insist that
seasoned travelers recognize that Costa Rica's reputation as a
safe, easygoing place iys been warned to watch out for pick-pockets
and petty thieves, the government seems serious about taking firm
steps against the more serious crimes that could turn their
tourist-rich paradise into a less-than-desirable destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as bad as it has been made to sound,'' Niehaus said.
``But we are taking action. Because of our peaceful reputation, if
we have one high-profile crime, it gets a lot of attention.''

   Cable Offshoot Branches Out
</P>
<P>
   As the new digital technologies continue to transform the movie
business, established companies are looking for ways to protect
their franchise while taking advantage of new opportunities. One
example is IFC Films, an offshoot of the Independent Film Channel
cable network, which was itself an offshoot of Bravo, the upscale
cultural channel that started up in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of Jonathan Sehring, the president of IFC
Films, and Caroline Kaplan, the vice president for production and
development, the company has branched out from creating programs
for its parent network into producing full-length features for
theatrical distribution.
</P>
<P>
   With IFC's ``Boys Don't Cry'' winning an Oscar for the actress
Hilary Swank and ``Girlfight,'' a drama about a female boxer from
Brooklyn, poised to become the indie hit of the fall season, it's
been a good year for Sehring and Kaplan.
</P>
<P>
   But they aren't resting on their laurels. They've just sprung
another offshoot, teaming with the producers Gary Winick and John
Sloss to create Independent Digital Entertainment, aka InDigEnt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it's five movies,'' Sehring said, ``but it's going
to be an ongoing series of movies done by filmmakers with pretty
good casts, inspired by Dogma 95, but with a New York slant.''
</P>
<P>
   Dogma 95 is the semiserious movement spawned by the Danish
filmmaker Lars von Trier as a reaction against Hollywood inflation.
The idea is to make digital video films quickly and cheaply,
without recourse to fancy lighting, special effects or music. ``We
don't have the Dogma rules, other than the budget, which initially
was to make 10 films for $100,000 each,'' Sehring said. ``So for a
million dollars we'll have a whole slate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Half of the revenue, from the first dollar, goes to the
creative talent,'' he said, a radical departure from Hollywood
accounting practices. ``So a lot of pretty well-known actors,
directors and writers are working for scale, because they're
sharing revenue from the outset.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial projects are ``Final,'' directed by Campbell Scott
and starring Denis Leary and Hope Davis, and Ethan Hawke's ``Last
Word on Paradise,'' with Uma Thurman and Kevin Corrigan. ``We're
not into making made-for-cable movies,'' Sehring said. ``When we
make a movie, we want it to go out theatrically and we want it to
go to pay television. We get the cable window after it runs on pay
TV and we get the library rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Non-InDigEnt projects for the next year include ``Waking Life,''
an animated feature directed by Richard Linklater (``Slacker''),
and ``Monsoon Wedding,'' a new film by Mira Nair (``Salaam
Bombay!'') currently shooting in India. ``The one thing we are
steadfast about is not having any creative control over a
project,'' Sehring said, ``which is why we've had a lot of
world-class filmmakers come to work with us, from John Sayles and
Steven Soderbergh early, to Rick and Mira now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're involved when they want us to be involved, and if they
don't want us, we stay away. Rick sometimes feels it's a bit
disconcerting because he hasn't heard from us. He'll call in and
say, `Don't you want to know what's going on?' and we're like,
`Yeah, whenever you want to tell us.' We told you we'd leave you
alone, and we're leaving you alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Donal Who?
</P>
<P>
   When Donal Logue won the best actor award at January's Sundance
Film Festival, for playing Dex, a pudgy Don Juan in Jenniphr
Goodman's ``Tao of Steve,'' he was hailed as a gifted newcomer _ an
ambiguous compliment for this character actor who has appeared in
almost 40 features since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember people at Sundance asking, `Is this your first
movie?''' said Logue on a recent New York visit. ``And I thought,
that's cool. It's weird that you can work so much for 10 years and
support yourself and get around and not appear on the radar
anywhere. But then the times I did appear on the radar, I played
parts so different from each other that people didn't put together
that I was the same guy. And that's cool, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm completely into that element of being unrecognizable to
some degree from part to part to part. Like Jimmy, this weird cab
driver guy that I did on MTV, to the gay cancer guy in `The Band
Played On,' to the vampire in `Blade' whose hand gets cut off, to
Dex in `The Tao of Steve.'''
</P>
<P>
   Logue, in fact, can currently be seen in three movies on New
York screens: ``Steve,'' for which he received warm reviews; ``The
Patriot,'' in which he has a supporting role (a Southern soldier
who overcomes his racism); and ``The Opportunists,'' a hangdog
heist comedy opening today that finds Logue as a not-so-sharp
security guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us want to hit the homer,'' Logue said. ``But movies
are sometimes made in the trenches, by the guys in the smaller
parts. And sometimes you have more freedom, because you have less
to carry so you can do wilder stuff. But at the same time I'm glad,
now that I've had my chance to carry a movie, that people would
respect it.''
</P>
<P>
   A Fable of Immigration
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of ``The Opportunists,'' the film is the work of Myles
Connell, a 36-year-old Dublin native who now lives in Brooklyn. The
film, on one level, is an ironic fable about immigration and the
American dream. Its central character is Michael, a young Irishman
(Peter McDonald) who turns up on the of his long-lost cousin Vic
(Christopher Walken) in Queens. Michael expects to find a
prosperous businessman; instead he finds a safecracker on parole.
Not to be dissuaded from his dream of riches, Michael pressures Vic
into undertaking one last job.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see so many New York crime movies that are just fast cars
and guns and people lying in pools of blood, and I just wanted to
do something different, that was based more around a character who
was just trying to make a go of it,'' Connell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vic to Michael is a little bit of a metaphor for his
relationship to coming to America. For people who come here from
different places, there's much more opportunity to get an education
and so on here. You come to appreciate the things you get here that
maybe you don't get at home. Michael is much more devious, but
there's something of me in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old immigrant neighborhoods, and the way people stay for a
generation or two and then disperse out into the rest of the
country, were fascinating to me,'' Connell said. ``I wanted to
create, out of those neighborhoods, a sense of a village. I showed
the movie in France, and a critic there said he thought it was a
very bucolic film. I took it as a compliment.''

<P>
   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica _ The girls giggle in their classroom. They
laugh and joke with each other as they mop the floors and clean the
bathrooms of the large, comfortable house where they live.
</P>
<P>
   Juanita, who is 14, arranges her teddy bears on her bunk bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it here,'' she says of the shelter for homeless girls
run by the Salvation Army on the outskirts of this capital city.
``It's much prettier than the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Just six months ago, Juanita was a troubled runaway, standing on
a darkened corner in San Jose's tourist district, offering to have
sex with foreign men for money.
</P>
<P>
   Children's' advocates say Central America has become a Mecca for
the sex tourism industry, fed by graphic sites on the Internet that
advertise an anything-goes atmosphere, cheap travel costs and
crackdowns in more well-known sex tourism centers like Thailand and
the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Exploitation of children _ both boys and girls _ is the seamier
underside of the trade.
</P>
<P>
   As Central America's most prosperous, stable nation and its top
tourist destination, Costa Rica has been at the center of an
international spotlight on the problem. Prostitution is legal and
regulated by the government here _ but only for women 18 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedophiles look for three things _ anonymity, poverty and
impunity,'' said Bruce Harris, director of Latin American
operations for Covenant House, a private group that works with
troubled teens in several U.S. cities, as well as in Central
America. ``They find them here. These children are desperate and
vulnerable, and the government has not assumed its responsibility
for taking care of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris cites a U.S. State Department report that estimates as
many as 3,000 underage children may be sexually exploited in Costa
Rica, as well as a United Nations committee that expressed concern
over the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Costa Rican officials say the numbers are a gross exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
   ``To give that type of number is irresponsible,'' said Lilliam
Gomez(CQ Both), the country's top prosecutor for sex crimes. ``It's
clear the problem exists, but not in that dimension.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of their country's reputation as a family-oriented
tourism gem, government officials have taken steps to combat the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   New laws have been passed outlawing sex with children, and
perpetrators face prison terms of up to 10 years. Gomez has been
promised that her understaffed division will be beefed up, although
she has to see any increase in resources.
</P>
<P>
   The government has also funded a national ``Save Our Children''
advertising campaign, featuring television and print ads reminding
the public that children are the nation's most valuable resource.
Brochures will be printed for distribution to arriving visitors,
warning that sex with children is unlawful, while government
Internet sites pushing Costa Rican tourism will do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want those kinds of people coming here, and we don't
want our country known for that type of activity,'' said Costa
Rica's Tourism Minister, Walter Niehaus. ``We take this very
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Police have also cracked down on San Jose's red-light district.
While visitors can still find legal prostitutes in a number of bars
and casinos that cater to tourists, the bands of underage boys and
girls who only a few months ago roamed the district and brazenly
propositioned foreign men are gone.
</P>
<P>
   Several weso hampered the operation of private homes that serve
as brothels.
</P>
<P>
   But under-age prostitutes are still available. Visitors need
only ask a taxi driver outside any of the downtown bars, and they
will be taken to a private home where girls clearly under the age
of 18 make themselves available, sometimes for as little as US$16.
</P>
<P>
   Niehaus says he'll soon start a program in which taxi drivers
will display stickers warning their passengers not to ask for help
in finding young girls for sex.
</P>
<P>
   Harris says the government efforts are inadequate, aimed more at
spiffing up Costa Rica's image than helping the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating,'' he said. ``Until we see a big sign at
the airport showing the pictures of foreigners behind bars instead
of this dancing around to protect the country's image, nothing will
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Vargas, director of children's' programs for the Salvation
Army and a former governor of San Jose province, says the problem
is part of a wider crisis of delinquency and drug-use among Costa
Rica's youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our society has lost its values,'' he said. ``We need a change
in attitude by the public. This problem can't be solved by the
police alone. Society must understand that if we don't help these
children, they will only grow up into lives of crime.''
</P>
<P>
   In rural Costa Rica, girls have traditionally married at a young
age, and while there are no hard statistics, there are reports that
sexual abuse of children within families is not infrequent.
Nationwide, a quarter of Costa Rican mothers have their first child
between the ages of 15 and 18, and 41 percent of children are born
to single mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Juanita _ a fictitious name, since Costa Rican law protects the
identity of minors _ began her prostitution career at age 12.
Living in a rural province, she rebelled against her parents,
sleeping with boys for fun and for pay. She ran away, lived with
the family of a friend, and then was turned over to the child
welfare agency when she got caught having sex with that family's
15-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   She was sent to the Salvation Army shelter in San Jose, but ran
away for about a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was easy to be a prostitute,'' she said. ``I went to a park
and asked around and they told me where to go. I would stand on a
corner. All my clients were foreigners. I made about 30,000 colones
(US$100) a night.''
</P>
<P>
   Her money went for clothes and drugs for her friends. But she
gave it up after growing tired of the hard life on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was ugly and cold,'' she said. ``I like it better here.''
</P>
<P>
   Maricela Barboza, a psychologist at the shelter, said most of
the girls come from broken families, where many were sexually
abused by relatives. Some, like Juanita, stay for months at the
shelter and seem ready to turn their lives around.
</P>
<P>
   But others stay only a few days to rest, clean up and eat well,
before running away again to lives of drugs and exploitation on the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so hard for us to keep them here,'' she said. ``These
girls can make as much in one night as they would earn in one month
in a regular job.''

`INTERN': BRAINS AND GOOD JUDGMENT? IT'S NOT IN THE JOB
DESCRIPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Intern'' takes such relentless glee in skewering the
pretensions of the fashion industry that it's difficult to choose
the nastiest bit in a movie crammed with mean-spirited caricatures
and catty bons mots. My favorite happens to be the moment when
Jocelyn Bennett (Dominique Swain), a sleek young intern at Skirt
magazine, takes a cup of iced cappuccino to Antoinette De la Paix
(Anna Thompson), a grim, bony-faced editor.
</P>
<P>
   After taking one sip, Antoinette realizes something is terribly
wrong, and Jocelyn meekly confesses that the coffee shop ran out of
skim milk and she had to make do with low-fat (2 percent) milk.
Turning ashen, Antoinette begins shaking with rage and screams,
``Oh, God!'' Grabbing a handy wastebasket she promptly vomits.
</P>
<P>
   One suspects that bulimia is epidemic in this wasp's nest of
gaunt, overdressed women and their conniving gay male colleagues,
of which Sebastian Niederfarb (Billy Porter) is a typical example.
Affecting an air of the grand inquisitor, Sebastian imperiously
orders Jocelyn to ``send this fax to Galliano's buttonist's
boyfriend's stylist in Monaco,'' as if he were directing a secret
bombing mission over the Middle East. Paranoia is rampant at Skirt
because someone has been faxing all the magazine's editorial ideas
to its archrival, Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   As for the viability of those ideas, you be the judge. At Skirt,
the editors get worked up over concepts like ``wheelchair chic''
and the fantasy that next year every woman in America will be
wearing a helmet.
</P>
<P>
   With acidic dialogue by the screenwriters Jill Kopelman and
Caroline Doyle, both of whom served time at fashion magazines (and
who have claimed in interviews that every nutty tidbit is based on
an overheard conversation), ``Intern'' has the ingredients of a
nifty satire. But the movie's technical aspects are so shoddy that
it often looks and sounds like a crudely edited home movie. Much of
the acting is amateurish, and the sound is so poor that some of the
dialogue is unintelligible.
</P>
<P>
   The story follows the ascent of poor, persecuted Jocelyn from
despised intern to revered staff member, as she plays sleuth to
uncover the traitor in the magazine's ranks. Swain, who made such a
great screen Lolita, has matured into a bland, cool cookie who
fails to make her character sympathetic or even engaging.
</P>
<P>
   While plotting her climb, Jocelyn also makes romantic headway
with the magazine's art director and ``token heterosexual male,''
Paul Rochester (Ben Pullen), a suave young Englishmen who is
described as being ``as straight as a Marc Jacobs pleat'' and is
rumored to be related to Prince Charles. Before befriending
Jocelyn, Paul allows himself to be the plaything of Resin (Leilani
Bishop), the rudest and most selfish and narcissistic cover girl
ever to sulk down a runaway.
</P>
<P>
   `Intern'' is ultimately as sycophantic as it is needling. Every
few minutes the movie stops dead in its tracks for useless cameo
appearances by the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow, Diane von Furstenberg
and Tommy Hilfiger, among many others. Joan Rivers also appears as
a Skirt editor and fashion fanatic who rants on woodenly about
living for the day when terms like ``leisure suit'' and
``housedress'' are stricken from the language.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest mystery about ``Intern'' is how a film about people
who are obsessed with appearances could wind up looking so
hopelessly drab and tacky.

 &HT;    TV AND POLS TROUBLED OVER CONVENTION ROLE
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Aug. 13.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What if they gave a national political convention
and swing voters swung elsewhere?
</P>
<P>
   That's a deeply seated fear among those charged with shaping the
political coronation of Vice President Al Gore at this week's
Democratic National Convention. From the opening gavel on Monday,
they'll be on the prowl for ways to get undecided voters to pay
more heed.
</P>
<P>
   It also deeply concerns news executives at the nation's major
television networks. After reviewing the recent low viewership of
the Republican National Convention, they may cede an even bigger
piece of the coverage pie to C-SPAN, PBS, all-news cable outlets
and the up-and-coming Internet.
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, the Republican conclave in Philadelphia was a
success, providing Gov. George W. Bush of Texas with a hefty bounce
in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   But it attracted only a small fraction of the 100 million
Americans expected to cast presidential ballots in November.
Viewership continued to fall from 1996 levels, which in turn were a
good deal lower than in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic to me that they're making the conventions perfect
enough to be a television show,'' said CBS President Andrew Heyward
at a Harvard-sponsored panel discussion in Philadelphia on whether
there's a future for televised conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of suspense,'' he said, ``has drained out. It has become
less interesting even as it has been customized for TV over the
years. The audience has changed, and this kind of an active
disengagement from politics is a much bigger issue than convention
coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   In a week of low ratings, ABC News peaked with 7.6 million
viewers when Bush spoke in prime time on thepstart UPN network,
attracted 8.5 million viewers, surpassing everyone's convention
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The downward viewing spiral may be partly due to the tone of the
coverage itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not difficult to find reporters commenting that the
conventions (are) staged photo opportunities devoid of useful
information,'' noted Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg
School of Communication at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The conventions still perform the important role of showcasing
the nominees to a national audience, and the Internet, accessible
to more than 110 million Americans, offers a potential escape valve
from the TV coverage squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the political Web remains a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   It's not yet clear how many people visited the sites maintained
by the ``Internet villages'' making their first significant
appearances this year at both conventions, but the numbers are
thought to be small.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the Republican show ended, the party's own Web site
at www. gopconvention.com was shut down. The Democrats, who have
their comparable convention site up and running at
www.dems2000.com., have yet to decide whether to remain on line
until November.
</P>
<P>
   Funded by the cable companies, C-SPAN has emerged as the de
facto official convention network. Its gavel-to-gavel coverage
freed CNN, Fox, and MSNBC to shape the kind of off-podium
production values that were once the hallmark of the Big Three
networks.
</P>
<P>
   According to a C-SPAN study, for the Republicans CNN devoted 8
hours and 55 minutes to analysis and commentary, against 6 hours
and 21 minutes from the podium. Both Fox and MSNBC also turned at
least 8 hours of their coverage over to commentators, with MSNBC
offering a relatively scant 4 hours and 17 minutes from the podium.
</P>
<P>
   For all of their efforts, the cable audiences were small
compared to what the old-line networks commanded. During the final
night of the GOP convention, CNN drew an average of 1.55 million
viewers, followed by Fox with 1.14 million and MSNBC's 506,000
viewers.

FOR OLD MONEY, A NEW HOME ON WALL STREET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa., Colo.)   By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Coin collecting is one field that is, literally,
child's play. The U. S. Mint reports that millions of Americans
collect coins, new and old, and that of these, tens of thousands
are children who are on the prowl for historic American gold,
silver and copper coins. Now there is a new source in Manhattan for
coins, as well as historical American documents.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street Rarities, at 44 Wall St., is a new gallery housed in
a former bank, and it has retained the bank's 1920s two-story vault
with a 4-foot-thick circular steel door. The counters and walls
display rare coins, historical documents, letters and historical
paintings. The gallery also has a site on the Internet:
www.wsrarities.com, which is geared to both the amateur and serious
collector.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery, whose logo is ``own a piece of history,'' is just
yards from the spot where George Washington was inaugurated as
president.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street Rarities was founded in 1999 by two young
entrepreneurs. William T. Anton III, the president, is a
third-generation numismatist who has collected coins since
childhood. Now 33, he studied at Princeton, Oxford and Harvard Law
School and worked for Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &AMP; Katz, the Manhattan
law firm, for five years before returning to his hobby full time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was at Oxford I used to visit the small coin dealers,''
Anton said. ``I realized that it's a very decentralized business.
Then, as a lawyer specializing in industry consolidations, I
realized I could take my hobby and build a national business.''
</P>
<P>
   So he left the law firm. ``I wanted to bring the passion of
collecting to the mass market,'' he said. ``I'm democratizing
collecting, taking out the elitism and intimidation. It's like what
the Web has done to investing. Now everyone is an investor. I want
everyone to be able to be a collector.''
</P>
<P>
   Prices for the gallery's coins range from $29.95 for a 2000 U.S.
silver coin depicting Standing Lady Liberty to $575,000 for a rare
1792 silver-center cent, the first of the United States-pattern
cents made by David Rittenhouse, the Mint's first director. It
shows the head of Liberty with flowing hair and the date and the
inscription ``Liberty Parent of Science &AMP; Industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Anton estimates there are at least 100,000 collectors of vintage
coins in America. Stephen L. Bobbitt, the press officer of the
American Numismatic Association, a nonprofit group based in
Colorado, said there are about 75,000 ``very serious'' collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Anton's business partner, Seth T. Kaller, is the firm's director
of rare documents and works of art, including a painting of George
Washington _ the so-called Goldsborough-Frelinghuysen portrait,
circa 1789-1791 _ by Charles Willson Peale, a saddler and
woodcarver, the father of a dynasty of American painters.
</P>
<P>
   Kaller, 35, grew up working in his family's business, which
specialized in rare stamps and coins. After graduating from the
University of Pennsylvania in 1988, he began to advise museums and
private clients trying to acquire historical documents. He became
the exclusive acquisition agent for the Gilder Lehrman Collection,
which contains 50,000 historic American documents now on deposit at
the Pierpont Morgan Library in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   One part of this collection is a series of working drafts of the
United States Constitution, which was used as the basis of a
college textbook, ``The Boisterous Sea of Liberty: A Documentary
History of America from Discovery Through the Civil War,'' by David
Brion Davis and Steven Mintz (Oxford University Press, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   Anton and Kaller suggested that people collect in different
ways. ``Some buy only coins,'' Anton said. ``We also help people
collect around a person or a theme. If you like George Washington,
here you can buy a Washington-era coin, an original letter written
by Washington, and a pair of George and Martha Washington
``porthole'' portraits, circa 1859, painted by Rembrandt Peale.''
(The original ``porthole'' portrait of Washington, painted in 1823,
is on display in the Capitol. There are thought to be about 80
replicas.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of seven pairs that remain together, including those
at the Met and Smithsonian,'' Anton said.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend Wall Street Rarities will have a booth at the
World's Fair of Money, the American Numismatic Association's annual
convention, at the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia.
It is free and runs through Sunday. There will be about 1,500
dealers at the show, which also sponsors seminars and courses for
young numismatists. Bobbitt said 20,000 people are expected to
attend.
</P>
<P>
   Quite apart from its more affordable coins and documents, Wall
Street Rarities has grouped 100 documents into a package it calls
``The Founding of America Collection,'' which carries a price tag
of $8.5 million and is on view at the gallery. ``We're selling the
collection as a unit because we are hoping to find a client who
will want to exhibit it in a public way,'' Kaller said.
</P>
<P>
   It includes several documents that one would expect to find only
in museums. There is a first New York edition of Thomas Paine's
``Common Sense,'' the pamphlet advocating that the American
colonies separate from Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This 1776 piece is credited with changing history,'' Anton
said. There is a copy of the circular signed by John Hancock and
others on Sept. 14, 1768, railing against the taxes ``imposed upon
the People without their consent,'' the seminal document laying out
the cry ``No Taxation Without Representation!''
</P>
<P>
   A Declaration of Independence from July 4, 1776, printed in
Massachusetts, shows signs of folding and wear and was probably
originally tacked onto the door of a church. According to Kaller,
in 1776 more than 1,000 broadsides of the Declaration were printed
and distributed to ministers of all denominations to read to their
congregations. ``Five hundred were printed in Philadelphia, of
which 25 are known to survive,'' he said. ``Fourteen are known to
survive from Massachusetts, and this is an official Massachusetts
broadside.'' He noted that the Declaration of Independence was not
actually signed until August.
</P>
<P>
   On July 29 Sotheby's sold another broadside, the so-called
Dunlap Declaration of Independence, on Sothebys.com for $8.14
million.
</P>
<P>
   The collection also includes one of the first original
facsimiles of the Declaration, known as the ``Stone'' printing.
Secretary of State John Quincy Adams saw that the original
Declaration was showing signs of wear so he commissioned William J.
Stone to engrave an exact copy. Congress ordered 201 official
copies of the Declaration to be printed and distributed to
surviving signers, families of the signers, General Lafayette, the
president and other public servants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original Declaration of Independence, in the National
Archives, is badly faded,'' Kaller pointed out. ``There are 31
copies known to survive, including ours, and 19 of them are
permanently housed in public collections.''
</P>
<P>
   A letter from Abigail Adams to Hannah Cushing in 1802 puts a
personal stamp on the politics of the day. Thomas Jefferson had
defeated her husband, and there was a major shift in the leadership
of the new nation. ``The Golden Age Is Past,'' Adams wrote. ``God
Grant That It May Not Be Succeeded By An Age of Terror.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Founding of America Collection'' is on view through August
and the Washington portraits through Sept. 15. The gallery's next
special exhibition, opening on Aug. 21, is ``Highlights of
History,'' with documents from Napoleon, Churchill, Einstein,
Machiavelli and Catherine de Medici.

   NEW YORK _ The Hearst Newspapers are commemorating the 49th
anniversary of the death of William Randolph Hearst. Along with
numerous other writings, he penned this poem, and reprinting it is
our traditional method of remembering our founder on each
anniversary of his death, Aug. 14, 1951.
</P>
<P>
   THE SONG OF THE RIVER
</P>
<P>
   The snow melts on the mountain
</P>
<P>
   And the water runs down to the spring,
</P>
<P>
   And the spring in a turbulent fountain,
</P>
<P>
   With a song of youth to sing,
</P>
<P>
   Runs down to the riotous river,
</P>
<P>
   And the river flows to the sea,
</P>
<P>
   And the water again
</P>
<P>
   Goes back in rain
</P>
<P>
   To the hills where it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   And I wonder if life's deep mystery
</P>
<P>
   Isn't much like the rain and the snow
</P>
<P>
   Returning through all eternity
</P>
<P>
   To the places it used to know.
</P>
<P>
   For life was born on the lofty heights
</P>
<P>
   And flows in a laughing stream,
</P>
<P>
   To the river below
</P>
<P>
   Whose onward flow
</P>
<P>
   Ends in a peaceful dream.
</P>
<P>
   And so at last,
</P>
<P>
   When our life has passed
</P>
<P>
   And the river has run its course,
</P>
<P>
   It again goes back,
</P>
<P>
   O'er the selfsame track,
</P>
<P>
   To the mountain which was its source.
</P>
<P>
   So why prize life
</P>
<P>
   Or why fear death,
</P>
<P>
   Or dread what is to be?
</P>
<P>
   The river ran
</P>
<P>
   Its allotted span
</P>
<P>
   Till it reached the silent sea.
</P>
<P>
   Then the water harked back
</P>
<P>
   To the mountain-top
</P>
<P>
   To begin its course once more.
</P>
<P>
   So we shall run
</P>
<P>
   The course begun
</P>
<P>
   Till we reach the silent shore.
</P>
<P>
   Then revisit earth
</P>
<P>
   In a pure rebirth
</P>
<P>
   From the heart of the virgin snow.
</P>
<P>
   So don't ask why
</P>
<P>
   We live or die,
</P>
<P>
   Or whither, or when we go,
</P>
<P>
   Or wonder about the mysteries
</P>
<P>
   That only God may know.

`THE MISSIONARY AND THE LIBERTINE': BEHIND THE ENDURING CLICHES OF
ASIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, now, Ian Buruma, the British journalist, has been
writing some of the most trenchant and sophisticated commentary
around on that very large portion of the cultural-political world
known as Asia. In his new book, ``The Missionary and the
Libertine,'' he reproduces essays that have appeared elsewhere _
most often in The New York Review of Books _ and adds a thematic
introduction to explain his intriguing title.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a sensual, even erotic, element in encounters _
imaginary or real _ between East and West since the ancient
Greeks,'' Buruma writes, setting out the libertine aspect of his
theme. This is complicated, but westerners have often dreamed of
Asia as a zone of hedonism, he says, of guiltless liberation from
the ``cold, pinched and dreary climate of the Christian, especially
Protestant, West'' _ in other words, from the missionaries.
</P>
<P>
   Asia, at times, he writes further, has bought into these
contrasting images _ the West as the masculine master of
discipline, the East as supine and passive _ with interestingly
paradoxical results. Authoritarian Asian governments like
Singapore's or China's, criticized for human rights abuses, have
replied that they embody ``Asian values'' and therefore repudiate
the moral laxness that comes with too much individual freedom.
Buruma argues that ``Asian values'' are readaptations of the
missionary idea, that Asia was complacent and soft while the West
represented hard work and moral propriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``The missionaries, then, have taken post in Kuala Lumpur, and
the whores of Babylon have moved to London and New York,'' Buruma
writes.
</P>
<P>
   The essays that he has included in this collection bear in one
way or another on this theme, though often rather loosely, and that
fact illustrates both the virtues and the shortcomings of this new
book. As always, Buruma is a pleasure to read. He displays a
remarkable breadth and he writes with a kind of unassuming
authority about matters that he has thought deeply about. One
essay, wittily entitled ``Samurai of Swat,'' delves into Japanese
baseball and what it tells us of the Japanese self-conception: a
great deal as it turns out. This essay is one of the most directly
relevant to the sexualized images of Buruma's main theme, beginning
with the shock that rocked Japan in 1964 when a huge Dutchman named
Anton Geesink beat the Japanese judo champion for the gold medal at
the Tokyo Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judo was not just a national sport,'' Baruma writes,``it
symbolized the Japanese way _ spiritual, disciplined, infinitely
subtle; a way in which crude Western brawn would inevitably lose to
superior Oriental spirit. And here, in Tokyo, a big, blond
foreigner had humiliated Japan in front of the entire world. It was
as though the ancestral Sun Goddess had been raped in public by a
gang of alien demons.''
</P>
<P>
   A book of essays is almost by definition thematically diffuse,
and not all of Buruma's essays are focused clearly to a central
concept, much less advance one. Some of the selections, informed
and perceptive as they are, are dated: Buruma's essay on the fallen
Pakistani leader Benazir Bhutto, written before she fell, for
example. They illustrate the limitations inherent in putting
previously published work under a single cover, rather than
developing ideas into a book from scratch. (Actually, Buruma has
written several books from scratch, including ``Anglomania: A
European Love Affair'' and ``God's Dust: A Modern Asian Journey.'')
Still, the essays are remarkably varied and of consistent high
quality, and demonstrate that, talent aside, it's useful when
reflecting on the world to do so from a solid base of knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Among Buruma's topics are several Indian figures, or Westerners
who were captivated by India. He writes brilliantly about the
filmmaker Satyajit Ray and the writers Nirad C. Chaudhuri and V.S.
Naipaul. But perhaps the most absorbing of his India essays is one
on the poignant and bitter love affair between the Romanian
mythologist Mircea Eliade and the Indian writer Maitreyi Devi. This
chapter, like ``Samurai of Swat,'' relates closely to the erotic
history of East and West, having at its core a near cliche:
``Young, romantic Westerner falls in love with mysterious Oriental
girl and, through her, with the mysterious Orient, only to bang his
head on the prison wall of exclusive Oriental customs.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Buruma teases out the Roshomonesque nature of the story _
the love affair was seen very differently by the parties to it _ he
evokes a rich panorama of East and West, and of the conflict
between the rationalism that is supposedly Western and the
fascination for the irrational that is supposedly of the East.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is the other principal subject for Buruma, and he takes
several different bearings on that country, treating topics as
varied as sadomasochism among early 20th-century writers, the
sexual fantasies of the filmmaker Nagisa Oshima and Michael
Crichton's anti-Japanese novel ``Rising Sun'' (which Buruma
compares to German works of the 1930s showing the supposed menace
of the Jews).
</P>
<P>
   He also includes a marvelously pithy, probing review of a novel
by the Japanese writer Banana Yoshimoto, who, when she was still in
her 20's, had sold six million copies of her first two novels. He
links that astonishing commercial success to another
literary-commercial phenomenon in Japan, the fascination with a
kind of innocent androgyny among teen-age girls, finding that both
are related to the sense among the Japanese that once they have
passed a certain age, the options for women become seriously
limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since family duties are (or at any rate were) particularly
onerous in Japan and sex roles so rigidly defined,'' he writes,
``it is no wonder that young girls so often long to stop time and
to retreat into a fantasy world of purity, androgyny and
prepubescence.''.
</P>
<P>
   That sentence perfectly illustrates Buruma's knack for holding
some cultural artifact up to the light and perceiving something
otherwise obscure, erotic and plausible glimmering within it.

`SUNSET STRIP': YOUTH IS WASTED ON THE DELUDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.)  
 By DAVE KEHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Here's something different: a youth comedy so
relentlessly sordid and depressing that it's likely to send its
audience straight into the arms of the nearest
psycho-pharmacologist.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``Sunset Strip'' is so different that it has been
gathering dust on a shelf at 20th Century Fox for almost a year,
and is now being released only to a single theater in New York, the
Village East.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, of course, orphan movies turn out to be imaginative
and innovative films that are just too difficult for the studio to
sell.
</P>
<P>
   This is not one of those times. Directed by the debutant Adam
Collis and written by Randall Jahnson (``The Doors'') and Russell
DeGrazier, ``Sunset Strip'' seems so fundamentally misconceived
that it's hard to imagine how it ever survived the first pitch
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Set in a low-budget version of 1972 (which means lots of orange
and brown interiors and nary a single sweeping image of the Los
Angeles boulevard that gives the film its name), ``Sunset Strip''
follows seven main characters through a single, late summer day.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy (the British newcomer Anna Friel) is a clothing designer
with a shop conveniently situated catty-corner from the famous L.A.
rock club Whisky-a-Go-Go, which allows her to have
near-simultaneous sex with an up-and-coming country rocker (Jared
Leto) and a visiting Scottish superstar (Tommy J. Flanagan).
</P>
<P>
   Zack (Nick Stahl) is a fuzzy-faced, novice guitarist who
believes that Jimi Hendrix came down in a dream to designate him as
his successor. He spends his day getting ready for his professional
debut at the Whisky, where he'll open for Flanagan's character and
falling fruitlessly in love with an attractive older woman who
lives in a mansion down the canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Felix (Rory Cochrane) is a booze-addled songwriter whose fondest
dream is about killing himself with a mix of vodka and pills.
Shapiro (Adam Goldberg) is a hustling talent agent from the Valley
with a white boy Afro that suggests a Chia pet on steroids. Michael
(Simon Baker) is the shy, color-blind photographer whose discovery
that he has caught a venereal disease from a cocktail waitress
kicks off the ``La Ronde''-like plot. The infection spreads through
most of the cast _ and eventually, it appears, through most of
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Jahnson and DeGrazier have written the film as a series of nasty
confrontations, perfunctory sex and shattering dreams, all directed
by Collis with the same claustrophobic staging, shrill line
readings and slack pacing. Only a knowledge of movie conventions _
she is, after all, the lead _ allows us to determine that Friel is
meant to embody a grand romantic ideal; her character's actual
conduct is by turns ditzy, opportunistic and cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Much like 1998's ``54,'' set at New York's chic night club of
the '70s, Studio 54, ``Sunset Strip'' projects a kind of oddly sour
nostalgia, suggesting that the good old days were actually pretty
awful. Maybe this is the message that teen-age filmgoers, fed up
with mom and dad's tales of their glorious youth, most deeply want
to hear. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunset Strip'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It includes strong language, casual sex
and prodigious substance abuse.

`BLESS THE CHILD': IT'S HARD TO REAR AN ANGEL, ESPECIALLY IN DEVIL
TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELVIS MITCHELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new thriller ``Bless the Child'' is runny with heartbreak;
it's a supernatural soap opera. Maggie (Kim Basinger) is a
dedicated psychiatric nurse who has a warm, flattering light on her
even when she rides in the back of a Manhattan bus. When her angry
younger sister, Jenna (Angela Bettis), shows up with a newborn
daughter, old family conflicts flare. Maggie growls at Jenna for
being a drug addict, and Jenna snaps back that at least she was
able to give birth, leaving her barren sister speechless. Then
Jenna leaves altogether, abandoning Cody, her little girl, at
Maggie's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bless the Child'' is an ecumenical suspense story, directed by
Chuck Russell with an attempt at the hushed elegance of ``The Sixth
Sense.'' Despite a few chills, the movie is more like ``The
Exorcist'' or ``The Omen'' with a happy face drawn on its soul _
the first suspense film of the ``Touched by an Angel'' era. Just
when you think that the movie is trying to show a little class,
Russell does something like send a car off a bridge, and then has
it explode as it hurtles toward the water.
</P>
<P>
   In one scene, Ian Holm appropriates Kevin Spacey's line from
``The Usual Suspects'' _ ``the Devil's greatest trick is convincing
people he doesn't exist'' _ without bursting into laughter. Gothic
stridor and ominous chanting issue from the soundtrack so often
that you'd think ``Rosemary's Baby'' was playing on a television
set in the other room. ``Bless the Child'' seems derivative of so
many other movies that you're surprised that it doesn't have to
credit its sources the way hip-hop artists do when they sample
songs.
</P>
<P>
   Maggie rears Cody on her own, and though the girl at age 6 is
labeled autistic, Maggie believes that it's something else. ``She's
special,'' she says, doting on Cody's otherworldliness. When a
cleaned-up Jenna _ now married to Eric (Rufus Sewell), a rich,
creepy and powerful cult leader who seems to be trying to repress a
British accent _ returns for Cody, Maggie smells that something
wicked this way comes. There is a brief touch of wit: As Maggie
fears that Cody is going to be taken away by Jenna and Eric, a
television cartoon shows a small animal being scooped up by a giant
talon.
</P>
<P>
   The screenwriters, Tom Rickman, Clifford Green and Ellen Green,
have carved away all the surplus plot of Cathy Cash Spellman's
novel, a potboiler crammed with incident: a custody battle from
beyond the grave, with trips to Egypt and great, musty tombs.
</P>
<P>
   Russell and the writers have also pared away the doom patrol
Maggie assembled in the novel to fight the forces of evil for Cody.
Her ally in the film is an FBI agent, John Travis (Jimmy Smits), a
former seminary student who is also an expert in santeria (to whose
forces Smits succumbed in ``The Believers,'' another mediocre
picture about Satan in New York).
</P>
<P>
   Holliston Coleman, the young actress playing Cody, has a
forehead that furrows with concern and an adult cleft in her little
chin. With her faraway look, she's enormously compelling, a real
find. Bettis, all red-rimmed eyes and shaky grip on stability, does
well, too.
</P>
<P>
   Christina Ricci turns up to deliver some important exposition,
and disappears; she might as well be one of the mysterious
strangers who step in to help Maggie with her quest, including a
construction worker who has the languid, dark-blond looks of a
Renaissance Jesus. In the end, though, Maggie has to do battle
herself, since this is also a test of faith for her; she's a lapsed
Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   Basinger speaks very slowly and intently, as if she is
self-medicated, until Maggie learns that Cody will be sacrificed on
Easter and shakes off her well-meaning stupor, bolting into action.
Eventually, ``Bless the Child'' is tiresome, though you have to
have a soft spot for a movie in which the commercialized self-help
movement _ Eric's motto is ``Do what you will, will what you do'' _
is equated with Satanism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bless the Child'' is off kilter enough to be unsettling. It
features a string of offscreen child murders, a scene in which Eric
has an epistemological conversation with Cody as he threatens to
shove her off a roof ( Coleman is so good that she almost makes it
work) and a confrontation between Maggie and Jenna in which Maggie
gasps, ``Drugs!,'' as if heroin were a brand name she was afraid to
utter. The scares may be only intermittent, but the oddities
remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bless the Child'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It includes violence, profanity, child
endangerment and scenes of ghastly special effects, including
armies of rats. &QL;

CONCORDE INVESTIGATORS LOOK AT METAL STRIP AS CAUSE OF CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ French investigators looking into the crash last month
of an Air France Concorde said Thursday it was probable that a
16-inch piece of metal found on the runway caused a tire to blow
out, sending debris from the tire through fuel tanks and triggering
a fire that brought down the plane.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the investigators had offered a probable
explanation of why the jet caught fire on takeoff and crashed into
a hotel north of Paris on July 25, killing 113 people.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Accident Investigations, which is looking into the
causes of the crash, said in a statement that the metal strip
appeared to match the shape of a gash found in one of the plane's
left-side tires, and that it was `'probable that this piece caused
the cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the disaster 16 days ago, investigators have focused on
the possibility that a tire blew out and that its debris damaged
the plane, starting the fire.
</P>
<P>
   In their statement Thursday, the investigators said that the
bursting of the tire while the plane was moving down the runway at
about 195 mph threw up large pieces of the tire, some of them
weighing as much as 9 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators steered clear of a final explanation, but they
said that as a result of the debris from the tire, ``one of several
fuel tanks on the left wing was very rapidly damaged, with as a
consequence a very important fuel leak and fire.'' Exactly how this
happened had not yet been determined, they said.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier statements, the investigators had said that tire
marks found on the runway after the crash showed that the aircraft
had veered to the left before taking off. They also said that in
addition to traces of tire marks, pieces of a water deflector fixed
above the left-side tires and debris from a fuel tank had been
found on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the investigators further reported that parts of the
plane's No. 5 fuel tank were found. The Concorde is outfitted with
seven fuel tanks in each wing.
</P>
<P>
   The tires on the Concorde are supplied by the Goodyear Tire and
Rubber Co., which manufactures them at a factory in Virginia. Last
week, Goodyear officials confirmed that the company's specialists
had been sent to France to assist the investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators have thus far been unable to determine whether
the metal strip was part of the Concorde. Xavier Mulot, a captain
in the French air transport police who is conducting a parallel
legal investigation of the crash, said at a news conference that he
could not say if the metal strip belonged to the Concorde. Last
week, investigators from the Bureau of Accident Investigations said
they believed the piece was not a part of the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Work was suspended last week because of health concerns, after
asbestos particles were found in the debris. But Thursday
investigators resumed work, collecting and sorting out debris from
the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have been gathering remains from the Concorde's
four engines and seeking to reassemble key parts of the plane to
determine the cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Attention has focused on the placement of the engines. A report
in the British publication New Scientist, the contents of which
were released Thursday, stated that a study commissioned in 1998 by
British Airways, which also flies the Concorde, revealed 55
``significant risks'' inherent in the design of the plane's jet
engines.
</P>
<P>
   Among the risks, the report cited the danger of uncontrolled
fire and multiple engine failure.

 &HT;    But thriller too heavy on the cheese
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ There are so few Communists anymore, the
Mafia is passe, and the conservatives have all turned
compassionate. Where can the movies find a really nasty villain
these days?
</P>
<P>
   Would you believe . . . ``Satan''?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the devil himself, or at least a cult of baddies that
worships him, is out to quash the forces of righteousness in a
corny, but admittedly creepy little tale of Messiahs and
anti-Messiahs, ``Bless the Child.'' Fans of ``The Exorcist,'' ``The
Omen'' and ``The Prophecy'' will soon have a new good-vs.-evil tug
of war to add to their video libraries. Those less enamored of the
genre will get a few fright jolts from the experience but also a
few giggles as the movie veers toward its fire-and-brimstone
climax.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, while the tale based on a novel by Cathy Cash Spellman
is laying its sort of plausible foundation, as characters are still
acting somewhat normally, ``Bless the Child'' draws us into its
spooky web. The child in question is Cody, diagnosed as autistic,
but perhaps she is simply tuned in to a higher power.
</P>
<P>
   Dumped by her drug-addicted mother, Jenna, on her Aunt Maggie
(Kim Basinger, who really needs a new agent or at least a script
adviser), Cody does seem to be receiving weird signals from
somewhere, plus she has some telekinetic powers and an ability to
bring birds and other beings back from the dead. Maggie bonds with
the tot and would do anything to see that no harm comes to her. Her
commitment naturally will be sorely tested.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, someone is murdering youngsters who were born on a
particular date, which also happens to be Cody's birthday. Just
when it seems clear that she is the target of a satanic cult, up
pops Jenna married to former child star Eric Stark (Rufus Sewell),
who now runs a self-empowerment mill that teaches we have no need
for God. Uh-oh, that will never do in this more spiritual new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Director Chuck Russell (''The Mask'') is serving up some pretty
obvious white hats/black hats stuff, but perhaps he will find a
responsive audience for it. At a screening this week, the crowd
broke into spontaneous applause three times as Cody (precious and
precocious Holliston Coleman) stood up to the malevolent Stark. Of
course those forces of good have the edge in audience sentiment,
but the bad guys have all the cool special effects.
</P>
<P>
   Elevating this B-level material is an impressive cast that
rarely lets on that it is slumming. Well, OK, Basinger's
performance is self-righteously cheesy, but Jimmy Smits lends
gravitas as the FBI agent who specializes in cult murders, and
Christina Ricci chews up the scenery as a druggie. She tries to
escape Stark's orbit and gets a ``Sleepy Hollow''-like beheading
for her efforts. Late and very briefly, Sir Ian Holm shows up as a
wheelchair-bound reverend. Either most of his role was chopped
away, or he told Russell that he could only give him a day's worth
of shooting.
</P>
<P>
   If you absolutely must sustain a few cinematic fright jolts this
summer, ``Bless the Child'' will probably provide them for you. But
you can bet that some of its sillier excesses will end up being
spoofed in ``Scary Movie 2.''

 &HT;    TV AND POLS TROUBLED OVER CONVENTION ROLE
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Aug. 13.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What if they gave a national political convention
and swing voters swung elsewhere?
</P>
<P>
   That's a deeply seated fear among those charged with shaping the
political coronation of Vice President Al Gore at this week's
Democratic National Convention. From the opening gavel on Monday,
they'll be on the prowl for ways to get undecided voters to pay
more heed.
</P>
<P>
   It also deeply concerns news executives at the nation's major
television networks. After reviewing the recent low viewership of
the Republican National Convention, they may cede an even bigger
piece of the coverage pie to C-SPAN, PBS, all-news cable outlets
and the up-and-coming Internet.
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, the Republican conclave in Philadelphia was a
success, providing Gov. George W. Bush of Texas with a hefty bounce
in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   But it attracted only a small fraction of the 100 million
Americans expected to cast presidential ballots in November.
Viewership continued to fall from 1996 levels, which in turn were a
good deal lower than in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic to me that they're making the conventions perfect
enough to be a television show,'' said CBS President Andrew Heyward
at a Harvard-sponsored panel discussion in Philadelphia on whether
there's a future for televised conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of suspense,'' he said, ``has drained out. It has become
less interesting even as it has been customized for TV over the
years. The audience has changed, and this kind of an active
disengagement from politics is a much bigger issue than convention
coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   In a week of low ratings, ABC News peaked with 7.6 million
viewers when Bush spoke in prime time on the closing night.
</P>
<P>
   According to Nielsen Media Research, ABC's network rivals fared
worse. NBC News averaged 6.1 million viewers on that Thursday,
followed by CBS with 4.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, ``WWF Smackdown!'', a Thursday wrestling event in
the 9-10 p.m. hour on the upstart UPN network, attracted 8.5
million viewers, surpassing everyone's convention audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The downward viewing spiral may be partly due to the tone of the
coverage itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not difficult to find reporters commenting that the
conventions (are) staged photo opportunities devoid of useful
information,'' noted Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg
School of Communication at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The conventions still perform the important role of showcasing
the nominees to a national audience, and the Internet, accessible
to more than 110 million Americans, offers a potential escape valve
from the TV coverage squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the political Web remains a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   It's not yet clear how many people visited the sites maintained
by the ``Internet villages'' making their first significant
appearances this year at both conventions, but the numbers are
thought to be small.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the Republican show ended, the party's own Web site
at www. gopconvention.com was shut down. The Democrats, who have
their comparable convention site up and running at
www.dems2000.com., have yet to decide whether to remain on line
until November.
</P>
<P>
   Funded by the cable companies, C-SPAN has emerged as the de
facto official convention network. Its gavel-to-gavel coverage
freed CNN, Fox, and MSNBC to shape the kind of off-podium
production values that were once the hallmark of the Big Three
networks.
</P>
<P>
   According to a C-SPAN study, for the Republicans CNN devoted 8
hours and 55 minutes to analysis and commentary, against 6 hours
and 21 minutes from the podium. Both Fox and MSNBC also turned at
least 8 hours of their coverage over to commentators, with MSNBC
offering a relatively scant 4 hours and 17 minutes from the podium.
</P>
<P>
   For all of their efforts, the cable audiences were small
compared to what the old-line networks commanded. During the final
night of the GOP convention, CNN drew an average of 1.55 million
viewers, followed by Fox with 1.14 million and MSNBC's 506,000
viewers.

 &HT;    Football film fumbles, stumbles
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If you like your football movies as
sugar-coated as your cereal, then huddle around ``The
Replacements.'' Loosely inspired by the 1987 National Football
League players' strike, it is the sort of hokum in which:
</P>
<P>
   _ Virtually every play is a pass and every game will be decided
by the final play.
</P>
<P>
   _ The players on the opposing teams keep losing their ability to
tackle.
</P>
<P>
   _ Everyone, from the substitute coach to the scab players, has
an opportunity for personal growth and redemption.
</P>
<P>
   _The has-been (or never-was) fill-in quarterback learns how to
be a leader, earning the love of the fans and the curvaceous head
cheerleader.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the world of ``The Replacements,'' a salute to a ragtag
bunch of amateurs enlisted to masquerade as the Washington
Sentinels. Finishing out the season, or at least until the pros'
work stoppage ends, they need to win three out of four games to
make it into the playoffs. Wanna bet it all comes down to a
cliffhanger in the final game?
</P>
<P>
   Like a master criminal readying a heist caper, Coach McGinty
(Gene Hackman, phoning in his performance from ``Hoosiers'')
gathers an odd assortment of characters for the team. There's the
fast-moving convenience-store guard, the pub-crawling Welsh soccer
player, the antisocial ex-convict, the jelly-belly sumo wrestler
and, well, you get the idea. Oh, and Shane Falco (whoa, dude, it's
inexpressive Keanu Reeves), the promising college quarterback who
choked so publicly in the Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Replacements'' has some amusing detours, but the
screenplay by Vince McKewin (''Fly Away Home'') is awfully
inconsistent. There's a nicely nutty scene in the locker room,
where McGinty shows he is no Knute Rockne, reaching for an
inspirational speech about fears that is taken too literally by his
players. After a barroom brawl with the strikers, the scabs get
locked up in a spacious jail cell, large enough for them to break
into a carefully choreographed rendition of ``I Will Survive.''
</P>
<P>
   At moments like these, we realize that director Howard Deutch
isn't interested in making a sports movie as much as emulating the
feel-good, blue-collar underdog triumph formula of ``The Full
Monty.''
</P>
<P>
   If only the script didn't let him down so often, like a rookie
letting a Hail Mary pass slip through his fingers. At regular
intervals, characters spout clunky, maudlin speeches about heart
and pride. You would swear that the Screenwriters Guild had gone on
strike and these sequences had been scribbled by a scab scribe.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch, who directed ``Grumpier Old Men,'' seems intent on
making another sequel with the grouchy, anemic byplay of Hackman
and Jack Warden as the Sentinels' wealthy owner. But they seem
positively lively next to Pat Summerall and John Madden, who appear
intermittently to interject cloyingly cute commentary.
</P>
<P>
   As Oliver Stone showed last year with ``Any Given Sunday,'' it
is not easy to make a sports movie without running headlong into a
wall of cliches. At least ``The Replacements''is a lot less
pretentious and features a lot fewer film clips from ``Ben-Hur.''
Although it would love us to root for these strike-breaking misfits
and to get wrapped up in their dreams of glory, it isn't easy when
the movie fumbles so often.

A HARD LOOK AT THE HARSH TACTICS OF MASTER CORPORATE POLITICIANS
</HEADLINE>

   ``Eat or Be Eaten: Jungle Warfare for the Master Corporate
Politician'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Phil Porter &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prentice Hall Press &QL;
</P>
<P>
   293 pages, $22 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Anyone intent on scaling the forbidding heights of upper-echelon
corporate management would be well-advised to take along the
survival kit that Phil Porter has put together.
</P>
<P>
   Porter's sardonic reflection on intra-corporation office
politics, ``Eat or Be Eaten,'' is based upon his 28 years of
competing for power, promotion and sheer survival in a world where
only the cunning avoid being figuratively ground into hamburger and
consumed.
</P>
<P>
   The advice contained in ``Eat'' smacks strongly of Niccolo
Machaiavelli's ``The Prince,'' although Porter doesn't acknowledge
the debt. In this case, the princes are what Porter refers to as
master corporate politicians, those who rule great U.S. companies
and their subordinates on ascending and desending rungs of the
corporate ladders.
</P>
<P>
   Porter unabashedly admits to having been a master corporate
politician who survived the internecine warfare at such giants as
McDonnell Douglas, Northern Telecom, Flowers Industries and General
Dynamics. His book is a compilation of the tactics he used,
observed other MCPs use and had used against him.
</P>
<P>
   Among them:
</P>
<P>
   _ Stalling to buy time to avoid obeying an order that one
believes will result in a failure that one would have to take the
fall for.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ridding oneself of an adversary by subtly undermining your
boss's confidence in the rival, or getting the rival promoted out
of one's department.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shifting the blame for all failures to someone else. In some
cases, that can be a subordinate or another department. Porter says
procurement and data processing are always ripe targets, and the
people running those departments lead charmed lives and are seldom
fired.
</P>
<P>
   _ Distancing oneself from risky courses of action. One way a
manager does that is to advise staff members against doing
something, while telling them how to do it without letting him know
about it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Taking advantage of opportunities as matrix managers, another
term for troubleshooters, to advance by playing functional managers
against one another and going over their heads to their boss.
</P>
<P>
   Such tactics, while common knowledge to MCPs, assume an enhanced
relevance when packaged as they are here. The book contains scores
of typical situations and the most suitable tactics for dealing
with them. The survival kit derives from the diaries Porter kept
during his years of corporate guerrilla warfare.
</P>
<P>
   He advises every corporate climber to keep such a diary for
protection. That way, he says, when something goes wrong, you will
have documentation with which to defend against any attempt by a
boss or rival to make a claim of not being informed about a problem
or asked to take some actions.
</P>
<P>
   Some may find Porter's book excessively cynical, but the truth
is that he is just being candid. He's been there, and he wants to
help others compete effectively in a tough and ruthless environment
where the weak and unaware get chewed up and spat out.
</P>
<P>
   Although the book is written primarily for the ambitious pyramid
climbers, it is well worth reading for those who merely wish to do
their specialized work within a company and have no aspirations for
power.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers, for example, need to know how MCPs function to
protect themselves from being used as scapegoats and sacrificed for
the sake of a boss's career.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Porter's book of advice makes good reading for the
general reader who can apply his tactics to other kinds of life
situations. &QL;

 &HT;    AMID SOARING PRICES, PATIENTS DISCOVER FREE DRUG PROGRAMS
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Melba Gann, widowed and disabled at age 60, didn't
know where to turn. She had too much income to qualify for
Medicaid, yet not enough to afford insurance for prescription
drugs. And her two medications cost $167 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Wiggins, a 37-year-old father of two, decided that the
daily pills his doctor prescribed at $5 apiece were too much for
his family's tight budget. He was going to skip taking them.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Wiggins family and Gann, who all live in the southern
Missouri town of Doniphan, found out something that most people
don't know: Many U.S. pharmaceutical companies will give free drugs
to customers who are financially strapped.
</P>
<P>
   As of last spring, Gann began receiving from Parke-Davis, a
division of the Warner-Lambert Company, a three-month supply of a
medication that normally costs $88 a month. Wiggins received a
four-month supply of his medication and expects to get more.
</P>
<P>
   Even as politicians make promises about future relief from
soaring drug costs, millions of Americans are finding practical
help now, thanks to an Internet-driven movement that is spreading
the word about patient assistance programs.
</P>
<P>
   That effort has received a boost from tiny Doniphan, where
retired Realtor-builder Danny Hogg and his wife, Cindy, heard a
mention of ``free drugs'' on cable TV about five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Researching the idea, they found that companies had been
operating these programs for many years. ``They just didn't tell
anybody,'' Danny Hogg said this week. ``I'm in the business of
telling people about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hoggs set up a website (www.themedicineprogram.com) and a
help line (573-996-2114) to spread the word and guide applicants
through what can be a tangle of red tape. Each company has its own
criteria for participants and its own list of drugs that are
included in the give-away programs.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the assistance is available to those who are not on
Medicaid, who have no private insurance for medications and who
find paying for medicines a hardship. Income levels that qualify
have ranged from poverty level to, in rare cases, as high as
$50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, whose Medicine Program now has a dozen employees in
their home-based office, estimate that their operation has doubled
in the past year. Last month, 6,200 people applied for help.
</P>
<P>
   The operation, which at first processed the applications for
free, now charges a $5 application fee to defray costs. An
applicant who is turned down is entitled to a full refund, Hogg
said. But he added that applications are overwhelmingly accepted
and said that he has had to refund only about 9 percent of the
fees.
</P>
<P>
   His program has drawn the attention of many in the federal
establishment, starting with the Clinton administration. One woman
who wrote to the White House to tell of her plight received a
letter from the Department of Health and Human Services suggesting
that she try the Medicine Program, which she did.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., wrote the program
last year, calling it a ``valuable resource'' to constituents and
sought more brochures for his office.
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican lawmaker, Rep. Ron Paul, who is a physician,
has gone a step farther by launching workshops for senior citizens
in his southeast Texas district to invite them to seek the private
prescription drug assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Testing the approach first, Paul's office helped five
constituents apply through their doctors to various companies. ``It
was very labor intensive,'' said aide Jackie Gloor. Still, within a
month the office helped find assistance for one person with drug
costs of $2,200 a month, for a young person who had a prescription
costing $800 and for a senior citizen who had a monthly income of
only $462.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 drug companies offer some form of assistance, said Mark
Grayson, spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers Association. Some of the programs date back many
years. However, as drug prices rose and public criticism has
increased, the companies have responded with more formalized aid.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Grayson bristled at the suggestion by Hogg and others
that the programs have not been well publicized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors all know about it,'' he said. Pointing to his
organization's website (www.phrma.org/patients), which includes a
34-page booklet listing the participating companies, which can be
downloaded for free, he said, ``That's not really a secret. I can't
imagine that that's a secret.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he acknowledged that the drug companies have focused on
telling doctors about the program, not the general public.
</P>
<P>
   With drug prices going off the charts, the word is getting out.
In 1997 the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association
estimated that companies gave 1.14 million people a total of $375
million in medicines. This year the industry projects that it will
give drugs valued at $935 million to 2.4 million patients.
</P>
<P>
   Grayson cautioned that consumers should be wary of some scam
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Some groups that promise to help applicants charge a hefty share
of the savings. Also, some insurance salesmen have been reported to
offer ``prescription coverage'' which customers later discover to
be nothing more than a guide on applying for drug company patient
assistance plans.

  (Production notes at end)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``You're not even a has-been; you're a never-was!'' a striking
pro football player cracks about Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), the
honorable, stoic fill-in quarterback _ yes, scab _ in ``The
Replacements.''
</P>
<P>
   This negligible comedy might as well come with a bouncing ball
so members of the audience can recite the dialogue along with the
actors. They certainly could do so with Gene Hackman, who plays the
honorable, stoic fill-in coach Jimmy McGinty. Hackman, looking
flinty and authoritative in a selection of tweed jackets and hats
from the Tom Landry Collection, seems to be repeating lines he used
in ``Hoosiers'' and old United Airlines commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Replacements'' is so eager to please that it's like a
Labrador retriever that slobbers all over you and leaves hair on
your favorite sweater. Even the limp, diffident tagline on the
poster _ ``Pros on strike. Regular guys get to play!'' _ has an air
of desperation. The movie just wants to be loved; is that so wrong?
Well, yes, given that ``The Replacements'' is a desperate, broad
comedy, full of fist fights, gunplay, projectile vomiting and
opposing teams in what looks like the old Oakland Raiders uniforms
that made the players look like assassins.
</P>
<P>
   Falco has been making a living cleaning barnacles off boats in
the Washington boat basin since he choked at the Sugar Bowl of 1996
_ a year when Ohio State apparently relaxed its age restriction on
college players _ and the Buckeyes were slammed in a 40-point loss;
he is still coping with the shame.
</P>
<P>
   When the Washington Sentinels go on strike, Falco is recruited
by McGinty, who looks at him and intones somberly, ``Nothing counts
so much as family ...'' Oops, that's one of Hackman's lines from
``Wyatt Earp.'' He does tell Falco that he has to act like a
leader. Reeves coasts through the picture by keeping his cool, even
when he should be ruffled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Longest Yard,'' ``The Dirty Dozen'' and all 30
installments of ``Major League'' are ransacked for ``The
Replacements.'' Instead of having a big threatening black man, this
movie reinvents the genre by offering several of them: the rapper
bodyguard brothers Andre (Michael Taliferro) and Jamal (Faison
Love) and Earl Wilkerson (Michael Jace), whose character is as much
of a walk-on as he could be, considering that he was released from
prison into the custody of a pro team.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the violent Los Angeles cop Bateman (a zealous Jon
Favreau) and the Chevy Silverado-size sumo wrestler Jumbo (the
large but gentle Ace Yonamine) to crank up the level of comic
violence. And it wouldn't be a football picture without a
born-again Christian (Troy Winbush). ``
</P>
<P>
   ``The Replacements'' also adds a deaf player (David Denman) to
the mix. ``He'll never be called offsides on an audible,'' McGinty
notes.
</P>
<P>
   Rhys Ifans, who in ``Notting Hill'' was so slight his chin
stubble weighed more than the rest of him, has filled out a bit and
plays Nigel Gruff, the immensely talented and garrulous Welsh
soccer player used as a place kicker. ``Is he smoking?'' asks John
Madden (playing himself in the announcer booth, along with Pat
Summerall), noting the cigarette dangling from Nigel's mouth under
the helmet.
</P>
<P>
   The movie has no pretensions, but it louses up a great subject.
The 1987 NFL Players Union strike, on which it is based, gave fans
a chance to see some of the most unusual football ever; it was like
watching the cable access version of the World Football League,
with a palpable current of players' desire keeping the
undertalented on the field. There is probably still a movie to be
made about that strike against a salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Since Los Angeles is such a union town and there is talk of
possible Screen Actors Guild and Writers' Guild strikes in the next
year, it's odd to see a movie that essentially glorifies scab labor
(especially at a time when athletes like Tiger Woods are being
attacked for crossing picket lines to do commercials during the
actors' strike against ad companies). During the 1987 strike, the
fans kept coming out to watch the games, turning the stadium
parking lots into huge tailgate rallies. The play-by-play guys
shook their heads and did their jobs. In the movie, Madden and
Summerall are probably supposed to offer the same kind of comic
relief that ``Major League'' got from Bob Uecker _ who's better at
using baseball for stand-up than he did as a player? _ but the fact
that they're not commenting on the politics of the strike seems
peculiar, too. The real-life players lost their job action, and the
sight of big-ticket players crossing the picket lines opened a
wound of bitterness that took years to scar; some say it never
actually healed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Replacements'' cheapens all this by treating the striking
pros as spoiled princes. While being interviewed by a news crew, a
player looks into the camera and says, ``You have any idea what
insurance on a Ferrari costs?'' And McGinty grumbles to the team's
owner (Jack Warden): ``You don't have any players. They all flew
off to their private castles.''
</P>
<P>
   The closest the picture gets to the kind of guy who ended up on
the field during the strike is the wide receiver Clifford Franklin
(Orlando Jones), a viper-fast sprinter who can't hold onto the
ball. When Franklin gets to see his pro football player heroes up
close, they're flinging eggs at the bus in which he and the scab
players are traveling. He's wide-eyed, terrified and happy.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the work is done by the foot-stomper old-school stadium
rock songs heard at every pro sports event _ Queen's ``We Will Rock
You,'' for example. The soundtrack, which sounds as if K-Tel put it
together, includes ``Unbelievable'' and ``I Will Survive,'' which
is fast emerging as this summer's movie anthem. (If you close your
eyes, you could be at ``Coyote Ugly.'') Franklin adopts it as the
team's theme and leads his teammates through the Electric Slide
when they're behind bars after a fight with the striking players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better lucky than good,'' Falco says at one point. With its
feel-good exuberance, it will probably win an audience. After all,
an ugly win is still a win.

<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. -- With a mix of pure chutzpah, combative
political instincts and serrated-edge rhetoric, Patrick J. Buchanan
is running a presidential campaign built largely on a foundation of
media celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan lays claim to having advised three Republican
presidents, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan, but it
was his identity as a pugnacious network television commentator on
shows like ``The McLaughlin Group'' and ``Crossfire'' that lifted
him to national attention and gave his blunt conservative populism
a political audience.
</P>
<P>
   He is the Sunday talk-show candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan bristles with strongly held opinions on a wide range of
issues, particularly trade, defense and immigration. His positions
are often ``politically incorrect,'' said his sister and campaign
manager, Angela ``Bay'' Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   But Buchanan, 61, has never had direct policymaking
responsibility in any of his appointive posts, and has never run
anything but his own campaigns. He was a speechwriter for Nixon, a
political adviser to Ford and communications director for Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has Buchanan ever held elective office. He twice
unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination before
abandoning that party last October to go after the nomination of
the Reform Party created by Texas billionaire Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   As the Reform Party candidate, Buchanan would be eligible for
$12.6 million in federal campaign funds to help him amplify his
views. Bay Buchanan said all of it would be spent on radio and
television advertising to begin after Labor Day, with all other
campaign expenses financed by private contributions.
</P>
<P>
   But Buchanan faces a legal fight with insurgent Reform Party
opponents over his right to the money.
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategists worry that Buchanan could siphon away
votes from their presidential candidate, Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buchanan could get enough votes to cost Bush the election,''
said former Republican National Chairman Haley Barbour.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, Bush will have his own father to blame,
according to Barbour, who does not believe that Buchanan is
entirely a media creation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what created Buchanan was the recession in 1990-91
(under President George Bush) and the fact President Bush broke his
no-new-taxes pledge,'' Barbour said. ``That, and the perception
during the recession, even among a lot of Republicans, that the
Bush administration was very slow to act on it. There was a feeling
that the administration didn't understand what was happening out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   But no elected Republican, no senator or governor, was willing
to challenge a sitting Republican president in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics abhors a vacuum and Pat Buchanan decided to fill
it,'' Barbour said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan launched his first campaign for the Republican
nomination against Bush in 1992, winning an impressive 39 percent
of the vote in the New Hampshire primary. But he could not deny
Bush renomination.
</P>
<P>
   That November Perot won 20 percent of the vote as an independent
presidential candidate, and went on to found the Reform Party. Bush
lost the election to Democrat Bill Clinton, and Buchanan went back
to his television career.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan made another run at the GOP nomination in 1996 and won
the New Hampshire primary, upsetting Sen. Robert Dole, who was able
to overcome that defeat and take the nomination, only to lose the
election to Clinton. Again Buchanan retreated to the talk-show
circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Buchanan himself acknowledges that his prospects as a
candidate depend on whether he can muscle his way into the
televised debates with Bush and Democratic Vice President Al Gore
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Voters then would be able to compare him with the major-party
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them may not agree with us on all the issues but
they're going to like us, they're going to like the spunk and the
courage and the convictions and the politically incorrect
statements that we make, because we're real,'' Bay Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she rejects suggestions that her brother owes
his political rise to his prominence and talent as a television
personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a celebrity because of television, but why? Not because
he had some show but because of the kind of show he had,'' she
said. ``The way he was successful on television is that he reached
people. He articulated his beliefs and he touched people so that
they tuned in to see what he had to say. That is why he was so
successful on TV -- because he is recognized as a national leader
who is willing to speak and debate issues and to set a course for
America that he thought was right.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Washington, D.C., Buchanan was educated in Jesuit
schools and received a journalism degree from Columbia University.
He went to work in 1962 writing editorials for the St. Louis Globe
Democrat until Nixon hired him, at Buchanan's request, in 1965.
Buchanan was then 26 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's supporters at the Reform Party convention here
clearly regard him more as an experienced policy hand than a TV
figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's spent more time in the White House than anybody else,''
said Don Foster, 71, of Elmira, N.Y., an alternate delegate, who
acknowledged that he became acquainted with Buchanan by watching
him debate liberals on ``Crossfire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Buchanan doesn't need a Henry Kissinger by his side to make
decisions,'' said Foster, a retired college biology instructor. He
referred to Nixon's national security adviser and secretary of
state.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's qualifications to be president are more than
adequate, in his sister's view.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's more experienced than George Bush, without question,''
she asserts. ``The man has enormous historical depth. He
understands issues. He understands the history of this country.
He's written an economics book. He understands those issues
extraordinarily well. He has written about and debated them for
most of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's years as a White House aide and confidant of
presidents, and as an inside observer at summit meetings, equip him
with exactly ``what is needed to do a very fine job, which is to
understand the issues and to be able to handle what comes before
him and articulate his position to the American people so they are
comfortable with the direction he is taking,'' Bay Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   Her brother was, she said, more than a speechwriter for Nixon.
``He was very much a personal adviser,'' often traveling with Nixon
as his only aide in the years before his election to the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan was also a staunch Nixon defender during the Watergate
scandal, until the ``smoking gun'' tape revealed that the embattled
president had been involved in the attempted coverup that led to
his disgrace and resignation.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Bay Buchanan said, her brother ``went to the
family to urge that Nixon resign. He felt that what the tape showed
was that (Nixon) had lied to the American people and there was no
other defense left.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan may not be successful this year, Bay Buchanan concedes,
but she thinks anything is possible.
</P>
<P>
   With Buchanan pounding away from one side of the political
spectrum and Green Party presidential nominee Ralph Nader on the
other side, ``We could break it open,'' Bay Buchanan said. ``We
could break this whole system open. And that's what we aim to do.
If not this year, then four years from now. We're not going away.''

A JOURNEY DOWN THE GHOST ROAD OF THE BIG BURN OF 1910

<TEXT>
<P>
   WALLACE, Idaho -- The ghost road of the Big Burn of 1910 starts
here, in a Panhandle town that, standing in the center of the fury,
lost a third of its buildings to the murderous firestorm that swept
over the Bitterroot Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Climb the steep and shaded slopes of Nine Mile Cemetery, just
north of town. Nine firefighters rest under two stone cairns. Eight
are named on bronze U.S. Forest Service plaques greened with age;
the ninth is listed as an ``unidentified man.''
</P>
<P>
   A few yards downslope from one of the cairns is a stained and
weathered granite tombstone marking the twin graves of a father and
his 16-year-old son -- the son one of eight who suffocated in the
tunnel of the Bullion Mine when their 60-man fire crew took shelter
there; the father dead of grief a month and two days later.
</P>
<P>
   Grind through the uphill gravel and dust of Moon Pass Road,
south of Wallace, and climb into the heart of the Big Burn, passing
the marker that immortalizes Edward Pulaski, the forest ranger who
saved most of his 45-man crew by marching them into another mine
tunnel, keeping them there with the threat of his pistol. He threw
water on blankets covering the entrance and support timbers that
threatened to burst into flame until he was badly burned, then
passed out from the smoke and deadly fire gases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole world seemed to us men back in those mountains to be
aflame,'' Pulaski said in a statement given from his hospital bed.
``Many thought it really was the end of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's firefighters still carry a Pulaski to the fire line, the
combination hoe and axe invented by the big ranger, who wore
sunglasses to protect fire-damaged eyes. Pulaski died in 1931, at
age 65, of the chronic effect of injuries from a car wreck several
years before.
</P>
<P>
   Continue down the phantom trail of the Big Burn, now green with
the trees that rose from its scars.
</P>
<P>
   You are riding Forest Service roads that cross the center of a
fire path that started southwest of Wallace, blown up by
hurricane-force winds. It swept up the rocky and well-timbered
slopes at the base of the Panhandle, up and over the Bitterroot
Divide and northeast into Montana, consuming almost all the
homesteads, towns and timber in its howling reach.
</P>
<P>
   Three million acres of timber were destroyed in two days, August
20 and 21, 1910.
</P>
<P>
   In their 1978 book, ``The Big Burn: The Northwest's Forest Fire
of 1910,'' Stan Cohen and Don Miller wrote: ``The heat of the fire
and the great masses of flaming gas created powerful whirlwinds
that mowed down trees in advance of the flames and fed oxygen to
the fires, which swept 30 to 50 miles wide across mountain ranges
and rivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Drop down into the swampy bottoms of the North Fork of the St.
Joe River, on the eastern flank of Storm Mountain and Flash Peak,
and past the tall, gray skeletons of giant cedars killed by the big
blaze, weathered testaments to a horrific destruction of trees and
wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   To the east is Lucky Swede Gulch and Loop Creek. Above the creek
is the old railbed of the Chicago, Milwaukee and Puget Sound, then
the new path of the Hiawatha Line, now a bicycle trail. Ninety
years ago, two of its tunnels were shelters for several hundred
evacuees from the mines, railroad camps and little saloon towns
that sprang up to serve this rough clientele, places like Taft,
Falcon, Grand Forks and DeBorgia that would soon be destroyed by
walls of flame.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue trains passed along this line, their flatcars packed with
people, the trestles threatened by fire, the pathway marked by
pickax handles and other pieces of wood that exploded in flames.
</P>
<P>
   As one train approached a burning trestle, a member of a
railroad construction crew, an unknown immigrant from Montenegro,
leapt from a flatcar to his death in the flames. The train shot
safely across the trestle.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the dead man's co-workers built a marker of
stones\roMDRV\ &UR; -. Citizens from nearby Avery made a crude cross of
scrap iron to top the cairn.
</P>
<P>
   That he was from Montenegro was not unusual \roMDRV\ &UR; --- these
mountains were full of immigrants from Italy, Ireland, Greece,
Persia and the Balkans, working the mines and building the
railroad, filling the fire crews scraped from the bars of Butte and
Spokane to fight the thousand of smaller blazes that would soon be
wind whipped into the Big Burn.
</P>
<P>
   And that makes it more than likely that the fire's death toll
was far higher than the official tally of 87, said Cort Sims, an
archaelogist for the Idaho Panhandle National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could have been all kinds of people killed in this fire
that we just don't have an accounting of -- miners, construction
workers, railroad workers, firefighters,'' said Sims. ``You can
imagine the chaos, a mix of people, people who couldn't speak
English.''
</P>
<P>
   Continue south along the ghost road. Gaze southwest toward
Setzer Creek. It is the scene of salvation marred by a solitary
madness; it is also the place of a fatal act of pig-headed
folly\roMDRV\ &UR; -.
</P>
<P>
   Walled in by fire, Ranger William Rock led his men to a small,
blaze-scoured clearing, saving them from flames that shot a
thousand feet into the air as the fire storm surrounded their
fuel-starved sanctuary. One member of the crew, Oscar Wiegert,
couldn't stand the tension -- he crept away and shot himself to
death, the only casualty.
</P>
<P>
   Ranger R.N. Debitt sent a sheriff's deputy to order a 70-man
crew working elsewhere along the creek to flee the forest. All but
28 heeded the command; those that didn't thought Debitt and the
deputy were exaggerating the danger. They were found burned beyond
recognition in the next drainage west, at the top of Storm Creek,
and \roMDRV\ &UR; -buried where they fell.
</P>
<P>
   Drop down to Avery, a railroad town deep in the forest that
seemed destined to certain doom. On a ridge north of town, a
flat-topped Ponderosa pine looms high above younger timber -- a
probable survivor of the Big Burn and several fires that followed.
</P>
<P>
   The town was evacuated, and a company of black soldiers was sent
to guard the rescue trains. Seven men, headed by Ranger Thaddeus
Roe, stayed behind to try to set a backfire to save the town.
</P>
<P>
   A sky-high wall of flame marched toward town. The smaller
backfire crept toward the bigger conflagration.
</P>
<P>
   According to Miller and Cohen, Roe wrote this about the
collision: ``Never have I seen anything like it. Plunging toward
each other like two living animals, the two met with a roar that
must have been heard miles away. The tongues of fire seemed to leap
up to heaven itself and after an instant's seething sank to
nothingness.''

   SWEDE GULCH, Idaho -- While the West burns through the worst
wildfire season in half a century, the dead from a holocaust 90
years gone serve as a silent reminder that, grim as it may look
now, nature has a terrible reserve that can make the mountains roar
with flame and wipe out 3 million acres of timber in two days'
time.
</P>
<P>
   That's the harrowing hallmark of the Big Burn of 1910, a
firestorm that savaged the towering forests of the Bitterroot
Mountains with a force of near atomic intensity. It killed at least
87 people -- no one can be certain of the toll -- most of them
firefighters trapped when hurricane-force winds swept the range on
August 20 and 21 of that year, turning scores of smaller blazes
into a howling juggernaut of flame.
</P>
<P>
   The past is very much alive in the present summer of fire.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 20,000 smoke jumpers, hot shot crews, volunteers,
Marines and Army troops are battling fires sweeping 11 Western
states. The veterans among them say the woods are so dry and packed
with fuel that another Big Burn could happen at any time -- perhaps
farther down in the Bitterroot Range, south of Missoula, Mont.,
where fire has forced the evacuation of hundreds of homes and
darkened the skies for hundreds of miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all the conditions for catastrophic fires to occur and
I'm not just yelling wolf,'' said former U.S. Forest Service smoke
jumper Laird Robinson, who is best known for his collaboration with
the late author Norman MacLean on ``Young Men and Fire,'' an
exhaustive, literary study of the 1949 Mann Gulch, Mont., disaster
that killed 13 of the parachuting firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been stuffing newspapers in our house for decades and
now where are we? The natural role of fire in the forests is now
unnatural.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the Forest Service's long run of strict fire
suppression -- a direct result of the 1910 conflagration -- has
resulted in a hazardous buildup of brush, trees, grass and other
fuels on land that has historically supported far fewer and far
healthier stands of trees.
</P>
<P>
   And this has even deadlier potential than 90 years ago, given
the numbers of retirees and others who, seeking to live close to
the natural beauty of the West, have built dream homes deep within
the timberlands on the outskirts of national forests and parklands.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   For nine decades, Smokey Bear vigilance has pitted man against
nature and treated every fire as a demon that must be exorcised
from the forest by ''10 o'clock'' the morning after it is first
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   A romantic legend of daring and death swirls like smoke around
the fire suppression policy. It's a legend reinforced by deadly
disasters like Mann Gulch and the 1994 Storm King Mountain blowup
in Colorado that killed 14 of the Forest Service's best, including
smoke jumpers and members of a ground-pounding elite known as the
Hot Shot crews.
</P>
<P>
   But the sacrifice of young men dying in fire is undercut by hard
irony: Their very cause has brought about the risk of yet another
Big Burn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unhealthy state of our forests is the result of good
people making bad decisions for the best intentions,'' said Greg
Aplet, a forest ecologist based in the Sierra Club's Four Corners
States regional office in Denver, Colo. ``It was people doing what
they thought was the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Although Forest Service scientists recognized the ecological
value of fires by the late '60s and early '70s, rangers initially
were reluctant to embrace their mortal enemy.
</P>
<P>
   But for the past two decades, the Forest Service and other land
management agencies have tried to offset the deadly buildup of
trees and brush with deliberate burnings. They've tempered strict
fire suppression by letting fires burn in wilderness areas far from
settled land.
</P>
<P>
   Academics and other experts say this has been too little and too
late.
</P>
<P>
   At least 40 million acres of federal forest, and perhaps as much
as 60 million acres -- almost all of it in the West -- are in dire
need of thinning, they say. And they warn that there's only a small
window of opportunity -- perhaps a decade -- to get it done before
the forests become so jammed with fuel that every fire will have
cataclysmic consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Restoration of America's forests can be accomplished either by
controlled applications of fire or judicious use of saw and axe,
and preferably both, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's three schools of thought,'' said Kevin Ryan, a
scientist at the Forest Service Fire Laboratory in Missoula.
``There are those who believe the chain saw and anything mechanical
is inherently evil. There are those who believe logging and logging
alone can bring the forests back to health. Then there are those
like me who say we've got to use mechanical means and fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Some worry that controlled burning is being touted as a lone
silver bullet for the disastrous condition of Western forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fire is not some magical potion you can sprinkle out over the
landscape,'' said Arizona State University professor Stephen Pyne,
a ecological historian who is writing a book on the Big Burn of
1910. ``It will cannibalize what's out there. If it's a mess
already, fire will only make it worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran firefighters like Robinson call for a multi-year,
multi-billion-dollar effort, envisioning a revival of Franklin
Delano Roosevelt's Civilian Construction Corps, the 1930s New Deal
program that put thousands of unemployed Americans to work on
public works projects like the Blue Ridge Parkway in Virginia and
North Carolina -- and firefighting in the West. They see thousands
of forest restoration workers, cutting and burning through the
dangerously choked timberland of the intermountain West.
</P>
<P>
   But this vision runs headlong into reality: long-standing
resistance to such big-ticket government spending, the buzzsaw of
public land politics, and the paralyzing effect those highly
polarized politics have had on the Forest Service and other federal
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   There's fierce opposition to any form of logging on federal land
from hardline environmental groups, accompanied by squinty-eyed
suspicion that any mechanical removal of trees, even for an
ecologically sound purpose, will be corrupted by the timber
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can talk all they want to about fire hazard, but behind
that rhetoric is a desire to continue logging,'' said Jake
Kreilick, campaign coordinator for the National Forest Protection
Alliance, a Missoula-based preservationist group that favors a
government program to hire loggers to trim the forests. ``The terms
of forest restoration shouldn't be based on what the timber
industry wants or what the loggers want, it should be based on what
the land wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Timber interests, meanwhile, maintain that overregulation of
logging has helped make the forests the tinderbox they are today.
They also say that a retooled industry, geared for smaller-diameter
logs and armed with less destructive equipment, should be a prime
partner in forest restoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``People know we're sitting on a powder keg,'' said Bill
Mulligan, president of the Three Rivers Timber Co., a small mill in
Kamiah, Idaho, on the western edge of the Clearwater National
Forest. ``And the timber industry can play a role here and help
bring these forests back to health.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the forests of the West were relatively sparse --
tall stands of fire-resistant Ponderosa pine, perhaps no more than
30 to 50 trees to the acre, rising above a sea of grass. Fires were
frequent and of low intensity, keeping the forest floors clean of
brush and killing off smaller trees that would compete with the
giants for sparse moisture and nutrients of this arid region.
</P>
<P>
   These fires were either natural -- caused by lightning strikes
-- or man-made. Indians often set them to drive game or reduce the
threat of wildfire near their villages. But with Anglo settlement,
fires used to clear forests for ranching and farming became
profligate and wantonly destructive, associated with the
free-booting exploitation of the West's rangeland, timber and
minerals.
</P>
<P>
   Aghast at the devastation to grassland and timber,
conservationists like President Teddy Roosevelt and the nation's
first Forest Service chief, Gifford Pinchot, moved to put the
nation's forest reserves under strict federal control.
</P>
<P>
   This set the stage for a struggle that is still the prime axis
of public land politics and conflict in the West. In Pinchot's
time, the firefight was over unfettered logging accompanied by
frequent burning, versus his preference for scientific forest
management, tightly regulated logging and fire suppression.
</P>
<P>
   Pinchot was an early casualty in this acrimonious struggle,
fired by Roosevelt's successor, William Howard Taft, in the very
year of the Big Burn.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the ultra-dry summer and a blowup like no one had ever
seen before. It wiped out one of the finest stands of white pine in
North America and vindicated Pinchot's call for fire lookouts,
trails and more manpower to protect the public's timber reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Burn was a searingly formative experience for three of
Pinchot's successors. All were supervisors during the losing battle
against the 1910 blaze, cataloguing its dead and its survivors. All
were convinced they could have prevented the disaster had they had
enough men and material.
</P>
<P>
   ``That entire generation was traumatized by that fire and, in a
sense, continuously refought that fire again and again,'' said
Arizona State's Pyne.
</P>
<P>
   The last of the line, Ferdinand Augustus Silcox, set the policy
of strict fire suppression with his famous ''10 o'clock rule,'' the
mandate that fire fighters put out all blazes by that time of the
next morning or fill out volumes of paperwork explaining why they
had failed. Silcox also convinced FDR to let him use the CCC to
fight fires.
</P>
<P>
   But by aggressively taking fire out of the forest ecology of the
West, land managers removed a crucial and often therapeutic
catalyst for renewal. They also changed the very biological makeup
of the forest itself.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of 50 trees an acre, 300 to 500 trees crowd the same
space, competing for water and nutrients and susceptible to disease
and insects. Instead of fire-tolerant Ponderosas, thin-barked
Douglas firs and lodgepole pines predominate. And there are so many
trees in the forest understory that they form a ladder of fuel that
guarantees the killing crown fires that leap into the top of the
oldest and tallest trees.
</P>
<P>
   All of this sets the stage for ever larger, ever hotter and ever
deadlier fires of the type seen 12 years ago in Yellowstone
National Park and earlier this year in Los Alamos, N.M., the latter
caused by a deliberate burn by the National Park Service that
quickly got out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Think of a watch spring that has been constantly tightened for
90 years and rarely allowed to unwind. And envision fires that are
only destructive, rarely therapeutic -- so hot that they sterilize
the soil for decades to come, so widespread and all-consuming that
they threaten every ecological goal on the preservationist menu,
from the salvation of old-growth forests and restoration of
endangered species habitat to the protection of streams vital to
trout and salmon spawning.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do nothing in our most valued forests is simply not an
option,'' said Leon Neuenschwander, a fire ecologist at the
University of Idaho. ``To do nothing is to have these forests burn
up.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate expression of strict fire suppression is the smoke
jumper, an elite corps of firefighters proud of their ability to
drop in on nascent fires and snuff them out before they become big
blazes. They have tremendous esprit de corps and are magnificent
hybrids of independence and team work.
</P>
<P>
   Adventurous by nature, they dance with death in tightly
controlled fashion -- stepping into the sky to fight fire in the
deep wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   But few buy into the old romance of man against nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's man working with nature,'' said Keith Wolferman, 38, a
10-year smoke jumping veteran based at the Forest Service's Aerial
Fire Depot in Missoula.
</P>
<P>
   Said Steen Simonson, a smoke jumper with nine years' experience:
``It's real arrogant to say we put that fire out. Nature let you
put it out. The fire's letting you put it out. And in a season like
this, with no rain, nature's not letting us put out much.''
</P>
<P>
   The smoke jumpers know about Mann Gulch and the 13 who lost
their uphill race against a sudden blowup of flame. They know about
Storm King Mountain and the deadly fire season of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   They don't know much about the Big Burn. But they're following
its trail.
</P>
<P>
   Said Pyne, the Arizona State professor: ``It's still part of the
long narrative since 1910 of the crews out there fighting fires,
getting killed, trying to survive.''

threat of wildfire near their villages. But with Anglo settlement,
fires used to clear forests for ranching and farming became
profligate and wantonly destructive, associated with the
free-booting exploitation of the West's rangeland, timber and
minerals.
</P>
<P>
   Aghast at the devastation to grassland and timber,
conservationists like President Teddy Roosevelt and the nation's
first Forest Service chief, Gifford Pinchot, moved to put the
nation's forest reserves under strict federal control.
</P>
<P>
   This set the stage for a struggle that is still the prime axis
of public land politics and conflict in the West. In Pinchot's
time, the firefight was over unfettered logging accompanied by
frequent burning, versus his preference for scientific forest
management, tightly regulated logging and fire suppression.
</P>
<P>
   Pinchot was an early casualty in this acrimonious struggle,
fired by Roosevelt's successor, William Howard Taft, in the very
year of the Big Burn.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the ultra-dry summer and a blowup like no one had ever
seen before. It wiped out one of the finest stands of white pine in
North America and vindicated Pinchot's call for fire lookouts,
trails and more manpower to protect the public's timber reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Burn was a searingly formative experience for three of
Pinchot's successors. All were supervisors during the losing battle
against the 1910 blaze, cataloguing its dead and its survivors. All
were convinced they could have prevented the disaster had they had
enough men and material.
</P>
<P>
   ``That entire generation was traumatized by that fire and, in a
sense, continuously refought that fire again and again,'' said
Arizona State's Pyne.
</P>
<P>
   The last of the line, Ferdinand Augustus Silcox, set the policy
of strict fire suppression with his famous ''10 o'clock rule,'' the
mandate that fire fighters put out all blazes by that time of the
next morning or fill out volumes of paperwork explaining why they
had failed. Silcox also convinced FDR to let him use the CCC to
fight fires.
</P>
<P>
   But by aggressively taking fire out of the forest ecology of the
West, land managers removed a crucial and often therapeutic
catalyst for renewal. They also changed the very biological makeup
of the forest itself.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of 50 trees an acre, 300 to 500 trees crowd the same
space, competing for water and nutrients and susceptible to disease
and insects. Instead of fire-tolerant Ponderosas, thin-barked
Douglas firs and lodgepole pines predominate. And there are so many
trees in the forest understory that they form a ladder of fuel that
guarantees the killing crown fires that leap into the top of the
oldest and tallest trees.
</P>
<P>
   All of this sets the stage for ever larger, ever hotter and ever
deadlier fires of the type seen 12 years ago in Yellowstone
National Park and earlier this year in Los Alamos, N.M., the latter
caused by a deliberate burn by the National Park Service that
quickly got out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Think of a watch spring that has been constantly tightened for
90 years and rarely allowed to unwind. And envision fires that are
only destructive, rarely therapeutic -- so hot that they sterilize
the soil for decades to come, so widespread and all-consuming that
they threaten every ecological goal on the preservationist menu,
from the salvation of old-growth forests and restoration of
endangered species habitat to the protection of streams vital to
trout and salmon spawning.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do nothing in our most valued forests is simply not an
option,'' said Leon Neuenschwander, a fire ecologist at the
University of Idaho. ``To do nothing is to have these forests burn
up.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate expression of strict fire suppression is the smoke
jumper, an elite corps of firefighters proud of their ability to
drop in on nascent fires and snuff them out before they become big
blazes. They have tremendous esprit de corps and are magnificent
hybrids of independence and team work.
</P>
<P>
   Adventurous by nature, they dance with death in tightly
controlled fashion -- stepping into the sky to fight fire in the
deep wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   But few buy into the old romance of man against nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's man working with nature,'' said Keith Wolferman, 38, a
10-year smoke jumping veteran based at the Forest Service's Aerial
Fire Depot in Missoula.
</P>
<P>
   Said Steen Simonson, a smoke jumper with nine years' experience:
``It's real arrogant to say we put that fire out. Nature let you
put it out. The fire's letting you put it out. And in a season like
this, with no rain, nature's not letting us put out much.''
</P>
<P>
   The smoke jumpers know about Mann Gulch and the 13 who lost
their uphill race against a sudden blowup of flame. They know about
Storm King Mountain and the deadly fire season of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   They don't know much about the Big Burn. But they're following
its trail.
</P>
<P>
   Said Pyne, the Arizona State professor: ``It's still part of the
long narrative since 1910 of the crews out there fighting fires,
getting killed, trying to survive.''

<P>
   Pulling the strings for the ballon drops at this year's
Republican and Democratic national conventions is the reigning
power couple of decorative balloon art.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democrats' corner, dropping nearly 200,000 balloons in
Los Angeles on Aug. 17, is Kelli Sipp, owner of Kelli's Balloon
Studio in La Verne, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Sipp was the 1999 International Designer of the Year, besting
more than 1,150 balloon artists from 39 countries at the 15th
annual International Balloon Arts Competition in suburban Chicago.
She's the only designer to simultaneously hold first place in large
sculpture, table centerpiece and buffet arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   In the GOP's corner is Treb Heining, owner of Balloonart by Treb
in Newport Beach, Calif. On Aug. 3, he also loosed about 200,000
balloons -- at the Republican convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   A living balloon legend, Heining created the world's first
balloon arch and has performed either massive balloon drops or
releases (of helium balloons) for the opening ceremony of the 1984
Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, numerous Super Bowls, presidential
inaugurations and Oscar shows.
</P>
<P>
   The two met four years ago at -- where else? -- a balloon
conference. They have since become boyfriend and girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Just as opposing politicos Mary Matalin and James Carville
didn't discuss work during the 1996 presidential campaign, Sipp,
40, and Heining, 46, haven't swapped any information.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept his drop a total secret from me,'' Sipp said.
</P>
<P>
   They have worked together in the past, however, most notably on
the millennium celebration in New York's Times Square. As the
``airborne effects'' manager, Heining supervised a crew of more
than 100 that dropped tens of thousands of balloons and tons of
confetti at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Sipp said Heining's balloon drops have a distinct style. ``I was
watching him on CNN on the floor of the convention'' during
preparations in Philadelphia, she said. ``I could see his touches.
Unique.''
</P>
<P>
   What would those touches be? Sipp turned evasive. ``I shouldn't
speak too much for him,'' she said. ``There are lots of secrets
that go on in balloon drops.''
</P>
<P>
   Sipp did let slip one detail: In Los Angeles, she'll be using
special ``signature balloons'' that delegates may have autographed.
</P>
<P>
   Heining's response, just before his own nationally televised
drop: ``Oh, I wouldn't know anything about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, each political party is just as hush-hush. The
balloon drop is the colorful climax of the convention, just after
the presidential hopeful has accepted the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Balloons are suspended in netting from catwalks. Workers pull
cords to send the balloons cascading down atop the delegates. The
spectacle usually lasts up to 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that all-important moment, signaling the end of the
convention and beginning of the official campaign, is known among
pundits as ``when the balloons drop.''
</P>
<P>
   So both Republicans and Democrats fret about being outdone,
particularly in the number of balloons. Sipp has to make sure her
drop at least equals and at best exceeds Heining's. That's a tough
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Heining's was spectacular indeed.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Tribune reported that it was ``so dense it enveloped
Illinois First Lady Lura Lynn Ryan. The balloons encircled her and
piled up higher than her head.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Morning News proclaimed it ``the world's greatest
balloon drop.''
</P>
<P>
   After the hoopla comes cleanup. Sipp said that despite the huge
number of balloons, not many are left to haul away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of people like popping them, or they take balloons when
they leave,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Which is good for Sipp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day after my drop the cast of `The West Wing' TV show is
coming in and taping a scene,'' she said. ``So we have to have it
all cleaned up.''

   REFORM-PARTY (Long Beach, Calif.) _ Split beyond repair, the
Reform Party convened two national conventions here Thursday, each
side claiming to be true heir to the political organization founded
by Ross Perot and each intent on nominating its own presidential
candidate. The actions made for a third day of noisy demonstrations
by forces for and against the candidacy of Pat Buchanan, but at
least this time police were not required to intervene. After
supporters of Buchanan's rival, John Hagelin, were turned away from
the delegate meeting room at the Long Beach Convention Center
controlled by Buchanan allies, they marched peacefully down the

began their own convention. By Michael Janofsky and B. Drummond

10 KILLED AS BOMB EXPLODES IN KASHMIR'S SUMMER CAPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ First came a grenade, going off near a bank
and luring police and journalists to inspect the damage. Then, 15
minutes later, a car bomb exploded within feet of the crowd,
killing at least 10 people Thursday in Kashmir's summer capital of
Srinagar.
</P>
<P>
   The militant group Hizbul Mujahedeen claimed responsibility for
the brutally choreographed incident. For them, it was a sensational
return to the practice of killing, their first major strike since
calling off a cease-fire two days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for peace in Kashmir passed quickly, and now that disputed
territory seems back to the bloody attacks and counterattacks that
have taken 25,000 to 40,000 lives since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Among the dead were eight police officers and a photographer,
Pradeep Bhatia, who worked for the Indian daily The Hindustan
Times.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad Amin War, a photographer wounded by the blast, told the
Associated Press that Bhatia had been standing in front of him.
``He fell down and I could see pieces of car flying over us,'' he
said. ``He was bleeding. So was I.''
</P>
<P>
   Salim Hashmi, a spokesman for Hizbul Mujahedeen in Islamabad,
said the attack was an act of frustration, caused by India's
unwillingness to meet his group's main condition for peace talks:
That Pakistan be included at the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our cease-fire we showed the Indians that we can be
peace-loving, but with this we have now shown them that we can also
be strong fighters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hizbul's cease-fire, declared in a surprise announcement on
July 24, was at first said to be an unconditional gesture that
would last three months. Only later, as other mujahedeen groups
criticized the move, did Hizbul's leaders begin making demands.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement sent by fax to the Reuters news agency in
Islamabad, Hizbul warned that bigger military operations would be
coming if India persisted with its ``traditional intransigence.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's bombing was reminiscent of a similar attack in
Srinagar five years ago, when 13 people were killed near the same
branch of the State Bank of India.
</P>
<P>
   This time, a hand grenade was thrown toward the heavily guarded
bank, where security personnel pick up their wages. Police and
journalists rushed over to look through the debris, unaware that a
bomb had been planted beneath a white Ambassador, one of the most
common automobiles in this country. The blast was powerful enough
to destroy several cars and tear out the windows of nearby
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Kashmir is claimed by both India and Pakistan. It has been the
source of two of the three wars between the nations since they
gained independence in 1947. For the past 11 years, there has been
a rebellion within the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir, with
indigenous forces abetted by Pakistan-backed warriors who see the
struggle as a quest in the name of Islam.

BEIJING'S QUANDARY: PROMOTING INTERNET USE AND CONTROLLING IT 
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG S. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ China's unease with the Internet is growing as
the country embraces the new medium to modernize its economy yet
worries about the Web's spread beyond government control.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, the government-sponsored State Research
Information Technology Co. said it had hired a California company
to help set up electronic commerce sites for thousands of
government companies. And it claims to own China's first patented
Wireless Application Protocol system, which could greatly expand
Internet access in a country where cellular telephones vastly
outnumber personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the government pushes its own Internet ventures, it
is trying to stamp out others that it sees as a potential political
threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enemy forces at home and abroad are sparing no effort to use
this battlefront to infiltrate us,'' said an editorial this week in
the Communist Party's national newspaper, the People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
   The warning followed renewed reports that local governments are
establishing Internet surveillance units and tracking down people
who use the Web to express political dissent or other nonconformist
ideas. The government shut one such Web site, www.xinwenming.com,
this week for posting ``counterrevolutionary content,'' a euphemism
that often means nothing more than criticism of the government.
Police are searching for the Web site's organizers, according to
New York-based Human Rights in China.
</P>
<P>
   The government's deep ambivalence toward the Internet, which
Beijing fears could be used to unite political opposition to the
Communist Party, has slowed the medium's development here. And it
threatens to distort the new industry in much the way the country's
planned economy distorted other industries in the past, favoring
inefficient government-owned ventures over more creative private
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the government's heavy hand has cast a pall overprivate
Web ventures, which are relying on foreign investment to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Regulations that make much of the foreign investment technically
illegal and the inability of Internet companies to list their
shares on China's domestic stock market are scaring off venture
capitalists who were still pumping money into the sector just a few
weeks ago. Many of the tiny Internet companies started in the past
year are now running out of cash and closing.
</P>
<P>
   Internet entrepreneurs say government interference has cost the
nascent industry hundreds of millions of dollars in investment
capital that could have helped close the gap between it and the
Internet industry in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Had Beijing moved more quickly, the critics say, many Chinese
Internet companies could have listed their shares on Nasdaq before
that market tumbled in April and the American public's appetite for
Internet plays waned.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Beijing dithered and by the time it began allowing
Chinese companies to list abroad, the moment had passed. The shares
of the last two Chinese Internet companies to list on Nasdaq,
Netease.com and Sohu.com, are trading at about half of their
initial offering prices. Other Chinese Internet stock offerings
have been postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, China's state-owned ventures are failing to generate
much excitement among the venture capital community that has
watched the Internet develop elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the government initiatives which don't have a strong
involvement with the private sector do face the risk of failure,''
said David Williams, a Hong Kong-based partner at the American
venture-capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its threatening rhetoric and a few widely publicized
arrests, Beijing appears to be failing in its efforts to control
unauthorized information flows. The government estimates that 17
million people are connected to the Internet so far, and that
number is doubling every six months while a plethora of Web sites
are popping up each day.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one popular Web site, www.homeway.com, which
regularly posts unconfirmed news reports from the Hong Kong press,
has reported for weeks that Li Jizhou, vice minister of Public
Security, is in Beijing's Qincheng Prison awaiting trial for taking
bribes worth millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   And despite having arrested Internet activist Huang Qi, who
faces charges of subversion after posting information about the
1989 massacre that ended pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen
Square, Huang's Web site, www.6-4tianwang.com, remains up for
people to see.

ADVERTISING: EMBATTLED VERIZON INSISTS REBRANDING EFFORT IS
UNDAUNTED 
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD STAMLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pity the poor communicators at Verizon Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Just as they were beginning their push this month to re-brand
the telecommunications giant, formed by the merger in June of Bell
Atlantic and GTE, they found their attention _ and that of the
public and the media _ drawn to other, more compelling events.
</P>
<P>
   Like the strike by the company's 86,000 employees, which began
early Sunday morning, and which has been marked by scattered acts
of violence and vandalism. And Verizon's acquisition, announced
Tuesday, of NorthPoint Communications, an Internet access provider.
Not to mention the plunge in Verizon shares that greeted that
announcement, as well as the company's admission, also made
Tuesday, that it would not meet earnings expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In normal times, of course, any one of these events would be
enough to keep any company's advertising and public-relations
departments spinning. But have they in fact slowed the branding
effort, one that Janet Keeler, Verizon's senior vice-president for
marketing services and brand management, says ``may well be the
largest re-naming campaign ever undertaken?''
</P>
<P>
   No, insists Keeler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is still going on as scheduled,'' she said. That
includes the printing this month of the first set of bills with the
Verizon name to be sent to customers and the reprogramming of the
greetings and closings heard by subscribers when they place
operator-assisted, credit card or collect calls (James Earl Jones
delivers many of these messages, just as he did in the past for
Bell Atlantic).
</P>
<P>
   The replacement of signs on buildings and on telephone booths is
also continuing, Keeler said, as well as the repainting of company
trucks. None of this work is affected by the strike, she added,
``because it is outsourced.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeler distinguished the Verizon re-branding from that of
Verizon Wireless, a joint venture formed in April between Bell
Atlantic Mobile and Vodafone AirTouch, to which GTE's cellular
operations were added once the main Verizon merger was completed in
June. That campaign started in May, she said, ``and is all finished
except for some of the stores.''
</P>
<P>
   She also differentiated the present renaming operation from what
she called the main ''repositioning'' campaign for Verizon,
scheduled for the fall, ``probably October.'' That effort will
result in ``the new statement of what Verizon stands for,'' she
said. ``We're still working on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Verizon is also working on the choice of agencies it will use in
the fall branding campaign, Keeler said, noting that the new
company is ``continuing to get experience with all the GTE and Bell
Atlantic agencies,'' which include the Lord Group in New York,
Arnold Communications in Boston, and Burrell Communications, in
Chicago, for Bell Atlantic and Ogilvy &AMP; Mather in New York and
Dallas, and Dallas-based Temerlin McClain for GTE.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, though, a raft of print advertisements and
television and radio spots has already begun running in the areas
Verizon has a so-called wireline presence, comprising 31 states,
Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. And some of the print ads
feature company employees such as Debbie Adams, a splicer in New
York City, and Andrea Lenoir, an assistant marketing manager in
Dallas, all of them said to be ready to provide the ``same
dedicated service'' to customers as they did when they worked for
Bell Atlantic or GTE.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our employees take center stage in this first campaign because
they are the face of the new Verizon,'' Keeler was quoted as saying
in a news release on July 31, just before the ads broke and a week
before the strike. ``They are the ones who build relationships with
customers, and they are the ones who deliver on our promises to
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they are also the ones who are now walking the picket
lines and, in some cases, jeering at the company's management. And
that makes for ``a rocky start,'' said Peter Dixon, senior partner
at Lippincott &AMP; Margulies, a corporate identity consulting company
owned by Marsh &AMP; McLennan, whose firm actually helped think up the
name Verizon, but is not involved in the branding effort.
``Especially because one of the issues they are raising is the
importance of the people who work for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Miller agrees. He is a spokesman in Washington for the
Communications Workers of America, whose members include the
workers now on strike against the company. ``It really is ironic,''
he said, ``because it is true that our people are the face of the
company. And the issues they are fighting for have to do with
providing better customer service.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be. Due to the labor conflict, however, management has
begun considering whether its unionized workers are its best
ambassadors after all, and whether the advertisements featuring
them should ``stay in rotation,'' according to Keeler.
</P>
<P>
   But Dixon believes that pulling the ads or ignoring the strike _
and the employees _ would be a mistake. ``It's better to talk about
this and even to give the employees credit before they settle the
strike,'' he said. ``Any kind of vindictiveness or slight to the
employees now would be the wrong thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York on Thursday morning, near Times Square, there was a
hint that Dixon might be right. A group of about three dozen
strikers, wearing red CWA T-shirts and headed for a union rally at
Verizon's New York headquarters a block away, stood waiting to
cross Broadway at 42nd Street. They jeered the Verizon billboard
diagonally across the intersection, which said, ``Bell Atlantic is
changing its name . . . to Verizon,'' and depicted several shots of
a worker in a hardhat with a logo that changed from Bell Atlantic's
to Verizon's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is that dork?'' shouted one CWA member. Another crumpled a
cardboard coffee cup and hurled it toward the billboard. It was a
purely symbolic gesture, since the cup made it barely halfway
across the intersection, but it drew cheers from the group all the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Behind them, two women passers-by shouted encouragement. ``Stick
it to 'em!'' one called out, then turned to her companion and said:
``That big company, with all that money! These guys shouldn't have
to be out here.''

BEETHOVEN AS A QUESTION NEVER REALLY ANSWERED 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: sidebar at end of article)  
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   What can possibly be left to say about Beethoven at this late
date? A great deal, it must be hoped, for the Bard Music Festival
is devoting the next two weekends and a third in October to the
composer, and these are truly talkative affairs.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be, a quarter-century ago, that you had a biography
(the classic ``Thayer's Life of Beethoven,'' perhaps, as revised
and edited by Elliot Forbes) and an LP set of the symphonies (say,
Herbert von Karajan's version from the early 1960s with the Berlin
Philharmonic), and you thought you had a fix on the composer.
</P>
<P>
   Now the book and CD shelves groan, yet Beethoven seems to grow
only more mysterious and fragmented, both in his personage and in
his meanings for our time. He has, as academics like to say, been
``problematized.''
</P>
<P>
   Maynard Solomon adopted techniques of psychobiography in his
1977 book ``Beethoven.'' Alessandra Comini explored the myths about
the composer in her 1987 book ``The Changing Image of Beethoven.''
Roger Norrington and the London Classical Players applied period
performance practice to recordings of the symphonies in the late
1980s. Scott Burnham examined what Beethoven's music meant to early
listeners and how those meanings have endured in his 1995 book
``Beethoven Hero.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This festival comes after 10 or 15 years of very provocative
Beethoven scholarship,'' Leon Botstein, the founding artistic
director of the festival, said recently. ``There was a whole period
of scholarship having to with the creative process, which Lewis
Lockwood, Robert Winter and other people were involved with.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was another generation that started with feminist
scholarship, and then with the `deconstruction' of the titanic
figure, by Scott Burnham and Elisabeth Eleonore Bauer.'' Solomon,
Burnham, Lockwood and Bauer are all to speak or participate in
symposiums at the festival.
</P>
<P>
   One result of such explorations has been a radical revision of
the notion of Beethoven as an Olympian figure removed from daily
life in his creation, writing quintessentially absolute music,
almost wholly abstract in its meanings. Beethoven is now thought to
have been deeply concerned in his music with description,
narrative, rhetoric, prosody, even philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Botstein pointed to the significance of certain keys in the
Missa Solemnis: G, ``sol'' in solfege, to represent the sun in ``Et
resurrexit''; D, ``re,'' for kingly or regal music. Such matters,
he suggested, are of more than merely intellectual concern, for
they affect performance practice no less surely than the continuing
debate over Beethoven's metronome markings does. (Whether because
of faulty early metronomes, as was long thought, or because of the
misreading of the composer's intentions over the years, those
markings in many cases indicate tempos faster than those we are
used to.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Some current scholars think Beethoven is long gone and
buried,'' Botstein said. ``That's an interesting question for the
festival. Is he? Has he finally receded into history? Maybe this
stuff belongs on the shelf, another trophy on the shelf of dead
classical music. Well, we'll find out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Scowl and Other Myths
</P>
<P>
   As part of its scholarly apparatus, the Bard festival publishes
a valuable book in connection with each outing, and this year's,
``Beethoven and His World'' (Princeton University Press), shows a
remarkable variety of current academic concerns having to do with
Beethoven. It is edited by Michael P. Steinberg, a historian at
Cornell University associated with the festival from the start, who
is to moderate a symposium next Friday, and Burnham, a musicologist
at Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more compelling essays is by Comini, ``The Visual
Beethoven: Whence, Why and Whither the Scowl?'' The scowl has been
a consistent trait in depictions of Beethoven, and it neatly fits
what we think we know of him: a fierce egalitarian forced to mingle
with aristocrats and curry favor (and income) from them; an
instinctive humanist made misanthropic by deafness; a plaything of
fate, exquisitely tortured yet opting for defiance over despair.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the scowl may be infinitely more mundane in its
origins. Although apprehensive about the process, Beethoven allowed
a plaster mask to be cast from his face in 1812. The stifling,
unpleasant procedure included inserting quills in his nostrils to
allow him to breathe. The resulting ``life mask'' has often been
misidentified as the death mask, in which the mouth merely droops.
``It exactly replicates not only Beethoven's living face, complete
with pock marks (possibly from smallpox) and facial scars but also
his acute physical discomfort,'' Comini writes, ``for this is what
the contracted brow and firmly clamped `scowling' mouth register.''
</P>
<P>
   Posterity read it, and wanted it, otherwise. When Ludwig
Rellstab, a critic from Berlin, visited Beethoven in Vienna in
1825, he found the reality anticlimactic: ``There was nothing
expressing that brusqueness, that tempestuous, unshackled quality
which has been lent his physiognomy in order to bring it into
conformity with his works.''
</P>
<P>
   Also fascinating is the essay ``Beethoven and Masculinity,'' by
Sanna Pederson, who is to take part in the festival. The
introduction of sexual interpretations into discussions of
classical music has often seemed far-fetched and resulted in
ridicule for practitioners of the ``new musicology.'' But
Pederson's measured discussion provides an illuminating analysis of
the ways in which Beethoven's music and personality, while
embodying the French revolutionary ideals of liberty and
fraternity, may have glossed over certain matters of equality.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason why Beethoven is assumed to be the most masculine
of composers,'' she writes, ``is that what he and his music stand
for is precisely the same ideology that tries to attain universal
society in theory while maintaining male domination in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is filled with other interesting and delightful
tidbits, including the information, in Lockwood's ``Beethoven,
Florestan and the Varieties of Heroism,'' that Beethoven once
contemplated writing an opera called ``The Arrival of the
Pennsylvanians in America.'' (And he thought he had problems with
``Fidelio''!)
</P>
<P>
   Great Works and More
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Bard Music Festival began on the campus of Bard College in
Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., in 1990, with each season centering on a
different composer. In his other conductorial activities,
specifically with the American Symphony Orchestra in New York,
Botstein tends to seek out the unknown, turning up the odd
masterpiece along with the predictable preponderance of dross.
</P>
<P>
   One of his great triumphs with the American Symphony was a
steamy performance of Schnittke's ``Faust Cantata,'' with the
soprano Joyce Castle in 1994. His latest discovery for the future
is ``Des Jona Sendung'' (``Jonah's Mission''), an oratorio by
Rudolf Tobias, an Estonian composer, which was recommended by
Botstein's conductorial colleague Paavo Jarvi. (It has, like
seemingly every other work ever composed, been recorded by Jarvi's
father, Neeme Jarvi.)
</P>
<P>
   Six of the Bard festivals, on the other hand, have been devoted
to composers from the central Germanic tradition: Brahms,
Mendelssohn, Strauss, Schumann, Haydn and, last year, Schoenberg.
The others focused on Dvorak, Bartok, Ives and Tchaikovsky.
</P>
<P>
   The concept here is different: to dig deep into the repertories
of familiar masters, locating unusual and neglected works that help
put the masterpieces in context. To broaden that context, works of
other, often unfamiliar composers are brought to bear as well.
</P>
<P>
   Haydn was an exception, with only his own works presented, and
Beethoven is almost another, with just one program of works by his
teachers. The layout is basically chronological, with genres freely
mixed. ``It seemed the least intrusive way to raise questions about
Beethoven without imposing a solution,'' Botstein said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Great works are here, to be sure: the Fourth Piano Concerto and
the ``Pastoral'' Symphony this Saturday and the Seventh Symphony
and the Missa Solemnis next weekend. But there are also works far
off the beaten path, like the ``Cantata on the Death of the Emperor
Joseph II'' this Saturday. Next weekend, Botstein embraces the
quixotic task of reclaiming ``Wellington's Victory,'' a work that
gets no respect these days but, Botstein argues, deserves some.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beethoven presents an interesting challenge,'' he said. ``With
Haydn, we knew from the outset that no matter how deep we dug into
the drawer, the music would all be great. He couldn't write bad
music, somehow. But with a lot of Beethoven, we simply can't be
sure. We've been very selective about the canon, and we've always
had the impression that there was a big break between the very good
and everything else. I'm not entirely sure that's the case.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Farewell to the Tent
</P>
<P>
   Botstein was only too happy to discuss plans for future
festivals because they involve a new, 900-seat performing arts
center on the Bard College campus, designed by Frank Gehry and
scheduled to open in 2003. Now most of the smaller programs are
presented in a small auditorium and the orchestral concerts take
place in a tent, with acoustics little more than decent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The larger concerts are pretty soggy,'' Botstein said. ``And I
have no romance with alfresco performance.''
</P>
<P>
   The stage of the new hall is designed to accommodate opera, and
that feature, in Botstein's mind, opens the way not only to Verdi
in 2003 but also to Smetana in 2004. He has wanted to do Smetana
ever since the Dvorak outing in 1993, he said, but he felt that it
was necessary to include opera (and not just a concert performance,
as was done with Tchaikovsky's ``Maid of Orleans'' in 1998).
</P>
<P>
   For Verdi and possibly other festivals in the future, Botstein
plans to add another weekend or so to the schedule to accommodate a
run of big works: not only ``Don Carlos,'' in the four-act version
in French, and ``Falstaff,'' but also the plays on which they were
based, by Schiller and Shakespeare (``The Merry Wives of
Windsor''). Gehry is to provide stage designs for ``Don Carlos,''
the opera and the play.
</P>
<P>
   Other plans include, someday, an additional week in the fall, at
Bard College during foliage season, to complement the annual
weekend at Lincoln Center. Botstein also has hopes of instituting
some sort of training center _ whether for musicians or for
scholars he is not sure _ to take full advantage of the talent
assembled each year.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, meanwhile, Debussy gets the usual treatment. When it
emerged that the new hall would not be ready for 2002, as
originally hoped, plans were shifted ahead, leaving 2002 vacant, as
it remains at the moment. Bach, who was considered for this year,
the 250th anniversary of his death, is said to lie a few years down
the road.
</P>
<P>
   The festival gives every appearance of thriving. And audiences,
Botstein said, continue to grow steadily despite the varying
popularity of the composers represented.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we struck a nerve generally in the classical music
world with the Bard festival and with the American Symphony
concerts,'' he said, ``by curating concerts, by treating the public
seriously in a way that is not forbidding and by making music not a
dead object behind glass, but a subject of living controversy and
reinterpretation on the part of the audience as well as the
performers. People walk out of the concert hall arguing. We
actually have influenced the way programming is thought about, and
the relationship between our role as museum keepers and the current
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Influenced'' does not claim too much, certainly. Botstein and
his forces have not been alone in bringing about this change, in
bringing music out of its ivory tower and putting it in contact
with the intellectual currents of the here and now. But they have
indeed played a crucial part. They have helped create a climate in
which, as the editors write in the festival book, ``music scholars
are currently more eager to engage questions of cultural history
than cultural historians are to think about music.'' Now if they
could just wake up the cultural historians.

EGYPT RELEASES HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST
</HEADLINE>
  By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ Saad Eddin Ibrahim, a human rights activist who
has been under investigation for defaming Egypt through his
pro-democracy projects, was released on bail Thursday after being
held for 45 days in prison without being charged.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim is the founder of the Ibn Khaldoun Center for Social and
Developmental Studies, which has sponsored research on
Muslim-Christian relations and planned to set up independent
monitoring teams to observe the November parliamentary elections
here.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested at his home on June 30. Investigators
confiscated his and the center's papers, computer files and
financial documents. The center has been closed by the government,
as has a related organization that was formed to promote the
participation of women in Egyptian elections.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt's chief state prosecutor, Maher Abdel-Wahid, recommended
the release of Ibrahim and set bail at 10,000 pounds, the
equivalent of $2,915. Nadia Abdel Nour, who was Ibrahim's secretary
at the Ibn Khaldoun Center, was also released on bail Thursday. She
had also been in prison since June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim's lawyers said that during interrogations, State
Security Court prosecutors have accused him of financial
improprieties, defaming Egypt, accepting foreign money without
government approval, and disclosing information harmful to Egypt's
security.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors began their investigation two months ago by accusing
Ibrahim of harming Egypt by producing a short film that is meant to
encourage voter participation, but also mentions past accusations
of election fraud. Prosecutors also accused the scriptwriter of the
film, who was interrogated but not imprisoned, of harming Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Egyptian legal system, a suspect can be detained for
up to 60 days without being charged. During that time, the
prosecutor, who also acts as the investigator, may compile a series
of criminal accusations that may later be dropped or converted to
formal charges.
</P>
<P>
   The detention of Ibrahim, who headed the sociology department at
the American University in Cairo, prompted widespread criticism
from international human rights groups and anxiety among Egypt's
civic activists. State Department spokesmen have said his arrest
was ``disappointing'' and have called on Egypt to either clarify
the charges against Ibrahim or free him.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim, speaking after his release from Tora Prison near Cairo,
said he hoped that the prosecutors' decision to set bail is a sign
that the Egyptian government would like to quiet the international
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be careful, because my case has not been closed, but
I feel in my bones that they are trying to find a way out,'' he
said. ``And I am grateful to them for even doing this. They've
probably done more damage to Egypt's reputation than has been done
in the last 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   No Egyptian official had commented on the case until Wednesday,
when a senior aide to President Hosni Mubarak lashed out at critics
who have suggested the government wanted to silence those pushing
for political openness and reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case of Dr. Saad Eddin Ibrahim is not one of a political
nature,'' said Osama el-Baz, the presidential aide, in a press
conference. ``It is strictly a judicial matter. He has been
investigated because of certain evidence, that is not considered
crucial evidence yet, that he violated certain rules and
regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Egyptian law _ as under the laws of most Arab states _ it
is a crime to defame or insult the country or its leaders.

<P>
   For a while there, Robert Lipsky was feeling pretty cocky. Back
in October 1999, the Vancouver, Wash., bank consultant and his
wife, Angeline, had put a good portion of the money they were
saving for a new home into the H&AMP;Q IPO &AMP; Emerging Company fund. The
tech-laden portfolio shot up 100 percent in the three months after
they bought it, and suddenly it looked as if the Lipskys would be
able to afford a lot more property than they'd imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Then came this spring, when tech stocks went into their free
fall. The H&AMP;Q fund was among the hardest hit. Its wipeout was so
severe that the Lipskys' investment is now worth 20 percent less
than when they started last fall. ``When the bottom dropped out, I
felt like I had just won a couple of grand in Vegas and lost it all
again,'' Lipsky says. ``I'm now very skeptical of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Rightly so. Indeed, the market's gut-wrenching ride this year
should serve as a reminder to us all: Big investments in stocks
(tech or otherwise) simply aren't for people with short time
horizons. If you have near-term goals such as saving for a home, a
child's upcoming college education or a once-in-a-lifetime
vacation, you really should set up a separate portfolio that's
geared to protect your assets so they'll be there when you need
them.
</P>
<P>
   Being cautious, however, doesn't mean you have to sacrifice
growth entirely. With a little effort, you can produce much bigger
returns than you'd get from your basic money market fund. ``You
don't want to bet the farm,'' says Andrew Keeler, a financial
planner in Columbus, Ohio, ``but if you're too conservative, you'll
fall short of your goal _ and that's the ultimate risk.''
</P>
<P>
   So where should you put your cash? Following are three sample
portfolios for short-term investors, from conservative to fairly
aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   SUPERSAFE
</P>
<P>
   You have only a year or so before you need to spend your cash,
and you can't stomach the idea of losing any of your principal. CDs
are going to look awfully tempting, with one-year rates reaching as
high as 7.5 percent. The downside of CDs: Your money is locked up
in the investment for a fixed time, unless you're willing to pay a
penalty to take it out. You also have to pay state and federal tax
on the income. Which is why you might be happier with Treasury
notes. They're free from state and local taxes and are highly
liquid. If you're in a state with a high income tax, you might be
able to get a better after-tax return than with CDs. Plus, should
an emergency arise, or you find your dream home quicker than you
anticipated, cashing out of Treasuries isn't a problem. Recently,
two-year notes were paying 6.5 percent. You can buy them through
most brokerage firms or go directly to the government
(www.publicdebt.treas.gov) and avoid transaction fees.
</P>
<P>
   MODERATELY RISKY
</P>
<P>
   Your time frame is a little longer _ 18 months to two years,
perhaps _ so you can afford a touch of volatility in return for
bigger gains. While keeping 30 percent of your short-term savings
in Treasuries, consider putting the remaining 70 percent in a
prime-rate fund (also known as a loan-participation fund).
</P>
<P>
   These portfolios invest in loans to companies with less than
perfect credit ratings. If one of these companies goes belly up,
the fund is one of the first lenders to be repaid, unlike junk-bond
funds. Managers also diversify their risk by investing in hundreds
of loans. In fact, compared with ultrashort-term bond funds, these
portfolios deliver some of the least volatile returns. Eaton Vance
Prime Rate Reserves is one of the oldest and steadiest performers,
gaining about 6.8 percent a year in the past five years. Talk about
stability: It hasn't finished a quarter with a negative return
since it opened in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of gain can you expect? A portfolio split 30/70
between Treasury notes and a prime-rate fund should return about
6.9 percent a year. Just remember that prime-rate funds aren't
government-backed.
</P>
<P>
   AGGRESSIVE
</P>
<P>
   Once your time horizon stretches three years or beyond, you can
safely own a bond fund and maybe even a stock fund or two. A
reasonable three-year portfolio looks like this: 35 percent in a
conservative stock fund, 30 percent in a loan-participation fund,
10 percent in a taxable-bond fund and 25 percent in Treasuries.
SmartMoney's computer model shows this portfolio has historically
earned as much as 13.4 percent a year, with standard deviation of
3.5 percent. (That means two-thirds of the time the actual returns
should be within 3.5 percentage points of the estimate.)
</P>
<P>
   Two good bond funds: Strong Advantage and Sit U.S. Government
Securities. Strong Advantage does dabble in junk bonds. But with
245 holdings, the managers have been able to dilute the risk. In
the past five years, even during a tough interest-rate environment,
the fund gained 6 percent annually, compared with 5.6 percent for
its average peer. The Sit fund, a more traditional portfolio, buys
government bonds ranging from Treasuries to GNMAs. It's gained 5.8
percent annually in the past five years. But beware: If interest
rates continue to rise, this fund could get bitten.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in the highest tax brackets should consider
substituting a low-expense muni bond fund. The Vanguard
Limited-Term Tax-Exempt and USAA Tax-Exempt Short-Term funds are
two of the safest, and both are solid performers.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the stock funds. If you're willing to take on some risk,
take a look at Vanguard Growth &AMP; Income, which has actually beaten
the S&AMP;P over the past three-, five- and 10-year periods. The
managers use computer models to look for companies that are
relatively underpriced and show signs of increased earnings.
</P>
<P>
   T. Rowe Price Growth Stock, meanwhile, has beaten the S&AMP;P during
the past five years. The manager looks for companies that are
underpriced relative to their free cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   If you want a real slow cooker _ one that won't come anywhere
near a bull market's returns but won't cause you to lose sleep _
Invesco Equity Income is your fund. It has low volatility but has
gained 16.8 percent annually over the past five years. The managers
curb risk by investing in dividend-paying stocks and a smattering
of bonds. This year it's up 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>

BRIDGESTONE TO TAKE $350 MILLION CHARGE FOR RECALL COSTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With TIRE-REACT, TIRE-FORD and related stories) 
 By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Bridgestone Corp. said Thursday that it would record
a $350 million one-time accounting charge to its earnings to cover
the costs of an extensive recall of problem tires produced by
Firestone, its troubled U.S. subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   The Tokyo-based parent company, which is the world's
second-largest tire producer, said the extraordinary charge would
reduce earnings by 26 percent, to $620 million, for the fiscal year
ending Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone's already depressed stock sank deeper on the
announcement, which was made at a news conference at company
headquarters Thursday afternoon. The company's shares lost 11
percent of their value Thursday, closing at 1,849 yen, or about
$17.12. Bridgestone shares have declined 27 percent since news of
the tire troubles emerged on Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Bridgestone/Firestone, the American subsidiary,
said that it was recalling 6.5 million tires that were the subject
of a government investigation into 193 accidents that have caused
46 deaths in the United States since 1995. Bridgestone said that 80
percent of the accidents involved Ford Explorer sports-utility
vehicles outfitted with the Firestone tires.
</P>
<P>
   At least 50 lawsuits have been filed against Bridgestone and
automakers like Ford Motor that installed the tires in their cars.
Many of the suits cite failures of improperly inflated tires
running at high speeds in hot climates.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone officials said the tire troubles are likely to cost
the company far more than the $350 million reflected in the
accounting charge, which does not include reserves to settle the
lawsuits or cover the cost of recalls that are expected in other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Bridgestone Australia Ltd., which is 60 percent
owned by Bridgestone, said that if required to, it would replace
Firestone tires that are in use in Australia that have been
identified as the targets of the U.S. recall. The division said
that a Firestone four-wheel-drive tire was imported as standard
equipment on about 3,800 Ford Explorer vehicles in 1997 and that
4,500 more tires have been sold in the country as replacements.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Tadakazu Harada, Bridgestone's vice
president, said that although the company's internal investigations
so far had found no defects in the tire production process,
Bridgestone's American subsidiary ``should have done more, earlier
to advise drivers to make sure their tires were inflated to the
correct pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the Firestone recall, Standard &AMP; Poor's put
Bridgestone and its U.S. subsidiary on its CreditWatch list with
negative implications on Thursday, which means the company's credit
rating may be downgraded.
</P>
<P>
   Kenichi Kitawaki, Bridgestone's public relations manager, said
the parent company first learned of problems with the Firestone
tires in May and that while not much concrete information was
available then, the company immediately began an investigation and
cooperating with U.S. regulators.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past three months, the quantity and quality of
information has increased dramatically, and we must say that our
current understanding of the case today is drastically different
from our perception back in May,'' Kitawaki said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Bridgestone hopes to rebuild public confidence in its
tires by undertaking the voluntary recall and improving the
quality-control systems of its American subsidiary.

KIM BASINGER TAKES ON SATAN IN ``BLESS THE CHILD'' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: B-  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was only a month or so ago that Kim Basinger ended a
two-year, post-Oscar filmmaking hiatus with ``I Dreamed of
Africa,'' the story of an Italian woman who rises to nobility in an
epic struggle against the various forces of evil at work on the
dark continent.
</P>
<P>
   Now, only the blink of an eye later, she's back with her name
above the title of ``Bless the Child,'' the story of an ordinary
woman who rises to nobility in an epic struggle against an even
darker force of evil at work against all of personkind: Satan
himself.
</P>
<P>
   She plays Maggie, a childless, divorced New York City
psychiatric nurse whose life changes bigtime when her irresponsible
junkie younger sister (Angela Bettis) drops in at Maggie's
apartment one day, deposits her seemingly autistic new baby
daughter, then takes a powder.
</P>
<P>
   But Maggie rises to the occasion. She becomes a dedicated
mother, she pays for the child's special schooling and she worries
when, six years later, a string of child murders breaks out in
which the victims are all six-year-olds with the exact same
birthday as her niece.
</P>
<P>
   And she's positively frantic when the long-disappeared sister
suddenly reappears at the door with her new husband (Rufus Sewell)
_ a former TV-sitcom child star turned multi-millionaire cult
leader _ and abruptly grabs the child, apparently up to some sort
of no good.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, however, Maggie gets help from one of the more
discontented members of her new brother-in-law's gothed-out cult
(Christina Ricci) and from an aspiring priest turned New York City
police detective (Jimmy Smits) specializing in ``ritual murder.''
</P>
<P>
   She also gets assistance from a defrocked Jesuit priest (Ian
Holm) and a succession of sweet-faced strangers with a glow of
goodness-and-faith about them who keep popping up out of nowhere
whenever she gets herself in a really tight jam _ yes, angels.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even with celestial assistance, it's a tough go because
it soon turns out the little girl is so special that Satan himself
is after her, and he's not at all shy about dispatching gangs of
teenage devil-worshipers, legions of rats and squadrons of
computer-generated flying demons against anyone who gets in his
way.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Stigmata,'' Arnold Schwarzenegger's ``End of Days'' and
several other recent films that use apocalyptic biblical mythology
in a straight-faced way to evoke modern horror, this film
constantly threatens to collapse in silliness and become an
unintentional comedy, a ``Dogma''-like parody of itself.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, amazingly, it doesn't. The movie works _ at least
marginally. Basinger's ingratiating earnestness and vulnerability,
Sewell's marvelously demonic villainy, producer Mace Newfeld's
first-rate production values and Chuck Russell's inventive
direction combine to make this a genuinely creepy experience.

`REPLACEMENTS' PLAYS BY THE RULES WITH MINDLESS, BUT ENJOYABLE
PLOT

 Our Grade: C

<P>
   The premise is so promising. A team of working class guys get a
one-time shot at playing in the NFL during the 1987 players'
strike.
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to Howard Deutch (late of ``Grumpier Old Men'' and
``The Odd Couple II'') to bench every potentially interesting
conflict and simply crib from the ``Major League'' playbook.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Hackman, coasting on charm and lazy smiles, is
``controversial'' coach Jimmy McGinty, pulled out of retirement to
create a new team from thin air. He must be psychic for he's
already compiled his list of never-was players, complete with
addresses and current occupations.
</P>
<P>
   Anchoring his daydream team is Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), a
quarterback who choked in a college bowl game in front of the
entire country. Now scrubbing barnacles off boats for a living, he
signs on to a squad formed of a butterfingers sprinter (Orlando
Jones), an over-stimulated SWAT cop (Jon Favreau, whose one-note
mania is surprisingly hilarious), a trash-talking, chain-smoking
Welsh place kicker (Rhys Ifans), a sumo wrestler (Ace Yonamime) and
roll call of unlikely talents with similarly colorful resumes.
</P>
<P>
   Personalities clash, insults fly and the bonding begins,
appropriately enough, on the field of battle most suited to these
working class slobs: a bar fight.
</P>
<P>
   Sliding the setting from the real NFL to an imaginary league,
Deutch and writer Vince McKewin make short work of the strike by
avoiding the issues and populating the picket line with greedy,
vain, abrasive bullies. Our blue-collar replacements aren't scabs,
they're salt-of-the-earth heroes bringing heart and spirit back
into a game sullied by millionaire players and their endorsement
deals. (In a flabbergasting subplot, the filmmakers find their
working-class cheerleader replacements in strippers but only after
a tryout that trots out every sexist stereotype for ridicule.)
</P>
<P>
   Apart from its dubious honor of being the most anti-union
American film in recent history, ``The Replacements'' does its job.
Reeves drops his breathy ``dude''-speak to play a sincere, modest
guy with a great arm and a dream, just a lug taking his last chance
to prove himself, and his romance with forthright veteran
cheerleader Brooke Langton is both cute and adult.
</P>
<P>
   Hackman never raises a sweat as the old pro whose legendary
temper is never more than a scolding bark, but he proves once again
that his second best is still a charge to be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch never raises the film beyond its paint-by-numbers
blueprint _ there's not a surprise to be seen from first practice
to final quarter _ but he ably pours on the sight gags and one
liners. It's an entertaining game, but strictly minor league.

&HT;     WORLD WAR II HEROES SAY TOO FEW BLACKS ARE IN THE COCKPIT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SIG CHRISTENSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ More than 50 years after the famed Tuskegee Airmen
broke the color barrier in the cockpit, the Air Force pilot corps
remains largely white.
</P>
<P>
   Only 232 blacks, about 2 percent of 12,368 pilots, fly Air Force
planes today, and the service says that figure has changed little
in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   a number of Tuskegee Airmen meeting this week at the group's
annual convention in San Antonio said the Air Force must find new
ways of putting more blacks in its pilot ranks, and the service's
top civilian is vowing to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly we are not attracting, proportionately, the number of
minority men and women we ought to be attracting into the Air
Force,'' Air Force Secretary F. Whitten Peters said Wednesday.
``That's very clear, and we are trying to figure out ways to reach
out into the community to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Though African-Americans have flown for decades, the Air Force's
pilot corps remains a preserve of white men, who make up roughly
nine of every 10 fliers.
</P>
<P>
   Like blacks, who make up 12.2 percent of the U.S. population,
Hispanics, too, are underrepresented among the service's pilots
with 200 flying today, according to statistics from the Air Force
Personnel Center at Randolph Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity is not new, but it is receiving fresh attention.
Leaders of four historically black universities, one of them Patt
Quinn College in Dallas, spent three hours Tuesday in the Pentagon
with Peters and other officials discussing ways to boost minority
recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   Peters acknowledged that ``we do have a marketing problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Peters said he doubted that bigotry is even partly
responsible for the low number of minority pilots in the Air Force,
the African-Americans who braved raw racism and Nazi fire over the
skies of Germany 55 years ago aren't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think it's intended racism, but I think it's a
lack of understanding on the part of both parties,'' said retired
Air Force Lt. Col. Alva Temple, 83, of Columbus, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some racism, and there will always be for many years
into the future,'' said another Tuskegee alumnus, retired Air Force
Lt. Col. Spann Watson, 83, of Westbury, N.Y. ``However, it is only
one factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Those in and out of the Air Force are certain racism cannot be
blamed for the dearth of black pilots, as it was in the early 1940s
when the first all-black squadrons were formed at Tuskegee Army Air
Base in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   They say a booming economy and, ironically, the success of
blacks have worked to draw African-Americans into lucrative
private-sector jobs, rather than the cockpit of Air Force planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is racism, it's going to be pretty subtle, and it's
going to be at a level that a two-star general is probably not
going to be able to see,'' said Maj. Gen. Daniel James III,
adjutant general of the Texas National Guard and son of the late
Gen. Daniel ``Chappie'' James, a member of the Tuskegee squadron
who became the nation's first black four-star general in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is booming and black Americans, like white
Americans, have more opportunity than they ever had,'' University
of Texas professor John S. Butler, co-author of ``All That We Can
Be: Black Leadership and Integration the Army Way.'' ``So a lot of
them are not choosing the military.''
</P>
<P>
   All the military services are struggling to sign up and keep
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   During the past three years, Peters said, there has been a
growing awareness of shortcomings in minority recruiting, and the
Air Force has worked with the Tuskegee Airmen and the Organization
of Black Airline Pilots to develop strategies.
</P>
<P>
   While neither the service nor Congress has created a formal
minority recruiting program, the Air Force earmarks millions of
dollars for advertising in predominantly black and Hispanic media
outlets, as well as career days involving school principals,
counselors and students.
</P>
<P>
   Fledgling aviation awareness programs have taken wing in
Delaware and Mississippi as part of cooperative efforts with the
Air Force and historically black colleges there. Yet another
program may start in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, Peters said it may take a decade before the
cockpits of the Air Force look anything like the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we put the same emphasis on getting black pilots the way we
do black basketball players,'' he said, ``we'd have more black
pilots.''

DESPITE FINE ACTING, ``OPPORTUNISTS' NEVER QUITE ENGAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: C+  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American-indie drama, ``The Opportunists,'' has quite a bit
going for it: a delicate and character-driven storyline, an
absorbing performance from the always reliable Christopher Walken
and plenty of authentic, lower-middle-class New York atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, however, it doesn't add up to be anything more than the
sum of its parts. Whatever that mysterious ``touch'' is that makes
a film jump memorably to life is missing from both Myles Connell's
earnest script and low-key, first-time direction. It keeps
threatening to engage us, but never quite does.
</P>
<P>
   Walken plays a well-meaning, hardworking Queens mechanic and
ex-con who is valiantly trying to make his life work while
struggling with a failing business and difficult relationships with
his aged aunt (Anne Pitoniak), his twentysomething daughter (Vera
Farmiga) and his live-in girlfriend (Cyndi Lauper).
</P>
<P>
   As the film opens, his finances have just gone from bad to
worse, and the story deals with the complications that ensue when
he tries to solve his money problems by joining a neighborhood
no-good (the ubiquitous Donal Logue) in a plot to crack the safe of
a local trucking firm.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, Connell steers clear of the usual caper-movie
formulaics and tries hard to be an honest character study, what he
calls an ``homage to a flawed but worthy man. ... a portrait of
someone's life and community in the style of many '70s films.''
</P>
<P>
   And Walken is more that up to the task of communicating the core
of this character. He holds the screen as well as any
character-lead in films today, and he quickly makes us forget the
string of loony villains he's portrayed recently to totally embrace
this man and his plight.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the film does a good job of evoking its unique
setting: the Sunnyside section of Queens. Walken grew up only a few
blocks away (the son of a Queens baker), as did co-star Lauper, and
writer-director Connell lived in the neighborhood for several years
ago when he as a recent Irish immigrant. The characters and
backgrounds positively ooze authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   Why then is ``The Opportunists'' unlikely be up for 10 Academy
Awards next February? Because it has very little impact. Because
it's so deliberately muted and non-exploitative that there's little
dramatic buildup in its narrative or much of a catharsis in its
climax.
</P>
<P>
   The excellent performances don't really work off each other well
or create an ensemble, and the ``big'' scene that should pull all
its characters and themes together is simply not there. As
enjoyable and engaging as it is in spots, it's finally emotionally
flat and eminently forgettable.

<P>
   WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass. _ Museums, with their deep storage and
archival mission, have long served as quiet graveyards for
discarded art. But these days they seem to be functioning more like
rehab centers.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, everything that was old and out is new and in: Norman
Rockwell, Maxfield Parrish, Adolphe-William Bouguereau. The
has-beens, the also-rans, the never-weres of history, the
criminally neglected and the just plain criminal are being hauled
out, dressed in up-to-date ideas and put back into circulation.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is fun, and often illuminating, almost anyone would
agree. But why the salvage operation now? As always, the market
must be taken into account. With A-list items in ever shorter
supply, fresh material has to be found. At least as important (and
by no means unconnected) is the continuing predominance of social
history as the academic lens through which art is viewed.
</P>
<P>
   By that lens' cool analytical lights, beauty and greatness
aren't inherent in objects. They are culturally based value
judgments made in response to social and political needs. Technical
skills may be quantifiable (which is why critics and audiences
fixate on them), but the old sliding-scale grading system based on
taste is, if not useless, a little beside the point. All this
thinking plays a part in a smart, entertaining grandmother's
suitcase of a show titled ``Noble Dreams, Wicked Pleasures:
Orientalism in America, 1870-1930'' at the Sterling and Francine
Clark Art Institute.
</P>
<P>
   In it, a few canonical painters like John Singer Sargent rub
shoulders with such half-forgotten colleagues as Henry Siddons
Mowbray, Charles Sprague Pearce and Ella Ferris Pell. And everyone
scrunches up to make room for Shriner hats, cigar boxes and Rudolph
Valentino, all to suggest America's complex attitudes toward a
specific part of the non-Western world _ the Islamic countries near
the Mediterranean _ between the Civil War and the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   The theme is based on Edward Said's provocative 1978 book
``Orientalism,'' which indicts European, specifically French,
colonialist views of Muslim Asia and North Africa as a lethal mix
of racial prejudice and willful misunderstanding. Although Said's
field of investigation is literature, it is easy to find supporting
evidence in French paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Two such pictures, both by the academician Jean-Leon Gerome
(1824-1904), are in the exhibition. One, ``The Snake Charmer,''
which appears on the cover of Said's book, is a skillfully wrought
homoerotic fantasy with a naked light-skinned boy, dark-skinned
Arabs and wall-to-wall phallic symbols, all set within a gorgeous
blue-tiled room.
</P>
<P>
   The other painting, ``The Slave Market.'' depicts a nude girl
being inspected by a turbaned man who shoves two fingers into her
mouth. Essentially an image of public rape, it sums up Gerome's
Orient: a benighted realm of depraved men and passive, available
women. No wonder _ the message was clear _ France had to bring
those people under control.
</P>
<P>
   Many ambitious American artists studied with Gerome in Paris; he
was a major, best-selling art guru of the day. They picked up on
his Orientalist subjects but changed them, customizing them for
American tastes. It is in defining those differences that the
exhibition, organized by a team of scholars led by Holly Edwards, a
professor of Islamic art at Williams College, gains interest.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest painting on view, ``Jerusalem From the Mount of
Olives,'' by Frederic Edwin Church, actually has nothing to do with
France at all. To many mid-19th-century Americans, the Orient meant
one thing: the biblical Holy Land, which they took to be a
prototype for America itself, the latter-day Promised Land with a
chosen people. Church saw it this way. His panoramic view of a
Jerusalem washed in a kind of celestial glow is very much in the
mode of his New World wilderness landscapes. In both, the
perspective is one of topographical omniscience, which implies
divine beneficence, but also a sense of ownership and surveillance,
appropriate to a country that took Manifest Destiny as a national
creed.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the picture was painted, though, Church's brand of
moral uplift was out of date, and sexier takes on the fabled East
were in place. As early as 1855, for example, the American writer
Bayard Taylor (1825-1878) had a smash hit with his escapist travel
book ``Lands of the Saracens,'' and boosted sales by turning up to
give lectures in caftans and pointed slippers.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, meanwhile, American artists were scrupulously
imitating Continental styles but toning down racy subjects for the
folks back home. Harem interiors and female bathing scenes, the
erotic staples of French Orientalist art, are all but absent in
American work, and when they appear they seem to be based on a
different script.
</P>
<P>
   The snoozing odalisque in ``The Siesta,'' by Frederick Arthur
Bridgman, a leading American Orientalist, is fully clothed except
for bare ankles and arms. Apart from the presence of a monkey and
hashish pipe, she might be in a suburban living room. The same
artist's version of a bathing scene is a singularly unsteamy
advertisement for Victorian family values, with a proud young
Algerian mom watching her child splash around in a basin.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In more inventive hands, Orientalism inspired some striking
images. Sargent's ``Ambergris Smoke,'' a sibylline study in white
and beige, is one. Another is Henry Ossawa Tanner's all-blue
``Christ Appearing to Nicodemus,'' which harks back to an older
pietistic art. And Albert Pinkham Ryder, in a jewel-like painting
titled ``The Scout,'' makes the single figure of a North African
horseman both ethnographically accurate and as insubstantial as a
mirage.
</P>
<P>
   Ryder, reclusive in his later years, actually traveled to North
Africa once, in 1882. His New York dealer made him do it, and
apparently a bad time was had by all. Louis Comfort Tiffany also
made the trip, but he came down with the measles in Egypt and drove
his traveling companion _ the painter Robert Swain Gifford, also in
the show _ to distraction with his kvetching.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Ella Pell seems to have enjoyed roughing it. After
graduating from the Design School for Women at Cooper Union in New
York, she traveled for more than five years on a modest budget
through Europe, Egypt, Palestine and Turkey, sketching and writing
in her journal as she went. Her drawings are small and careful, but
back at home she painted an image of the Judean princess Salome
that has the commanding glamour of a theater poster.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, American Orientalism was all about theater,
replete with costumes and props and special effects. William
Merritt Chase, who never set foot in Asia, tarted up his New York
studio with all manner of Asian gewgaws as a promotional lure. And
Church built an elaborate live-in stage set in the form of Olana,
his tiled and turreted mansion over the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   Artifacts from Olana are here, most of them souvenirs of the
artist's travels. But with the advent of the crafts-intensive
Aesthetic Movement, similar forms were adapted for American
manufacture, as in the case of the outstandingly kooky ``Alhambra
Pot,'' by Cordelia A. Plimpton, a member of the Cincinnati Pottery
Club, and a sleek satinwood ``Moorish Desk,'' designed by Tiffany
for the men-only smoking rooms that enjoyed a vogue in wealthy
American homes.
</P>
<P>
   They are part of a jumble of objects on the museum's second
floor. If this generous spread of material culture expands ``Noble
Dreams'' beyond previous surveys of American Orientalism, it also
deprives it of a cohesive shape and focus. (Edwards acknowledges
her curatorial struggle with this problem in the catalog.)
Shopper's fatigue quickly sets in, but that in itself makes
historical sense in the context.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the 19th century, the Holy Land of America was
essentially the commodity culture of today, with its unstoppable
flood of tantalizing, have-able, disposable things. Art became part
of the sales pitch; Orientalist images appeared on every surface
and in every form, as a mark of quality and as a guarantee of
pleasure, forbidden or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarettes, then a hot new concept, were given Oriental brand
names like Fatima, Omar and the still-with-us Camels. Songs like
``My Turkish Opal From Constantinople'' topped the charts. A new
branch of freemasonry called the Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles
of the Mystic Shrine, or Shriners, drew on the combined
mystification and amusement that the idea of Asia had always evoked
in Americans.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was sex, once suppressed, now out in the open,
big time, in books, fashion and ``hoochie-coochie'' dancing of the
kind depicted in Robert Henri's ``Salome,'' a painting of a
statuesque, bangles-and-beads, proto-Ziegfeld good-time girl.
</P>
<P>
   From there it was just a short step _ or a long slide, as
moralists saw it _ to the movies, and the exhibition concludes with
screenings of Valentino's eruptive 1921 film ``The Sheik,'' for
which a brand of condoms was named.
</P>
<P>
   A ``That's Entertainment'' ending to the show seems far removed
from Said's furious book. But it is in line with some of the
catalog essays, which argue that in America Orientalism was an
essentially positive and embracing phenomenon, rather than the
instrument of cultural control it became in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe. But I think many of the paintings, with their
tendency to validate another culture by rephrasing it in terms of
Western aesthetics, deserve a more critical reading. And as Edwards
suggests, whenever you hear non-Western art discussed, as
frequently happens, in terms of stereotypes like timelessness and
universality, or as a set of attractive styles rather than a body
of challenging ideas, you are on retrograde turf.
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly the turf, visually speaking, that ``Noble
Dreams'' is all about, and it has been staked out in Williamstown
with fine, self-knowing aplomb. As for the likes of the
milquetoasty Bridgman and the redoubtable Pell, and the countless
other artists who are no doubt in line for reclamation, as long as
they serve scholarship well, as they do here, they can expect to
enjoy full and useful second careers.
</P>

&HT;     COURT CLEARS WAY FOR MOLESTATION SUIT AGAINST SCOUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BOB EGELKO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Setting a statewide precedent for lawsuits
against the nation's most venerated youth organization, the
California Supreme Court has cleared the way for a San Leandro man
to go to trial in a lawsuit accusing the Boy Scouts of failing to
protect him from molestation a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The court unanimously denied review Wednesday of an appellate
ruling, the first in California, that said the Scouts' local and
national organizations could be held legally responsible for
molestation by a volunteer Scout leader. Trial courts statewide are
bound by the ruling and will have to let similar suits proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Paz, the assistant scoutmaster who admitted molesting
Mario Juarez and nine other youths, is now serving a 14-year prison
sentence. He was a teacher's aide in Oakland and had no previous
criminal record or history of sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   But Juarez said the Scouts could have protected him by requiring
his Oakland troop to educate youths and adults about preventing
molestation, using the Scouts' own acclaimed training program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be seeking millions of dollars against the Boy
Scouts because they knew better,'' said Charles A. Bonner, a lawyer
for Juarez. ``They knew the organization attracts pedophiles like a
magnet attracts metal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Scouts argued in court papers that they had no reason to
foresee the molestation, could not have prevented it with an
educational program and should not be held liable for it.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate ruling, which reinstated Juarez's suit after a
judge dismissed it, ``held that it is the duty of Boy Scouts of
America to crime-proof the children of America against sexual
molestation through education,'' wrote Nicholas Heldt, an attorney
for the Scouts. ``This duty . . . will be asserted against every
youth-serving organization in California.''
</P>
<P>
   Child molestation has become a plague despite large-scale
educational programs in schools, Heldt said. He said the Scouts
were among the few private organizations to educate youths and
adults about prevention.
</P>
<P>
   However, the 1st District Court of Appeal, citing the Scouts'
own reports of more than one incident of sexual abuse nationwide
for the past two decades, said, ``It should be reasonably
foreseeable to the Scouts that a child participating in Scouting
might fall prey to a sexual predator.''
</P>
<P>
   A jury should decide whether the Scouts were negligent for
failing to require local troops to use their training materials,
which included a 29-minute video, and whether the educational
program would have prevented the molestation, said Justice Ignazio
Ruvolo in the 3-0 ruling May 12.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Scouts now argue that education doesn't stop
molestation, Ruvolo said, one study of their educational program
found that it was effective in detecting molesters: The number of
male Scout leaders barred for sexual abuse rose from 169 in 1987,
the year before the program started, to 209 in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the privilege of being able to contribute directly to the
moral and spiritual development of millions of American youths
comes some legal responsibility,'' Ruvolo said.
</P>
<P>
   Juarez's lawsuit said the educational program could have shown
him how to recognize and resist sexual abuse. He said it also would
have alerted other leaders that Paz was violating Scout rules by
taking troop members on overnight trips without another adult
present, sleeping in the same tent as the boys and inviting them to
his home for swimming and overnight stays.
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scout Handbook contained some information on
molestation, but was provided only in English. Juarez said he and
his mother, who had recently emigrated with him from Honduras,
spoke only Spanish, as did most of the boys in the troop.

`TAO' LACKS FOLLOW-THROUGH, BUT INDIE DIRECTOR SHOWS PROMISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quick! Rattle off the names of three romantic comedies in which
the heroine is movie-star gorgeous, but the male lead is
significantly overweight _ in fact, an out-and-out slob.
</P>
<P>
   Tough, huh?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it's so unusual a cinematic situation that it gives the
slight American indie ``The Tao of Steve'' the illusion of being
some sort of profound, taboo-breaking landmark. Outside of a few
failed star vehicles for John Belushi and Eddie Murphy in his fat
suit, it's a definite rarity.
</P>
<P>
   And this novelty is also more than half the reason, I suspect,
why the film has managed to make a surprisingly big name for itself
on the festival circuit (including last spring's Seattle
International Film Festival) and gain more pre-release media
attention than just about any other low-budget, star-deficient, Gen
X dating comedy of the year.
</P>
<P>
   It's the story of Dex (Donal Logue), an obese, slovenly,
dope-smoking kindergarten teacher who has combined his observations
of the macho appeal of Steve McQueen _ whom he calls the ``epitome
of American cool'' _ with certain Taoist principles to create his
own personal philosophy for scoring with women.
</P>
<P>
   The script deals with how the big lug gets his comeuppance when
he falls for Syd (Greer Goodman), a woman he meets at his 10-year
college reunion _ or, more properly, re-meets, since she claims he
slept with her years ago in a one-night stand he can't remember.
(Yes, the exact premise of McQueen's ``Love With the Proper
Stranger.'')
</P>
<P>
   In the plus column, some of the dialogue sparkles nicely, the
first-time direction of Jenniphr Goodman is remarkably sure of
itself, cinematographer Teodoro Maniaci always makes the most of
his Santa Fe locations, and the overall production values are much
more polished than we usually get in low-budget indie romances.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is that, once the unlikely romantic hero and the
promising premise are established, the movie just doesn't do
anything very interesting with them. Like most films in this
overworked genre, it's as formulaic in its own way as a John Wayne
western, and the characters and situations all have a gnawing
predictability about them.
</P>
<P>
   Your enjoyment of the movie is ultimately likely to depend on
how you relate to Logue as a star. His presence seems to require a
love-him or hate-him commitment, and I personally found him
considerably less charming than did the Sundance Festival jurors,
who awarded him its special jury prize for ``outstanding
performance.''

<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `ALICE AND MARTIN,' starring Juliette Binoche and Alexis Loret.
Directed by Andre Techine (R, 123 minutes). Techine's sprawling,
emotional love story is the kind of movie that makes you work a
little. It takes time to figure out the relationships among the
characters, to say nothing of their motives and feelings. But like
so many of Techine's movies, ``Alice and Martin'' repays the
effort. The unlikely, complicated passion between Martin, the
troubled illegitimate son of a wealthy industrialist, and Alice, a
brittle violinist, unfolds against an equally complicated and
sometimes overcrowded background of family secrets and shifting
domestic alliances. Binoche and Loret are superb in the title roles
(A.O. Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `BUTTERFLY,' starring Fernando Fernan Gomez and Manuel Lozano.
Directed by Jose Luis Cuerda (R, 96 minutes). This gentle,
devastating film, based on short stories by the Spanish writer
Manuel Rivas, tells the story of Moncho ( Lozano), a sensitive
young boy coming of age in the months before the outbreak of the
Spanish Civil War. The movie touches on the usual excitements and
mysteries of childhood, but Moncho's relationship with his teacher,
the proudly republican Don Gregorio, beautifully played by Fernan
Gomez, gives the story an unusual degree of pathos and political
complexity (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `CHICKEN RUN,' with the voices of Mel Gibson, Miranda Richardson
and Julia Sawalha. Directed by Peter Lord and Nick Park (G, 86
minutes). The first full-length feature from Aardman Animation is
immensely satisfying, a divinely relaxed and confident film that
credits youngsters' interest in a cartoon more substantial than the
standard bland musical. The movie employs modeled latex figures to
tell the story of a group of chickens desperate to escape from a
chicken farm before they are turned into pies. Park, who also
directed the fabulous Wallace and Gromit shorts, transfers all of
the deftness and imagination of his shorter films into an artful
big-screen realization. And this briskly paced epic uses Lord's
continuing satirical take on British modesty and balmy superiority.
``Chicken Run'' parodies cultural touchstones from ``Stalag 17'' to
``Star Trek'' to the loose-cannon heroics of Gibson, the voice of
Rocky, the matinee-idol flying rooster who is asked to teach the
hens to fly. Finally it shows that the hens can save themselves
through the pluck of Ginger (Sawalha) and doesn't make a big deal
of this. It's a great eggscape from banality (Elvis Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `CHUCK AND BUCK,' starring Chris Weitz and Mike White. Directed
by Miguel Arteta (R, 95 minutes). At the center of Arteta's funny,
creepy and poignant new film is Buck, a 27-year-old man who
inhabits the mental world of a preadolescent boy. As played by
White, who also wrote the screenplay, Buck is needy and sensitive,
an object equally of sympathy and revulsion. The film chronicles
his attempt to rekindle his childhood bond with his old friend
Charlie ( Weitz), who has grown into a distant, self-absorbed
careerist. Arteta's visual sense, White's insightful script, and
strong supporting performances from Weitz and his brother Paul, as
well as from Lupe Ontiveros as a kindly theater manager, make this
one of the most unusual and affecting coming-of-age stories in some
time. ``Chuck and Buck'' is an antidote to the current epidemic of
lazy nostalgia for the innocence of childhood and therefore,
magically, one of the few truly grown-up movies you're likely to
see this year (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `DISNEY'S `THE KID,'' starring Bruce Willis, Spencer Breslin,
Emily Mortimer, Lily Tomlin and Jean Smart. Directed by Jon
Turteltaub (PG, 101 minutes). In this cloying throwback to Disney's
modest live-action comedies of old, Willis plays a smarmy image
consultant humanized by his encounter with his 8-year-old self
(Spencer Breslin), who arrives in Los Angeles via a toy red prop
plane. By rights the movie should be dreadful, and it is thick with
therapeutic cliches, but it occasionally soars to heights of not
bad, thanks to strong performances from Willis, Tomlin and Smart,
and to Audrey Wells' surprisingly clever script (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `THE EYES OF TAMMY FAYE,' directed by Fenton Bailey and Randy
Barbato (PG-13, 79 minutes). Tammy Faye Bakker Messner, the former
wife of Jim Bakker, is that most American of stories, a figure of
tragedy and a joke. This documentary walks us through her life, a
veritable catalog of bad marriages, lost televangelist empires,
squandered relationships with children and, despite it all,
indomitable optimism. ``The Eyes of Tammy Faye'' cries out for a
little more analysis of its subject. Instead, it joyfully wallows
in the backdraft of her excesses. The directors are awfully quick
to forgive Messner's lack of self-awareness, possibly because she
has a heart as big as her hair. She was one of the first in the
televangelist crowd to accept gay men with AIDS. The movie makes a
case for her because she's a survivor; it's more of a mash note
than a formal documentary, and there's nothing wrong with that
(Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `HOLLOW MAN,' starring Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue. Directed
by Paul Verhoeven (R, 114 minutes). Verhoeven's sluggish new
special-effects thriller takes a tantalizing premise _ the
corrupting effects of invisibility _ and drowns it in horror-movie
hackwork. Bacon plays an egomaniacal scientist who injects himself
with a serum that disrupts his ``quantum synchronization with the
visible universe.'' You can guess the rest. He ends up pursuing his
colleagues (including his ex-girlfriend, played by Shue) through a
labyrinthine underground laboratory, looking, thanks to
computer-generated imagery, like a plasticine anatomical model on a
rampage (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `NUTTY PROFESSOR II: THE KLUMPS,' starring Eddie Murphy and
Janet Jackson. Directed by Peter Segal (PG-13, 105 minutes). In
this sequel, Murphy again displays enough agility to show that he
deserves to be taken seriously. Parts of the film, a variation on
the Jekyll and Hyde story, are tremendously funny. Every single
scene in which Murphy, hidden away under millions of dollars' worth
of transformative makeup, plays all the members of the Klump family
_ all of them together in some scenes _ will knock the blues right
out of you. But some of the cheap laughs to which the picture
stoops will give you the blues. This makes ``Nutty Professor II''
half a movie at best. The broad humor at times derails Murphy's
performances, but the film provides a vehicle for him to display
his reach (Mitchell).

   `THE PATRIOT,' starring Mel Gibson and Chris Cooper. Directed by
Roland Emmerich (R, 158 minutes). A grueling Revolutionary War epic
that, at more than two and a half hours, seems to take place in
real time. The brutality and sentimentality are effective, though
the film will leave you feeling used as you exit the theater. This
sort-of prequel to Emmerich's ``Independence Day'' stars Gibson as
a gentle farmer who leads the Colonies in wresting freedom from the
Brits, using counterintuitive methods alarmingly similar to
terrorism. His anguished masculinity is brandished like a musket.
The film's chief asset is his relationship with the young actors
playing his children; it draws on the actor's real-life feeling
about his own large brood, and his work with them is stirring
(Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `THE PERFECT STORM,' starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg,
Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, John C. Reilly and Diane Lane.
Directed by Wolfgang Petersen (PG-13, 130 minutes). Impressive but
monotonously redundant special effects smother the human drama in
this true story (adapted from Sebastian Junger's best-selling book)
of a group of swordfishermen battling ``the storm of the century''
off Massachusetts in 1991. Clooney is the ship's glowering,
enigmatic captain, and Wahlberg and Lane are the appealing
lovebirds who lend the movie its stingy quotient of warmth. The
early scenes, which paint a romantic portrait of the fisherman's
life in Gloucester, Mass., promise a great deal, but the movie
becomes waterlogged once it leaves shore (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `SAVING GRACE,' starring Brenda Blethyn and Craig Ferguson.
Directed by Nigel Cole (R, 93 minutes). This innocuous piece of
comic Anglophilia features the usual cast of lovable British
eccentrics plopped down in a picturesque seaside spot, in this case
a Cornish village. Blethyn is Grace, a widow whose husband has
committed suicide, leaving her $450,000 in debt and in danger of
losing her lovely stone house. She and her resourceful gardener (
Ferguson, who also wrote the screenplay), convert her greenhouse
into a marijuana farm, and the resulting high jinks resemble a twee
hybrid of ``The Full Monty'' and the lesser works of Cheech and
Chong (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `SPACE COWBOYS,' starring Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones,
Donald Sutherland and James Garner. Directed by Eastwood. The
second half of Eastwood's new movie is a pleasant reworking of the
standard trouble-in-space movie, with Eastwood himself leading a
heroic team of astronauts that also includes Jones, Sutherland and
Garner. But the first half, which consists of the comic,
tough-old-guy interplay between these four sublime actors, is a
boisterous, easygoing tribute to manhood and maturity. Sutherland
and Jones are in especially fine form, as are Marcia Gay Harden,
playing a NASA engineer, and James Cromwell as (once again) the
villainous bureaucrat who tries to deny the old-timers their shot
at celestial glory (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `THE TAO OF STEVE,' starring Donal Logue and Greer Goodman.
Directed by Jenniphr Goodman (R, 87 minutes). The ``Steve'' in the
title refers to the spiritual embodiment of cool as exemplified by
Steve McQueen, Steve McGarrett (``Hawaii Five-0'') and Steve Austin
(``The Six Million Dollar Man''), a goal to which the blobby and
amiable Dex aspires. In this light-as-a-marshmallow romantic
comedy, Dex ( Logue) has lined up quotes from Heidegger, Thomas
Aquinas and ``Don Giovanni'' to rationalize his aimless
pleasure-seeking in this rather aimless movie. Logue's performance
as a nice-guy player _ his weight doesn't keep him from scoring
with the ladies _ makes the movie glide. Dex has a cherub's glee
over what he gets away with. The movie becomes a lot less
interesting when it rolls around to the inevitable quest for a
steady relationship with a girl ( Goodman) whose feelings were
trampled in Dex's compulsive fox-hunting. ``Tao'' can't redeem the
moves to its predictable end, but its protagonist has a great time
getting there (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `WHAT LIES BENEATH,' starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison
Ford. Directed by Robert Zemeckis (PG-13, 130 minutes). Zemeckis'
film takes its time in laying out the story of high-strung Claire (
Pfeiffer), who is dissolving into hysteria on a regular basis. Her
daughter has just gone off to college, and Claire is still
recovering from the trauma of a car accident. Then her house starts
showing signs of being haunted. Her husband, Norman ( Ford), is a
driven research scientist with a secret. This thriller is as
implausibly chilling as any ``X-Files'' episode. By the last 10
minutes, your interest will have long vanished (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `THE WIND WILL CARRY US,' starring Behzad Dourani. Directed by
Abbas Kiarostami (not rated, 118 minutes). The latest film by the
Iranian director _ widely considered one of the greatest living
filmmakers _ is oblique, evocative and visually stunning.
Kiarostami's views of hillsides, valleys and gnarled, solitary
trees seem almost otherworldly in their clarity and depth, and his
story, about a morose engineer who has come to a remote Kurdish
village on an enigmatic mission, is as simple and mysterious as a
folk tale. This is one of those rare movies that completely absorb
your attention _ and demand your concentration _ while you're
watching, and that stay in your thoughts, growing richer and more
powerful, for a long time afterward (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `X-MEN,' starring Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman,
Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Halle Berry and Anna Paquin. Directed
by Bryan Singer (PG-13, 105 minutes). The long-awaited arrival of
Marvel Comics' do-gooder mutants is mildly fun on a couple of
levels: for one, the acting duel between Stewart (as the mutant
telepath Professor X, the X-Men's leader) and Ian McKellen (as the
mutant nemesis Magneto, who possesses the power of supermagnetism).
As these two austere hams trill their vowels at each other, you get
the feeling you really are watching members of another species in
action. And Jackman scores as the two-fisted, confrontational
Wolverine, a mutant with superstrength, an ability to heal all
wounds and metal-alloy claws that shoot out from his knuckles. He
lives to fight, a boisterous tragic hero with no complications.
Otherwise the movie is an earnest affair that is clumsy when it
should be light on its feet; it takes itself even more seriously
than the comic book does, though its fans may be overjoyed by that
devotion (Mitchell).

   Yeah, yeah, the Democrats are on tonight, but it's probably the
dullest day of the convention. The real action is on Wall Street,
specifically in ``Bull,'' cable network TNT's first-ever drama
series, which premieres at 8 (with repeats at 9 and 10).
</P>
<P>
   George Newbern stars as a young turk who leads a handful of his
colleagues _ including Malik Yoba, Ian Kahn and Elisabeth Rohm _
out of their cushy jobs at the old-line firm run by his grandfather
(Donald Moffat) and out on their own. Christopher Wiehl is the
midwestern everyman who's intended as our guide through this
sometimes treacherous world. And Stanley Tucci lights things up as
an operator who works all sides of the Street.
</P>
<P>
   Producer Michael Chernuchin worked on ``Law &AMP; Order'' for
several years and is a respected writer. This could be a good show.
Interestingly, Fox has a similar young-turks-on-Wall-Street drama
coming in the fall, and that's pretty good too. Could Hollywood
have finally caught up with reality, six months after Internet
stocks collapsed?
</P>

`THE OPPORTUNISTS': NO MORE MR. REGULAR CITIZEN: IT'S BACK TO THE
BAD OLD DAYS
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.)  
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Money changes everything,'' Cyndi Lauper once sang
in her cover of the Brains' original, and as Sally, a bar owner in
``The Opportunists,'' she gets to watch that aphorism take on a sad
and poky life. Money could change the life of Vic (Christopher
Walken), her boyfriend and the picture's protagonist, an ex-felon
who might as well sport a ``Born to Lose'' T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Vic slaves at keeping his struggling auto repair shop alive. In
the opening, he is shown lovingly rubbing down a vintage '70s
Riviera, buffing it to a gloss worthy of Teo Maniaci's eye-catching
cinematography. This is one of the best-photographed pictures of
the year, but not ostentatiously so; the look is organic to the
less-than-glamorous badlands of Sunnyside, Queens, where the movie
is set.
</P>
<P>
   Myles Connell, who wrote and directed the picture, gives it the
sleepy pace of a late fall day when the biggest event turns out to
be waiting to see if the sun will break through the gray haze. The
film has the ambience of a real neighborhood, but Connell can't
seem to give it substance. Sometimes it seems to be fading away in
front of your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Opportunists,'' which opens Friday at the Angelika Film
Center, is meant to be a distinct 180-degree turn from the gritty,
tense robbery movies that are generally about nothing but
moviemaking _ a respectable choice on the director's part _ but the
film feels as small-time as Vic.
</P>
<P>
   Vic is an amiable loser, and Walken plays the role without the
spasms of rage that usually compound the freakishness of his
delivery. (His bellowed line ``You're late!'' in ``The Dogs of
War,'' the fury rising to a leonine whine on the last word, is a
real puzzler.)
</P>
<P>
   Vic is drawn and slightly defeated; Walken's lost, trembling
cadence makes him seem beaten down by his past life of petty crime.
He is still in pain over a robbery he committed 20 years ago, one
that cost him his marriage and almost his relationship with his
daughter (Vera Farmiga).
</P>
<P>
   His failing garage keeps him broke, and he won't take a loan
from Sally. Then a distant cousin, Michael (Peter McDonald),
arrives from Ireland and persuades Vic to mastermind another crime.
``The regular-citizen thing is not going too good,'' Vic says with
Walken's punctuated diction.
</P>
<P>
   Walken's twitchy, chilled acting style may be the wrong choice
for a vaguely sympathetic leading man, though he is vague. No one
else gives the kind of line readings he does, which are as hypnotic
in their own way as staring at a double strike on a coin; he
suggests a stoned Kirk Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   Connell uses his cast well, and the actors go at the material
briskly. Donal Logue and Jose Zuniga, as the security guards who
connive with Michael and Vic, are incredibly eager; they watch Vic
practice his safecracking as if it were the second overtime of a
Knicks playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   All of the younger characters have an antsiness. Michael's pushy
curiosity leads to his almost botching things several times. ``I'm
starting to think there's something wrong with you,'' Vic says of
Michael's idiotic interference. ( McDonald's downcast face gives
him a minor resemblance to Walken.)
</P>
<P>
   The movie is full of characters, notably Mort (Tom Noonan), who
gets Vic the equipment he needs to prepare for the robbery. Mort is
a third-rate version of the expediters who turn up too often in
film noir, and Noonan plays his crabby meticulousness for comedy.
Noonan practices his craft beautifully, and Mort gives him a chance
to return to the comedic work with which he began his career on the
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Connell does well by his actresses, too. Lauper is so good that
her few screen appearances make you want more, and her feistiness
makes an impression against Walken's mannered weightiness.
Farmiga's grounded Miriam is memorable, too. Pieces of ``The
Opportunists'' play quite well, enough to make you want to keep an
eye on Connell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Opportunists'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity and mild
violence. &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Conditions will gradually deteriorate over the Northeast and the
Middle Atlantic states as a jet stream disturbance plunges south
from eastern Canada. A broken area of thunderstorms will move south
during the day from the northern parts of New York and New England.
The day will begin with ample sunshine near the Northeast coast,
but clouds and scattered thunderstorms will then move in. Unsettled
weather will linger in much of the Northeast through the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   While moisture from a tropical depression will stay east of the
Carolinas and Georgia, an approaching cold front will cause potent
thunderstorms near the coast. Most of the interior Gulf Coast
states be hot with ample sun.
</P>
<P>
   Heat will persist in much of the Plains and interior West. A few
strong thunderstorms will precede a front in the northern Rockies.
Numerous showers will bring cooling rain to parts of the southern
Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: CELESTIAL SHOW
</P>
<P>
   The Perseid meteor shower will reach its peak Friday night.
Despite their misleading name, meteorologists have no special
expertise concerning the meteors that illuminate the night sky.
Astronomers are the scientists who can lay claim to detailed
knowledge of meteor showers. In ancient times, though, when science
was in its infancy, meteorology and astronomy were more closely
allied. Indeed, the word ``meteorology'' comes from the Greek
meaning ``the study of things in the sky.''

&HT;     HEALTH OFFICIAL ACCUSES AIDS DISSIDENTS OF ASSAULT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For the first time, a city official is pressing
battery charges against members of an AIDS dissident group that for
years has screamed obscenities and disrupted public meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Health Director Mitchell H. Katz said the tactics of ACT UP/San
Francisco were taking an emotional toll on his staff and hurting
efforts to stop the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus, or
HIV.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest Wednesday of ACT UP members David Pasquarelli and
Jason Swindle came after they threw paper wads and sprayed Silly
String on Katz as he spoke before a Board of Supervisors committee
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The pair, along with two other ACT UP members, already face
similar charges after they stormed a meeting of the AIDS education
group Project Inform in April, threw pills and allegedly pushed a
staff member to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   They show up frequently at public meetings to heckle officials
and create attention-grabbing disturbances, but this is the first
time a public official has brought criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitting the health director at a hearing on the back of the
head is not part of free speech,'' said Katz, who was not hurt in
Wednesday's incident.
</P>
<P>
   Katz was delivering figures showing that new HIV infections are
up sharply among gay men in San Francisco. ACT UP claims HIV is not
the cause of AIDS and accuses officials of twisting statistics to
scare people and secure more funding.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS, the acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is an affliction
in which HIV weakens the immune system, subjecting the body to
serious infection. AIDS is most often spread through sexual
contact, sharing contaminated needles and infected blood products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality here is that the real criminal here is Mitch
Katz,'' ACT UP member Michael Bellefountaine said after the
hearing. ``This is typical political street theater antics, and
they don't warrant assault and battery charges.''
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) was founded in New
York in 1987 to agitate for greater access to treatment, cheaper
drugs and more funding for AIDS education. The San Francisco
chapter became divided after dissidents took control, and many
members left to form ACT UP/Golden Gate. That group is now called
Survive AIDS and is careful to distinguish itself from the tactics
and views of ACT UP/San Francisco.

RUSSIA ACCUSES MINE-CLEARING ORGANIZATION OF HELPING CHECHEN
REBELS 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With Russian casualties mounting from land mine attacks
in Chechnya, the Federal Security Service Thursday accused a
British-based mine-clearing organization of providing military
training and assistance to rebel forces still engaged in partisan
attacks and ambushes on Russian security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Willoughby, the president of the organization, Halo Trust,
which is funded in part by the United States and the trust of the
late Princess Diana, acknowledged Thursday night that some of the
100 or more Chechens his organization trained between 1997 and 1999
might have ``joined the fighters,'' and transferred their skills to
rebel formations laying mines and ambushes for Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
   But Willoughby denied that his organization of former military
officers who have risked their lives to clear mines and to train
others to do the same in places like Angola, Kosovo and Cambodia
strayed beyond its humanitarian mandate to locate and clear more
than 270 minefields in Chechnya. The mines were left over from the
1994-96 war. These mines and cluster bombs, he said, many of them
dropped from Russian helicopters on schools and other civilian
targets, represented a serious risk to kill and maim Chechen
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were doing what we do in every other country,'' Willoughby
said in a telephone interview from Scotland. ``If people want to
state that mine clearers around the world are potential terrorists,
they'll have a hell of a job convincing anyone of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization's $20 million budget receives about $3 million
in support from the State Department, he said. The memorial fund of
the late Princess of Wales, who took a special interest in the
issue, contributed more than $375,000 to the group last year,
according to published reports.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued Thursday by the Russian intelligence service
said it had ``reliable information on training of specialists in
mines and explosions for the armed formations of international
terrorists fighting on the territory of the Russian republic. One
of the structures covertly carrying out such activities,'' it said,
was Halo Trust, a nongovernmental organization based in London.
</P>
<P>
   The statement from the intelligence agency also alleged that
Halo Trust officials collected intelligence on Russian tactics,
weapons and munitions being used in the war zone and passed this
information back to their headquarters. It said the group also
``carried out full-scale topographic surveillance of all the
territory of the Chechen Republic fixing the Chechen villages to
the NATO system of coordinates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Halo Trust smuggled special equipment, communication
facilities and combat equipment for the illegal militants,'' the
statement said, adding that one commander of the Halo Trust
contingent, Matthew Middlemis, was a ``career military intelligence
officer.''
</P>
<P>
   Willoughby characterized these allegations as ``completely
absurd'' and ``rubbish.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Halo Trust entered Chechnya openly in 1997, after the
first Chechen war had ended and before the current conflict had
begun. Halo Trust teams mapped 276 mine fields in the devastated
republic and then shared its report with the Russian military
mission based at the Grozny airport in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   To map the mine fields, Willoughby said, the Halo Trust teams
conducted topographical surveys using equipment that measured
standard latitude and longitude measurements. During this period,
he said the organization worked under the sponsorship of the
legitimately elected Chechen administration of President Aslan
Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
   Halo Trust ceased its mine-clearing operations in Chechnya last
fall after four of its Chechen mine clearers were killed in a
Russian rocket-artillery barrage on the town of Stari Achkhoi,
where Halo Trust was engaged in clearing mines that had been
dropped on the Stari Achkhoi primary school by Russian forces in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when we stopped de-mining and the de-miners all went
home and we switched our work to humanitarian medical programs,''
Willoughby said. ``I can't say that one of them did not join the
fighters, they may have, but as far as we were concerned, they were
civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no explanation for the timing of Thursday's
allegations, many months after Halo Trust abandoned its
mine-clearing operation in Chechnya.However, the Federal Security
Service made one of its spokesmen available for interviews on
Russia's state television news channels Thursday night, which gave
prominent display to the charges. One television report aired video
captured from Chechen rebels showing a man identified as a Halo
Trust trainer examining a Russian bomb in a field.
</P>
<P>
   Since late spring, the Chechen rebels have adopted new tactics
relying more extensively on mine warfare, Russian military
commanders have warned. This summer, military dispatches from
Chechnya have reported almost daily incidents of Russian armored
personnel carriers and other troop transports and vehicles striking
mines. As many as 14 Russian servicemen were injured in mine blasts
on Aug. 1 and Aug. 2 and 18 mines were defused by federal troops.

 &HT;    CLINTON MUST EMBRACE GORE AT CONVENTION _ BUT NOT TOO CLOSELY
 &HT;    730&AMP;add. For release Sunday, Aug. 13.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two years after enmeshing his fellow Democrats in a
scandal that shook the nation, President Clinton is poised to
deliver a triumphant valedictory address Monday night to a party
reborn.
</P>
<P>
   When he addresses the Democratic National Convention in Los
Angeles, however, Clinton must do more than burnish an imperfect
legacy by touting his role presiding over eight years of peace and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   He must somehow make Americans believe it couldn't have happened
without Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to tell them that the last eight years have been the
greatest achievement since sliced bread, and that Al Gore was an
integral part of that success,'' said political scientist Gary
Segura of Claremont Graduate University, Claremont, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president gives a speech only about himself,'' said
Segura, ``then he does Gore no good.''
</P>
<P>
   For months now, at political fund-raisers, campaign speeches and
press conferences, Clinton has labored to give Gore his due,
portraying the vice president as a man of integrity and a full
partner in the policies behind the administration's successes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has made an absolutely incalculable contribution to
whatever good we've accomplished in the White House,'' Clinton said
at a Democratic fund-raiser in Washington in June. ``I think he
should be elected because I agree with his economic plan. ... He'll
do more to help everybody participate in our society, and I think
he
</P>
<P>
   understands the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond lip service, helping Gore has always been a complicated
trick for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The closer Gore stands to the charismatic Clinton, for one
thing, the more vice-presidential he looks.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason Gore won't be seen at all with Clinton in Los
Angeles. The two will meet instead at a rally Tuesday in Michigan,
where Clinton is expected to charge his No. 2 with the mission of
keeping the keys to the White House in Democratic hands.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, though, has no plans to step into the shadows. He has
set aside the entire month of September for high-profile battles
with the Republican-led Congress over next year's budget, as well
as banner Democratic issues such as the quest for a so-called
patient's bill of rights, a minimum wage hike and increased gun
controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to have a very healthy debate in the month of
September, where the president tries to get these things
accomplished,'' said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart, signaling
that Clinton is nowhere near ready to cede the spotlight of
presidential power.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard also for Gore to cozy up to Clinton's coattails
without smudging his own attire.
</P>
<P>
   It was two years ago this week that Clinton went before the
nation to confess that he had an ``inappropriate'' relationship
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, after publicly
denying it for eight tumultuous months.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton survived a bid to remove him from office. But
Republicans want Gore to pay the price for standing by his boss and
calling Clinton ``a man I believe will be regarded in the history
books as one of our greatest presidents'' on the night the House
voted impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our generation has a chance to reclaim some essential values,
to show we have grown up before we grow old,'' presidential nominee
George W. Bush told the GOP convention. ``But when the moment for
leadership came, this administration did not teach our children, it
disillusioned them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gus Cochran, political science professor at Agnes Scott College
in Atlanta, said, ``The Republicans just loathe Bill Clinton
personally, and they see him as just the embodiment of everything
they think has gone wrong with America.''
</P>
<P>
   Some pundits have suggested that Clinton owes it to Gore to make
clear in his speech that his personal conduct had nothing to do
with his vice president.
</P>
<P>
   But there's nothing in Clinton's past to suggest that he would
turn a celebration of the life and times of the man from Hope into
yet another public confessional, and Lockhart dismissed such
speculation as ``hot air.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is his valedictory speech, his swan song,'' said
government professor Phil Klinkner of Hamilton College in Clinton,
N.Y. ``For him to bring up something that is clearly the low point
of his political career, the low point of his personal life, it's
probably not something he would want to dwell on.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   What Clinton has been stressing in recent speeches is his role
in turning the country around and the importance of avoiding a
U-turn toward the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1992, the country was in trouble,'' Clinton told supporters
at a fund-raising dinner for the U.S. Senate campaign of First Lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton in McLean, Va., last Wednesday night. ``I
mean, our backs were against the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gets much public credit for the longest and largest
economic expansion in the country's history, even though it began
in March 1991, nearly two years before he took office.
</P>
<P>
   On his watch, though, the economy has generated 22 million new
jobs. Over the past year alone the economy has grown a blistering 6
percent, after adjusting for moderate inflation of just above 2
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gets some credit, as well, for the dramatic turnaround
in the federal budget, which was $290 billion in the red in 1992
and is on track to be $211 billion in the black this year. Surely
Clinton will make the case Monday that he has led the charge on
policies that have helped take the budget from record deficit to a
record surplus.
</P>
<P>
   He's sure to attack GOP tax cut proposals _ which the White
House projects would amount to nearly $2 trillion over the coming
decade _ saying the changes would risk throwing the nation back
into a cycle of deficits. Under ``the Gore plan,'' Clinton will
likely point out, the country could pay off its $3.2 trillion worth
of publicly held debt by the year 2012.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton isn't likely to leave Los Angeles, though, without
employing his considerable rhetorical gifts to cast his own legacy
in the most favorable light possible. Nor is he likely to resist
taking a jab at those who scoffed at his prospects eight years ago,
when as the governor of Arkansas he appeared at the Democratic
National Convention to embark on his own campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other side kind of referred to me as a governor of a small
Southern state, and I was so naive I thought it was a compliment,''
Clinton told the NAACP last month. ``You know what,'' he asked, ``I
still do.''

TOYOTA TELLS BRITISH COMPONENTS MAKERS TO DO BUSINESS IN EUROS, NOT
POUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Toyota Motor Corp. said Thursday that it had instructed
British components suppliers to do business in euros instead of
pounds. The move reflected the distress among automakers and other
manufacturers here over the pound's high value relative to the
euro, which has made British exports to Europe expensive.
</P>
<P>
   This year, BMW of Germany pulled out of a six-year investment in
Rover Group of Britain, complaining that the pound's high value
against the euro had helped kill profits. Ford Motor Co. also cited
the pound's strength against the euro in a decision to close a
major assembly plant. Nissan Motor Co. of Japan has threatened to
transfer production of a new subcompact from its plant in
northeastern England. And the Japanese electronics giant Matsushita
Electric Works has also warned it may close plants in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Thursday's move by Toyota passed on the
uncertainties and costs of currency fluctuations to the many
components makers who supply 80 percent of the parts for the
180,000 cars that Toyota produces in Britain from two plants.
Toyota's British subsidiary, Toyota Motor Manufacturing UK, exports
about 70 percent of its cars to the zone of 11 nations in Europe
that adopted the euro currency last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will have a huge impact on the motor components sector,
who will have to bear the brunt of currency fluctuations,'' said
Sir Ken Jackson, an auto labor leader who would like Britain to
adopt the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Toyota's decision, said Edward Roberts, chief
executive of the component maker Peterson Springs in the British
Midlands, would leave British manufacturers with payments in euros
while all their costs were in pounds. ``If we get paid in euros,
what do we do with them? Our employees don't want to be paid in
them, and our small suppliers don't want them either.''
</P>
<P>
   Many foreign companies have invested in Britain as a springboard
for exports to the Continent, seeking advantage from Britain's
relatively low costs and more flexible labor laws. But, since the
euro was introduced in January 1999, the single currency has fallen
25 percent against the yen and 16 percent against the pound.
</P>
<P>
   Some British-based car producers, particularly in the luxury
market, seem untroubled by the slide in the euro. Ford announced
Thursday that it would build a new factory in Britain to expand its
high-end Aston Martin sports cars division. The factory, with new
400 jobs, would produce a relatively low-priced Aston Martin _
retailing at between $90,000 and $135,000.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota said through a spokesman that not all suppliers had been
told to do business in euros and said existing contracts in pounds
would continue to be honored.
</P>
<P>
   The move added to the pressure on Prime Minister Tony Blair's
government to adopt a less ambiguous policy about joining the
single currency. While Britain says it sees economic benefit in the
single currency, it insists that it will not join without holding a
referendum and assessing the euro's performance against its own
economic yardstick. There was no indication Thursday that Toyota's
move had shifted British policy.
</P>
<P>
   But it rekindled Britain's debate about the euro and its
fluctuations, with some arguing that it is the euro's weakness _
not the pound's strength _ that is the problem.

PLACE YOUR BET: A VEGAS CASINO OR A VIRTUAL ONE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, August 13)  
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Nervous casino executives are lobbying to make
Internet gambling an illegal activity, concerned their business
will falter if people can stay at home and play on their personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
   But regular casino-goers here say the executives have nothing to
worry about. They contend that the Internet and Las Vegas are such
vastly different worlds that it is kind of like comparing apples
and oranges in a slot machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never gamble on the Internet,'' said Reggie, who said
he was a vice president of a major corporation and therefore
refused to identify himself further. ``There's no way to believe
you're getting accurate odds,'' he added with a scoff.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Reggie and his girlfriend, Jackie, who works in
marketing and public relations and who also declined to give her
full name, said they felt good about their chances playing the
Wheel of Fortune slot machine at the Mirage Hotel. It's not that
they were winning money _ just the opposite _ but three times the
slot machine came up one roll short of delivering a row of three
sevens. Those near misses demonstrated to the couple, who are from
Lexington, Ky., that a jackpot might be just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that would have turned one more time,'' he said to Jackie,
inserting his third $20, ``it would have been big money. Big
money!''
</P>
<P>
   Not only do casino patrons seem to trust the gambling odds in
Las Vegas more than they do those of the 700 or so Internet
casinos, but they also note that there is more to this colorful
city than just losing money. It's an experience that can't be
replicated on a PC monitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to sit at home in the dark just hitting my mouse
button over and over,'' said Ken Harrison, 30, from San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   He'd rather not be at home, lost in his own dark world, pouring
electronic money into a dreary electronic box connected to a
central server and with a video monitor displaying animated images.
</P>
<P>
   This is a subject that Harrison knows something about, since at
that moment (noon, roughly _ though hard to tell, as casinos are
kind enough to omit potential distractions like clocks and windows)
he was sitting in the dark at the Treasure Island casino, pouring
real money into a one of the new computerized slot machines that
are connected to servers, and watching animated images of fruit,
police officers and bags of money whirl by.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison acknowledged that this experience wasn't entirely
unlike sitting at home in the dark playing on a computer. ``Good
point,'' he said, putting another nickel into the machine called 3
Reel Hold Up. ``People around here do look pretty zoned out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanging out here, Harrison added, was still a far more social
experience than playing at home. ``Gambling at home by yourself is
like drinking alone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the Mirage, Reggie agreed. ``The Internet is so
impersonal,'' he said, standing next to a man playing video poker
alone and downing free gin gimlets.
</P>
<P>
   The bread-and-butter patrons of Las Vegas say that there is
another important way in which this place differs from online
casinos: It's not in the Caribbean. In fact, they often speak ill
of the Caribbean, where most online casinos are based. They are
skeptical of trusting off-shore virtual casinos to process credit
cards and return winnings.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some places here pretend to be in the Caribbean.
Consider the Lagoon Saloon, a Mirage lounge that brochures call an
``island paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is full of disreputable characters,'' said Phil,
who also would not give his last name but said he was an air
traffic controller from Albuquerque, N.M. He was playing the Who
Dunnit slot machine at the Mirage.
</P>
<P>
   At least in Vegas, you have some idea of who the bad actors are,
like Bugsy Siegel, the gangster who was one of Las Vegas' founding
fathers, and whoever invented sequins. ``Vegas has a history; you
know what you're getting,'' Phil said. Which is? ``I always come
hoping to win, but I never do,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The fact that he and other casino patrons trust how things will
turn out in Las Vegas isn't its only draw _ nor the only reason
that casino executives should feel confident about their prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Their casinos offer an unparalleled opportunity to sit in the
dark in front of a monitor wearing whatever suits one's fancy,
compulsively hitting buttons and pulling levers, smoking and
drinking as if cigarette rationing and Prohibition were about to
return.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, casino patrons say, it is absolutely nothing like
gambling over the Internet. &QL;

`AIMEE AND JAGUAR': IN LOVE IN WARTIME BERLIN, AND DEFYING
UNDERSTANDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Production notes at end of review)  
 By DAVE KEHR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Opposites attract, according to conventional wisdom and movie
mythology, though platitudes are inadequate to explain why Felice
Schragenheim (Maria Schrader), a Jew living undercover in Nazi
Berlin, would fall in love with Lilly Wust (Juliane Koehler), an
Aryan poster girl married to a German officer and the mother of
four strapping blond boys.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, she did. ``Aimee and Jaguar'' _ the title comes from
the nicknames the lovers give each other _ is based on a true story
as recounted in a 1994 book by Erica Fischer. Although Schragenheim
is believed to have died in a forced march from a Nazi camp, Wust
is 86 and still lives in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   The fascination of such a story is understandable _ how powerful
their feelings for each other must have been to overcome the gulf
that separated deadly enemies at the height of wartime, much less
to overcome class differences ( Schragenheim was a bohemian writer,
Wust a happy hausfrau) and the powerful prejudices against same-sex
unions then in force. Surely there is something heroic about love
on so grand and risky a scale.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, there is surprisingly little emotional amplitude in the
film that the German television director Max Faerberboeck has
fashioned from Fischer's book. Neither of the principal characters
acquires the depth to support feelings any more profound than a
schoolgirl crush, and Faerberboeck's reconstruction of Berlin under
the Allied bombing campaign never moves beyond a back-lot
artificiality.
</P>
<P>
   Much of ``Aimee and Jaguar'' relies on the dramatic and visual
conventions of another era _ that of the Weimar Republic, as
represented in films like G.W. Pabst's ``Pandora's Box'' (whose
star, Louise Brooks, bears a passing resemblance to Schrader's
Felice) and Josef von Sternberg's ``Blue Angel'' (with Koehler's
Lilly echoing Marlene Dietrich's blond wave and dangling
cigarette). Once again, Faerberboeck (who with Rona Munro also
wrote the screenplay) trots out the cinematic vocabulary of
decadence: women wearing tuxedos, smoky nightclubs filled with
couples of ambiguous gender, pudgy capitalists pulling on cigars
(though the last have become German officers), a general excess of
eye makeup.
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame that Faerberboeck has chosen to remain so
resolutely on the surface of his material, since there is a great
deal going on between the characters that a little digging might
have brought out. The film subscribes to the familiar and
convenient notion that love conquers all, yet what we see of
Felice's long courtship of Lilly suggests that love was the last
thing on her mind. Seduction, and particularly, the seduction of a
figure so closely tied to Nazi ideology (the fertile earth mother
and home-front warrior), was what mattered most to Felice, at least
initially. Here is a notion of sex as revenge, if not outright
warfare, that the film might have profitably explored.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, ``Aimee and Jaguar'' quickly turns pastoral and
romantic (no mean feat for a film set in wartime Berlin, but there
always seem to be limpid ponds and verdant dales within commuting
distance). There is much gamboling amid the glories of nature,
images of a squeaky-clean outdoor sexuality that recall the work of
the photographer Bruce Weber.
</P>
<P>
   It's upon their return from one such frolic, to the flat they
have been sharing in the city, that the women discover the Gestapo
waiting for them. Faerberboeck, to his credit, does not exploit the
usual Holocaust imagery. There is no scene set in the camp to which
Felice has been sent; instead, in the film's one genuinely
cinematic moment, Lilly recounts her disastrous attempt to visit
Felice during a conversation in a cafe, leaving the viewer to
visualize the horror of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader and Koehler shared the prize for best actress at the
1999 Berlin International Film Festival, and their work is indeed
highly professional. Schrader, in particular, brings just enough of
a hint of hysteria to her performance to redeem Felice from the
plaster saintliness that Faerberboeck has thrust upon her.

 &HT;    Botanical Garden receives needed room for research with donation
in Gainesville, Ga.
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Ga. _ Imagine a garden where pretty flowers aren't
the priority but rapidly disappearing plants native to the
Southeast are.
</P>
<P>
   A place where seeds collected from around the world are sown to
determine how well plants might grow here. A tract large enough to
develop collections of trees that can be studied and admired. And
more important, a setting that nature lovers can relish without
fear of developers robbing them of yet another spot.
</P>
<P>
   For the Atlanta Botanical Garden, the fantasy's over. Charles
and Lessie Smithgall have seen to that by donating to the Midtown
garden 168 acres in Gainesville, where it plans to develop the
Smithgall Arboretum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a beautiful piece of property, and as we begin to live
in more and more crowded conditions, one that will become even more
valuable,'' said Alston Glenn, the garden's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   The gift, announced last month, is especially attractive because
the garden is landlocked between Piedmont Road and Piedmont Park
and needs space for expanding its programs. The Smithgall property,
along with an unrelated land gift three years ago in Cherokee
County, in effect will create two satellite gardens, each with its
own focus, when they open several years from now.
</P>
<P>
   The arboretum will operate under a $5million endowment
($3million from the Smithgalls and $2million from the garden) as a
research facility and public nature center convenient for both
suburbanites and north Georgians. ``It's an incredible asset and to
me, more valuable than a state park,'' said Gene Anderson, an
extension agent in Hall County.
</P>
<P>
   Media mogul Charles Smithgall and his wife, Lessie, began
assembling the property in 1949 and made their home there six years
later. Now 89, the two decided years ago the site would never be
commercially developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt the garden would be good caretakers, and we wanted to
do this while we had our wits about us,'' Lessie Smithgall said.
</P>
<P>
   The family has retained 17 acres surrounding its home, but a
master plan will be developed for the rest of the property. Before
that, garden officials plan to assemble an advisory board of
representatives from both Gainesville and Atlanta. The Smithgalls'
three sons _ Charles and John, who live in Atlanta, and Thurmond,
of New York _ will be among them. ``I want people to know our
family will still be involved with how the property is used,''
their mother said.
</P>
<P>
   The site features rolling hills of hardwoods that slope to Cry
Creek and a cove on Lake Lanier. A 50-foot cliff is home to huge
mountain laurels.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the tract lies in the middle of Gainesville. ``We're
surrounded by housing, so we're lucky in that there will never be
buildings around us,'' said Mildred Pinnell, a botanical garden
horticulturist and Gainesville resident, who has been instrumental
in the project.
</P>
<P>
   The garden also is fortunate to have the necessary
infrastructure in place. Gravel roads navigate the site, where only
a few structures, such as greenhouses, offices and restrooms, will
be built.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I'm really excited about is the possibility of
developing some wonderful collections of trees , which we've never
had room to grow at the garden,'' Glenn said. ``To be able to show
people a complete collection, whether it's bonsai or oaks, is very
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   The arboretum also will be used to expand the garden's native
plant conservation program. There, endangered plants will be
propagated, including the Florida torryea, or stinking cedar. The
conifer, which grows only in southwest Georgia and the Florida
Panhandle, is the rarest tree species in North America. The trees
have been dying in large numbers since the late 1950s, victims of a
fungus.
</P>
<P>
   For the past decade, the garden staff has nurtured genetically
different types of torryea that are fungus free.
</P>
<P>
   Some are grown on another property once owned by the Smithgalls,
the Department of Natural Resources' Smithgall Woods-Dukes Creek
Conservation Area near Helen, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``From both an agricultural and horticultural standpoint, the
possibilities are just incredible,'' Anderson said. ``From Master
Gardeners and their projects to property tours, it will be just so
educational.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the garden plans to evaluate plants grown from seed
collected by staff on trips to Asia as well as plants that
commercial nurseries are considering selling. ``If they introduce
it, we'll be a great place to plant it out and have the public come
and see it growing,'' Pinnell said.
</P>
<P>
   And from a bigger picture, the property presents the garden with
a new opportunity to expand outside the city into other rapidly
growing areas. It's already planning a demonstration garden on its
100-acre site in north Cherokee County, a 1997 gift from landscape
designer James Gibbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This creates a wonderful, equilateral triangle with Atlanta at
one corner, Cherokee in the other and now Hall County at the third,
with each about 60 miles from one another,'' Glenn said. ``People
who don't want to drive down to Atlanta or simply would rather tour
a more natural setting will now have the option.''
</P>
<P>
   Satellite sites are used successfully by European gardens as a
means for reaching other populations while at the same time
spreading their resources.
</P>
<P>
   And environmentalists hope other land holders concerned about
metro Atlanta's rampant development will see the project as an
example for successfully protecting greenspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is going to become more of an issue with people
who have land,'' Pinnell said. ``What we do here could become a
role model.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S PLANNED
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Develop collections of trees and shrubs for display,
evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Expand conservation of native plants, including the stinking
cedar.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Evaluate plants grown from seeds collected in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Test new plants by commercial growers before they're marketed.

RENDEZVOUS AT THE GATEWAY TO FREEDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   Samuel G. Freedman, a professor of journalism at Columbia
University, is the author of several books including the recently
published ``Jew vs. Jew: The Struggle for the Soul of American
Jewry.''  
 By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the first ferry of the morning pulled away from
Liberty Island, I found myself nearly alone on deck. Gone were the
throngs with backpacks and videocameras that had boarded with me in
lower Manhattan's Battery, clutching tickets allowing them to
ascend into the statue's crown. Instead of an admission card, I was
holding photocopies of some postcards, written in Yiddish and dated
in the spring of 1912. I was bound for the next stop, Ellis Island,
and an appointment with an ancestor.
</P>
<P>
   He was my paternal grandfather, my namesake, the link in my
lineage between Old World and New. He had died, this Samuel
Freedman, in 1941, 14 years before my birth. I knew little more
about him than the stirring outlines of his immigration. But I did
know he had passed through this island, one of the multitudes, some
88 years ago, not long after having sold his original steerage
ticket, on a vessel called the Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   The orphaned son of a cantor named Reichgold from a Polish
village outside Lodz, he had adopted the faith of anarchism while
still in his teens and been sentenced to death by the czarist
regime for his part in a strike. Liberated in a jailbreak, he
obtained a forged passport and found his way to England. He steamed
to New York under the surname on the passport, one true in its
falsity, because he was a freed man indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Where better to rendezvous with my forebear, then, than on the
harbor island where he first touched America. As I came off the
ferry, I literally followed the steps he would have taken into the
Beaux-Arts main building.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation
finished restoring the structure from its limestone base to its
hundred-foot copper-domed towers, transforming a neglected monument
into the Ellis Island Museum of Immigration. And as I approached,
past the manicured flower beds and gleaming windows and flawlessly
pointed brick walls, I wondered if it had not been made too perfect
a replica of its former self. How could a place that must have been
teeming and clamorous on the day one Samuel Freedman arrived be so
serene and tidy for another?
</P>
<P>
   Then, passing through the entry doors, I stood before an exhibit
of baggage. There were steamer trunks and woven baskets, carpet
bags in geometric designs and a metal box with the name Hughes
stenciled on its flank, piled one atop another into a kind of
palisade. The display served as a reminder that here, in the
ground-level hall, immigrants were separated from their belongings
until America had decided whether or not to admit them. But for me,
gazing on the oldness, the wornness, the scuffed and torn surfaces
of those bags felt like a collision with the past itself.
</P>
<P>
   A stairway led me up to the Registry Room, where immigrants were
processed. It is a grand chamber, yes, with its vaulted Guastavino
ceiling and its arched windows, giving out to Miss Liberty on one
side and lower Manhattan's bristling skyscrapers on the other. And
yet it seemed to me as striking for its smallness, just 160 feet of
herringbone tile from end to end. Here in a space not much larger
than a high school gym there passed as many as 5,000 newcomers a
day, 12 million over Ellis Island's active lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   The room lay empty now except for six rows of waiting benches
and five varnished oak tables for the inspectors. I was drawn not
to the majesty of the place or to the precision of its restoration
but rather to the imperfections _ the patch of wall where
immigrants scratched drawings of seabirds and ships into the
cracked plaster, the abraded paint and splintered wood on the
benches.
</P>
<P>
   There I could imagine my grandfather, fretful and fidgeting like
the rest. Perhaps he worried he would be deported as a red, as his
hero Emma Goldman would be in 1917. Perhaps he feared one of those
inspectors would find some medical ground for exclusion, chalking
his coat with the insignia for lameness or trachoma or
tuberculosis. I know he felt the pressure to find work right away
and earn passage for his wife, Rose, because in those postcards
that I carried he is accounting for every few dollars he sends her,
promising a ticket by July, pleading with her to ``be cheerful, be
calm.''
</P>
<P>
   All these anxieties, the restored Ellis Island made clear, were
widely shared, a contagion among the newly arrived. From the
Registry Room, I moved through a series of smaller exhibit rooms,
each devoted to aspects of processing like medical inspection,
detention, denials, reunions.
</P>
<P>
   Each room included taped recollections of immigrants made in the
1980s, decades after they had arrived, and in creaky voices, still
accented with Naples or Galicia or Liverpool, they recounted the
stench of steerage, the terror that a wart might render them unfit,
the first tantalizing glimpse of American shore. One man likened
Ellis Island to purgatory. Another declared, ``In contrast to what
I'd been through, Ellis Island was not a haven but a heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Berkoff and Dunn, Shlueter and Taldone, Becker and Lenhart _ I
tried listening to every one, hoping that I would hear the kind of
stories my grandfather took early to the grave. But as I struggled
to possess each detail, to distinguish each testimony from the
next, my senses grew saturated, overwhelmed. There was too much to
know, too much to absorb, too much to feel. When I took a headset
from my ear for the last time, I was gasping for air as though I'd
just broken the water's surface after a perilously deep dive.
</P>
<P>
   Around me, though, I spotted all the latter-day Berkoffs and
Dunns. By now, several more ferries had reached Ellis Island, and
the museum was filling with immigrants from the last generation,
those who met America in the International Arrivals building at
JFK. A Filipino teen-ager translated an exhibit for her mother. An
Indian clicked a snapshot of the plaque describing the registry
room. A woman in a chador toted a bag of T-shirts from the gift
shop. Immigration present was sealing a compact with immigration
past.
</P>
<P>
   My own business, though, was with history, and so I proceeded to
the opposite side of the second floor, where the museum focuses on
the peak years of immigration, 1880 through 1924. There were walls
covered with passports, walls covered with foreign currency, walls
covered with railroad timetables for immigrants traveling on to
Cleveland or Duluth. And there were walls of photographs depicting
the travails that drove people from Europe and the struggles they
undertook in America in which I discovered my grandfather in spirit
if not form.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One portrait showed a dozen Jewish revolutionaries mourning a
comrade slain in the Kishinev pogrom of 1903; another captured the
anarchist leader Alexander Berkman addressing a rally of the
Wobblies. Farther along, I saw a cartoon made in 1910 for the
Cloakmakers' Union, depicting a group of workers lofting their arms
into one single massive fist. ``In unity,'' read a translation of
the Yiddish caption, ``there will be power.''
</P>
<P>
   My grandfather gave his life to the pursuit of such ideals. He
managed the newspaper Freie Arbeiter Shtimme (Free Voice of Labor);
he served as secretary for his local in the Waterproof Garment
Workers Union; he reared his four children in an anarchist colony
in rural New Jersey. He lived long enough, I suspect, to realize
America was not ripe for a revolution, and by that measure, maybe
he died a failed man. How I wish that he could have seen his vision
of America, however unfulfilled, hallowed by its display here on
Ellis Island.
</P>
<P>
   The very existence of this museum is a triumph for unruly,
polyglot, mongrel America, as two particular exhibits vividly
demonstrated. One collected the anti-immigrant propaganda that
helped lead to the enactment of brutal quotas in 1924; an editorial
cartoon, emblematic in its tone, portrayed Uncle Sam clinging to a
rocky shoreline against a tide labeled ``Riff-Raff Immigration.''
</P>
<P>
   More devastating in its way, though, was a gallery of
photographs of Ellis Island in its abandoned state. Thirty years
after immigration quotas were enacted, the island closed. Even
after President Lyndon B. Johnson declared it a national monument
in 1965, the same year he signed legislation undoing the draconian
1924 law, Congress couldn't be bothered to authorize money for its
repair. The photographs bore witness to the result _ shattered
windows, floors littered with paint flakes, doors overgrown by ivy,
a crumpled flag on a deserted desk.
</P>
<P>
   The rehabilitation of the main building, begun in 1982, had to
be undertaken not only without public funds but also without
massive corporate support of the sort the Statue of Liberty
enjoyed. Lee Iacocca, the automobile executive who headed the
private restoration effort, devised the idea of raising money
directly from citizens. Anyone who donated $100 or more could have
the name of a relative who passed through Ellis Island engraved on
a commemorative wall outside the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Iacocca realized it or not, his brainstorm had profound
provenance. When the Statue of Liberty was first being erected in
the 1880s, it, too, failed to loosen the pockets of the plutocrats.
With $100,000 still needed for the pedestal, Joseph Pulitzer, the
Hungarian immigrant turned newspaper publisher, appealed to his
readers, ``As the rich citizens of New York have shown such apathy
in this matter, let the poor citizens move.'' One young woman, like
my grandfather an orphan, accompanied her 60-cent donation with the
note, ``Drops make the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   Four hours after entering the immigration museum, I stepped
outside to view the wall. A woman in a sundress was taking a photo
of the panel etched with ``Franchi.'' A man rolled his wheelchair
to a stop before ``Bosak.'' A girl of perhaps 10, all bony limbs
and ponytail, watched as her mother indicated a ``Valenti,'' and
explained, ``My mother's mother.'' I overheard another parent
telling another child, ``That's great-granddad, who came from
Moravia.''
</P>
<P>
   I could savor these moments of recognition only vicariously. As
far as I was aware, nobody in my family had donated money in the
name of Samuel Freedman. The failure weighed most heavily on me,
his namesake, me with the same wavy black hair and distant,
preoccupied eyes I can see in his photograph in the Report of the
Waterproof Garment Workers Union, Local 20, printed in both English
and Yiddish, dated May 1, 1922.
</P>
<P>
   Out of curiosity, I edged to the stone panel containing the
Freedmans. I wondered who else I might find. But there, halfway
down a column, lay the letters, Samuel Freedman, not once but
twice. And directly above them, also twice, was the name of his
wife, my grandmother, Rose Freedman, who died when I was 2. I think
I remember sitting on her lap in her old house in what was left of
the anarchist colony. But maybe I've just recalled a photograph and
out of sheer longing transformed it into an experience.
</P>
<P>
   The ferry back to the Battery was already loading. My
appointment was complete, more complete than I'd dared to hope. My
father, it turns out, had given money in his parents' names. So,
evidently, had my uncle or aunt. On the way back to shore, the way
my grandfather went to his first American home as a boarder with a
family named Vulcan at 37 First Ave., I unfolded the translations a
Yiddish scholar had made of his postcards for me a dozen years ago.
For a man dangerous enough for a death sentence in Europe, Samuel
Freedman sounded in those cards almost shockingly romantic, both
about his young wife and his new land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rosela, be cheerful and happy,'' he wrote on May 21, 1912.
``You'll soon come to New York and to me, to your one and only dear
beloved. I know that it's your dearest dream and wish now. And your
most beautiful dream will become a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back across the choppy harbor to Ellis Island, that holy
place, I knew he had kept his word.

ANGRY PILOTS: WHY EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP DIDN'T HELP UAL
</HEADLINE>
  By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At least two lessons can be learned from the current United
Airlines fiasco, in which the airline's profits are plunging as it
cancels flights and apologizes profusely to customers.
</P>
<P>
   First, if you want to buy somebody's cooperation, pay with cash,
not with stock that may seem quite unreal to recipients who lack
the right to sell it when they want. The pilots own 25 percent of
UAL, United's parent company, through an employee stock-ownership
plan, or ESOP. But they do not seem especially concerned that their
disinclination to fly overtime is hurting the share price.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the old-fashioned way of having shareholders elect
corporate directors may be better than the Rube Goldberg-like plan
that assures that the UAL board will be made up of factions that
cannot be replaced no matter how badly things are going for the
company.
</P>
<P>
   All this stems from a 1994 recapitalization that left most of
the company's stock in ESOPs for the benefit of employees, who took
pay cuts. Of the 12 members on the UAL board, five are chosen by
public shareholders, two by unions and one by nonunionized
employees. Four are independent directors who choose their own
successors.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't worked. To be sure, profits are up, and so is the
share price. But those factors reflect the economy. UAL's share
price has lagged behind that of its rivals since the recap. As for
forecasts of a new era in cooperation between management and
workers, ask a passenger marooned in O'Hare Airport by canceled
flights.
</P>
<P>
   Just who is to blame for the sad state of affairs is debatable.
United blames the pilots for not volunteering for overtime; the
pilots blame United for scheduling too many flights without hiring
enough pilots.
</P>
<P>
   This was predictable. There was no way that an ESOP could change
basic attitudes. Until this year, the pilots got nothing tangible
from the plan because they cannot withdraw their shares before
retirement. Now the average pilot receives about $1,400 a quarter
in dividends, a pittance compared with the raise the pilots' union
is seeking.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots have other concerns. They worry that routes they
could fly are being assigned instead to United's commuter-airline
affiliates. They fear the pending takeover of US Airways will lead
to US Airways pilots getting plum jobs that United pilots would
otherwise receive.
</P>
<P>
   None of that is very different from recent disputes at other
major airlines. The UAL stock-ownership plan and convoluted
corporate structure have not fundamentally altered the industry's
often troubled labor relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of the people who believed it would make a
difference and that life would be better than it has been,'' Herb
Hunter, a United pilot and spokesman for the pilots' union, said
Thursday. ``But it doesn't seem to have made a great deal of
difference in the way the company was run.''
</P>
<P>
   This dispute will be settled, as were earlier bitter arguments
at Northwest and American Airlines. Wall Street may be right to
fear that labor and antitrust issues will doom UAL's takeover of US
Airways, whose shares now sell for 38 percent less than UAL's offer
of $60 _ but UAL's profits will be good until the economy weakens.
Its stock, down 36 percent this year, is likely to bounce back.
</P>
<P>
   Getting workers to think their success is intertwined with that
of the company is a worthy goal. But at UAL, some workers are angry
despite being in the ESOP, and newer workers are jealous because
they don't get stock. The ESOP panacea has not made UAL skies any
friendlier.

 &HT;    Chickens first line of defense against West Nile virusBy M.A.J.
McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HENDERSONVILLE, N.C. _ The best defense against West Nile virus,
the Third World pathogen that has unexpectedly invaded the East
Coast, sits in a swampy corner of a county park in the heart of
North Carolina's apple country.
</P>
<P>
   And clucks.
</P>
<P>
   Five white chickens brood in an improvised battery cage perched
4 feet off the ground to protect them against predators. Every day,
Henderson County engineer Jerry Robinson feeds and waters thems and
collects their eggs. Every two weeks, he draws a tablespoon of
blood from a vein beneath one wing. Back at the county health
department, the blood is centrifuged and refrigerated, then shipped
to a lab in Raleigh to check whether the birds are infected.
</P>
<P>
   The African virus that in 12 months has killed seven people,
sickened 56 and killed thousands of wild birds from Massachusetts
to Maryland _ and for which there is no vaccine _ has not yet
turned up in Henderson County's chickens, nor in 57 other
``sentinel flocks'' across the state.
</P>
<P>
   But health officials in North Carolina _ and in Georgia and
other states that are watching North Carolina for the first signs
of virus in the South _ don't expect that to last.
</P>
<P>
   ``West Nile virus will probably reach North Carolina late this
year,'' said Dr. Nolan Newton of North Carolina's Department of
Environment and Natural Resources. ``If not, we will see it next
summer.''
</P>
<P>
   West Nile virus is this summer's scary disease. Like hantavirus
in 1993, Ebola in 1995 and the Hong Kong avian influenza in 1997 _
and a new rodent-borne virus, announced Thursday, that appears to
have killed three women in California _ it is a reminder of how
easily pathogens that infect animals can leap across species and
take humans by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Among public health experts, though, it is a reminder of a
second phenomenon as well: the frequency with which infectious
diseases that once were thought confined to the Third World are
menacing developed countries, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``West Nile virus shows us that new diseases can emerge at any
time, unexpectedly,'' said Dr. Peter Daszak of the University of
Georgia, a specialist in diseases of wildlife. ``It is a sign of
our globalized planet, with humans, animals and their products
being transported internationally at an unprecedented rate.''
</P>
<P>
   The discovery last summer that West Nile had arrived in New York
City, coupled with confirmation this month that the virus is
circulating locally in at least four states, has triggered an
extraordinary national effort to track the microbe. Led by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the initiative has
enlisted health departments in 17 at-risk states, which are
collaborating to detect the disease as it migrates across borders.
</P>
<P>
   Humans acquire West Nile from mosquitoes, which transmit it from
birds. Some bird species, such as chickens, can be infected without
showing signs of illness: North Carolina's chicken flocks are the
above-ground equivalent of canaries in a coal mine.
</P>
<P>
   Public health experts predict that West Nile will arrive in
Georgia in the bloodstream of migrating birds that were bitten
somewhere north of here by infected mosquitoes. When the birds land
to rest or feed, they could be bitten by local mosquitoes, which
would then transmit the virus to other birds and on to humans. So
many migrating birds cross the Southeast that a new CDC study
suggests southern Georgia could actually become a significant site
for the virus: The coastal plains of Georgia, northern Florida and
Alabama are winter habitat for some species that move through New
Jersey and New York.
</P>
<P>
   There have also been two fatal cases of viral encephalitis,
transmitted by mosquitoes, in North Carolina this summer. And south
Florida, along with southern Texas, is consistently recording cases
of dengue, a mosquito-borne tropical disease.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities tracking the spread of emerging diseases fear the
situation could get worse. Many insect-borne diseases are kept
under control by the arrival of cold temperatures, because most
mosquitoes don't survive through winter. But the planet is warming:
A study done by malaria experts at Maastricht University in the
Netherlands suggests that now-temperate parts of the planet,
including the eastern U.S., will become friendlier environments for
mosquitoes, and more vulnerable to the diseases they carry.
Georgia's risk of malaria, they predict, will rise 1.7 times by
2020. Despite alarm over West Nile and other unrecognized diseases,
public health experts stress that the potential for infection is
largely under individuals' control. Insect-borne diseases cannot
imperil humans unless the insects are given the chance to bite.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize, in public health, that people are often willing
to take risks, for instance smoking, that they themselves can
control, and unwilling to accept risks where they feel they don't
have any control, such as potentially being bitten by a mosquito,''
said Dr. Susan Lance-Parker of the Georgia Division of Public
Health. ``So I try to encourage people to know that the diseases
are out there, that their chances of contracting them are small,
and that there are things they can do to lower the risk further.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should put screens on their windows. They should cover
themselves when they go outside if they can, and use repellents if
that is not possible. And they should try to avoid being outside
for extended periods during the time when the disease-bearing
mosquitos are most likely to bite.''

   Authorities tracking the spread of emerging diseases fear the
situation could get worse. Many insect-borne diseases are kept
under control by the arrival of cold temperatures, because most
mosquitoes don't survive through winter. But the planet is warming:
A study done by malaria experts at Maastricht University in the
Netherlands suggests that now-temperate parts of the planet,
including the eastern U.S., will become friendlier environments for
mosquitoes, and more vulnerable to the diseases they carry.
Georgia's risk of malaria, they predict, will rise 1.7 times by
2020. Despite alarm over West Nile and other unrecognized diseases,
public health experts stress that the potential for infection is
largely under individuals' control. Insect-borne diseases cannot
imperil humans unless the insects are given the chance to bite.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize, in public health, that people are often willing
to take risks, for instance smoking, that they themselves can
control, and unwilling to accept risks where they feel they don't
have any control, such as potentially being bitten by a mosquito,''
said Dr. Susan Lance-Parker of the Georgia Division of Public
Health. ``So I try to encourage people to know that the diseases
are out there, that their chances of contracting them are small,
and that there are things they can do to lower the risk further.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should put screens on their windows. They should cover
themselves when they go outside if they can, and use repellents if
that is not possible. And they should try to avoid being outside
for extended periods during the time when the disease-bearing
mosquitos are most likely to bite.''

 &HT;    Rodent-borne virus causes 3 deaths, CDC reports
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Three women in California have died after being
infected with a virus carried by rodents that has never before
caused disease in humans, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The women, who were not related and lived in different parts of
California, were 14, 30, and 52 years old. They first experienced
fever and headache and were hospitalized with blood disorders and
severe breathing difficulties. They died from one to eight weeks
after first reporting problems.
</P>
<P>
   Analysis of samples from the women revealed genetic material
from an arenavirus, one of a family of pathogens that have caused
hemorrhagic fevers in Africa and South America. The virus found in
the patients is similar to one identified in a wood rat in New
Mexico in the 1990s, CDC said.
</P>
<P>
   Family members of one victim have told CDC investigators that
she cleaned up rodent droppings near her house two weeks before she
became sick. Investigation of the cases is continuing, the CDC
said, adding that the deaths emphasize the importance of behaving
cautiously around rodents; rodent droppings and rodent nests have
been linked to transmission of diseases such as potentially fatal
hantavirus.

   GRAPES _ BOONVILLE, N.C. _ In the four decades he's grown

he always figured. But now one of a fast growing number of North
Carolina farmers growing grapes to supply area vineyards,
57-year-old Hopson has learned to pay attention to sunshine and
other considerations critical to growing sweet, firm grapes. The
payoff? A crop that agricultural experts say won't replace North
Carolina's embattled, nearly billion-dollar-a-year crop, but one
that is acre for acre as profitable as tobacco.

especially those at the Carter Center, who are working with China
on standardizing village elections _ that this communist country is
on a slow but steady course towards democracy. To others, village

found UPS had committed a ``sham transaction.'' As a result, the
company may now be forced to pay the IRS one of the largest bills

 &HT;    FOR GORE, CONVENTION OFFERS A LAST CHANCE TO DEFINE HIMSELF
 &HT;    770&AMP;add. For release Sunday, Aug. 13.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vice President Al Gore has one overriding task at
the Democratic National Convention that convenes here this week: to
answer the questions, ``Who am I? What do I really believe in? And
where am I going to take the country?''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the way Gore answers those questions _ and how
effectively his answers are conveyed to a national television
audience increasingly bored with the parties' national conventions
_ will play a big part in determining whether he can overtake his
Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It also wouldn't hurt, experts say, if Gore also generated the
kind of enthusiasm that can get Midwestern swing voters to brave a
November chill.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to create excitement about himself,'' said James
Thurber, director of American University's Center for Congressional
and Presidential Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Why are such basic questions still unanswered after Gore's
nearly quarter-century in public life?
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore has zigged and zagged right and left so often since his
first race in 1976 that even experts can't follow his ideology
without a road map,'' said Larry Sabato, an expert in politics and
media at the University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, the delegates at Los Angeles's Staples Center _ and
more important, the national TV audience _ will get a four-day
reintroduction to the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's address Monday night will blend a
celebration of his policy successes as president with praise for
Gore as an indispensable partner. Then Clinton will leave Los
Angeles for a joint Michigan appearance with Gore designed as the
formal passing of the torch to the next Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the Staples Center, Gore becomes the centerpiece of the
convention's last three days.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's theme _ ``New Heights: You Ain't Seen Nothing
Yet'' _ will emphasize not only Gore's vision for the country, but
also the glories of the Democratic Party's past. It will feature
speeches by former Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's rival for the
Democratic nomination this year, and Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg,
the only child of the late President John F. Kennedy, who was
nominated by the Democrats in Los Angeles in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night _ ``Al Gore, the Principled Fighter'' _ will
feature Gore's wife, Tipper; his oldest daughter and adviser,
Karenna Gore Schiff, and his running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut. Schiff will formally nominate her father for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's acceptance speech Thursday night is the key to the
success of the convention, and is one of the last opportunities the
vice president may have in presenting himself as an appealing
figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush had to show people he was smart enough to be president,
but Gore has to show people he has the depth to be president,''
said Gary Nordlinger, a longtime Democratic campaign consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public knows his experience and his knowledge and his
capabilities,'' added convention manager Maria Hale. ``The
convention will say who he is as a father, as a son, as an elected
official, as a personal friend and as someone who wants to be
president.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to soften Gore's public image and convince the
nation he is not an attack-dog professional politician who will say
or do anything to get elected, as the Bush campaign has painted
him.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, Gore needs to contrast himself and his
party with Bush and the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   He ``has to define the race in a sharp way,'' said David
Wilhelm, the former chairman of the Democratic Party. ``The
Republicans are trying to have a feel-good campaign and avoid sharp
contrasts.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore ``needs to portray the Republicans as `risky' _ though
without using that word and without becoming harshly personal,''
said Jack Pitney, a onetime Republican strategist who now teaches
political science at Claremont McKenna College in Claremont, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Pitney said a two-part convention message could work: that Gore
will ``continue the good things'' of the Clinton years, such as
economic growth, and ``put the bad things behind them,'' such as
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a tricky combination,'' added Pitney.
</P>
<P>
   Tricky because Monday's address will be closely watched for any
attempt by the president to absolve Gore of Clinton's shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Tricky, too, because the story-starved reporters descending on
the convention are likely to visit the nearby Hsi Lai Temple, the
scene of a controversial 1996 Gore visit that for many symbolizes
his involvement in Democratic fund-raising improprieties. And to
help them along, the Buddhist temple has supplied directions on its
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Most experts agree that Gore's speech _ which is writing himself
_ represents his best chance along with the fall debates to take
votes away from Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore needs to decide whether his best argument is change or
continuity, and build his appeals around that perspective,'' said
Darrell West, a presidential scholar at Brown University. ``He
can't have it both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's post-convention trip down the Mississippi underscores the
future. It's being billed as ``Setting Course for the Future,'' and
will feature working families whose economic standing has improved
since the 1992 recession.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Bond, the chairman of the non-partisan NAACP, said the
Democrats should take special care to use the convention to convey
the party's commitment to minorities as ``more than the Republicans
photo-op approach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Comments I've heard about the GOP convention _ 'the stage
looked like Saturday night at the Apollo and the audience looked
like the Grand Old Opry' _ suggest that won't be difficult,'' added
Bond.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleisher, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, dismissed the
upcoming Democratic gathering as ``Al Gore's reinvention
convention.''
</P>
<P>
   But Doug Hattaway, one of the Gore campaign's chief spokesman,
countered that Gore is ``famous as vice president, but not well
known as a person.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, his task is to tell the nation who he is, what
he believes in and where he wants to take the country.

 &UR; THE VOICE OF MORRIS ON THE WAYS OF JOE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Morris Engelberg &LR; , lawyer for the late  &UR; Joe DiMaggio &LR; , says in
Vanity Fair's September issue that the Yankee slugger's last words
were ``I'll finally get to see Marilyn,'' a reference, of course,
to  &UR; Marilyn Monroe &LR; . At the time of DiMaggio's death, the New York
Post had quoted a hospice worker's assertion that he'd said ``I
love all of you''; the Daily News quoted a hospice worker who'd
said he'd had no ``last words.'' (The term appears in quotation
marks here because only a mute has no last words. ``Is there any
mustard in the refrigerator?'' spoken 10 years before a person's
death might qualify.)
</P>
<P>
   According to Engelberg, DiMaggio hated  &UR; Frank Sinatra &LR; ,
President  &UR; Kennedy &LR;  and  &UR; Robert Kennedy &LR; , and one of his many rules
was that Sinatra, JFK and Monroe were not to be mentioned in his
presence.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer said that DiMaggio hated  &UR; Bill Clinton &LR;  so much that
when the two were at Camden Yards in 1995, to see  &UR; Cal Ripken &LR;  set
a consecutive-games-played record, DiMaggio refused to shake the
president's hand. He also said that Clinton called the hospital
when DiMaggio was dying, but the call was not put through.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer will reveal in a book he is writing that DiMaggio
never grew out of his poor childhood: His refrigerator was full of
doggie bags from restaurants, loved getting things free, hated
turning on the air conditioning, did his own housekeeping and
laundry and liked other people picking up checks.
</P>
<P>
   Engelberg said he's making these revelations to help his late
friend ``become another  &UR; Babe Ruth  &LR; when it comes to recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; THE COST OF LAWYERS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ABC admitted this week that it paid lawyer  &UR; Theodore Olson &LR; 
$25,000 to help arrange  &UR; Barbara Walters &LR; ' interview with  &UR; Monica &LR; 
 &UR; Lewinsky &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Although Lewinsky's immunity agreement had prevented her from
talking with the media, Olson _ a close friend of &UR; Kenneth &LR; 
 &UR; Starr &LR; 's _ negotiated an exception, this week's issue of the New
Yorker says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't pay her,'' said &UR; Richard Wald &LR; , who worked for ABC
News at the time. ``We didn't pay her lawyer. We didn't pay anybody
else but a lawyer who made it possible for us to go through with
the interview.''

across the country found that the most ``years before they'll let

10 years and far behind, is held by the Baltusrol Golf Club in
Springfield, N.J.
</P>

Zarem told the New York Post he decided to quit representing

Fair cover shoot _ that I'd spent a year trying to get with  &UR; Annie
Leibovitz &LR;  _ because she had gained one pound.''

 &HT;    HISPANIC ACTIVISTS WANT ACTION TO FOLLOW WORDS
 &HT;    Eds: Moving in (w) Washington and (p) National political
categories
 &HT;    By MIRIAM A. GARCIA
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans will have to back up their message of
inclusion with action if they expect to gain Hispanic votes in
November, Hispanic and immigrant advocates said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While several Hispanics spoke and performed at last week's
national party convention in Philadelphia, leaders of the
congressional majority have hesitated to act on immigration bills
affecting about 900,000 Latin Americans, said members of the
National Hispanic Leadership Agenda, a non-partisan coalition of
Hispanic organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appreciate these symbolic marketing and outreach efforts,''
said Raul Izaguirre, National Council of La Raza president and a
coalition member. ``But issues and substance more than marketing
and symbols will decide who Latinos will vote for at all levels of
government.''
</P>
<P>
   The coalition is pushing Congress to take action in September on
the Latino Immigration Fairness Act, which would upgrade the status
of immigrants already working in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Coalition members wrote to both Texas Gov. George W. Bush and
Vice President Al Gore seeking support for the legislation. Bush
has not responded while Gore wrote back in support of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want results not issues,'' said Frank Sharry, executive
director of the National Immigration Forum. ``There was a chance to
have a vote on these issues in the Senate and the GOP said no.''
</P>
<P>
   A Bush spokesman said the campaign's response was delayed by
preparations for the Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Congress is seeking to vote on the H-1B bill, which
would raise the limit on high-tech worker visas.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats have said they want to add two parts of the
Latino Immigration Fairness Act to the legislative calendar:
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) Changing immigration law to allow hundreds of thousands
of illegal immigrants to apply for permanent residence if they can
show they have been in this country continuously since 1986. The
eligibility cutoff is 1972 under current law; and
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) Granting the same immigration benefits to Salvadorans,
Guatemalans, Hondurans and Haitians that were given Cubans and
Nicaraguans. Haitians, for example, are treated much differently
than Cubans when seeking permanent residence.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the coalition is seeking to change the law that
would permit immigrants to remain in this country while their
permanent residency papers are being processed. That measure has
less support among Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the coalition, however, Gore expressed support
for all three measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a fair and and comprehensive immigration agenda that is
based on family reunification, provides humanitarian protection for
refugees and addresses labor shortage needs while ensuring American
workers are not adversely affected,'' said Gore in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Bush supports allowing families to remain in this country while
immigration applications are being processed, said Ray Sullivan, a
campaign spokesperson. However, he said, ``Gov. Bush does not
support blanket amnesty and has not endorsed a specific bill
currently pending in Congress. He wants to see his reforms move
forward after he takes office in January.''
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Maribal, chairman of the coalition of some 20 Hispanic
groups, said Bush's ``compassionate conservatism'' may not be
shared by other members of the Republican party.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bush) might portray a face and it clearly gives the
impression that your face has changed but your party has not,''
Maribal said. ``Even though Gov. Bush wants to change his party,
does his party really want to change?''

   The National Hispanic Leadership Agenda, a coalition of about 20
Hispanic groups, is lobbying for the Latino Immigration Fairness
Act. The act:
</P>
<P>
   Updates a provision of immigration law known as ``registry''
cutoff date from 1972 to 1986 so that undocumented immigrants who
have been living in the U.S. since then would qualify for permanent
residence status.
</P>
<P>
   Restores section 245(i) of the immigration act, a provision of
immigration law that allows those on the verge of gaining their
immigration status to remain in the U.S. while completing the
process.
</P>
<P>
   Grants immigration benefits to Salvadorans, Guatemalans,
Hondurans and Haitians parallel to those enacted in 1997 to help
Cubans and Nicaraguans obtain permanent residence.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore supports all three provisions of the act.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has said he supports section 245(i) but wants to
see the reforms move forward after he is elected President.

A ROLE IN SIERRA LEONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since 18 US peacekeepers were slaughtered in Somalia in
1993, the United States has been loath to send its forces to
Africa. This week, a top Clinton administration official announced
that significant numbers of GIs would be returning to Africa _ but
as trainers of African peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   That, according to Wednesday's New York Times, will be the
mission of several hundred soldiers who will train soldiers from
Nigeria and two other West African nations for service in Sierra
Leone. That nation has been riven by fighting between government
forces and the Revolutionary United Front, which became infamous
for cutting off the limbs of civilian victims.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1999, the United States and other countries made the
mistake of approving a peace agreement that gave a governing role
to RUF leader Foday Sankoh. Sankoh failed to keep his promises and
earlier this year took hostage hundreds of poorly trained United
Nations peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   According to Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering,
Washington hopes that US-trained regional soldiers will be able to
restore the power of the Sierra Leone government. One goal will be
to help it reclaim the diamond mines that have financed the RUF's
weapons purchases.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the government of Sierra Leone won approval from the
UN Security Council to start certifying diamonds from government
mines. The Security Council in July had banned the purchase of
Sierra Leone diamonds that were not government certified.
</P>
<P>
   The dispatch of the US trainers should be an answer to critics
in Congress who never approved of the 1999 agreement and who have
found US policy feckless since. One of those critics, Senator Judd
Gregg of New Hampshire, has withheld comment for the time being.
George W. Bush's foreign policy adviser, Condoleezza Rice, gave the
plan a conditional approval, a welcome sign that the administration
may have found a bipartisan approach to a more assertive US role in
Africa.

U.S. WILL BE ABSENT WHEN LEADERS OF PARLIAMENTS MEET AT UNITED
NATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ More than 170 speakers of legislatures around
the world plan to meet here for the first time later this month to
celebrate a little-noticed byproduct of the spread of democracy:
The growth and strengthening of national parliaments.
</P>
<P>
   To the chagrin and distress of the organizers, however, it seems
that no one from the U.S. Congress is willing to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, the Republican-led Congress has failed to pay its
dues to the group that organized the meeting, the
Inter-Parliamentary Union, an organization that Americans helped to
found in 1889. An invitation to preside over part of that meeting
was sent to Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who is speaker of the House of
Representatives. It has not been answered. No one can make it from
the Senate side, either, officials of the parliamentary group said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that they should be there,'' said Anders B. Johnsson,
a Swede who is secretary-general of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.
``I think the world wants them to be there. We've sent that
message. But we haven't got a response. I think that's a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnsson, an administrator based in Geneva, and Najma Heptullah,
the speaker of India's upper house, who is now president of the
parliamentary union, both tried to meet U.S. legislators to
persuade them to attend the meeting and play a part in
strengthening the work of national legislatures. Heptullah waited
in vain in New York for two weeks for an appointment with Hastert
in Washington, union officials said.
</P>
<P>
   An official on Johnsson's staff, frustrated by repeated snubs
from Washington, called Congress ``the rudest parliament in the
world, without a doubt.'' He described the atmosphere on Capitol
Hill as fortresslike and ``run by aides who are the age of my
children.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, John Feehery, the House speaker's spokesman, said
that Hastert could not attend the meeting because he would be
traveling in Colombia with President Clinton at the end of August.
``This is the worst time of the year for us, toward the end of the
August recess,'' he said. ``This is a very contentious political
year and the speaker is going to be spending most of his time
campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   If Congress does not resume paying its dues, about $900,000 a
year, it will be suspended form the Inter-Parliamentary Union in
October and expelled next year, paradoxically at a meeting
scheduled to be held in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   National legislatures have growing roles to play in a global
age, parliamentary union officials and members say. Legislatures
have the power to regulate the uses of national resources, and
protect countries from exploitation in an era of economic
globalization. They ratify treaties and debate international
policies. Domestically, they can protect rights, raise tax revenues
and guide social policies so that spending reaches the poor.
Functioning legislatures aid development.
</P>
<P>
   When Secretary-General Kofi Annan travels abroad, said Santiago
Romero-Perez, director of the Inter-Parliamentary Union's liaison
office with the United Nations, ``he makes it a point of visiting
parliaments.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a chance happening,'' Romero added, ``but a
realization that the big commitments made during the 1990s really
need a popular response. Parliaments have to legislate and
appropriate the funds.''
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva, Johnsson said that many parliaments still need work.
</P>
<P>
   As he put it: ``If you look at the last decade _ the 1990s, the
one that history will remember as a period of democratization in
the world _ one country out of every four in the world changed its
constitutional framework, its electoral law, its parliament. In all
of those, there were two elements in common. One is that they
introduced multiparty systems, and the other was that they
introduced a stronger parliament with real legislative and
oversight functions.''
</P>
<P>
   National parliaments, he said, are a natural link between the
grass roots and the wider world, including the international
economic institutions that have become targets of criticism in the
third world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people in many parts of the world feel that they are
completely disconnected from the real decision-making processes on
the international scene,'' Johnsson said. ``That is a great
concern. If they don't feel that these are their processes and that
they have an influence over them, then these processes may be
destroyed. That we cannot afford.''

SLK, AS IN SLICK PACKAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, August 13) 
 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The last time I drove a Mercedes-Benz SLK, I couldn't
lower the retractable hardtop. Not because it didn't work; it was
buried under a half-foot pile of snow.
</P>
<P>
   That was during a dreary Michigan winter. This time, with
temperatures near 90 under a broiling sun, the roof came down once
and stayed there. The car was sunnier, too: It was a new-for-2001
model, the SLK320, with a 215-horsepower V-6 stuffed in the engine
compartment.
</P>
<P>
   The original version, the SLK230 Kompressor that arrived in
January 1997 was a sales success. Mercedes had to double production
to meet American demand. That car, like the new 320, had a sexy
wedge shape and a retractable metal hardtop, a marvel of
engineering that stopped traffic when it went up or down, various
panels whirring open as the roof lifted, folded and dropped out of
sight, all at the touch of one button in about half a minute.
</P>
<P>
   But the SLK230 had one nagging inadequacy: It didn't feel very
sporty. Even in turbo-charged form, the four-cylinder engine was
barely adequate for such a solid, heavy car. Sports car purists
also lamented the lack of a manual transmission.
</P>
<P>
   The four-cylinder SLK230 is still around _ its horsepower rating
inched up 5 for 2001, to 190 _ but most American drivers will find
the new 320 more to their liking. This car has a version of the
3.2-liter V-6 engine used in several Mercedes products. The V-6 has
peak torque of 229 foot-pounds, compared with 200 for the old car.
</P>
<P>
   The performance difference is impressive. While the larger
engine supposedly shaves only about a second from the SLK's 0-to-60
acceleration time, stoplight getaways feel far more exhilarating
than the numbers suggest. And the SLK320 makes a throaty growl.
</P>
<P>
   Both SLK models are now available with a six-speed manual
transmission, although a five-speed automatic continues to be
offered in both versions. The six-speed is a big improvement over
the notchy five-speed manual that was added to the 230 Kompressor
last year, but its shift action is more mushy than crisp, and it
sometimes balked at sliding smoothly into gear.
</P>
<P>
   While the V-6 and six-speed transform the SLK into a sporty
package that can be driven hard, the car still rides more
comfortably than the most imported roadsters. (A sport package with
a tighter suspension is optional.) With the top down, the solid
Mercedes structure virtually eliminates body shake, and with it up,
the car feels as well-braced and weatherproof as a coupe. This is
one convertible that truly can be used year-round in the North.
</P>
<P>
   My only other complaint with the SLK320 was with the steering.
Under hard acceleration, I clung tightly to the steering wheel to
keep the roadster in a straight line.
</P>
<P>
   The body shape is the same, reminiscent of Mercedes roadsters of
the 1950s, but the front and rear have been subtly updated. The
tail lamps now have clear covers; turn signal indicators are
incorporated into the side mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the SLK still has retro gauges (attractive, but not
always perfectly legible), but the phony carbon-fiber trim of the
original car is gone. The V-6 car has wood inserts; the
four-cylinder uses machined aluminum. Both models have TeleAid, an
emergency communications system like General Motors' OnStar, and
antiskid controls.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for the new car, Mercedes lowered the price of the
SLK230 Kompressor by about $2,000, to $39,545 including shipping
charges. The SLK320 starts at $44,545, but options can quickly add
$10,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   I was always a fan of the SLK, which has sold especially well
among women. Its classy style cost half as much as Mercedes'
top-of-the-line SL-Series roadsters. Compared with sports cars like
the Porsche Boxster or BMW Z3, it offered a more comfortable ride,
and its retractable hardtop gives it year-round capability. Now, a
new powertrain adds even more pizazz.

   REFORM-PARTY (Long Beach, Calif.) _ Split beyond repair, the
Reform Party convened two national conventions here Thursday, each
side claiming to be true heir to the political organization founded
by Ross Perot and each intent on nominating its own presidential
candidate. The actions made for a third day of noisy demonstrations
by forces for and against the candidacy of Pat Buchanan, but at
least this time police were not required to intervene. After
supporters of Buchanan's rival, John Hagelin, were turned away from
the delegate meeting room at the Long Beach Convention Center
controlled by Buchanan allies, they marched peacefully down the
street to the Long Beach Center for Performing Arts where they
began their own convention. By Michael Janofsky and B. Drummond

   GORE-BIO-HOUSERACE (Undated) _ From his earliest days on the
stump, Al Gore showed both the best and the worst of himself as a
candidate. In his 1976 House race, he won because he outworked the
competition and had his facts down cold. Yet he also turned off
even some old friends in the process by presenting himself as more
conservative than he was. In that race, Gore's first job was to
differentiate himself from his father, Sen. Albert Gore, who had
suffered a bitter defeat six years earlier. Just as in this one,
the vice president must separate himself from another political
force of nature, Bill Clinton. The question for Al Gore was then
and is now: Is he his own man? In one sense, he has yet to prove
that he is his own guy, in part because his political decisions
have not always made clear where he stands. But also because he is
so complicated, with a million moving parts behind the shut-down
exterior, that there is no perfect soundbite of an answer to the
larger question of who he is. Often, though, for Gore, being his
own man has often meant going it alone. By Melinda Henneberger.

   NIGERIA-OIL (Oviri-Court, Nigeria) _ The Niger Delta of Nigeria,
one of the world's top oil producers, has for years been the center
of violent despair. The swampy patch of land yields almost all of
Nigeria's 2 million barrels of crude a day, most of which ends up
at gas stations in the United States. But because of this country's
complicated history of ethnic politics, its inhabitants have
remained stunningly and desperately poor. And in gruesome displays
of that poverty, hundreds have been burned to death in recent weeks
in at least five explosions as they tried to scoop up fuel. By

<P>
   ARDENT-FANS (Undated) _ It has long been assumed that ardent
sports fans derive excitement and a sense of community from rooting
for a big-time sports team. But a growing body of scientific
evidence suggests that, for some fans, the ties go much deeper.
Researchers have found that fervent fans become so tied to their
teams that they experience hormonal surges and other physiological
changes while watching games, much as the athletes themselves do.
Testosterone levels in male fans go up significantly after their
team wins and drop sharply after a loss, one study found. And while
science has not yet grappled rigorously with the broad question of
whether rooting avidly for a team is good or bad for someone's
health, there are early clues, some of them surprising. A study at
the University of Kansas suggests that sports fans suffer fewer
bouts of depression and alienation than do people who are
uninterested in sports. By James McKinley.

NASCAR DRIVERS KNOW HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK ZIER   The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One thing that sets race car drivers apart is their sense of
history.
</P>
<P>
   Ask anybody in Winston Cup about Richard Petty or David Pearson
or Bobby Allison and they can tell you.
</P>
<P>
   Last week at Indy, when the Winston Cup cars invaded the birth
place of oval racing, you sensed that the drivers and teams
understood they were someplace special, even though Indy's roots
are not in stock car racing.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers and teams appreciate Indy's mystique, are aware of
it and they have started their own tradition there.
</P>
<P>
   After the race, whoever wins, the whole team goes to the finish
line and kisses the one row of bricks remaining from when Indy
actually was put together with bricks, which gave it its nickname.
</P>
<P>
   Before the race, the drivers are taken around the track in open
cars to be introduced to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte recounted riding with Darrell Waltrip. ``We were
on the back straightaway and it gets a little quiet back there and
he asked me, he said, `Well, what do you think?' '' Labonte
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I said, `I think it's just an honor to ride with you
today, sir.' So I gave him my hat and he signed my hat for me. All
the way around, all those people were cheering and none of them
were cheering for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were all cheering for him because this was his last race
at Indy. It's an awesome feeling riding around this racetrack that
slow with all those people,'' Labonte said. ``To me, that's the
special thing.''

welfare reform and a rebounding regional economy. ``I want to tell
what the core of this whole struggle is all about: It's the
economy,'' said Gore. He ridiculed Republicans in a fiery speech in

nomination joined campaign forces today, with John McCain declaring
himself ``proud to be part of this crusade'' and asking independent
voters to take another look at Bush. ``All I can do really is ask
independents to look at Governor Bush,'' he said, at a joint news
conference in Salinas, Calif., adding that he can't tell them how
to vote. ``Independents are independents because they are
independent,'' he said. McCain and Bush were teaming up through
Saturday for campaign appearances in California, Oregon and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   REFORM PARTY FEUD INTENSIFIES
</P>
<P>
   A deeply divided Reform Party fractured into two separate
conventions today as Pat Buchanan's forces turned away those who
are fiercely opposing his presidential run. Rallying around a
little-known opposition candidate, John Hagelin, supporters of
party founder Ross Perot marched off to convene a rival meeting
down the block. The split was official after several hundred
members of the anti-Buchanan faction marched into the hallway of
the original convention site and tried to enter the opening
proceedings. They were turned away peacefully by security forces.
``This reminds me of the old civil rights days of the 1960s,'' said
Lee Dillworth of Mississippi, a delegate with the Perot faction.
</P>
<P>
   HEAD START CUT OFF AT THE PASS
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney defended his congressional vote against Head Start,
saying today that the preschool program for poor children needed to
be more than just child care. ``Just because something had a fancy
title doesn't mean it merited support,'' Cheney said after a
campaign stop in Columbus, Ohio, designed to highlight education.
``You don't want it to just be child care.'' he said. Cheney has
also said he voted against Head Start because the federal deficit
limited money for social spending.
</P>
<P>
   EVEN AGAIN IN MUST-WIN STATE
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore and George W. Bush are now virtually even among likely
California voters, with Green Party candidate Ralph Nader taking
significant support from Gore, according to a new poll. The survey,
released today by the Public Policy Institute of California, found
Gore backed by 40 percent of likely voters while Bush drew 37
percent. Nader had 8 percent, and Reform Party contender Pat
Buchanan 1 percent. Fourteen percent were undecided. The poll,
conducted during last week's Republican convention, has a 4
percentage point margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   CRUISING DOWN THE RIVER
</P>
<P>
   The morning after the Democratic convention, Al Gore and Joe
Lieberman will launch a 400-mile riverboat tour along the
Mississippi River, the campaign announced today. On their ``Setting
Course for the Future'' boat tour, Gore and Lieberman will visit
communities in four states along the Mississippi aboard the Mark
Twain riverboat and talk with working families about their plans
for the future. The tour will start Aug. 18 in LaCrosse, Wis., and
wrap up four days later in Hannibal, Mo., the boyhood home of Mark
Twain.
</P>
<P>
   VALUES TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER RELIGION
</P>
<P>
   In a survey about values, religion and politics in America,
conducted before the selection of Joe Lieberman as Al Gore's
running mate, voters said they favor candidates who display strong
moral beliefs and are more concerned that a candidate share their
values than their religious faiths. Among the findings of the
Oxygen/ Markle Pulse poll (www.pulse.org), part of a larger study
on voters' political engagement, released today was that only 2
percent of women and 4 percent of men would not vote for a Jewish
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   GROUP WANTS PLAYBOY OFF-LIMITS
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore is pressuring Rep. Loretta Sanchez (D-Calif.) to cancel
a fund-raiser at the Playboy Mansion during next week's Democratic
National Convention. The Gore campaign is threatening to revoke her
convention credentials, cancel her speaking role, withdraw support
for her re-election and remove her from her position as Democratic
National Committee general co-chair, according to the Associated
Press. Maria Meier, a Gore spokeswoman, said Sanchez declined
offers from the Gore campaign for assistance in moving the venue.
Sanchez's spokeswoman did not return phone messages.
</P>
<P>
   WITH THE WEB, YOU MUST BE QUICK
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Al Gore selected Joe Lieberman as his running mate,
the campaign Internet team began trolling for a Web address.
Trouble was, virtually every conceivable Gore-Lieberman combination
had already been snatched up by ``domain name investors,'' also
known as cyber-squatters, looking to turn a quick buck. One such
squatter, Pete Lucas of Bridgewater, N.J., held at least five
possible Gore-Lieberman addresses and was e-mailing the campaign in
search of financial offers. The Republican National Committee also
reserved sites _ AlandJoe.com and AlandJoe.org _ and they won't be
used to spread good news about the Democratic duo.
</P>
<P>
   ALL-OUT SPENDING PUSH FOR HILLARY
</P>
<P>
   The national Democratic leadership, clearly concerned that
Hillary Clinton is facing a tough Senate race in New York, has
mounted an unusually early effort to promote her candidacy. It
already has channeled nearly $3 million into the state _ much of it
from large, unregulated contributions _ and is girding to spend far
more. No other Senate candidate in the country has received
anywhere near as much financial assistance from either major
political party, according to campaign finance records.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEGED SLUR DOING LITTLE HARM
</P>
<P>
   A clear majority of New Yorkers who believe Hillary Clinton
hurled an anti-Semitic slur at an ex-campaign worker in 1974 won't
vote against her in the Senate election because of it, according to
one poll. The Quinnipiac University survey showed that despite
Clinton's denial that she used the slur, 40 percent of the 1,203
registered voters surveyed believe the allegation. However, 88
percent of those people ``say it will have no impact on how they
vote,'' said Quinnipiac pollster Mickey Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   PROSPERITY AND FUND-RAISING
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton did some stumping for his vice president and
his wife in McLean, Va., saying the best way to ensure continued
prosperity was to send Al Gore to the White House and Hillary
Clinton to the Senate. ``This election is a very big deal,'' he
told 30 people who paid $10,000 each to help the first lady. ``How
you use your prosperity is as important a test as how you deal with
a crisis: You have to go around and convince people of that.''
</P>
<P>
   NRA ARMED FOR DEMOCRATS
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association plans to run newspaper and TV ads
during the Democratic convention, attacking the party for wanting
``to destroy the Second Amendment,'' in what the NRA's leaders
called an effort to divide the Democrats' conservative and liberal
wings over gun control. In the TV spot, actor Charlton Heston, who
also is NRA president, says: ``From anti-gun mayors and marchers to
gun-hating celebrities and politicians, they're almost all
Democrats. Tell me: Why are so few Democrats willing to defend
constitutional freedom?''
</P>
<P>
   PUSH FOR IMMIGRATION AMNESTY
</P>
<P>
   Labor and immigrant rights leaders will aggressively push their
case for a new general amnesty at the Democratic convention.
Immigrant workers and community activists plan to station
themselves outside the daily gatherings of every state delegation
and to relentlessly pester all the federal lawmakers in Los
Angeles. They'll speak of justice and the contributions immigrants
have made to the economy, but underlying those arguments will be a
simple, blunt message: If you want the support of Latino voters,
you need to give us this in return.
</P>
<P>
   `SILVER SEWER' STOCK SALE
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lieberman's wife owned stock in two TV networks that
received his ``Silver Sewer'' award for offensive programming, but
sold them after the issue was raised publicly last year. Hadassah
Lieberman sold the CBS and Fox stocks shortly afterward ``because
some concerns were raised about the perceptions, even though she
didn't see anything wrong with it,'' said Lieberman spokesman Dan
Gerstein. ``It wasn't because Senator Lieberman told her to; she
did this on her own.''
</P>
<P>
   HEY, THEY'VE GOT AN EX-PRESIDENT, TOO
</P>
<P>
   At Al Gore's invitation, ex-President Jimmy Carter will attend
the convention and be featured in a five-minute film paying tribute
to his service as president and his achievements since leaving the
Oval Office. The Los Angeles Times reports that Carter, who skipped
the 1996 convention, hadn't planned to attend this year's event
until Gore called him last week after the Republican convention
paid tribute to former Presidents Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan and
George Bush in two short films. Carter will be accompanied by wife
Rosalynn. The Carter tribute will be Monday evening, the same night
the Clintons are scheduled to address the convention.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. CARDINAL GOING TO CONVENTION
</P>
<P>
   Breaking with recent precedent, Roman Catholic Cardinal Roger
Mahony of Los Angeles agreed to deliver the invocation at the
opening of the Democratic convention. Four years ago, the late
Cardinal Joseph Bernardin turned down an invitation to address the
convention in Chicago. Similarly, the late Cardinal John O'Connor
absented himself from Democratic conventions in New York in both
1984 and 1992. Tod Tamberg, a spokesman for the L.A. archdiocese,
said Mahony's appearance should not be seen as ``fudging'' on the
church's _ and the cardinal's _ oft-stated opposition to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   AND DON'T LEAVE HOME WITHOUT IT
</P>
<P>
   Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader is spoofing
MasterCard commercials by claiming his attempt to expose corporate
contributions to the major political parties is ``priceless.''
Nader's spot pokes fun at George W. Bush and Al Gore for accepting
millions in special interest donations, and concludes with a plea
to include Nader in the presidential debates. ``Grilled tenderloin
for fund-raiser: $1,000-a-plate,'' says the voiceover. ``Campaign
ads filled with half-truths: $10 million. Promises to special
interest groups: over $10 billion.'' Then the camera pans to Nader
sifting through documents at a desk: ``Finding out the truth:
Priceless. There are some things money can't buy.''
</P>
<P>
   NOT THE YEAR OF THE WOMEN
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years after Geraldine Ferraro made history, George W.
Bush and Al Gore have picked white men as their running mates, and
women advocates argue that it's long past time to see another woman
on the ticket. But the cycle will only be broken, they say, when
more women occupy governors' mansions and seats in the U.S. Senate
and position themselves for the two highest political offices.
``More and more women are saying to themselves: When is next time
going to come?'' said Erica Henri of the nonpartisan Women's
Campaign Fund. ``Women have to be more demanding, and we need to
expand the list we're looking at.''
</P>
<P>
   THE HOUSE, TOO, NOT JUST WHITE HOUSE
</P>
<P>
   Two top House Democrats _ House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of
Missouri and Rep. Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island, chairman of the
House Democrats' campaign committee _ will take a two-day swing
through California in hopes of drumming up support for five of the
party's challengers for House seats. The Democrats hope to pick up
seven seats in November and win control of the House, where
Republicans have a 223-210 edge. Of two independents, one generally
votes with Democrats, the other with the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   PIGSKIN AND POLITICS CRAZY
</P>
<P>
   Retired University of Nebraska coach Tom Osborne has had little
trouble with name recognition in a football-crazed district that
takes up about 85 percent of the state's area. Although he hadn't
lived in the rural district since leaving nearly 40 years ago, he
faces a little-known real estate investor and is the odds-on
favorite in November. Before Osborne started his campaign, no one
knew for sure his political affiliation _ Republican _ or where he
stood on issues. It didn't matter. Said Carroll Sheldon, one of
four GOP candidates who dropped out after Osborne announced: ``I
leave town, come back and find out God is running against me.''
</P>
<P>
   CAN'T-VOTE CAPITAL OF CALIFORNIA
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic convention in Los Angeles is being held in the
33rd Congressional District. It's the poorest, most Hispanic
district in all of California. Democrats win in the 33rd without
breaking a sweat. But when Bill Clinton and Al Gore swept the 33rd
in 1992, they also collected fewer voters there than in any other
district in the state. That seeming contradiction is possible
because the 33rd also has the fewest registered voters of any
California district _ and not entirely because the locals are not
organized or interested. It is, rather, because so many of those
living there are not citizens at all, but immigrants not yet
eligible to vote.
</P>
<P>
   THAT WAS A NO-N0
</P>
<P>
   CBS and the producers of ``The Late Late Show With Craig
Kilborn'' apologized for putting the words ``Snipers Wanted'' under
footage of George W. Bush's acceptance speech at the Republican
convention during a mock newscast portion of the program. The
footage ran last week as part of the late-night show's segment in
which Kilborn tweaks topical news. ``This graphic . . . should not
have been included in the telecast and is not consistent with our
broadcast standards,'' CBS said.
</P>
<P>
   BRACING FOR A TERRORIST ATTACK
</P>
<P>
   Hospital employees are getting anti-terrorist training, fire
stations are adding staff and stockpiling supplies, and city buses
are bypassing downtown as Los Angeles prepares for its biggest
event since the 1984 Olympics. ``The big concerns are that
terrorists will try to use bioterrorism to attack the area,'' said
Jim Lott of the Healthcare Association of Southern California.
About a dozen hospitals near the Staples Center have stocked up on
antidotes and undergone decontamination training, and have bought
protective equipment that could shield the staff from toxins.
</P>
<P>
   DANGER: NEWS BOXES
</P>
<P>
   Citing the need for tight convention security, Los Angeles
officials ordered media outlets to remove dozens of sidewalk news
boxes around Staples Center, while the Postal Service has carted
off nearly 60 mailboxes in the area. Publishers have been asked to
voluntarily remove boxes from other areas outside the immediate
security zone that are likely venues for street protests. A news
box was thrown through a store window in Seattle during protests
over the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   BIG STAGE ALL SET
</P>
<P>
   With lights dimmed and rock music blaring, the Democrats
unveiled their huge convention stage and podium. The metallic,
futuristic-looking 5-foot-high, 3,700-square-foot stage in Staples
Center moves up and down, clearly wowing the journalists and
visiters given a tour. A giant 18-by-30-foot video screen _ adorned
with a red, white and blue banner labeled, ``America 2000'' _
towers above and behind the metal-surfaced stage.

 &HT;    E. Texas Democrat doesn't expect Bush coattail effect
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You have to hand it to Jim Turner of Crockett, Texas, incumbent
congressman for the Pineywoods. He knows how to pick 'em.
</P>
<P>
   What better election year not to have a Republican opponent with
GOP-presidential nominee George W. Bush expected to sweep Texas by
as much as 70 percent?
</P>
<P>
   Turner, heading into his third term in Congress and a delegate
to the Democratic National Convention, is at least one sure winner
at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Turner will tell you he doesn't think other Texas Democratic
congressional candidates have that much to worry about, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see much in the way of coattails when Gov. Bush ran
for re-election two years ago. It didn't seem to be much of an
impact on congressional races, and I really hope that's what
happens again.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner, however, allowed, ``We all know Gov. Bush is very
popular and will carry Texas by an overwhelming majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner goes as far as to predict that, ``Come January, we'll
have a Democratic majority'' in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in a number of years, the Democratic
candidates for Congress are raising as much money as the Republican
candidates. We're six votes shy in the House. There are at least 20
possibilities for Democratic gains. We can count of at least half
of those.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner says what he is looking forward to in Los Angeles ``is
hearing some of the issues that distinguish the Democratic Party
from the other party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans had a nice convention, but they didn't talk
about the issues that really matter to the American people. At our
convention, we'll address those issues and, as a result, I believe
the races are going to tighten up.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important issues, to Turner's way of thinking,
is ``the direction that we want to take this country in terms of
fiscal responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting to note, he said, ``that the Democratic Party
has become the party of fiscal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Republican Party that wants to spend the surplus with
a trillion dollar tax cut'' _ the total, Turner said, of the
Republican bills that have passed the House so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a standpoint of fiscal responsibility,'' he said, ``I
think you have to put a priority on paying down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tax cuts are important, but they shouldn't be so large that
they consume virtually the entire estimated 10-year surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which may not ever even show up, by the way,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   People talk about the prosperous times, but in the poorer parts
of his district that's all it is _ talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this prosperous economy needs to be shared by
everyone. We live in an area of the country, here in East Texas,
where not everybody has seen this prosperity yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democratic Party has always stood for making sure that
everybody has a place at the table. The Democrats offer the best
hope for everybody to realize the American Dream.''

 &HT;    DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION COMMENTARY: No one lost Texas, it just
stopped hiding
 &HT;    NOTE: Needs commentary line
 &HT;    JOE MURRAYAVAILABLE
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After the Communist take-over of China in 1949, outraged
Republicans demanded of the Truman administration, ``Who lost
China?!''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Republican take-over of Texas is a done-deal, the
party of LBJ and Sam Rayburn well might be asking themselves, ``Who
lost Texas?''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to put your finger on, but the same thing has happened
across the once-Solid South.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the national Democratic Party over the last 20 years
has done its part by becoming ever more liberal on the issues. Gun
control is as good an example as any.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't leave the Democratic Party _ It left me!'' is the
common refrain for members of the new Republican majority.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicanization of Texas has been more dramatic, perhaps,
than in the rest of the South because of its larger number of
electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot at stake in the Lone Star State. At present, Texas
ranks No. 3 in electoral votes. Four years from now, it will likely
move to No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing really has changed so much politically. Deep in its
heart, Texas has always been Republican, particularly evident on
the national level.
</P>
<P>
   Look at its voting history for presidents:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1952 and 1956, Texans liked everything about Ike.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1960, Kennedy won with LBJ on the ticket and, perhaps even
more than that, the massive turnout of Mexican-Americans in the Rio
Grande Valley voting for the Catholic candidate.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1964, LBJ beat Goldwater, but hardly anyone voted for
Goldwater anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1968, LBJ was able to deliver Texas to Hubert Humphrey _ just
barely; but third-party candidate George Wallace probably cost
Nixon the state.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1972, Nixon was the one for Texans.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1976, Carter was able to carry Texas when fundamental
Christian voters mistakenly thought the born-again Georgian Baptist
was one of them politically.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1980 and '84, Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1988 and '92, Bush.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1996, Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Even in its years as a Democratic state, Texas's true political
leaning has always been to the right. You could find a scattering
of moderate and liberal Democrats tolerated at the statewide level,
but conservative Democrats ruled.
</P>
<P>
   And conservative Democrat was just another name for Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Shivers, John Connally, Dolph Briscoe _ most any Texas
governor in any year _ may have carried the label of Democrat but
wlong she lasted.)
</P>
<P>
   The accepted practice was for Texas Republicans to participate
in the Democratic primary in order to have a say in local and state
politics -- ignoring the ballot pledge that you were bound to
support the nominee of the party come November.
</P>
<P>
   Republican candidates who did try to run locally might never
mention party affiliation in billboards and media ads.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 20 years, Republicans eventually got to the point
where they could win local elections, even in the erstwhile Yellow
Dog Democrat regions of East Texas.
</P>
<P>
   No longer the party that dares not speak its name, the GOP
controls not only the governor's office and both U.S. Senate seats
but most every other aspect of state politics.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's the Democratic candidates who often avoid mentioning
party affiliation in their campaign material.
</P>
<P>
   Who lost Texas?
</P>
<P>
   Texas wasn't lost. It just finally came out of hiding.

   MARLBORO-MUSIC (Marlboro, Vt.) _ We've been trying to figure out
what to call this thing for 50 years,'' Frank Salomon said of the
venerable Marlboro Music School and Festival, which ends its 50th
season here August 13 with a public concert. ``It is not what
people customarily think of either as a school or as a festival.''
True, it is an odd school that has no teachers or students; only
participants, as they are called, some with much experience, some
with little, purposefully mixed and working together in rehearsals
and performances of chamber music. The learning is in the doing.
And it is an odd festival that determines its concert programs only
a week or so in advance, trusting listeners to travel from far and
wide all unknowing, and to welcome whatever pieces and performers
happen to come around. By James R. Oestreich.

   YIDDISH-PINAFORE-THEATER (New York) _ The good ship Pinafore
looks familiar enough, with its big nautical steering wheel at
center stage, but why is it flying the Israeli flag? The tunes are
Arthur Sullivan's good old tunes, but what's with the lyrics? ``Ich
bin der keynig fun dem yam.'' What happened to ``I am the monarch
of the sea?'' Welcome to the Gilbert and Sullivan Yiddish Light
Opera Company's production of ``Der Yiddisher Pinafore,'' currently
anchored at Manhattan's New 14th Street Y. By Julius Novick.

</P>
<P>
   ALTAMONT-FILM (Undated) _ What gets called the '60s had any
number of endings, most of them elusive or much debated. But for
those who understood the decade (or era, or moment) as more a
cultural than a political phenomenon _ a last, late Romantic
pastoral _ the end came quite precisely and inarguably: Friday
night, Dec. 6, 1969, at the Altamont Speedway not far from San
Francisco, as the Rolling Stones, distracted and distraught, worked
their way through ``Under My Thumb.'' This moment is understood in
such terrible detail largely because of ``Gimme Shelter,'' the
extraordinary cinema verite account of the Stones' 1969 American
tour that ended in the Altamont darkness. By Gerald Marzorati.

   FOREIGN-FILMS (New York) _ For five weeks, through Sept. 14,
Film Forum is showing some wonderful foreign classics made in the
years 1945-65, everything from ``Children of Paradise'' and ``Open
City'' to ``The Seventh Seal'' and ``Breathless.'' The series is
titled ``The Golden Age of the Foreign Film,'' a challenging claim;
it sounds almost too good to be true. By Phillip Lopate.

   STANLEY-TONG-FILM (Hong Kong) _ When Stanley Tong left his
hometown for Hollywood in 1996, Hong Kong's film industry was
headed for a crack-up as spectacular as anything in a Jackie Chan
movie. Box office revenue was plummeting, scripts were threadbare
and rampant piracy was driving a whole generation of movie-watchers
away from theaters. Now, Tong has returned to Hong Kong and is back
on familiar ground _ shooting an action film about the Chinese
police busting a smuggling ring. By Mark Landler.

   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CHEERLEADER-DANCE (New York) _ In the show ``Wanted:
X-Cheerleaders,'' a squad of 10 real-life ex-cheerleaders rant and
cheer about women's issues. Their routines, which feature flying
pompoms, kicks and jumps, are at once authentic cheerleading drills
and carefully choreographed movement. Although ``X-Cheerleaders''
may or may not fall under the rubric of contemporary dance, it is
exactly the kind of movement-dominated performance that is carving
out a niche in the New York International Fringe Festival, which
will envelop the Lower East Side for 12 days beginning on August
16. By Kevin Giordano.
</P>
<P>
   TROCKS-DANCE (New York) _ What renowned American classical
ballet company garnered enough engagements in 1999 to employ its
dancers for an impressive 41 weeks? The Joffrey Ballet, maybe?
American Ballet Theater? No, it was Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte
Carlo, fondly known as the Trocks, home of bulldozing etoiles like
Olga Supphozova and Ida Nevasayneva. The company, opening at the
Joyce Theater on August 15, will present two repertory programs
consisting primarily of Slavic chestnuts, including the New York
premiere of an impeccably affected ``Raymonda's Wedding,'' coached
by Elena Kunikova. By Joseph Carman.

   NC-DANCE-FESTIVAL (Undated) _ Dance is getting itself happily
mixed up. Some choreographers are having a ball with rock 'n' roll
and all that jazz. Others are uniting seemingly disparate music and
dance styles. The results can be artistically provocative, the best
of such productions making theatergoers gaze in wonder at both
dance and the world from which it comes. Take two refreshing
productions at this summer's American Dance Festival in Durham,

<P>
   AMERICAN-ROUTES-MUSIC (Undated) _ Nick Spitzer's uncompromising
passion for American music in all its vast variety has found
expression in the nationally syndicated public radio program
``American Routes.'' Part travelogue, part oral history, part
musical survey, the show is 100 percent Nick Spitzer, which is to
say that in a given two hours each week it might range from
Thelonious Monk to Doc Watson to Lauryn Hill, stopping along the
way to interview a New York cabbie or a Delta barber, deliberately
heedless of categories. By Samuel G. Freedman.

   WHITE-WOMEN-BLUES (Undated) _ Why do white women sing the blues?
It's grueling work to peer over the broad shoulders of old masters

a cluster of major civic projects that, between them, will exercise

New York. All the projects have an important role to play in
meeting the fundamental challenge faced by New York and other aging

   AFRICAN-INSTRUMENTS (Washington) _ Africans _ and their
descendants in the diaspora _ always seem surrounded by music. So
it hardly comes as a surprise for a museum curator to decide that
traditional African instruments should not only be listened to but
looked at. Such is the point of ``Audible Artwork: Selected African
Musical Instruments,'' a pleasant, though rather modest, exhibit
showing here at the National Museum of African Art through April 8,
2001. By Stephen A. Holmes.

   MALE-NUDE-PHOTOGRAPHY (Undated) _ The first photographer to make
male nudes popular subjects for both homosexuals and heterosexuals
was Baron Wilhelm von Gloeden (1856-1931), a German who worked in
Sicily, primarily from 1890 to 1914. Forty-one of his images, most
of them of young Italian boys dressed like ancient Greeks, are on
view at Throckmorton Fine Art in Midtown Manhattan through Sept.
9). By Vicki Goldberg.

 &HT;    Coca-Cola launching new round of humorous television ads to
stimulate sales
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A 101-year-old great-grandmother in a wheelchair busts
up a family reunion because there's no Coke Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Two high school girls get into a fight at graduation because
there's no Coke.
</P>
<P>
   And a Chinese foreign exchange student greeted at a railroad
station by her American hosts starts muttering under her breath in
disbelief after, you guessed it, they didn't bring any Coke.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Monday, Coca-Cola will launch a new round of humorous
television ads aimed at stimulating sales of its flagship brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brand Coke and the whole cola segment have been
underperforming the industry as a whole,'' said John Sicher, editor
and publisher of Beverage Digest. ``With these new ads, Coke is
using humor to try to more effectively connect to the consumer. How
well they work over time will be up to the collective jury of U.S.
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads are the first ones created exclusively for the North
American market under the company's new ``think local, act local''
mantra established by Chairman Doug Daft. Other regions of the
world are preparing their own versions.
</P>
<P>
   The new North American ads, dubbed ``Moments,'' attempt to build
on the global ``Enjoy'' campaign that started earlier this year. In
reality, however, the ads depict blown moments.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of going with the conventional approach of connecting a
special event with Coke by showing consumers drinking it, the ads
take the opposite tack, which you don't expect because the music
and scenery set you up for tradition. By unexpectedly lightening up
the events, the spots also have the effect of poking fun at
previous Coke spots in a self-deprecating sort of way.
</P>
<P>
   What can be more American than a soldier returning home to his
family's farmhouse with his loved ones rushing to meet him on a
gravel road. But without any Coke there, the soldier walks away
from his family in dismay: ``The moment's over. We missed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Next time, the spots say, enjoy Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an opportunity to have fun, be a little more humorous and
be unexpected,'' said Darryl Cobbin, Coke's vice president of North
American consumer communications. Cobbin said the company is trying
to emotionally connect with consumers in a different way than the
earlier Enjoy ads. Those ads highlighted some of the tingling and
pop sensations of drinking Coke.
</P>
<P>
   Created by New York-based Cliff Freeman &AMP; Partners, the family
reunion and graduation spots will start airing Monday on network
and cable TV. They will be followed by the soldier's homecoming and
exchange student ads that will begin airing in September during the
Opening Ceremony of the Olympic Games in Sydney. Additional spots
will follow in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Coke will spend about $115 million advertising Classic on TV in
the United States this year.

<P>
   For anyone who'd actually be interested in watching, ``Bob
Dylan: American Troubador'' could be retitled, ``Everything You
Already Knew About Bob Dylan and Didn't Have to Ask.'' It's a fan's
high-school term paper with such audio-visual aids as archival
footage of '50s Minneapolis, a New York blizzard and race riots,
combined with a line or two from a handful of Dylan classics.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons for the program's stunning lack of insight
into Dylan is the paltry band of witnesses it rounds up _
gnarly-toothed geezers who knew Dylan back in the day, a couple of
session guys, folks who apparently never even met the guy but have
listened to his albums (hey, you and I could probably be in this
film). Only The Band's Levon Helm, who appears here, could be said
to have spent any meaningful time with him, and his observations
are none too acute.
</P>
<P>
   There's a particularly strong '60s bent to the material, where
the inspirations for even semi-obscure songs are discussed at
length, while entire albums of the '70s, '80s and '90s aren't even
mentioned. (Potentially interesting subjects, such as the
underground controversy surrounding Dylan's authorship of ``Blowin'
in the Wind,'' perhaps his most famous song, are of course
ignored.) Dylan's previously well-documented '60s rate an hour of
the documentary, while the '80s and '90s scarcely rate 15 minutes,
when those are the decades that hold the most questions _ such as
how the heck did he tumble so far, anyway? And how did he muster
enough oomph to put together one last great album, 1997's ``Time
Out of Mind?''
</P>
<P>
   Dylan never comes off as particularly friendly _ or, in archival
interviews, even as vaguely articulate _ but his misanthropy is
hardly challenged or explored beyond a sweeping nod to the
``pressures of fame.'' Interviewees mainly spend their time trying
to convince us of his greatness, which seems fairly unnecessary
given his still-substantial place in pop music history.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well, the producers do un-earth one hilariously jaw-dropping
piece of footage _ a kitschy, Vegas-style tribute to Dylan from the
'60s. And the snippets of music here should be enough to inspire
fans to dust off their Dylan CDs and give them another play. Which
can be done without, and more entertainingly than, sitting through
this perfunctory exercise in hagiography. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Reality TV'' reaches its sexual peak with ``G-String Divas,''
HBO's latest wallow in ``adult'' prurience. Produced and directed
by Patti Kaplan, the brain _ if that's the overriding organ at work
_ behind HBO's ``Real Sex,'' ``G-String Divas'' documents the lives
of strippers at a Pennsylvania ``men's'' club.
</P>
<P>
   The ``documentary'' series, which runs in 13 episodes, looks at
the lives, the souls, but mainly the anatomy _ explored in
near-clinical detail _ of women who are pneumatically enhanced,
both between their shoulders and between their ears. We're given
endless tours of this club's ``Champagne Court,'' where the women
drag johns _ er, admirers _ for lap dances that are hardly confined
to the lap. Booze is charged by the half-hour there, and it's not
cheap _ $60 _ and the dancers go for three or four times that. But
they work hard for the money.
</P>
<P>
   In two screened episodes, one of which airs tonight and the
other on Sept. 2, we meet Ginger and Chrissy, women who are both
straightforwardly honest about their work and yet guileless about
how manipulative they truly are.
</P>
<P>
   Ginger is a barracuda of a performer with a Villanova diploma
and an acute sense of what it takes to coerce a man into coughing
up some serious money into her purse. ``Give me a little present,''
she bosses Carl, the most pathetic man to grace a TV screen since
``Big Brother's'' Ian O'Malley, and certainly the most deluded _ he
discusses his relationship with Ginger by suggesting, utterly
misguidedly, love might be in the air. ``I was really appreciating
the money he was giving me and he was thinking I was taking
advantage of him,'' Ginger grouses after someone else estimates
Carl has dropped a cool $800 on her in three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissy, on the other hand, is in a lesbian relationship, which
neither adds to nor detracts from her ability to arouse her male
clientele. She even recruits another dancer to perform a lap dance
for her girlfriend, who edits a feminist newspaper, and says the
dance ``felt like a massage on my soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you get to see it? Indeed you do. But be warned: Chrissy's
gal has dumped her by that episode's end, so maybe it wasn't that
great after all.
</P>
<P>
   Of her job, Chrissy enthuses, ``It's almost like a real
office,'' as she wears nothing but a black bra and panties. She
also disingenuously insists that her clients are more interested in
just chatting in the Champagne Court than anything else _ real
therapists don't even cost that much (nor, in many cases, do
hookers), but they don't come with a bottomless glass of booze,
either _ but alas, the show doesn't devote its energies to covering
that aspect of her job as assiduously as it does the main part of
her job description.
</P>
<P>
   ``G-String Divas'' is fascinating in that train-wreck kind of
way, but here's the question: Would anyone care what these women
have to say were their observations not interspersed with footage
of their nether-regions being thrust into guys' faces? (Here's the
answer: Get serious.) If it's a shot of the women chattering while
driving their car, it's a sure sign you can feel free to zone out
momentarily.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, when the gals aren't jabbering, the show is at least
incredibly true to what it's about, with plenty of in-your-face
anatomy _ none of that endlessly tedious titillation with no
follow-through that ``Big Brother'' continues to foist upon
viewers. (And, hey, wasn't it a little creepy when ``Big Brother''
tried to squeeze a dance out of Jordan before she got bounced? As
reported, Jordan's ouster was a fait accompli as soon as she was
``marked for banishment,'' so BB clearly realized that it was now
or never in terms of eking out one last little humiliation from
America's favorite exotic dancer.)
</P>
<P>
   The women come off fairly sympathetically here, even if there
are classier jobs available. But you really have to wonder what if
anything was going on in the minds of the guys on hand here, who
allowed themselves to be depicted _ before television cameras
clearly in operation _ as abject losers who have to pay strippers
for a little female attention. What are their friends going to tell
them? _ ``No, dude, honest, you only looked kinda pathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it all feels a little manufactured to me _ it's a nice,
justice-is-served myth that these women enjoy wielding their power
over men, but for many women, it's a myth all the same. I lived
next door to a stripper back in the '80s, and it was nothing like
TV; her fingernails, for example, over which she pasted chunks of
exotic red plastic, were gnawed to their nubs.
</P>
<P>
   She would complain to me bitterly of her objectification at the
club, and how hard it was to both dance and pretend to enjoy it,
which her bosses were always on her about _ a complaint that seems

NOTHING PERSONAL
</HEADLINE>
  For Selleck, being president 
is just another role 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below. `Sunday' refers to Aug. 13, 2000.) 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (ITAL) ``Man is by nature a political animal.'' _ Aristotle(END
ITAL)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Tom Selleck is not really a political animal, but he plays one on
TV.
</P>
<P>
   Selleck stars in ``Running Mates,'' premiering Sunday on TNT, as
Democratic presidential nominee James Reynolds Pryce, who is
struggling with naming a vice president even as the Los Angeles
2000 convention is getting under way. Pryce has lived politics for
decades, coming up through Congress to the Michigan governor's
office before launching his bid for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few traits Selleck shares with this character: Both
have had to deal with the ups and downs of fame, both consider
themselves men of integrity, and both would like to make the world
a better place _ if only they could do it without politics.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early '80s, when Selleck became a household name with
his series ``Magnum P.I.'' and then publicly supported President
Reagan _ one of a relative few Hollywood celebrities to ally with
conservative figures and causes _ he has been branded a Republican
and greeted by reporters with political questions regardless of the
occasion. Then there was that ``I'm the NRA'' ad that sparked a
contentious interview with Rosie O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   But Selleck, dressed this day more like a Thousand Oaks ranch
owner than a power-tied politician, says he doesn't consider
himself politically active.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a perception (that I am). It's almost troubling because
if I really considered myself politically active, I wouldn't have
been very effective at all,'' he said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   He said when he gives interviews to promote his movies,
reporters often ask him questions about politics and he answers
them as best he can. ``But when the interview is presented, unless
it's a Q&AMP;A, the question's never there, so suddenly it goes from
the reporter's agenda to my agenda, and I don't think that's a good
message to be sending to studios. ... I'm on somebody else's
nickel. I don't think it's the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Selleck said the notion that he's a Republican is a myth. ``I'm
a registered independent, I've been a registered independent for a
decade. And in the last decade I've probably given as much money to
Democrats as Republicans, and it's usually in presidential
campaigns in the early stages where I think we actually need
debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually give to two or three people to help them get their
message out, and I give $1,000,'' he said. ``I'm not one of those
secret Hollywood people who give tons of money, so I don't get to
sleep anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in this race, Selleck says he contributed to the Bill
Bradley, John McCain and George W. Bush campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But he wouldn't use this occasion or any other before ``Running
Mates'' airs to endorse a single candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been asked by both candidates but I won't do that,''
Selleck said. ``I have an ethical obligation to promote this movie
and not make the audience's job more difficult of accepting me in
this role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, the republic's going to survive without !ital!me
getting involved,'' he said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   For someone who isn't politically active, it's easy to get
Selleck talking about politics. He criticizes newspapers that put
their editorial opinions on page one, and he praises Minnesota Gov.
Jesse Ventura _ not for his politics, but because ``his candidacy
is so American.'' Without naming names, he derides politicians who
profess to have ``the bumper-sticker solution'' to the nation's
problems and their reliance on polls to tell them what to say and
how to think.
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, don't hold your breath waiting for Selleck's name
to appear on a ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, he has been beating down rumors sparked by Maureen
Dowd's New York Times column that reported he was considering
running for the Senate. (``Let's put it this way _ she should have
just checked with me, because it had unintended consequences,'' he
said.) Selleck says he doesn't want to run for public office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why I would. Would you?'' he said. ``Admittedly I
have an edge, I guess, if I ran for office, because I'm a
celebrity, because the only insurgent candidates we get nowadays
are celebrities or rich people. They're the only ones who can
run.''
</P>
<P>
   Selleck wonders why anyone already subject to public scrutiny
would want to turn up the heat a couple of notches. ``I don't think
we're getting all the candidates we should because of what we do to
our political figures.''
</P>
<P>
   While most real-life candidates either live squeaky clean lives
or spend considerable effort trying to keep their dirty little
secrets hidden, Selleck's character, Pryce, is open about his past.
</P>
<P>
   The title ``Running Mates'' refers not to the men Pryce is
considering for his second in command but to the women who helped
him on his way to the nomination: Meg Gable (Faye Dunaway), wife of
William ``Gabe'' Gable (Robert Culp), Pryce's inside-the-beltway
mentor and a veep wannabe; Shawna Morgan (Teri Hatcher), a
Hollywood insider and fund-raiser extraordinaire who wants to be
the White House social secretary; Lauren Hartman (Laura Linney),
the brilliant campaign manager who encouraged him to run for
governor and then president; and Jenny (Nancy Travis), Pryce's
loving and politically savvy wife.
</P>
<P>
   Did I mention he had affairs with Meg, Shawna and Lauren before
he married Jenny? And that Jenny knows and doesn't care? And
neither do the media? Call it literary license.
</P>
<P>
   Another fictional element in this film, executive produced by
Albert S. Ruddy and Gerald Rafshoon, is that Pryce achieves the
nomination and appears bound for victory in November without
checking his principles at the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people get into politics for good, noble
reasons,'' Selleck said. ``I don't know who said it, about politics
being the art of compromise, and it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's compromise of policy or programs or political
solutions. It can't be compromise about ethics and standards.''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, Pryce is on the brink of selling out to fatcat
special interests because they are offering $100 million in ``soft
money,'' the type of contribution that has no legal ceiling because
it is given to parties or causes, although it usually trickles down
to candidates anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's at the point,'' says Selleck about his candidate, ``where
he's come so far, he's so close that the human thing to do is say,
'My intentions are so good, I want to do such good things. I can
get there if I just put my standards and ethics on hold for a while
and then when I get there I'll be good again.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think that is the fatal compromise, the one that
politicians shouldn't make and all too often probably do make,'' he
said. ``They judge themselves by their good intentions and forget
that they'll be judged by their last worst act.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafshoon, a TV movie and miniseries producer who created
then-Gov. Jimmy Carter's 1976 advertising campaign and later served
as Carter's White House communications director, lent his
Washington experience to the project. He brought the campaign
finance reform theme to the script and saw to such details as
making sure Selleck's entire wardrobe was American-made.
</P>
<P>
   He screened ``Running Mates'' last month in Washington for
government and political insiders, including McCain. Rafshoon said
Selleck's performance inspired wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``After it was over I heard people saying, 'If only,''' Rafshoon
said, as they discussed the idea of a Selleck candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   But when he isn't shooting movies, Selleck prefers to busy
himself with nonpartisan efforts, such as his role on a journalism
ethics board and the Character Counts Coalition, which he
co-founded with Barbara Jordan and Michael Josephson, aimed at
encouraging ethics, responsibility and fairness among young people.
That's as close to politics as he wants to tread.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's intimidating to play the president. I'm not so sure it's
not intimidating to run for president,'' Selleck said. ``You've got
to pretend you're the guy, but come on. You go home at night if
you're running for president and say, 'Am I enough? This is crazy.
Would I vote for me? And if they knew how anxious I was about that,
would anybody vote for me?'''
</P>
<P>
   Rafshoon, a loyal Democrat, said he would support a Selleck
campaign _ if the actor ever changes his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he runs as an independent, yes. I've never voted for a
Republican,'' Rafshoon said. ``Would I vote for Tom? Yeah, he gets
my vote. On the issue of character and authenticity, he gets my
vote.'' &QL;

NOT `DEMENTED' ENOUGH FOR WATERS

Our rating: 2 stars

<P>
   Another good John Waters idea in search of a decent script and
direction, ``Cecil B. Demented'' presents a manifesto for
unfettered personal filmmaking. I suppose the joke is that this
very personal Waters production, like the guerrilla cineastes it
depicts, displays a laughable lack of craftsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   As with most of the Baltimore satirist's pictures, ``C.B.''
revels in ``outrageous'' prankishness that is actually pretty pale
in comparison to his '70s trash masterpieces ``Pink Flamingos,''
``Female Trouble'' and ``Desperate Living.'' It's also a
celebration of campy bad acting, which too is a yawn. The one
glorious exception to that here is Melanie Griffith, who almost
redeems the whole, tossed-off mess with one of her sharpest comic
performances in years.
</P>
<P>
   She plays Honey Whitlock, a shrewish Hollywood actress who
visits the City of Crabs for the charity premiere of her latest
commercial monstrosity. The event is hijacked by the self-styled
C.B. (Stephen Dorff) and his merry band of movie-loving terrorists,
The Sprocket Holes. A mixed bag of satanists, mama's boys, ex-porn
stars and sexually confused marginals, the Holes have all tattooed
auteurs' names on themselves and taken vows of celibacy to cinema _
at least until they finish shooting the movie C.B. forces the
kidnapped Honey to star in.
</P>
<P>
   As you might imagine, these kids don't have a very easy time
managing some substantial pent-up rage. The violent
verite-within-the-film recounts a series of raids on multiplexes
and runaway production locations (for the Baltimore-set ``Gump
Again,'' Forrest tells his bus bench neighbor that life is like a
crab cake) where Hollywood pablum dominates. ``We are the ultimate
bad review!'' the zealots cry before opening fire. The best bit is
when art-hating family film advocates respond so angrily to their
provocations that the Holes must run for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, of course, Honey comes around to the logic of C.B.'s
poison love for good cinema, and her performances in the raid
footage grows correspondingly more heartfelt. Any similarities to
the Patty Hearst nightmare are entirely intentional; a Waters
favorite, the kidnaped heiress turned brainwashed revolutionary has
a small role here as an uncomprehending mother.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to report that a similar Stockholm Syndrome
effect takes hold when you're trapped in a theater with ``Cecil B.
Demented.'' But whenever Waters starts to bring us around to an
acute appreciation of his disdain for mainstream movies, he
undermines the effect with stupid sexual humor, uninspired sight
gags or excessive actor whining. What could have been a bracing
attack on everything that's wrong with our current film culture, or
at least a funny spoof of directorial megalomania as a
cult-building phenomenon, ends up childishly underdeveloped.
</P>
<P>
   A little more fully grown, full-blown dementia wouldn't have
hurt. &QL;

ONE LONG CLICHE

<P>
   ``The Replacements'' tries to set some kind of record for
regurgitating sports movie cliches faster than any film that's run
before. Basically ``Major League'' for football, this formulaic
comedy is quick enough to recycle the grossest joke from the last
gridiron film, ``Any Given Sunday,'' the one about throwing up on
the field in the middle of the big game.
</P>
<P>
   But that's about as swift as ``The Replacements'' gets.
</P>
<P>
   In this one, a faux NFL goes on strike late in the season, just
as the Washington Sentinels are nearing a long-withheld shot at a
playoff berth. The team's sneaky owner (Jack Warden) hires coach
Jimmy McGinty (Gene Hackman), whose stellar career was cut short by
``that Dallas mess,'' to put together a winning scab team. In a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy's first hire is Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), an exceptional
college quarterback whose pro chances were cut short by that
``Sugar Bowl choke'' nobody ever seems to forget. A contingent of
lovably eccentric losers suits up in his wake. There's a receiver
who can't catch (Orlando Jones), a psychopathic SWAT cop (Jon
Favreau), assorted racial caricatures that include gun-totin' twin
bodyguards and a sumo wrestler and, just to make for a complete
entertainment experience, a deaf guy.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, the cheerleaders strike along with the
athletes, probably so there can be funny/degrading auditions for
new pep squad members. This also provides an excuse for hiring
dancers from a local strip club, whose distinctive routines
director Howard Deutch is so evidently fond of he cuts in more and
more shots of them as the film wears on.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Brooke Langton's nice gal cheer choreographer
provides love interest and moral support for the uncertain Reeves
character. And he needs all of the latter he can get, even though
there's no doubt from the kickoff that he'll lead his screwballs to
self-esteem and glory. Outside of these prescribed calculations,
there are some mildly interesting observations on the prima donna
natures of overpaid professional athletes. Then again, that's
probably just smoke for the movie's real, union-bashing agenda.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, it's become almost as tedious to note that Reeves
gives a passable performance (the onetime ``Whoa!'' dude has been
doing that for years) as it is to mention that Hackman once again
walks through another paycheck (which the sporadically great actor
has been doing for decades now). But we'll acknowledge, for the
record, that that's what both stars do. Everyone else inhabits
stereotypes like the animated cutout writer Vince McKewin imagined.
</P>
<P>
   John Madden and Pat Summerall appear as themselves in an attempt
to reinforce the illusion that real football is being played. Their
efforts are undermined by the uncharacteristically inept
cinematography of Tak Fujimoto (``The Sixth Sense,'' ``The Silence
of the Lambs'') which, somewhat due to the film's lapdance editing,
demonstrates little understanding of how the game actually works.
</P>
<P>
   What is certainly understood here, however, is the mechanics of
superficial sport comedy uplift. This probably earns points in some
studio playbook, if not on the screen where it counts. &QL;

``The Opportunists'' is a modest, slice-of-life film that tries,
seemingly against its will, to turn into a caper yarn, with a
standard-issue reformed crook dragged, also against his will, back
for one last heist.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christopher Walken does a fair approximation of an average guy _
well, there is a scene or two in which a line reading recalls the
nut cases he's built his career essaying _ playing Victor Kelly, a
former safecracker with a heart of gold. Now, he's a
none-too-talented auto mechanic with a mountain of debt and a
bar-owning girlfriend (former pop novelty Cyndi Lauper, who's OK
except she always needs to do something with her hands) who wants
to lend him money and keep him on the straight and narrow.
</P>
<P>
   Well, of course it's not that easy. In drifts Michael Lawler
(Peter McDonald), an Irish scam artist who claims familial roots
while at the same time hitting on Vic's daughter (Vera Farmiga,
oozing casual charm). He convinces Vic to organize a no-brainer
boost of a vault, which, of course, doesn't go as planned.
</P>
<P>
   Connell, however, is too fond of his characters to truly dump on
them, which in truth makes for some pretty listless drama.
Likewise, he pads the movie with a lot of protracted establishing
shots and scenes of characters just walking, walking. And for all
the footage he uses in an airport, you'd think something would
actually transpire there, but no _ it just looks like he couldn't
believe his good luck to shoot in an airport on such a tight
budget. And Kurt Hoffman's music may be the most blandly obscure
score in years _ the music evokes nothing emotionally in the scenes
over which it plays, it just takes up space on the sound track.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing about ``The Opportunists'' that's poorly
rendered, it's just that, try as Walken and Connell may _ and
perhaps they try too off- handedly _ they can't generate much
empathy for Vic's plight. It makes low-key movies seem
over-caffeinated. &QL;

&HT;     HILLARY CLINTON HAS TWO HATS AT DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL and JUDY HOLLAND  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hillary Rodham Clinton will be a quick-change
artist during her four days at the Democratic National Convention,
switching roles from first lady to Senate candidate and back again
starting Friday.
</P>
<P>
   One sign that her overlapping duties are interchangeable is that
the 15-minute, prime-time televised address she will deliver to
4,370 delegates and 610 alternates Monday night is being crafted by
speech writers from both the White House and aides in her campaign
for the U.S. Senate from New York.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of Clinton's schedule in Los Angeles, both as first
lady and as a Senate candidate, is devoted to appearances that are
either fund-raisers or events designed to reward past Democratic
donors.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party spokesman Rick Hess said Thursday that donors
and activists alike are eager to see the 52-year-old
first-lady-turned-Senate-candidate who could keep the Clinton name
in the limelight beyond the eight years of her husband's
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first lady has been a very strong supporter of the party
and a tremendous draw among our core supporters because of her
stand on issues that are important to women,'' Hess said. ``She is
a Senate candidate from New York, but she is also a great source of
inspiration and enthusiasm for Democrats from around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Erika Batcheller, a spokeswoman in the first lady's White House
office, said the crowded schedule of official events involving the
first lady and campaign events featuring the Senate candidate was
still evolving and that some events will probably be added.
</P>
<P>
   Under Federal Election Commission regulations, Clinton's
expenses at official events, where she appears as first lady, will
be paid by the taxpayers. Her expenses as a New York Senate
candidate will be paid by her campaign, which had $6.9 million on
hand on June 30 after spending $11.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive
Politics, which tracks campaign spending, said Clinton's mingling
with campaign contributors is crucial to making donors ``feel
special'' so they will contribute during the height of the Senate
campaign this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to roll out the red carpet and give donors a real big
ego boost,'' Makinson said. ``It's a pep rally. You want them to
dig deeper in their pockets then they already have.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's entertainment industry is ``one of the deepest wells
of Democratic money in the nation,'' Makinson said.
</P>
<P>
   David DiMartino, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee that has already funneled nearly $3 million to
Clinton's Senate campaign, says her prominence helps her
fund-raising: ``Prominent people do well at fund-raising.''
</P>
<P>
   Hess said Democratic donors who have given from $1,000 to
$100,000 are being invited to a variety of events, including some
featuring the Clintons, as a way to ``thank people who have been
very supportive in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Laying the groundwork for future contributions will be crucial
to Clinton, the first wife of a president to seek elective office
from the White House. She is locked in a tight battle with Rep.
Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., to fill the Senate seat of retiring Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The latest statewide poll, conducted by Quinnipiac College and
released on Wednesday shows Clinton leading Lazio 46 percent to 43
percent. The survey had a margin of error of 2.8 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is taking a far more prominent role at the Democratic
convention than Lazio did at the Republican National Convention in
Philadelphia last week. He declined an invitation to give a
two-minute address to convention delegates that was offered to two
dozen other GOP House and Senate candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio attended the four-day conclave for a single day, saying,
``I'm not running for national office; I'm running for senator from
New York.'' The comment was an elliptical reference to Republicans'
claims that Hillary Clinton may one day try to parlay a New York
Senate seat into a presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Sferrazza Anthony, author of a two-volume series: ``First
Ladies: The Saga of the Presidents' Wives and their Power
1789-1991,'' said Clinton has been handling multiple roles for
years, ranging from the social duties of traditional first ladies
to the tasks of developing policy and legislation.
</P>
<P>
   She worked on legislation that streamlined adoptions, won
greater federal funding for asthma, prostate cancer, breast cancer
and epilepsy and persuaded large businesses to offer day care,
Anthony said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not just some poster girl just getting up there and
smiling,'' he added. She has ``been working with senators from both
sides of the aisle.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who travels as first lady to Los Angeles with President
Clinton aboard Air Force One on Friday, will appear on the Jay Leno
Tonight Show as a political candidate that evening.
</P>
<P>
   She will also take part as a candidate in a celebrity-packed
salute to the president at a private estate Saturday night that is
designed to raise $4 million from 1,400 invited guests for her New
York Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering, hosted by Stan Lee, a comic book tycoon who
created Spider-Man, will also include singers such as Patti
LaBelle, Michael Bolton, Toni Braxton, Cher, Stevie Wonder and
Luther Vandross. Tributes to the president will be delivered by
actors such as Michael Douglas, Whoopi Goldberg and John Travolta.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday Hillary Clinton will resume her role as first lady to
attend a fund-raiser hosted by Barbra Streisand at her Malibu
compound that is intended to raise $10 million for her husband's
presidential library in Little Rock, Ark. Later on Sunday, Clinton
will change to her role as candidate to attend a welcome party for
the New York delegation to the convention, before dropping by at a
similar affair for Arkansas Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, she will start off as a candidate attending a
breakfast with the New York delegation, switch to first lady to
attend a luncheon salute to women in Congress honoring Rep. Nita
Lowey, D-N.Y.; and take up both roles to address the Democratic
convention.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, who spoke to convention Democrats in 1996 as
part of her husband's successful re-election campaign, will
introduce a videotaped tribute to the president that will precede
his swan song at the current convention.
</P>
<P>
   The couple will then attend a tribute to the president hosted by
Calif. Gov. Gray Davis at Paramount Studios.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady and the president are scheduled to leave the
Democratic convention on Tuesday morning, leaving the spotlight
clear for Vice President Al Gore's presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons will rendezvous with Gore and his running mate,
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., at a passing-of-the-torch rally in
Michigan, en route back to the White House.

AS COMMISSIONS SHRINK, TRAVEL AGENCIES SEEK NEW NICHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, August 13)  
 By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sharon S. Turnau, president of Landmark Travel in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., knows what it means to be flexible.
</P>
<P>
   She once had to arrange five deliveries of airline tickets in
one hour to a law firm whose flight itinerary kept changing.
Another time, she had to have a lawyer literally pulled off a
plane; the lawyer's deposition was in Columbus but her secretary
had mistakenly sent her to Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she got off to change planes, the airline caught her and
directed her to Columbus; she arrived on time for her deposition,''
Turnau said.
</P>
<P>
   Turnau, of course, is used to handling fluctuating plans and
misdirected passengers. It comes with the turf as a specialty
travel agent.
</P>
<P>
   Landmark Travel, whose clients include about 20 law firms, is
one of a small group of agencies across the country that cater to
specific industries and their varying demands. There are agencies
that assist dance companies, whose performers require special hotel
amenities, as well as agencies that cater to fashion and publishing
executives who want only the most stylish accommodations. Someone
has to help arrange transportation for the circus clowns and their
animal sidekicks.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman Entertainment Travel of Burbank, Calif., a division of
McCord Travel Management, works with the entertainment industry,
including production companies and film studios, while Valerie
Wilson Travel Inc. of New York handles the fashion, publishing,
financial and pharmaceutical industries. The World Travel
Specialists Group, also in New York, makes arrangements for
lawyers, bankers, consultants, advertising agencies and, most
recently, dot-com companies that prefer face-to-face service to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Even individual agents are specializing: Marjorie Agriss, with
Pisa Brothers Travel Services in New York, once worked as a travel
agent for Broadway producers and now arranges trips for the Alvin
Ailey American Dance Theater, the American Ballet Theater and the
Big Apple Circus.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for specialty services has been rising, analysts say,
because the travel industry is consolidating and because many of
the larger agencies, and even some smaller ones, have become
reluctant to pursue clients who may be more demanding and thus more
time consuming and less profitable to handle. At the same time,
some smaller independent agencies see specialization as a way to
survive in the wake of commission cuts that have been made by
airlines in recent years. (Today, commissions start at 5 percent of
the value of a ticket, and are also capped at $50 a round-trip
domestic ticket and $100 a roundtrip international ticket.)
</P>
<P>
   ``These agencies are looking for customers who are less
price-sensitive, who can pay them greater fees,'' said Robert Moss,
a travel industry consultant in Belmont, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The specialized agencies may bill for each transaction _ usually
a minimum of $20 an airline ticket _ or charge a management fee
that is generally 2 percent to 3.5 percent of their clients' travel
expenditures. Some, like World Travel Specialists Group and Hoffman
Entertainment, will even place agents in clients' offices.
</P>
<P>
   Clients say they do not mind paying these fees as long as the
agency delivers, which means that it must understand their needs
and provide around-the-clock hand-holding as well as discounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``One advantage of working with an agency like WTSG is that
their leverage in the travel business helps start-ups like
ourselves that don't have the volume or the experience to get some
discounts on our own,'' said Chuck Curtis, director of human
resources for Need2Buy.com, a business-to-business online marketer
based in Westlake, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Moskowitz, president and chief operating officer of the
World Travel Specialists Group, says his company saves its clients
an average of 23 percent of their total travel costs off published
prices. Valerie Wilson, chairwoman of the agency that bears her
name, says her clients save 20 percent, on average, of airlines'
and hotels' published rates.
</P>
<P>
   Travel discounts can sometimes make or break a season for a
performing arts company, Agriss said. ``One of the main things I do
is to contact airlines for rates that make trips affordable,
because I have clients, particularly nonprofits, who say that if I
can't get the rates down, their tour won't happen,'' she said.
``They rely on me.''
</P>
<P>
   She recently negotiated a $135 one-way fare for a group of Alvin
Ailey dancers for a noon flight on American Airlines from Austin,
Texas, to New York; the unrestricted one-way fare on that route is
around $800, Agriss said.
</P>
<P>
   Agencies also help clients with their travel-management
policies, establishing rules about who can fly first class, for
example, or which expenses are reimbursable.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Baxter, senior vice president and chief financial officer
of Odyssey Network in Studio City, Calif., a subsidiary of the
pay-television company Crown Media Holdings, relies on Hoffman
Entertainment for help in revising his company's travel policy in
order to get cheaper fares. ``Half our travel is between Los
Angeles and New York, and if we fly the wrong airline or go to the
wrong airport, it kills us,'' Baxter said. ``So we modify our
policy six or eight times a year to get savings.''
</P>
<P>
   For many specialty agents, change is constant. Jim Hagy, a
partner in the Chicago law office of Jones Day Reavis &AMP; Pogue, a
client of the World Travel Specialists Group, estimates that his
colleagues change their travel plans three times, on average,
either before their departure or while traveling.
</P>
<P>
   Having to extend a business trip recently in Milan, John R.
Wilson, president of Vestimenta Inc., an apparel distributor in New
York, asked Valerie Wilson Travel to rebook his airline ticket and
extend his stay at the Hotel Principe di Savoia. ``During the
fashion shows, Milan is absolutely a zoo,'' Wilson said. ``But the
agency got me onto a later flight, and I didn't have to move out of
my hotel, even though it was overbooked.''
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Wilson must find hotels that match the tastes of her
fashion and publishing clients. ``In Milan, for example, the more
conservative fashion houses want to be at the Principe di Savoia,''
she said, ``while the trendier ones want to stay at the Four
Seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Performing Arts companies pose their own challenges. Many
dancers belong to unions, whose rules may regulate the number of
hours and times of day that they can travel. They also travel in
large groups that also include musicians and production and
administrative staff. (The traveling American Ballet Theater has
about 125 people, each of whom usually has at least two pieces of
luggage.)
</P>
<P>
   The demands continue at the destination. Calvin Hunt, general
manager of the first company of the Alvin Ailey American Dance
Theater, which travels 25 weeks a year, says his dancers' primary
requirements are a bathtub, ``to soak their tired muscles''; room
service, ``because they sleep late during the day and come home
late at night''; and a swimming pool, where they can cross-train.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finding hotels with these services that are also in close
proximity to the theater where we're performing and that are not
five-star is difficult,'' Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
   In her work with the Big Apple Circus last year, she had to find
a way to transport 17 dogs from Russia, accompanied by their
trainer, by plane from Moscow to New York. That involved making
special arrangements with Aeroflot, in addition to obtaining health
certificates for the dogs. Some things were simply beyond her
control, she said. ``The customs guy was ready to check the dogs
off when they got off the plane, but when they arrived, there were
21 of them. One had had four puppies on the flight,'' she said.
``He let them all in.''

NASA PLANS A DOUBLE MISSION TO MARS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wanting to make the most of an especially favorable launching
opportunity, NASA officials have decided to send not one but two
large roving vehicles to the surface of Mars on separate missions.
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials said Thursday that they were confident that the
spacecraft and roving vehicles could be built and tested in time
for launchings in 2003 _ on May 22 and June 4. The landings on Mars
are scheduled for 2004 _ on Jan. 2 and Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the decision, Dr. Edward J. Weiler, NASA's
associate administrator for space science, said the agency would
not require an increase in its budget to pay the estimated $200
million for the additional landing mission. The White House is
reported to have approved the expanded Mars effort on the condition
that the money comes from other National Aeronautics and Space
Administration programs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Weiler denied rumors that a mission to Pluto, now in the
early stages of planning, had been sacrificed. Pluto is the only
planet in the solar system that has yet to be studied up close by a
visiting spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope this won't cause cancellation of any programs in other
parts of NASA,'' Dr. Weiler said at a news conference at NASA
headquarters in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Space officials said the cost for the two missions would
probably not exceed $600 million, which they said fell within the
price range of the agency's much-heralded ``faster, better,
cheaper'' policy for flight projects. The plans, they said,
included extra money to support more rigorous testing ordered after
two Mars spacecraft failed last year.
</P>
<P>
   The orbits of Earth and Mars are such that favorable flight
opportunities occur once every 25 months. And some are better than
others, when it requires less rocket energy to make the journey.
Dr. Weiler noted that the 2003-2004 ``launch window'' would be the
last especially favorable opportunity for another six years.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, when the decision to send one rover to Mars was
announced, officials said they were studying the scheduling and
budget implications of going for two landings. Scott Hubbard,
NASA's Mars program director, who recommended the expanded mission,
said Thursday, ``This is a chance to double our science, and do it
for far less than twice the cost.''
</P>
<P>
   The rovers will be identical 300-pound wheeled robots designed
to travel more than 300 feet each day over the Martian surface,
taking close-up pictures and analyzing rocks.
</P>
<P>
   The exact landing sites do not have to be chosen until launching
time, and can be changed slightly while the spacecraft are on their
way to Mars. Scientists said they were looking at shallow basins,
some 60 miles or more in diameter, where surface water may have
collected in the past and left chemical fingerprints. The search
for evidence of Martian water, past or present, is the main
scientific objective of current exploration of the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Weiler said that with two spacecraft, it may be possible to
send one to a relatively smooth and safe landing place, then send
the second to a somewhat riskier but scientifically enticing site.
</P>
<P>
   Excited by the assignment to develop the science instruments for
the rovers, Dr. Steven Squyres, a planetary geologist at Cornell
University, said, ``This mission will be humanity's first great
voyage of exploration of this new millennium.'' &QL;

(Eds: Corrects slugline from `Slug' to G-String.') 
(Eds: Fact box below. `Tonight' refers to Sat., Aug. 12.) 
Our rating: 2 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Reality TV'' reaches its sexual peak with ``G-String Divas,''
HBO's latest wallow in ``adult'' prurience. Produced and directed
by Patti Kaplan, the brain _ if that's the overriding organ at work
_ behind HBO's ``Real Sex,'' ``G-String Divas'' documents the lives
of strippers at a Pennsylvania ``men's'' club.
</P>
<P>
   The ``documentary'' series, which runs in 13 episodes, looks at
the lives, the souls, but mainly the anatomy _ explored in
near-clinical detail _ of women who are pneumatically enhanced,
both between their shoulders and between their ears. We're given
endless tours of this club's ``Champagne Court,'' where the women
drag johns _ er, admirers _ for lap dances that are hardly confined
to the lap. Booze is charged by the half-hour there, and it's not
cheap _ $60 _ and the dancers go for three or four times that. But
they work hard for the money.
</P>
<P>
   In two screened episodes, one of which airs tonight and the
other on Sept. 2, we meet Ginger and Chrissy, women who are both
straightforwardly honest about their work and yet guileless about
how manipulative they truly are.
</P>
<P>
   Ginger is a barracuda of a performer with a Villanova diploma
and an acute sense of what it takes to coerce a man into coughing
up some serious money into her purse. ``Give me a little present,''
she bosses Carl, the most pathetic man to grace a TV screen since
``Big Brother's'' Ian O'Malley, and certainly the most deluded _ he
discusses his relationship with Ginger by suggesting, utterly
misguidedly, love might be in the air. ``I was really appreciating
the money he was giving me and he was thinking I was taking
advantage of him,'' Ginger grouses after someone else estimates
Carl has dropped a cool $800 on her in three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissy, on the other hand, is in a lesbian relationship, which
neither adds to nor detracts from her ability to arouse her male
clientele. She even recruits another dancer to perform a lap dance
for her girlfriend, who edits a feminist newspaper, and says the
dance ``felt like a massage on my soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you get to see it? Indeed you do. But be warned: Chrissy's
gal has dumped her by that episode's end, so maybe it wasn't that
great after all.
</P>
<P>
   Of her job, Chrissy enthuses, ``It's almost like a real
office,'' as she wears nothing but a black bra and panties. She
also disingenuously insists that her clients are more interested in
just chatting in the Champagne Court than anything else _ real
therapists don't even cost that much (nor, in many cases, do
hookers), but they don't come with a bottomless glass of booze,
either _ but alas, the show doesn't devote its energies to covering
that aspect of her job as assiduously as it does the main part of
her job description.
</P>
<P>
   ``G-String Divas'' is fascinating in that train-wreck kind of
way, but here's the question: Would anyone care what these women
have to say were their observations not interspersed with footage
of their nether-regions being thrust into guys' faces? (Here's the
answer: Get serious.) If it's a shot of the women chattering while
driving their car, it's a sure sign you can feel free to zone out
momentarily.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, when the gals aren't jabbering, the show is at least
incredibly true to what it's about, with plenty of in-your-face
anatomy _ none of that endlessly tedious titillation with no
follow-through that ``Big Brother'' continues to foist upon
viewers. (And, hey, wasn't it a little creepy when ``Big Brother''
tried to squeeze a dance out of Jordan before she got bounced? As
reported, Jordan's ouster was a fait accompli as soon as she was
``marked for banishment,'' so BB clearly realized that it was now
or never in terms of eking out one last little humiliation from
America's favorite exotic dancer.)
</P>
<P>
   The women come off fairly sympathetically here, even if there
are classier jobs available. But you really have to wonder what if
anything was going on in the minds of the guys on hand here, who
allowed themselves to be depicted _ before television cameras
clearly in operation _ as abject losers who have to pay strippers
for a little female attention. What are their friends going to tell
them? _ ``No, dude, honest, you only looked kinda pathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it all feels a little manufactured to me _ it's a nice,
justice-is-served myth that these women enjoy wielding their power
over men, but for many women, it's a myth all the same. I lived
next door to a stripper back in the '80s, and it was nothing like
TV; her fingernails, for example, over which she pasted chunks of
exotic red plastic, were gnawed to their nubs.
</P>
<P>
   She would complain to me bitterly of her objectification at the
club, and how hard it was to both dance and pretend to enjoy it,
which her bosses were always on her about _ a complaint that seems
to bother none of the women on this series a whit. She groused in
particular that the married club owner had given her roommate _
whom, by the way, he was dating _ the cushy and, relatively
speaking, far more lucrative and far less immodest job of waitress.
</P>
<P>
   This melodrama went on for a few weeks; her roomie even drove
their boss's Porsche home until his wife found out and the waitress
rebelled against his dumping her. Then, the next morning, the
neighborhood awoke to find said Porsche uselessly up on blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Show me a scene like that on ``G-String Divas'' and I'll start
believing.
</P>

   WASHINGTON _ It was 40 years ago that the Democrats last
convened in Los Angeles to pick a presidential nominee, as they are
about to do again next week.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates nervously chose the young, untested Sen. John F.
Kennedy on the first ballot after a great deal of backroom wheeling
and dealing.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a controversial, last-minute move, Kennedy defied his
major advisers and the expectations of party pros to select as his
running mate his strongest rival for the nomination, Senate
Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson. Liberal northern Democrats were
furious, but Johnson's presence carried Texas for the ticket and
won the election.
</P>
<P>
   It was all very exciting. My generation was elbowing past the
Old Guard and moving closer to power.
</P>
<P>
   Today the current baby boomers rule, but so much else is
different in the way conventions operate and in the social and
economic priorities of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, much of America was racially segregated and women were
relegated to secondary roles. Television, not yet the dominant
media, reached only 56 million households. Kennedy campaigned
during the primaries in a small propeller-driven plane, dubbed the
``Caroline'' after his daughter. The nation's population was
roughly 180 million, compared with the current estimate of 270
million.
</P>
<P>
   But the world was beginning to change from a post-war culture to
a modern, complex society. Americans were preparing to explore
outer space. Atomic missiles were pointed at American cities. The
Cold War colored everything. The Soviets shot down a U.S. military
plane the day the convention opened. New technology, in the form of
a sophisticated convention communications system, had suddenly
appeared.
</P>
<P>
   I remember the 1960 convention well. I was a junior reporter
covering Washington for the Hearst Newspapers. The convention was
my first exposure to the high-pressure tactics and tensions of
nominating a president.
</P>
<P>
   Since his assassination, Kennedy has become the stuff of popular
legend. But in sweltering Los Angeles that steamy July he was just
a 43-year-old Massachusetts senator widely considered an
indifferent legislator who had used daddy Joseph Kennedy's vast
wealth and powerful connections to buy his way to power.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, he was a Catholic, and in that unenlightened era
conservatives feared he would dig a tunnel from the White House to
the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   But he had managed to overcome his opponents in the primaries
and the closed-door conclaves where power was dispensed. He had
youth, vigor and personality, backed up by the ruthless campaign
advisers. He had what it takes.
</P>
<P>
   When Kennedy arrived at the convention, he was not sure of the
nomination. But he was so close that most of the holdout bosses who
resented the newcomer capitulated one by one rather than be left
out in the cold.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of frustrated liberals marched around the Los Angeles
Sports Arena chanting for Adlai Stevenson, the eloquent two-time
loser they called ``the thinking man's candidate.'' But their
voices were lost inside the convention hall, where Adlai was
nominated in a wave of emotion but received only 79 1/2 votes.
</P>
<P>
   As befitting my junior status, I mostly covered the vice
presidential losers. Parked outside the suite of Sen. Stuart
Symington of Missouri, I was among the first to learn that he got
the wrong call from Kennedy: Sorry, it's Lyndon. I saw Sen. Henry
(Scoop) Jackson of Washington state, looking sour, burst out of
Kennedy's room to announce he had been passed over because he was
``too young and good-looking.'' (Honest, that's really the tactless
thing he said.)
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy campaign had its headquarters in a cottage beside
the arena with big windows through which a handful of reporters and
staffers watched the action inside. Although Kennedy had promised
his party new thinking and a fresh start, when he arrived in
triumph at the cottage after the nomination, he was immediately
greeted by an invited lineup of familiar party bosses. A famous
Washington columnist had pronounced the bosses ``dead'' with
Kennedy's takeover of the party.
</P>
<P>
   But we watched them dutifully take turns shaking his hand,
pledging allegiance to their new leader _ Govs. David Lawrence of
Pennsylvania and Mike DiSalle of Ohio, Mayor Richard Daley of
Chicago, Sen. Abraham Ribicoff of Connecticut, Gov. G. Mennen
Williams of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   This revolution was to be more symbolic than substantive after
all. Even though the nominee was not really a party insider, he saw
the practical wisdom of relying on those who were.
</P>
<P>
   In his acceptance speech, Kennedy projected youthful idealism,
pledging to get the country moving again, promising a liberal
social agenda and tough Cold War initiatives. Caught up in the
excitement and too inexperienced to be cynical, I wrote an
enthusiastic story.
</P>
<P>
   Later, I learned that Vice President Richard Nixon, watching the
speech on television, thought Kennedy seemed tired and unsure of
himself. That impression deluded Nixon into thinking he could
easily beat Kennedy in the general election. It was a fatal
miscalculation.

JAPANESE LEADERS FOCUS ON POSSIBLE INTEREST RATE INCREASE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKI TANIKAWA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Bank of Japan's impending decision on whether to
raise interest rates for the first time in 10 years theoretically
is a matter of economic judgment based on facts and data. Instead,
it has become a contentious political issue, pitting the central
bank governor against an alliance of other high-ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank was due to announce the bank's rate policy on
Friday after its policy board meeting. But the stated eagerness of
the central bank governor, Masaru Hayami, to end the bank's policy
of keeping rates at near zero, where they have been for 18 months,
has incited widespread disapproval among the country's leading
politicians, who are jittery about any policy measure that might
cause Japan's economic recovery to stall.
</P>
<P>
   This week, at a meeting of economic ministers attended by
Hayami, most participants expressed uneasiness over Hayami's desire
to raise rates, Japanese news accounts of the meeting said.
</P>
<P>
   Other leading politicians including Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori
called any rate increase premature.
</P>
<P>
   While it is not unusual for politicians to apply pressure to the
central bank in Japan, the pressure has become more significant now
because Hayami has repeatedly said interest rates must eventually
rise, and his credibility is at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the law governing the Bank of Japan was revised a few
years ago to ensure it had a higher level of independence from the
government. So the stepped up effort by politicians to thwart
Hayami's move is proving to be a test case of whether the central
bank has the autonomy that the law says it does.
</P>
<P>
   If the bank's nine-member policy board approves a rate increase,
the benchmark overnight loan rate will most likely rise from near
zero to 0.25 percent, analysts said. That would be the first
increase in interest rates since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   There has been an extensive debate for years over whether the
Bank of Japan's low interest rate policy has been helping the
economy overcome its worst period of weakness since the end of
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the cost of borrowing at near zero is aimed at making it
easier for Japan's highly indebted banks and businesses to repay
loans and to stimulate new borrowing for economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   But many Japanese corporations, particularly those that borrowed
heavily during Japan's boom years in the 1980s, remain heavily
indebted, and there is fear that a rise in rates could push some
into bankruptcy, setting off a chain of other insolvencies and
business failures.
</P>
<P>
   When the Sogo Co., a department store operator little known
outside of Japan, collapsed last month under $17 billion in debt,
the reverberations rattled Japan's financial markets and helped
persuade the Bank of Japan to delay an interest rate increase.

MODERATE DRINKING MOVEMENT ROCKED BY VEHICULAR HOMICIDE ARREST OF
FOUNDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CANDACE HECKMAN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELLENSBURG, Wash. _ For years, Audrey Kishline thought she and
other recovering alcoholics could learn to drink responsibly.
</P>
<P>
   Her belief was so strong that she helped found a nationwide
movement called Moderation Management, and became the movement's
marquis speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the Woodinville, Wash., woman will be sentenced on two
counts of vehicular homicide _ deaths resulting from her drunken
driving.
</P>
<P>
   Four months ago, the 43-year-old alcoholic drove down the wrong
side of Interstate 90 near Cle Elum, Wash., plowing through traffic
and crashing her pickup head-on into a car driven by Richard
``Danny'' Davis, 38, of Yakima County. In the car with Davsi was
his daughter LaSchell, 12. Both were killed.
</P>
<P>
   More than an hour later, doctors found that Kishline had three
times the legal limit of alcohol in her bloodstream. She was headed
for Spokane, though she still cannot say why.
</P>
<P>
   Detractors of the Moderation Management movement immediately
began to criticize Kishline for what they called her moral failure
_ and for duping alcoholics into thinking they could drink again.
For decades, Alcoholics Anonymous and other organizations have said
only total abstinence would do.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as their founder prepares to enter prison, Moderation
Management followers are keeping the movement alive. While
suffering the tragedy of Kishline's relapse, they say they continue
to believe in her. In fact, they say they respect her for pleading
guilty to her crimes, and note that accepting responsibility for
their own actions is the first rule of their organization.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth rule is never to drink before driving.
</P>
<P>
   Moderation Management, commonly called MM, was ushered into the
mainstream media five years ago as ``a common sense'' solution to
heavy drinking.
</P>
<P>
   With individual meetings in 15 states, the organization is
spreading quickly through support groups on the Internet. There are
no reliable membership numbers, however.
</P>
<P>
   Kishline declined comment for this story, citing an agreement
between prosecutors and the Davis family aimed at preventing her
from capturing media attention. But in the past, the housewife and
mother of two has described herself as a recovering alcoholic who
rebelled against that label.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional 12-step treatment programs such as AA are based on
the belief that alcoholism is a disease that cannot be cured _ and
that once someone becomes an alcoholic, they will always be an
alcoholic even if they never again drink.
</P>
<P>
   That stigma, Kishline reasoned, becomes an enormous weight and
deterrent for people to seek help. Kishline in 1994 wrote that
after undergoing abstinence-based treatment, she was disgraced and
demoralized, and was compelled to return to alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   She describes discovering that she could teach herself to drink
moderately _ not chronically as alcoholics do.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 20 years ago, researchers and noted psychologists
were proposing moderation as a healthy habit. Kishline, who has no
formal training in the field, took the work of these people and
wrote it into a self-help format without the medical jargon.
</P>
<P>
   Though her ideas were not original, media attention to her book
made her the spokeswoman for a controversial, rapidly growing
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Never accepted in the established alcohol treatment community,
the group shined among the general public, attracting many drinkers
for whom abstinence treatment had already failed.
</P>
<P>
   While still promoting the movement, in January Kishline logged
on to the Moderation Management Internet news group to announce
that she could no longer sustain moderate drinking and that she
would leave her organization to join several abstinence-based
12-step recovery programs.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was a shock, said MM board member Marc Kern.
During the ensuing debate and angst within the network, some people
dropped out while the publicity attracted newcomers as well.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, Kishline failed sobriety altogether.
</P>
<P>
   State troopers at the crash scene found her unconscious. A
partially empty bottle of vodka and a container of the prescription
anxiety drug Alprazolam were found in her truck.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters have argued that Kishline's failure was due to
abstinence-based treatment, not moderation.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Institutes of Health, there are far
more problem drinkers in the United States than chronic drinkers
who are severely dependent on alcohol and need to quit.
</P>
<P>
   MM proponents say traditional abstinence-based programs that do
not consider moderation as an achievable goal are themselves a form
of denial. They maintain that a majority of problem drinkers can on
their own learn to drink less, while some need guidance _ a book, a
support group or professional help.
</P>
<P>
   But Kern, a Los Angeles-based psychologist, said that for most
people with real alcohol problems, moderation is not viable.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, MM worked for Kishline, he said, because working
through her own methods helped her learn she has a more serious
problem. Many members who routinely attend MM meetings end up
choosing total abstinence, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it is a very rational, gentle forum, they find that
this forum is better to talk about their alcohol problems than
other methods,'' Kern said.
</P>
<P>
   MM critics say it is impossible to predict when a person
``crosses the line'' into alcoholism, though. Because of that, they
contend that abstinence is the safest course of recovery _ and some
blame Kishline for leading drunks to believe they could safely
drink.
</P>
<P>
   In a sharply worded critique in June, Stacia Murphy, president
of the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, said
Kishline's denial of her alcoholism has contributed to the
progression of the disease for thousands of Americans and their
families.
</P>
<P>
   Like programs fashioned after Alcoholics Anonymous, Moderation
Management stresses certain steps and rules, though it omits the
highly spiritual aspects of AA and other organizations.
</P>
<P>
   For example, MM-ers must first abstain for 30 days in order to
clear their system and lower their tolerance. But they need not put
their lives ``into the hands of God,'' as many 12-step programs
ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't do 30 days on your own, you'll never be able to
sustain moderation,'' Kern said.
</P>
<P>
   Kishline in her book also lists drinking guidelines that differ
for men and women of various weights.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the group allows three drinks per day for women and
four for men. By comparison, the U.S. Department of Agriculture in
new dietary guidelines released in May defines moderate drinking as
one drink a day for women, two for men.
</P>
<P>
   Teetotalers argue that MM's liberal guidelines were attracting
drunks looking for an excuse to leave AA _ concern shared even by
psychologists who actively support the organization, Kern said.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford University psychologists, at the invitation of the
group, have studied the program. Their results are due later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   In various media accounts following the death of the Davises,
Kishline is reported to have denounced Moderation Management and
its members for denying their alcoholism. But her close associates
say she made no such statement and still believes in the principles
of moderate drinking.
</P>
<P>
   After pleading guilty on June 29, Kishline apologized _
admitting that nothing she says or does could reverse the
destruction she caused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am giving this statement in a public forum because I pray
that my story can touch at least one other alcoholic,'' Kishline
said in Kittitas County Superior Court. ``When I failed at
moderation and then failed at abstinence, I was too full of
embarrassment and shame to seek help.''
</P>
<P>
   Her confession has done little to still the debate over
Moderation Management. A little more than a week later, 36 noted
professionals in the alcohol abuse treatment field issued a
statement supporting both moderation and abstinence-based
approaches as equally viable answers to problem drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Many more treatment professionals, however, continue to advocate
abstinence as the only path to recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Kern added that the debate, sparked by ``a horrible, horrible,
horrible tragedy,'' has been helpful. It put the discussion of
recovery methods back on the table in a big way, forcing people to
look into the ``gray area'' of alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Kishline will have plenty of time to re-examine the gray areas,
her life and the future of her movement. She faces a sentence of 41
months to life in prison, although the Kittitas County prosecutor
is expected to ask for 54 months in custody, followed by two years
of community supervision that would include a locking device on her
car's ignition.

   OVIRI-COURT, Nigeria _ As the rain clattered on his aluminum
roof, Akierou Awe sat in a gloomy corner inside his mud-brick house
and spoke softly of the oil pipeline explosion that killed three of
his sons last month, not far from his village in this oil-soaked
corner of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel had been leaking from the pipeline for some time at a spot
deep in the bush near a forest of rubber trees. Villagers had been
scooping it up with jerry cans, wash basins and 1.5-liter plastic
bottles that they carried away in wheelbarrows and hoped to resell
for a few pennies above the official rate of 21 cents a liter. Then
perhaps one wheelbarrow knocked against another, causing a spark.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion shook Awe's house early on the morning of July 10.
The fire spread along a mile-long stretch of the pipeline, killing
more than 300 people, including his sons Kingsley, 23, Tuesday, 22,
and Gift, 20, all of whom tapped rubber trees for a living.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even as you see me now, I am no longer a full human being,''
Awe, 65, a retired civil servant said, so softly that the rain
nearly drowned out his words. ``Gift attended secondary school, and
he was supposed to finish this year.'' A fourth son, named Hope,
20, had been with his brothers, but was not killed. Hope was still
in the hospital, and his father did not know whether he would
survive.
</P>
<P>
   The Niger Delta of Nigeria, one of the world's top oil
producers, has for years been the center of violent despair. The
swampy patch of land laced by tributaries of West Africa's great
Niger River yields almost all of Nigeria's 2 million barrels a day
of crude, most of which end up at gas stations in the United
States. But because of this country's complicated history of ethnic
politics, its inhabitants have remained stunningly and desperately
poor. And recently, hundreds have been burned to death in at least
five explosions as they tried to scoop up fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more than any other country on the continent, Nigeria _
where one in six Africans live _ has focused attention on the
problematic role of natural resources, which have enriched members
of the African elite and Western business people but slowed
development. Nigeria is the nightmare that loomed before World Bank
officials who recently approved a $3.7 billion oil pipeline for
Chad; it is a warning for the tiny country of Equatorial Guinea,
where oil started gushing four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Pipelines have exploded in many nations. The biggest explosions
since the mid-1980s occurred in 1994 in Brazil, where 508 were
killed. There were 529 deaths in Egypt in 1994 and at least 220 in
Cameroon in 1998. But Nigeria leads all of them by a wide margin:
In the last two years alone, official figures indicate, more than
2,000 women, men and children have died in pipeline explosions.
Many believe that the real figure is even higher.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, while explosions elsewhere result from accidents,
here they are caused by sabotage. Organized rings made up of
thieves with knowledge of the oil pipelines, allied with corrupt
government and military officials, are believed to steal huge
quantities of fuel with trucks and sophisticated oil equipment. The
leaks eventually attract villagers with jerry cans, and the
villagers are invariably the ones who end up being killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the level of grinding poverty in the Niger Delta,
when there are these leaks, people see it as an opportunity to make
some money despite the dangers,'' said Doifie Ola, director of
Environmental Rights Action, a Lagos-based organization that
monitors pipeline explosions. ``Similar incidents are likely to
keep recurring if nothing concrete is done.''

   Immediately after assuming power in May 1999, President Olusegun
Obasanjo visited the Niger Delta. He raised great hopes among its 7
million inhabitants, but little has been accomplished so far. A
Niger Delta development bill has yet to become law.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the most notable government action was the military's
destruction of a town called Odi last November after some of its
residents killed 12 police officers. Obasanjo later expressed
regret for the attack on Odi, which many see as the single most
startling violation of human rights during his term.
</P>
<P>
   Port Harcourt, one of the two oil centers in the Niger Delta,
had tentatively been on the itinerary of President Clinton, who is
scheduled to come to Nigeria later this month. But it is now
unlikely he will come here; he will very likely spend most of his
visit in the capital, Abuja.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Delta has grown increasingly restive. Early this
month, youths held hostage 165 workers associated with Shell, the
biggest oil exporter, eventually releasing them. And vandalism of
oil pipelines has risen sharply.
</P>
<P>
   The targets of vandalism are usually not the oil multinationals'
pipelines. They carry crude for export, but pipelines connected to
government-owned refineries that process crude in the Niger Delta
and ship easy-to-resell gasoline or kerosene through a 3,250-mile
network of pipelines crisscrossing Nigeria. The country's four oil
refineries have long been the source of corruption: Gen. Sani
Abacha, the late dictator, allowed them to deteriorate so severely
that Nigeria found itself in the absurd position of having to
import gasoline _ through the general's middlemen _ from non
oil-producing nations.
</P>
<P>
   Since Abacha's death in June 1998, the refineries have been
repaired. The new method of theft is the siphoning of fuel coursing
through the pipelines. In October 1998, 1,082 people were killed,
by official tally, by a huge explosion in the town of Jesse, not
too far from here. A pipeline connected to a refinery in Warri, the
second oil center of the Niger Delta, had been punctured.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In 1999 government pipelines were sabotaged 497 times, according
the Nigerian National Petroleum Corp., or NNPC, which owns and
operates the pipeline network. In the first three months of this
year, the number had already reached 200. In the first five months,
$20 million was lost in stolen fuel and damage done to pipelines,
the petroleum corporation estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The state-run corporation fired some of its workers after
villagers reported their involvement in the siphoning: They had
employed soldiers to guard tankers driven alongside the pipelines
to collect the fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Gaius-Obaseki, managing director of the oil corporation,
acknowledged the collusion at a news conference in Warri after
visiting victims of the blast earlier this month. He said more
dismissals were planned.
</P>
<P>
   At another news conference, a corporation spokesman, Ndu
Ughamadu, said that although villagers had been scooping up the
fuel, they could not have been the ones to puncture it. ``Our
engineers have told us that vandalization of oil pipelines takes a
scientific process which ordinary villagers can't engage in,'' he
said, adding: ``There must be well-placed people that have links
with this pipeline vandalization. Where they have located a
pipeline they will perforate holes, and quietly they will lay
pipelines for up to 1 kilometer where they siphon the fuel at
will.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Here in Oviri-Court, to reach the pipeline, one must quit a dirt
road and hike a half-mile into the bush. Wooden planks remained on
the muddy stretches to allow access to vehicles _ evidence,
villagers said, that an organized ring had come here with a truck
and equipment. A big hole had been dug, exposing the pipeline,
which now lay underwater.
</P>
<P>
   The blast had charred the trees in the area; their leafless,
black skeletons rose out of darkened water. The 300 bodies had been
carried away. But the tools of the dead lay scattered around the
unearthed pipeline: wash basins, countless 1.5-liter plastic
bottles, jerry cans, a scorched bicycle and two wheelbarrows.
</P>
<P>
   Adeje, a nearby village with no electricity, no tap water and no
paved roads, is typical of the Niger Delta _ in fact better off
than villages accessible only by boat. The Delta's inhabitants are
members of ethnic minorities. Partly out of fear that Nigeria might
break up one day, the Hausa-speaking northern generals who have
ruled most of the time since independence have kept the oil-rich
Delta poor and weak.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Oghoro, a community leader in his 70s, was one of many
who said he had reported the leaking pipeline to the local
authorities. But nothing had been done, Oghoro said, because the
vandals were well connected and had siphoned the fuel under
military escort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police are not here to protect us,'' Oghoro said. ``If the
government wanted to protect us, they would employ people to man
the pipeline. No one will go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Another local leader, David Okomore, 45, said that he and the
village chief, Benson Egberebo, 65, once videotaped a leaking
pipeline. ``The soldiers pounced on us,'' he said. ``The chief was
taken to the police station and interrogated.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Okomore, one of the few college-educated men in the village,
said two of his cousins, women aged 50 and 19, had been killed in
the blast. He had identified their bodies, which were buried in a
mass grave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they were poor and uneducated,'' he said, ``they were
scooping the fuel.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Okomore foresaw repercussions beyond the deaths: ``Because of
the explosion and the destruction, the farms we have won't produce
anymore _ even the river has been polluted. There will be even less
for the people to do here.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, he added, the destruction will make more people
hopeless. More will scoop for fuel. He was not counting on the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we ask for compensation,'' he said, ``they harass us with
soldiers. There's nothing we can do. We only live by the mercy of
God now.''

HIS SERBIAN FLOCK SCATTERED, THE PRIEST STAYS ON, SADLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Foreign Journal) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVO POLJE, Kosovo _ The Rev. Radivoje Panic has had more than
his share of parishes.
</P>
<P>
   He lived in Pristina, the Kosovo capital, for nearly 10 years,
and often gave sermons at a small church on Taslixhe hill. A
witness to terror by his own Serbs, humiliated by his inability to
stop the expulsion of Albanians from Pristina, he found himself
expelled by them in turn.
</P>
<P>
   He was assigned to a church here in Kosovo Polje, a largely
Serbian town a few miles southwest of Pristina, but it was badly
damaged by hand grenades a year ago, despite the British troops
nearby. About a month ago it was attacked again, reduced to rubble
by dynamite in a large explosion, the third church destroyed in six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Now Panic serves at the last remaining church in Kosovo Polje,
the Church of St. Nicholas, which is surrounded by barbed wire and
patrolled by troops. It's a bizarre life, and oddly lonely. However
potent religious symbols have been for Serbian nationalism and
identity, neither the Serbs nor the Albanians are especially devout
after so many years of Communism. Not many Serbs come to church _
mostly the old and those who want to light candles for the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Even on June 28, the anniversary of the famous 1389 battle that
marked the loss of this province to the Ottoman Turks for 500
years, only 11 people came here to worship. More surprising, only
70-odd came to mark the event at the early 14th-century monastery
at nearby Gracanica. Services there _ under the eyes of NATO
soldiers, who to some Serbs are the new Ottomans _ were conducted
by Patriarch Pavle, the head of the entire Serbian Orthodox Church,
and by Bishop Artemije, the church's leader in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At least 8,000 Serbs live around Gracanica, but even on such a
symbolic day, sighed the Rev. Sava Janjic, the bishop's aide and
spokesman, ``you could see the empty chairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Panic, who describes himself as a simple priest, tries to see
the situation as a whole. ``This is the tragedy of all of us, Serbs
and Albanians,'' he said. ``There's no way to justify what happened
or to improve on it. With the war and the bombing, the Albanians
were pushed to leave the cities, towns and villages, and after the
bombing stopped, the Serbs were pushed to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   He remained in Pristina throughout the war. ``To be frank,'' he
said, ``I didn't see anyone personally being expelled from their
apartments and houses, but I did see many Albanians leaving with
their goods. I asked people why they were leaving, and they said
that a lot of people were being pushed out of the apartments and
houses by Serbs with guns, and that they were afraid this would
happen to them.''
</P>
<P>
   There were a lot of armed Serbian police, he said, standing
guard and guiding those who were leaving.
</P>
<P>
   And what did he do?
</P>
<P>
   He looked away, out the window, toward the barbed wire. ``I
remember one instance, when we tried to explain to the police that
they were making a mistake, that this Albanian was a good man, that
we knew him. We tried at least individually to protect him. But
this cop told me to get out of there, that this was not my
business.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused again, played with a pencil. ``Individually and
collectively we have responsibility,'' he said slowly. ``But you
can't punish someone based on collective guilt. What is happening
now is not the responsibility of all the Albanian people. I woke up
one morning to see a large group of Albanians leaving Pristina.
How? Why? Could someone stop that? I explained one case.
Milosevic's propaganda did the worst things here and still does
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian Orthodox Church, which broke with President Slobodan
Milosevic over his failures in Bosnia, and which calls for his
resignation, was clear in its attitude toward the war in Kosovo,
Panic said. The church opposed NATO's bombing, but it also opposed
the wrong done to Kosovo's Albanians, the murders and expulsions.
</P>
<P>
   Sava, the bishop's aide, who often comes here to get a better
Internet connection on the church's telephone, says that the church
should have broken with Milosevic sooner, and that many priests
became too caught up in the nationalist fervor over Bosnia, with
some of them photographed atop advancing tanks. ``And too many
others were silent,'' Sava said.
</P>
<P>
   He and Artemije are regarded as traitors by Belgrade _ and by
some Kosovo Serbs _ for working politically with Washington and the
U.N. civilian leader here, Bernard Kouchner, to try to increase
security for Serbs and allow more of them to return. The church
leadership has also expressed regret and sorrow for Serbian actions
here.
</P>
<P>
   But its apologies to Albanians, and its call for tolerance and
forgiveness, ring hollow in Albanian ears, and many Serbs here
still seem unable to acknowledge what was done in their name or
even by their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war happened, and there was a lot of anger on both
sides,'' Panic said. ``Evil things happened to ordinary Albanians,
too, that's the tragedy. But the peace has been signed. What
happened, happened. There were 60,000 Serbs in Pristina and now
there are 238. But life must go on. And today I'm occupied mostly
with the problems of simple people, who did no evil to anyone. The
ones who did the evil have left.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war last summer, Panic's apartment was robbed many
times and his car stolen. ``There was no longer any way for me to
live in Pristina,'' he said. ``So in September, I left Pristina
forever and came here.''
</P>
<P>
   On Taslixhe hill in Pristina, the church where Panic once
preached, in the once-mixed ethnic neighborhood where he once
lived, is guarded around the clock by the Royal Fusiliers, with
their trademark feathers of red and white shooting out of their
caps. The church is fine, but there are few Serbs left to use it;
the soldiers, who keep watch from a sandbag shelter 24 hours a day,
in all weather, are bored to tears. But the minute they leave, they
know, the church will be vandalized and destroyed, as some 80
others have been.
</P>
<P>
   They have two dogs, mongrels, that keep them company. One they
have named NATO and the other Unmik, the acronym for the U.N.
Mission in Kosovo, which runs civilian life here.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO barks at all the cars,'' a soldier said, laughing. ``And
Unmik sleeps.''  &QL;

 &HT;    Street name to honor ill civil rights crusader
 &HT;    By Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hosea Williams, who wore out many pairs of shoes
marching up and down highways and streets for justice, now has a
street to call his own.
</P>
<P>
   At a special city-sponsored celebration for the ailing
74-year-old civil rights leader, Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell
unveiled ``Hosea L. Williams Street,'' a 3.3-mile stretch in
southeast Atlanta. The street runs through the residential
neighborhood where the Williams family has lived for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are happy that the people and the city has recognized my
father while he is still living,'' said Williams' son, Torrey
Williams. ``Naming the street after him was wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   With the bright green street sign serving as a backdrop, more
than 500 people packed City Hall to celebrate Williams' life and
legacy, and pray for his recovery. Aside from the street being
named for him, Williams also received Atlanta's first-ever Lifetime
Service Award, as well as a special award from the U.S. Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We planned this to make sure that a grateful city honors a
great man while he is still around to appreciate it,'' Campbell
said. ``We know that Hosea Williams has always stood on the right
side of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was noticeably absent from his own party, but it was
not without cause. The civil rights crusader, who battled bigotry
all of his life, has been in and out of the hospital recently
battling cancer. The illness has left him too weak to travel.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had been scheduled to attend the celebration, but
backed out late Thursday morning. His son said he was home resting.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many of his friends, including the Rev. C.T. Vivian, the
Rev. Joseph Lowery, Southern Christian Leadership Conference
President Martin Luther King III, and Lt. Gov. Mark Taylor were on
hand for the celebration, which at times was joyous, poignant and
sad.
</P>
<P>
   Among them were Williams' good friend, television sidekick and
``road dog''', James ``Alley Pat'' Patrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better late than never,'' Patrick.``It's a long time
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Though everyone said they were praying for a full recovery, some
_ perhaps accidently _ spoke of him in the past tense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a difference while he was here on Earth,'' said Gov.
Roy Barnes. ``Nobody can ever say or dispute the fact that Hosea
Williams made a difference. Sometimes I don't think he agreed with
himself, but you know his heart was in the right place.''
</P>
<P>
   King, who leads the organization where Williams made a name for
himself as an abrasive but effective organizer, said people like
Hosea were the most important cogs in the civil rights machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thank you for what you have done,'' said King III. ''Martin
Luther King, Jr., could not have done what he did if he didn't have
Hosea Williams.''

only one crash has sparked a national controversy over continued
drinking by recovering alcoholics. Audrey Kishline, who founded
Moderation Management, an organization which asserts that problem
drinkers need not abstain from alcohol, is to be sentenced Friday
on two counts of vehicular homicide.

   FILM-CHILD (Undated) _ Kim Basinger recently ended a two-year,
post-Oscar filmmaking hiatus with ``I Dreamed of Africa,'' the
story of an Italian woman who rises to nobility in an epic struggle
against the various forces of evil at work on the dark continent.
Now she's back in ``Bless the Child,'' the story of an ordinary

himself.

   FILM-REPLACEMENTS (Undated) _ The premise of ``The

one-time shot at playing in the NFL during the 1987 players'
strike. Leave it to Howard Deutch (late of ``Grumpier Old Men'' and
``The Odd Couple II'') to bench every potentially interesting
conflict and simply crib from the ``Major League'' playbook.

   FILM-OPPORTUNISTS (Undated) _ ``The Opportunists'' has quite a
bit going for it: a delicate and character-driven storyline, an
absorbing performance from the always reliable Christopher Walken
and plenty of authentic, lower-middle-class New York atmosphere.
Somehow, however, it doesn't add up to be anything more than the
sum of its parts.

   FILM-TAO _ Quick! Rattle off the names of three romantic

gives the slight American indie ``The Tao of Steve'' the illusion
of being some sort of profound, taboo-breaking landmark.

IN ROMANCE OR BUSINESS, BREAKING UP IS HARD TO TAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, August 13) 
 By   LINDA DUPREE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the start of a new fiscal year at our media and marketing
research firm, and though I hadn't heard from my West Coast
manager, for a few days, I wasn't worried. After all, I had a
well-oiled team in place, and this manager did excellent work. When
we finally made contact, the news was good. Sales were brisk, he
said, and the new hires were settling in.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a U-turn. ``I'm thinking of resigning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The sunny morning and my matching disposition both turned
suddenly dark. My stomach churned, and I was glad I was sitting
down. This manager's sister was opening a new business and wanted
him as general manager. I was listening to him, but there was a
disturbing, oceanlike roar in my ears, even though I was smack in
the middle of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at home, I kept rubbing the mental bruise. Awake at 2
a.m., I was scribbling notes to myself on making an A-list
counteroffer to him. If he did go, it wouldn't be before I'd given
my best shot at keeping him.
</P>
<P>
   In our red-hot business climate, defections have grown
significantly. Over all, voluntary turnover is averaging 17 percent
a year at American companies, according to the retention practices
survey by the Society for Human Resource Management. The rate is
even higher, 25 percent, at companies with 5,000 or more employees.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that I wasn't used to employee resignations; I've been
around long enough to have accepted many of them.
</P>
<P>
   There were the ``C-student'' types, whom I had thanked and
wished luck and then said a silent prayer of gratitude that I
hadn't had to fire them.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the solid citizens _ able and dependable, but no
superstars. I was sorry when they left, but not devastated. They
were replaceable.
</P>
<P>
   But some departures just ripped my heart. These were the people
with exceptional talent, in whom I had invested so much, both
professionally and emotionally. They had shared my best business
practices and my best stories. In other words, they were people
like my West Coast manager. How could he do this to me?
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to my husband to cut to the heart of the matter. I was
a little too focused on me, he said. What about the manager and his
happiness? I was acting like a jilted lover.
</P>
<P>
   I'm in a happy marriage, but I remember some of these same
symptoms from my dating years: tightness in the chest,
lightheadedness, depression. I was jealous because a manager was
throwing me over. Sure, it was for a more attractive business
proposition, not some pixie cheerleader. But it amounted to the
same thing. I'd been dumped, and everybody knew it.
</P>
<P>
   But wallowing would only accelerate the downward spiral. So I
have taken a page from my sweet-16-and-dying-of-a-broken-heart
workbook and have applied it to this professional breakup. The
following advice still applies to all the Dear Johned of the world,
whether in romance or in business:
</P>
<P>
   TAKE TIME TO REFLECT
</P>
<P>
   After breaking up with a guy, I used to make self-improvement
lists. Maybe, for example, I could have made a little more time for
Almost Right. For my work team in the current situation, it has
been much the same: I ask myself if I can eliminate any obstacles
to making their jobs more satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   LOOK CONFIDENT
</P>
<P>
   In high school, I would dress a little more carefully after a
breakup. No need to overdo it; the crocheted poncho didn't work
then, and it won't work now. But I must say that a new haircut has
lifted my spirits in dealing with the manager's departure. More
important, I have looked people in the eye and spoken to his
decision, but have then moved quickly to other important topics.
</P>
<P>
   STAY BUSY, AND VISIBLE
</P>
<P>
   In bygone years, I'd remove the sweater-marring fraternity pin
and head to every campus activity available. Today, I'm adding
business trips and making a lot of telephone calls to gauge the
organization's temperature.
</P>
<P>
   DON'T GO IT ALONE
</P>
<P>
   The support of the remaining team members means a lot to me
today _ as did that of my school friends who took me out for pizza
after my high school honey vanished. My colleagues have offered
great advice, and it seems to help them to help me.
</P>
<P>
   COMPLIMENT YOUR EX
</P>
<P>
   Yes, everyone knows that the manager's departure wasn't my
choice. Still, I have praised him for all he did for the
organization _ and even posted a companywide e-mail message before
everyone heard the news second-hand. If I had been more mature at
16, such an approach could have saved me a lot of heartache.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, these steps have helped me feel better. The problem
has been diagnosed, and it isn't life-threatening. Of course he
couldn't live his life for me. Let's move on. I'll date again.
</P>

IN 1976, GORE UNVEILS POLITICAL STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES IN FIRST

<P>
   For years _ since college, anyway _ Al Gore had been telling
friends that the very last thing he would ever do with his life was
go into politics. That was fine for his father, he would say, but
not for him.
</P>
<P>
   When he changed his mind, though, while he was in his second
year of law school and working evenings at the Nashville
Tennesseean, he kept it to himself. ``I had a vague, unarticulated
game plan,'' Gore said in a recent interview. ``I'd get my law
degree, continue in newspapers'' _ by buying the Carthage Courier,
in the little Tennessee town where he'd spent summers growing up _
``move to the farm, spend 10 or 12 years establishing myself in the
community and run for Congress at 40.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so vague. But unarticulated, definitely.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's friends remember being kept out of the loop, as usual,
until after the fact. ``He didn't ask anybody whether he should
run,'' said his closest Tennessee friend, Steve Armistead.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Gore kept his own counsel right up until the very
moment he heard that his local congressman, Rep. Joe L. Evins, was
retiring unexpectedly _ years ahead of Gore's own plan. Gore's boss
at the paper, the publisher, John Seigenthaler, who had been
encouraging Gore to consider public life, called him at home one
evening in February 1976 to tell him the news.
</P>
<P>
   And after less than a minute, he hung up and told his wife
Tipper, ``I think I'm going to run.'' Then, as they both have
described the scene, he dropped to the floor and started doing
push-ups, to keep from drowning in adrenaline.
</P>
<P>
   Gore took a risk in 1976, pouring a huge chunk of his own money
into a campaign that was short on other people's cash because he
was not favored to win.
</P>
<P>
   And from his earliest days on the stump, he showed both the best
and the worst of himself as a candidate. In 1976, he won because he
outworked the competition and had his facts down cold. Yet he also
turned off even some old friends in the process by presenting
himself as more conservative than he was. He cut his
shoulder-length hair, moved to the right on gun control and called
homosexuality ``abnormal.''
</P>
<P>
   In that race, Gore's first job was to differentiate himself from
his father, former Sen. Albert Gore, who had suffered a bitter
defeat six years earlier. In the same way, Al Gore must in the 2000
presidential campaign separate himself from another political force
of nature, Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The question for Gore was then and is now: Is he his own man?
Yet the answer has stayed the same also.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, he has yet to prove that he is, in part because he
has changed positions on some issues, leaving unclear just where he
stands. But also because he is so complicated, with a million
moving parts behind the shut-down exterior, that there is no
perfect soundbite of an answer to the larger question of who he is.
</P>
<P>
   He may well be trying to hide some parts of himself from a
public that does not seem particularly enchanted by complexity. Yet
even his efforts to tell all can seem like attempts to obscure. He
often answers a question by saying, ``On one level ...'' then plows
through many levels more. His thinking is often so subtle that the
harder he tries to download the entire mental file, the more he
sounds like he's hedging.
</P>
<P>
   And though Gore has certainly been a dutiful senator's son and
loyal vice president, he is so self-contained, making even
important decisions in a surprisingly solitary way, that it's
possible to conclude that if anything, he is probably too much his
own man.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, he has stubbornly resisted advice and
charged ahead to a degree that has driven generations of aides
crazy. One longtime aide said Gore really only listens to his
family, because they tend to encourage him to follow his own
instincts.
</P>
<P>
   So for Gore, being his own man has often meant going it alone.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first decisions the 27-year-old congressional
candidate made was to tell his father, the former senator, that he
would have to sit out the campaign _ much as George W. Bush seems
to have sidelined his father during his first political race, also
for a freshly vacant House seat, in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was adamant that his father refrain from making a single
speech or statement on his behalf. ``He didn't understand it or
like it, but I insisted,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Was that a hard conversation to have? ``Not really,'' he said
coolly. ``It was hard for him to hear it. But I didn't want to be
elected as his son.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet this distancing strategy was as tricky in 1976 as it is
today. Though the elder Gore had lost statewide in 1970, he was
still well regarded in his old House district, even if the district
was more conservative than the former senator.
</P>
<P>
   There were no burning issues in the race. And among the 9
candidates, all Democrats, the favorite was majority leader of the
Tennessee House, Stanley Rogers, who had their party's support sewn
up.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gore's campaign press secretary, Ken Jost, a colleague at
the Tennesseean, said it never really occurred to him that Gore
might actually win.
</P>
<P>
   And plenty of people thought the only way Gore could even hope
to prevail was by exploiting the familial connection he was running
away from. But Gore balked at this, and thought the key was to
outwork the competition, And that's what he did.
</P>
<P>
   Day after day, he drove the backroads of middle Tennessee, and
ran across fields to ask farmers for their support. On one
occasion, he climbed a telephone pole to shake hands with the
lineman.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was not anyone's idea of a natural on the stump, and he
stuck with the same tired jokes throughout the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he kept going back, asking for support time and time
again, and in many cases wore people down. Several longtime
supporters in Tennessee said in recent interviews that they took
his lack of God-given talent for backslapping and baby-kissing as
proof that he was getting into politics for the right reasons. When
they saw him breaking a sweat, they approved.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Gore's jam-packed campaign schedule and hours-long
town hall meetings have been seen as a sign of desperation in his
current race against Bush, whose pace is more leisurely. But even
after Gore won his congressional seat, he held something like 1,200
town meetings. The exact number of meetings held, like the number
of burgers sold by McDonald's, was always the last line in Gore's
press releases.
</P>
<P>
   Gore believes that the winner is usually the guy who works the
hardest.

 UNDATED: the hardest.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Gore not only made all the major decisions in his
campaign, but financed it, too, like some indie film project, with
loans and maxed out credit cards. He took out a $50,000 loan and
kicked in a total of $125,000 of his own money.
</P>
<P>
   Though his father was not wealthy while Gore was growing up, he
did make a lot of money after losing his Senate seat in 1970. And
at age 27, the younger Gore already had a substantial bank account,
owing mostly the homebuilding business and another real estate
venture his family had brought him in on. His donations to his own
campaign accounted for more than two-thirds of the $188,560 he
raised in the race at a time when his financial statements showed a
net worth of $273,841.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote some of his own press releases and drove himself
around, too, speeding to hit the maximum number of events and using
a CB radio _ his handle was ``Carthage Campaigner'' _ to avoid
getting caught.
</P>
<P>
   News coverage of the race focused on the surprisingly
conservative ground staked out by Gore, who felt he had to distance
himself from his father's liberalism.
</P>
<P>
   It paid off. Gore surprised everyone by snagging an endorsement
from the right-leaning Nashville Banner, a paper that had always
been a harsh critic of his father's. The Banner had been sold to
Gannett several years earlier, but still retained its conservative
voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very important in establishing credibility to have
gotten the Banner's endorsement,'' said Gore's press secretary in
the race, Jost. ``The editorial board of a decidedly Republican,
conservative newspaper thought he'd be a good congressman, too.''
</P>
<P>
   His strongest competition in the race, Stan Rogers, now says
that both he and Gore, whom he supports, pandered in that race.
``No doubt about it, Al postured himself in a more conservative
image, but we both did, so I can't blame him. I attempted to paint
him as the liberal even though that's what I was. I just tried to
paint the senior brush on him'' _ as in Albert Gore, Senior _ ``but
the senator was not photographed, not seen in the campaign until
election night when it was all over, and that was smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spoke against gun control, and a week before the primary
told a crowd, ``I don't believe a woman's freedom to live her own
life, in all cases, outweighs the fetus' right to life.'' Both of
these positions were news to his former colleagues at the
Tennesseean, where he had written an editorial expressing outrage
over the proliferation of cheap handguns.
</P>
<P>
   After Gore was elected, he would often stop back in at the
Tennesseean at the end of a full day of town hall meetings. Then
he'd plop down at a desk, and write his own story _ complete with a
news hook _ rather than just issuing a press release. His old
editor, Frank Ritter, was usually running the desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you didn't have any staff on the weekend so he saved you a
lot of trouble,'' Ritter said. ``He'd go set the hot type, read the
proof and made the corrections, too,'' if you'd let him, he
laughed. ``Then we'd put our feet up on the desk late and have
coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in one such late night session that Ritter finally asked
his friend about his surprisingly conservative campaign positions
on abortion and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Al, how in the world can you not support gun control?
The Tennesseean has always been for strict gun control.' He said,
`Frank, they all hunt in my district and there's no way in the
world I could win if I came out against guns.''
</P>
<P>
   On abortion, Ritter said, ``He said, `Here's my position. I
don't believe government funds should ever be used to finance
abortions.' Of course, he's really changed that now.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has remained consistent on some of the relatively
conservative views he expressed back then _ on national defense and
criminal justice, for example. But of course, he now categorically
supports gay rights, strong gun control legislation and abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   When he called homosexuality ``abnormal,'' was he pandering, or
did he really think that? ``That was a view, a statement I long
since retracted,'' he said. ``I don't think that way'' any more, he
added, ``because I've long since learned better. But I was
encumbered with a stereotype, and the bad news is that statement
was an accurate reflection of my belief at the time. It wasn't a
pose.''
</P>
<P>
   On gun control, he admits to changing his position to suit his
constituents, but also says, ``If I had had a strong belief that it
was really important, I would have said so. I did not see it as a
compelling issue at that time. I really didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   On other issues, including abortion, he says, ``I've grown in
the last 24 years, seriously.'' But overall, he insists he listed
only a little to the right to win the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's unfair to say I probably leaned more
conservative,'' he said, ``but they still were all positions I was
comfortable with at the time. Even at Harvard, I was more moderate
than all my friends. I don't think you can say that was a pose.''
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the primary, Aug. 5, the tally went back and
forth, but Gore ended up winning by just a few thousand votes,
receiving 32 percent of the vote to Rogers' 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At a victory party at a Holiday Inn in Lebanon, himself was so
excited that he just kept on thanking people.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time in the race, he emphasized his family
ties. ``I have a family that teaches you what public service is all
about,'' he said in his speech. ``That is what my family has taught
me.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   With the economic expansion setting records for longevity, much
of American business is reveling in prosperity. But all is hardly
well. For reasons that include profligate lending and underwriting
in the second half of the 1990s, many large businesses, and even
entire industries, are suffocating from their debts.
</P>
<P>
   A major portion of the health care industry is in shambles; in
retailing, competition from category killers has contributed to
huge consolidation. And some auto parts suppliers, already
beleaguered despite record car sales by Detroit last year, seem to
have no place to go but south.
</P>
<P>
   That's not all. Household names like Pathmark Stores and United
Artists Theatre Co., defaulted on bonds this spring and are
contributors to $15 billion total in defaulted debt across
corporate America for the first half of 2000 _ a rate that could
smash last year's record of $23.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Though the financial disruption at Pathmark and United Artists
is nearly invisible to their customers, it is very visible to the
bankruptcy lawyers and other people _ please don't call them
vultures _ who make their living from corporate distress. For them,
business has rarely been better. Judging from the agony in the
market for high-yield bonds, probably the best predictor, it is
likely to get better still.
</P>
<P>
   ``The restructuring industry is in an expansion phase right
now,'' said Al Koch, managing principal at Jay Alix &AMP; Associates, a
leading specialist in the category. Its staff has nearly tripled in
size over the last five years as more companies have needed help in
fixing operations and recasting notes and bonds. ``Insolvency
attorneys are all very, very busy,'' Koch added.
</P>
<P>
   Deryck Palmer, a partner and restructuring specialist at Weil,
Gotshal &AMP; Manges, can vouch for that. He points particularly to the
bounty that awaits those involved in refinancing hospitals, which
he believes are only beginning to feel the crunch that has affected
other businesses. ``What's amazing is you have this much activity
in a robust economy,'' Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether these exceptions to the boom will lead to a full-fledged
credit crunch depends on whom you ask. But there is no doubt that a
rising number of companies, running out of financing options, are
having to default.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly all economists agreeing that the Federal Reserve
will succeed, sooner or later, in slowing the nation's growth, the
corporate distress will probably widen. If the Fed's tightening
brings on a recession, as a few analysts now predict for next year,
the defaults could intensify the contraction.
</P>
<P>
   As Henry S. Miller, vice chairman of Wasserstein Perella &AMP; Co.
and head of its restructuring business, put it, ``Most people who
play in this business believe there is a lot more to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Moody's Investors Service calculates that 6.2 percent of
high-yield, or ``junk,'' bonds are now in default. It projects that
the rate will rise to 7.1 percent by year-end, and to 8.4 percent
by July 2001. Globally, the United States, which has the world's
most accessible capital markets, accounts for 75 percent of the
defaulted bonds by amount and 85 percent by number of companies.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists doubt that the soured debt will cause more than
a blip in the nation's overall economic performance. But Alan
Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, watches the figures
on distressed loans. His staff has made inquiries recently about
the ill health of the market for high-yield debt, defined as
securities rated no higher than Ba-1 by Moody's or BB+ by Standard
&AMP; Poor's.
</P>
<P>
   Some casualties are in long-ailing businesses like steel. Others
are in highly cyclical ones like heavy equipment. Harnischfeger
Industries, a maker of mining equipment, survived the Rust Belt
vicissitudes of the 1980's only to be driven into Chapter 11
bankruptcy by overwhelming fixed costs and falling prices in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing for what analysts regard as ill-conceived acquisitions
has also caused problems. Safety-Kleen, for example, tried to
combine such fundamentally different businesses as hazardous-waste
disposal with the more routine collection of used motor oil and
recyclable materials. In still others, companies fell prey to rapid
technological change or, as with hospitals and nursing homes, to
new restrictions on government reimbursements.
</P>
<P>
   With a few exceptions, Internet companies have not made much use
of the bond market, because of a ready supply, at least until this
year, of equity capital. As a result, few have defaulted.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say bad strategies or bad execution, sometimes both,
could not have occurred without a severe relaxation in standards
that allowed weak companies to borrow freely from banks and bond
investors.
</P>
<P>
   From 1996 to 1999, said Edward Altman, a finance professor at
New York University and a consultant to Salomon Smith Barney, ``you
had a huge number of low-quality issues coming to market.'' As
proof, Altman said, defaults showed up within a year or two of the
financings, instead of the more typical three or four years.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton agreed that the ease of raising money in the bond
market in 1997 and 1998 ``sowed the seeds for the current crop of
defaults.''
</P>
<P>
   As the cash flows necessary for repaying bonds and loans failed
to materialize, banks began to tighten their credit standards, even
more so in the wake of Russia's 1998 default. The Fed put pressure
on the banks to acknowledge their mistakes by using some of their
profits to increase reserves to cover dubious loans. Also, lenders
and debt markets became far less hospitable to companies needing to
refinance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Credit standards have tightened up and they've got nowhere to
go,'' Koch said. ``Three years ago, you could go to the bank across
the street but you can't do that anymore. And the bond markets are
closed to them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Koch said, companies could routinely be rescued
with fairly straightforward financial fixes like persuading
investors to swap their bonds for freshly issued stock. But
companies now find that they need to make their operations far more
efficient, too. He cited Trans World Airlines as a company that
still needed to improve operations if it was to head off its third
descent into bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   In a report published last month by Salomon Smith Barney, Altman
found not only that the default rate on bonds jumped to 1.58
percent in the second quarter, from 1 percent in the first quarter,
but also that so-called distressed debt had reached ``somewhat
ominous'' levels. Distressed bonds have yields to maturity at least
10 percentage points above those of similar Treasury securities.
</P>
<P>
   Some 17 percent of high-yield debt was in this category on June
30, compared with 9 percent at the end of last year and just 3
percent at the end of 1998. Moody's downgraded the debt of twice as
many companies as it upgraded in the first half of this year, the
highest ratio since 1991, when the last recession ended.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the cumulative total of defaulted and distressed debt,
estimated at 23 percent of the amount outstanding at midyear,
remains far below the 43 percent in 1992. Some analysts contend
that prices on high-yield debt have fallen to bargain levels, with
the average yield at 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel the Fed is basically done with interest-rate
increases,'' said Steven Ruggiero, director of high-yield research
at Chase Securities. He calls high-yield debt a ``good place to
be'' for investors, provided that they are in a mutual fund or
closed-end fund and that it constitutes no more than 10 percent of
a portfolio.

<P>
   For years _ since college, anyway _ Al Gore had been telling
friends that the very last thing he would ever do with his life was
go into politics. That was fine for his father, he would say, but
not for him.
</P>
<P>
   When he changed his mind, though, while he was in his second
year of law school and working evenings at the Nashville
Tennesseean, he kept it to himself. ``I had a vague, unarticulated
game plan,'' Gore said in a recent interview. ``I'd get my law
degree, continue in newspapers'' _ by buying the Carthage Courier,
in the little Tennessee town where he'd spent summers growing up _
``move to the farm, spend 10 or 12 years establishing myself in the
community and run for Congress at 40.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so vague. But unarticulated, definitely.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's friends remember being kept out of the loop, as usual,
until after the fact. ``He didn't ask anybody whether he should
run,'' said his closest Tennessee friend, Steve Armistead.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Gore kept his own counsel right up until the very
moment he heard that his local congressman, Rep. Joe L. Evins, was
retiring unexpectedly _ years ahead of Gore's own plan. Gore's boss
at the paper, the publisher, John Seigenthaler, who had been
encouraging Gore to consider public life, called him at home one
evening in February 1976 to tell him the news.
</P>
<P>
   And after less than a minute, he hung up and told his wife
Tipper, ``I think I'm going to run.'' Then, as they both have
described the scene, he dropped to the floor and started doing
push-ups, to keep from drowning in adrenaline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had not articulated the extent to which my thinking had
evolved,'' to anyone until then, Gore said. Surely he had dropped a
hint to his wife, who has always been his closest confidante and
adviser?
</P>
<P>
   ``We had talked about buying the Carthage Courier'' _ a plan
that had only recently fallen through when the paper was sold to a
higher bidder. ``But the idea of 12 years out I never emphasized in
the plan,'' he said, ``because it was so speculative.''
</P>
<P>
   But had he even mentioned the possibility to his wife? Well, no,
Gore said finally, after some hemming and hawing. ``I don't think
she's over it yet,'' he sighed.
</P>
<P>
   His wife's memory of that evening is that she had just put a
tuna noodle casserole on the table when the phone rang and their
lives changed. ``It was unsettling to me,'' Mrs. Gore said in a
separate interview in their home. ``I had a new baby, a couple of
part-time jobs and a husband who'd just quit law school to run a
race he wasn't supposed to win. Nobody's ever thought about it that
way, have they?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore did take a risk in 1976, pouring a huge chunk of his own
money into a campaign that was short on other people's cash because
he was not favored to win.
</P>
<P>
   And from his earliest days on the stump, he showed both the best
and the worst of himself as a candidate. In 1976, he won because he
outworked the competition and had his facts down cold. Yet he also
turned off even some old friends in the process by presenting
himself as more conservative than he was. He cut his
shoulder-length hair, moved to the right on gun control and called
homosexuality ``abnormal.''
</P>
<P>
   In that race, Gore's first job was to differentiate himself from
his father, former Sen. Albert Gore, who had suffered a bitter
defeat six years earlier. In the same way, Al Gore must in the 2000
presidential campaign separate himself from another political force
of nature, Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The question for Gore was then and is now: Is he his own man?
Yet the answer has stayed the same also.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, he has yet to prove that he is, in part because he
has changed positions on some issues, leaving unclear just where he
stands. But also because he is so complicated, with a million
moving parts behind the shut-down exterior, that there is no
perfect soundbite of an answer to the larger question of who he is.
</P>
<P>
   He may well be trying to hide some parts of himself from a
public that does not seem particularly enchanted by complexity. Yet
even his efforts to tell all can seem like attempts to obscure. He
often answers a question by saying, ``On one level ...'' then plows
through many levels more. His thinking is often so subtle that the
harder he tries to download the entire mental file, the more he
sounds like he's hedging.
</P>
<P>
   And though Gore has certainly been a dutiful senator's son and
loyal vice president, he is so self-contained, making even
important decisions in a surprisingly solitary way, that it's
possible to conclude that if anything, he is probably too much his
own man.
</P>
<P>
   From a young age, there were whole areas of his life he kept to
himself. On the farm in Tennessee, where he has said he had his
closest friends and most relaxed times, the 9 months of the year he
spent in Washington were never mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, he has stubbornly resisted advice and
charged ahead to a degree that has driven generations of aides
crazy. One longtime aide said Gore really only listens to his
family, because they tend to encourage him to follow his own
instincts.
</P>
<P>
   So for Gore, being his own man has often meant going it alone.

 &HT;    Elliott's season of woes
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Anything that can go wrong during a NASCAR Winston Cup
race has done exactly that for Bill Elliott this season.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran driver has had a resurgence, including a strong
third-place finish at last week's Brickyard 400, but you wouldn't
know it from looking at the points standings. Elliott is more than
900 points away from standings leader Bobby Labonte, even though he
has run among the leaders at numerous events this season.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on faulty mechanical parts, which cost a chance to win
at least two races. And blame it on reckless competitors, who
ruined Elliott's chances for victory in two other races. Those
chances could have provided Elliott's first victory since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing in one respect but good in another that
we've been running so well,'' said Elliott, who is 14th in points.
``We just can't make a break with what we need to get the monkey
off our back. Maybe someone has voodoo after us. Yeah, we've run a
whole lot better this season than what has been shown at the finish
line _ let's just put it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott hopes he's seen the end of his bad luck. Three weeks ago
at the Pennsylvania 500 at Pocono Raceway, Elliott, who drives the
No. 94 Ford, led 13 laps and stayed with the leaders most of the
day. He and Dale Jarrett made ``short pits'' three-fourths of the
way into the race and appeared set to make it a one-on-one race.
But a blown engine resulted in a disappointing 32nd-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott's team also thought that it had a shot at victory lane
in Charlotte's Coca-Cola 600 in May or, at worst, a top-five
finish. But a freak mechanical problem, a broken oil pump, caused
the car to drop out after 122 laps and finish last.
</P>
<P>
   It has been that same story line for Elliott at several other
races. It was the bad set of tires at California Speedway,
transmission problems at Bristol and rear-suspension difficulties
at Sears Point.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as an explanation, I wish I had one,'' said Mike Ford,
co-crew chief of the McDonald's team. ``We've had failure after
failure, which sometimes you don't have any control over and
sometimes you do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe one or two of the failures could've been avoided. (But)
the rest of them have been out of our control.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott had one of the strongest cars in the field in the
Cracker Barrel 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway in March. He was in
first place when he made his second pit stop. While pulling out of
his pit box, he and rookie Scott Pruett crashed, causing heavy
damage to the front of Elliott's car.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to pit row on the next lap, Elliott's crew discovered
a large hole in the front bumper. It destroyed the aerodynamics of
the Ford Taurus and ruined Elliott's chance of contending for a
victory on his home track.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most frustrating race came during the Pepsi 400 in
Daytona. Other drivers conceded that Elliott's car was the best in
field, but it was taken out on lap 113 after a blatant bump in the
rear bumper from Mike Skinner. Elliott climbed out of the mangled
automobile and raised both arms in the air. Safety workers tried to
restrain Elliott, but he walked near the track and shook his finger
at Skinner.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Elliott's closest friends said it was the most emotion
Elliott has shown in 25 years. Those same people also say that
Elliott is smiling much more this season, especially after last
week's third-place finish at Indy. In the seven Brickyards, Elliott
has five finishes in the top 10 and three in the top five.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1997, Elliott is running competitively
in just about every event. Last year, he had two top-10 finishes.
This year, he has seven, with 14 races remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I'm happy,'' Elliott said. ``What can I say? I feel like
we've had a darn good race car and a whole turnaround from last
year. That is what it is all about getting better every week.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott put together a staff mostly different from last year. It
will remain with him when he gives up his ownership at the end of
the season to drive a Dodge Intreprid for Ray Evernham in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't got many more months of ownership _ I can't wait,''
Elliott said with a look of relief. ``It's great knowing I won't
have to deal with that junk (next year). The sport has grown too
much to continue doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   With four more months of racing, the team feels like it has an
``excellent'' chance of winning this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, on a scale of 1-10, I feel like our speedway
program is at a 10,'' Ford said. ``I really don't see any weak
tracks for us the rest of the way. I feel like at any given
weekend, we could win. We are definitely keeping focus on what's
ahead of us, rather than trying to look back and figure out what
went wrong and why.''

 &HT;    Amid concerns over safety, two drivers taking week off
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The deaths of NASCAR drivers Adam Petty and Kenny Irwin continue
to have far-reaching effects in racing.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's safety policies have come under tremendous scrutiny,
and the drivers seem to be learning a valuable lesson: Racing
should not be a life-or-death proposition.
</P>
<P>
   That was best illustrated last weekend, when Jeremy Mayfield was
told he could not drive and Terry Labonte chose not to at the
Brickyard 400 in Indianapolis. They also will sit out Sunday's race
at Watkins Glen.
</P>
<P>
   Both said they had been cleared by doctors to race. Labonte, who
ended the sport's longest consecutive race streak of 655, admitted
he thought about Petty and Irwin while making his decision. Those
two drivers were killed earlier this year in practice-session
wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a game, just a sport,'' said Labonte, who had
experienced ``dizziness'' during practice sessions at Indy,
apparently lingering effects of a concussion that he suffered after
wrecking at Daytona on July 1. Ron Hornaday, a regular in the Busch
Series, will be the substitute.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to give Terry two weeks off to rest and
recuperate,'' said John Hendrick, president of Hendrick
Motorsports.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield crashed in practice last Friday morning at Indy and had
to be removed from his mangled No. 12 Ford by safety workers. He
was taken to a local hospital, where he was diagnosed with a closed
head injury.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield said he was ready to drive in the Brickyard 400 the
next day, but his owner and crew chief advised against it. Tom
Hubert will substitute for Mayfield at Watkins Glen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I feel fine, and everybody says everything is
okay,'' Mayfield said. ``I'd much rather be driving than not
driving, believe me. But everybody seems to think this will be for
the best in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield is one of the hottest drivers on the circuit. He has
won two races, and nearly won a third, before blowing a tire a
half-lap away from the finish line at the Pennsylvania 500 three
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially because of where we are in the points right now,
there is no sense in taking a chance,'' owner Michael Kranefuss
said. ``We'd rather let him rest for one more week and be ready to
go for all of the key races coming up right after Watkins Glen.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR Q&AMP;A: STERLING MARLIN
</P>
<P>
   Sterling Marlin, driver of the No. 40 Team Sabco Chevrolet, is
one of 12 drivers to have won more than $12 million in a career. He
began his Winston Cup career as a crew chief for his father, Coo
Coo Marlin. The Columbia, Tenn., resident will drive a Dodge next
season.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are some of the differences in racing now and when you
started?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are tons more technology than what Dad had back when he
started. It was a lot more laid-back then, a lot more. The first
time I ever raced, I drove the car to the track. We bought a '64
Chevelle for 100 bucks, took it to Nashville Speedway, won $50 with
it and drove it home. Back then we borrowed parts from other
drivers. If you didn't have it, they'd loan it to you. It's a lot
different now.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How would you grade yourself on your season so far?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not good as a team. We've lost four engines, and we've done a
lot of stupid stuff. We ran second at Sonoma, but we had a lot of
potentially good finishes that we threw away. We've got to get
better.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is the purchase of your team by Chip Ganassi going to
affect the team?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's going to be a lot better. Felix Sabates is a super guy,
but he just doesn't know racing. People can tell him anything. He's
had the wool pulled over his eyes many times since he's owned the
team. Chip Ganassi has been racing since he was 14, and he knows
what's going on. They can't fool him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How have the deaths on the circuit affected you?
</P>
<P>
   A: It can happen anytime. It's been that way since '94 when it
happened to Neil Bonnett at Daytona. You don't really dwell on it.
I feel safer in the race car than I do on the street. I've done it
all my life, and I just enjoy doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much time do you have away from the track?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've usually got Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. I've got a
Chevrolet dealership at home, and my boy, Steadman, is racing, and
I try to help him with his car. I do some promotional stuff for
Chevrolet and Coors and I enjoy doing that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does it mean to you to be switching to Dodge next year?
</P>
<P>
   A: It'll be the best opportunity I've had to win since I drove
the No. 4 car.
</P>
<P>
   We'll have a good chance to win every week. I believe that we'll
be in the top 5 in points this time next year. I'm really looking
forward to it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you still hunt for Civil War relics?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah, when I get time. I found about fifteen 69-caliber
bullets a couple of months ago. A guy called me and said, ``You'd
better come quick, they're doing some excavating and found them.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you get into relic hunting?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've always liked history. That's one of the subjects I was
pretty good at in school, and my mom talked a lot about the Civil
War when I was younger. They fought and camped within a mile of my
house.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But isn't it difficult to be leaving Chevrolet because of
your family's connections with Chevrolet.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's kind of odd because my dad and Friday Hassler were the
only ones that had Chevrolet back in the old days.
</P>
<P>
   Dodge had some neat cars back then _ the old Dodge Daytonas and
426 hemis were great.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, Burton headed wrong way in Winston Cup points race
</P>
<P>
   By Michael Carvell
</P>
<P>
   c. 2000 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   Pardon Mark Martin and Ward Burton if they are feeling down.
That's the direction the veteran Winston Cup drivers have been
heading in the points standings over the past month.
</P>
<P>
   Both arrived at Pocono Raceway three weeks ago as legitimate
contenders for the Winston Cup championship. Martin had fought his
way to sixth overall, overcoming a series of late spring struggles.
Burton was in third place behind Dale Jarrett and leader Bobby
Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference two races make. After the Brickyard 400,
Martin has dropped to 10th. Burton is hanging on to seventh, but
losing ground.
</P>
<P>
   No driver has fallen as fast and hard as Martin, who finished
43rd in two consecutive events. A blown engine at Pocono Raceway
and an early wreck at Indianapolis Motor Speedway have Martin
calling his roller-coaster season ``almost laughable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I wasn't even all that mad (after the wreck),'' Martin
said. ``If that would have happened a year ago I would have had to
either kill myself or some one. I really didn't get that mad
because it's just like, 'I can't believe it.' That's why it took me
so long to get out of the car _ I wasn't hurt, I was just stunned.
I couldn't believe that I was wrecked on lap 15.''
</P>
<P>
   With the elusive first circuit trophy out of sight, Martin is
focusing on victories rather than points for the rest of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``All it does is take a little bit of stress and strain off of
scoring every point, and puts a little bit more stress and strain
on just sheer performance,'' Martin said. ``So it's still just as
strenuous, but the strain is in a little different focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in the points championship you never want to lose a
point. If you're going to run sixth, you've got to kill yourself
for fifth. If you're not in the points championship, if you're
running sixth you've got to really try to kill yourself to figure
out how to get first out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton also has had his share of tough luck. He has finished no
higher than 18th in the last three events, igniting his free-fall
in the points standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we're a little bit down right now because we've
gotten our tails whipped a little bit, but we will get it turned
around,'' Burton said. ``I have complete faith in that. It's just
that hopefully it's sooner than later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been steadily moving upward for over a year and a half
now, and we've just found ourselves in a little bit of a slump. We'
ve got to stay positive and get out of it, and I believe we will.
We've just got to work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Big goal for `Little E'
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt Jr. has been in a recent slump, common for all
Winston Cup rookies, but ``Little E'' thinks he has a chance of
pulling off a little surprise at Watkins Glen this weekend. He won
the Busch race at the same track in 1999, making a daring pass on
Ron Fellows during the final lap.
</P>

   ``I may be biased because we won there last year (in the Busch
Series), but Watkins Glen is a cool place _ a really cool track,''
Earnhardt Jr. said. ``The track has long straights and several good
places to pass. You can be more aggressive there than at Sears
Point, so that suits my style.''

<P>
   Eight to go for Shawna
</P>
<P>
   Shawna Robinson is only eight races away from becoming the first
woman to finish in the top 10 of the points standings in a national
oval-track series. Robinson, 35, is eighth in the ARCA points after
a dozen events.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things can happen and there is a lot of racing
left,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a chance to make a run at a lot of the teams ahead of
us in the standings. We want to keep an eye on the ones behind us
because there are some teams pretty close, but this team looks
ahead instead of behind. We'd like to be able to make a really
strong points run the last part of the season.''

   OTHER CAREER MOVES BEFORE ENTERING POLITICS
</P>
<P>
   First, he found his own way back to politics.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wanted nothing to do with his father's line of work
after watching the Vietnam fiasco. And had all the legislation in
the world kept the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. from getting
shot? When his father was turned out of office in what historians
regard asa particularly dirty race in 1970, Al Gore not only walked
away, he walked away mad.
</P>
<P>
   After he got back from Vietnam, he turned down all the
invitations to political functions that poured in from his dad's
old friends, who were eager to adopt him. He showed next to no
interest in discussing politics. Even on the night that President
Richard M. Nixon resigned, he stayed home instead of joining
friends at a party.
</P>
<P>
   He had been a journalist in the Army, and after his discharge
took a job writing obits and cop stories for the Tennesseean. At
night, he attended divinity school for about a year, though he
never felt a call to the ministry. For him, this was mostly an
effort to puzzle through the morality of the war through a
structured, intellectual exercise.
</P>
<P>
   But he hoped to make a life in newspapers, or at least a
rarefied version of that life. ``I was expecting that my path would
take me to writing either journalism of a different level,'' he
said grandly, without the slightest embarrassment. ``or books of
the sort our family friend David Halberstam was writing.''
Halberstam is a Pulitzer prize-winning reporter and author of `The
Best and the Brightest.'
</P>
<P>
   Seigenthaler had made a habit of hiring celebrity offspring like
Gore, including Robert F. Kennedy's son, David, and Hank Aaron's
daughter, Gaile. The paper's longtime city editor, Frank Ritter,
edited them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget the lead David Kennedy put on a story about
the locusts who come out and mate every 13 years,'' Ritter said,
laughing. The story, which never ran, began, ``If you had not had
sex in 13 years, you'd be screaming, too.' But Al was all
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   He approached the lowliest assignments with great industry.
``Even when he was asked to cover the Christmas parade,'' said one
former colleague, Alan Carmichael, who now owns a PR firm in
Knoxville, ``it was a very serious project for him.'' (The byline
on that one was ``Ebenezer Scrooge, as told to Albert Gore, Jr.'')
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gore did not fail to notice that he was no competition for
Halberstam. ``I saw a lot of others who did better stories,'' he
said, ``day after day after day.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-workers saw that he was in journalism mostly to influence
public policy. And in that, too, he was ultimately disappointed.
After graduating to investigative pieces, he became convinced that
some members of the local Metro Council were demanding bribes from
developers in return for scheduling their zoning cases.
</P>
<P>
   With Seigenthaler's blessing, Gore worked with law enforcement
on a sting operation _ a relationship that many journalists these
days would consider too cozy. But when a case against a council
member went to trial, the defense accused the paper of going after
that official because he was black. The jury deadlocked along
racial lines, a mistrial was declared and the man was acquitted at
a second trial. Colleagues remember that Gore was devastated.
</P>
<P>
   And it was that experience, he says, that ultimately led him to
explore a career in the law, and then circle back to politics. ``It
was a kind of call to arms,'' said Gore, who often speaks about his
work in moral and even religious terms. ``This process held nearly
sacred is being defiled and good people need to jump in and help
the forces of good prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, though _ and without ever committing himself _ Gore had
already prepared himself to take advantage of the
``once-in-a-lifetime opportunity'' that presented itself when
Evins, who was considered congressman-for-life, decided to retire.
Though he says he did not have a political run in mind at the time,
while still in college he took a summer course in Tennessee history
and bought into a real estate venture in Tennessee's fourth
district that in addition to making him some money provided him
with business credentials there.
</P>
<P>
   As he says, ``Even though I really had closed the door'' as a
young man, ``I had left a trail of bread crumbs.''
</P>
<P>
   LAUNCHING THE CAMPAIGN, AND KEEPING DAD AT A DISTANCE
</P>
<P>
   One of the first decisions the 27-year-old congressional
candidate made was to tell his father, the former senator, to stay
out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours after hearing from Seigenthaler, Al and Tipper had
already packed a bag and were driving from their apartment in
Nashville to their farm in Carthage, which soon became campaign
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Later that same night, Gore called his parents to tell them he
was running for his father's old House seat. As Gore remembers it,
the former senator was initially unenthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had begun to see how much of life he had been missing.
There was no `Yipee!' He said, `Al, it's such a hard life, I hate
for you to put yourself through this.' ''

</P>
<P>
   Before long, though, Gore said, his father's ``zest for battle
came bubbling up and he was raring to go.'' And at that point, Gore
told the senator point blank that he would have to sit out the
campaign _ much as George W. Bush seems to have sidelined his
father during his first political race, also for a freshly vacant
House seat, in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was adamant that the senator would have to refrain from
making a single speech or statement on his behalf. ``He didn't
understand it or like it, but I insisted,'' the vice president
said.
</P>
<P>
   Was that a hard conversation to have? ``Not really,'' he said
coolly. ``It was hard for him to hear it. But I didn't want to be
elected as his son.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet this distancing strategy was as tricky in 1976 as it is
today. Though the elder Gore had lost statewide in 1970, he was
still well regarded in his old House district, even if the district
was more conservative than the former senator.
</P>
<P>
   There were no burning issues in the race. And among the 9
candidates, all Democrats, the favorite was majority leader of the
Tennessee House, Stanley Rogers, who had their party's support sewn
up.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gore's campaign press secretary, Ken Jost, a colleague at
the Tennesseean, said it never really occurred to him that Gore
might actually win.
</P>
<P>
   And plenty of people thought the only way Gore could even hope
to prevail was by exploiting the familial connection he was busy
running away from. Gore, though, balked at this, and thought the
key was to outwork the competition, And that's what he did,
starting the morning he announced his candidacy _right after he
threw up in a public restroom inside the Smith County courthouse.
Day after day, he drove the backroads of middle Tennessee, and ran
across fields to ask farmers for their support. On one occasion, he
even climbed a telephone pole to shake hands with the lineman.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Gore was not anyone's idea of a natural on the stump,
and he stuck with the same two tired jokes throughout the campaign,
though they almost never got a laugh. (He told one of them, about
the Republican kittens who became Democrats _ ``They have their
eyes open now,'' _ on the trail again only recently.)
</P>
<P>
   After one of his more rousing efforts at speechifying, at a
cattle auction in Murfreesboro, ``there was not one ounce of
applause,'' recalled Carmichael, who wrote about the campaign for
the Tennesseean.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he kept going back, asking for support time and time
again, and in many cases wore people down.
</P>
<P>
   Several longtime supporters in Tennessee said in recent
interviews that they took his lack of God-given talent for
backslapping and baby-kissing as proof that he was getting into
politics for the right reasons. When they saw him breaking a sweat,
they approved.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Gore's jam-packed campaign schedule and hours-long
town hall meetings have been seen as a sign of desperation in his
race against Bush, whose pace is more leisurely. But even after
Gore won his congressional seat, he held something like 1,200 town
meetings. The exact number of meetings held, like the number of
burgers sold by McDonald's, was always the last line in Rep. Gore's
press releases.
</P>
<P>
   And right or wrong, it is Gore's enduring belief that the winner
is usually the guy who works the hardest. Last fall, at the peak of
the Bill Bradley boomlet, Armistead had lunch with his old friend
and told Gore he was a little worried that Bradley might take the
nomination away from him.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, though, seemed perfectly serene. There had already been a
turning point in the race, he declared _ one somehow overlooked by
all the pundits. ``He told me he thought the turning point was that
Bradley had to leave a debate in New Hampshire'' soon after it was
over, leaving Gore alone to work the crowd for hours more.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he knew he would win after that, and he tied it back
to `76,'' Armistead recalled. He said, `It was just like when Stan
Rogers had to walk off and leave that crowd of people at the
Alexander County Fair and I got to stay and answer all their
questions.' ''
</P>
<P>
   RUNNING AND FINANCING THE CAMPAIGN LARGELY BY HIMSELF
</P>
<P>
   In those days, Gore not only made all the major decisions in his
campaign, but financed it, too, like some indie film project, with
loans and maxed out credit cards. He took out a $50,000 loan and
kicked in a total of $125,000 of his own money.
</P>
<P>
   Though his father was not wealthy while Gore was growing up, he
did make a lot of money after losing his Senate seat in 1970. And
at age 27, the younger Gore already had a substantial bank account,
owing mostly the homebuilding business and another real estate
venture his family had brought him in on. His donations to his own
campaign accounted for more than two-thirds of the $188,560 he
raised in the race at a time when his financial statements showed a
net worth of $273,841.

<P>
   He wrote some of his own press releases and drove himself
around, too, speeding to hit the maximum number of events and using
a CB radio _ his handle was ``Carthage Campaigner'' _ to avoid
getting caught.
</P>
<P>
   Though aides insist that he has long since gotten over the
inclination to run his own campaign, Gore still does not seem able
to resist involving himself in the details. He reads his clips
closely enough to be able to spar over word choice, and is
remarkably well versed on the gossip from his campaign plane. On
the Fourth of July, a rare day off for the vice president, he
called a reporter several times to talk about some photos he had
agreed to provide The New York Times. Once, he called to get
directions for the assistant who was to drop off the packet, and
later he called back to make sure it had arrived.
</P>
<P>
   In his first race, though, he could serve as his own driver
without getting accused of micro-managing. And he was ferrying his
wife, his press secretary, Jost, and a reporter, Carmichael,
between campaign stops one day when Carmichael unexpectedly asked
whether Gore had ever smoked pot.
</P>
<P>
   Carmichael said Gore immediately stopped the car, got out and
walked around for a few minutes _ a technique the vice president
still uses in interviews. Recently, after being asked a sensitive
question over the phone, he repeated a couple of times that he was
losing the connection. ``What? I'm losing you.'' Then he went on
and answered.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore came back to the car where Carmichael was waiting, he
said he would not answer the question because it had not been put
to the other candidates. And eventually, the question was withdrawn
and a scandal averted.
</P>
<P>
   What everyone covering the race did write about, though, was the
surprisingly conservative ground staked out by Gore, who felt he
had to distance himself from his father's liberalism.
</P>
<P>
   It paid off, too; He surprised everyone by snagging an
endorsement from the right-leaning Nashville Banner, a paper that
had always been a harsh critic of his father's. The Banner had been
sold to Gannett several years earlier, but still retained its
conservative voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very important in establishing credibility to have
gotten the Banner's endorsement,'' said Gore's press secretary in
the race, Jost. ``The editorial board of a decidedly Republican,
conservative newspaper thought he'd be a good congressman, too.''
</P>
<P>
   His strongest competition in the race, Stan Rogers, now says
that both he and Gore, whom he supports, pandered in that race.
``No doubt about it, Al postured himself in a more conservative
image, but we both did, so I can't blame him. I attempted to paint
him as the liberal even though that's what I was. I just tried to
paint the senior brush on him'' _ as in Albert Gore, Senior _ ``but
the senator was not photographed, not seen in the campaign until
election night when it was all over, and that was smart.''
</P>
<P>
   In the campaign, Gore also spoke against gun control, and a week
before the primary told a crowd, ``I don't believe a woman's
freedom to live her own life, in all cases, outweighs the fetus'
right to life.'' Both of these positions were news to his former
colleagues at the Tennesseean, where he had written an editorial
expressing outrage over the proliferation of cheap handguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the political spectrum, I would have put him as a liberal
Democrat,'' said Lloyd Armour, who ran the paper's editorial page
for many years. And he didn't run as that? ``Oh, no, he wouldn't
have dared,'' his former boss said. ``Middle Tennessee is
conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore turned in his last editorial just a few hours before he
quit the paper to run for Congress. And already in campaign mode,
the words he'd written were more colorful than usual. The piece
never ran, but Armour still remembers how it began: ``Education in
Tennessee is a damned disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   After Gore was elected, he would often stop back in at the
Tennesseean at the end of a full day of town hall meetings. Then
he'd plop down at a desk, and write his own story _ complete with a
news hook _ rather than just issuing a press release. His old
editor, Ritter, was usually running the desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you didn't have any staff on the weekend so he saved you a
lot of trouble,'' Ritter said. ``He'd go set the hot type, read the
proof and made the corrections, too,'' if you'd let him, he
laughed. ``Then we'd put our feet up on the desk late and have
coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in one such late night session that Ritter finally asked
his friend about his surprisingly conservative campaign positions
on abortion and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Al, how in the world can you not support gun control?
The Tennesseean has always been for strict gun control.' He said,
`Frank, they all hunt in my district and there's no way in the
world I could win if I came out against guns.''
</P>
<P>
   On abortion, Ritter said, ``He said, `Here's my position. I
don't believe government funds should ever be used to finance
abortions.' Of course, he's really changed that now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritter, an enthusiastic mid-life convert to Catholicism, is fond
of Gore and has a signed photo of the vice president and his wife
meeting the pope in his office at the Tennessean. But when asked
where he thinks Gore really stands, he said, ``On those two issues,
I have no idea. If I was a one-issue man and that was my one issue,
either gun control or abortion, I'd be leery.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has remained consistent on some of the relatively
conservative views he expressed back then _ on national defense and
criminal justice, for example. But of course, he now categorically
supports gay rights, strong gun control legislation and abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   When he called homosexuality ``abnormal,'' was he pandering, or
did he really think that? ``That was a view, a statement I long
since retracted,'' he said. ``I don't think that way'' any more, he
added, ``because I've long since learned better. But I was
encumbered with a stereotype, and the bad news is that statement
was an accurate reflection of my belief at the time. It wasn't a
pose.''
</P>
<P>
   On gun control, he admits to changing his position to suit his
constituents, but also says, ``If I had had a strong belief that it
was really important, I would have said so. I did not see it as a
compelling issue at that time. I really didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   On other issues, including abortion, he says, ``I've grown in
the last 24 years, seriously.'' But overall, he insists he listed
only a little to the right to win the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's unfair to say I probably leaned more
conservative,'' he said, ``but they still were all positions I was
comfortable with at the time. Even at Harvard, I was more moderate
than all my friends. I don't think you can say that was a pose.''
</P>
<P>
   A NARROW VICTORY, AND AN ELATED FATHER
</P>
<P>
   Late into the night of the Aug. 5 primary that would decide the
race, it was still too close to call, and as Steve Armistead drove
Gore to his victory party at the Holiday Inn in Lebanon, half an
hour away, they still didn't know if he had won or lost.
</P>
<P>
   Armistead had also driven his friend to a party at Nashville's
Hermitage Hotel the night his father lost his senate seat in 1970.
In the car that night, Gore had quietly told Armistead that his
father had come to him and asked him to write his victory speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew there was not going to be any victory speech,''
Armistead said. ``But he went in and made an effort to write it
rather than say, `Dad, this race has been over for a long time.'''
</P>
<P>
   When they arrived at the party in Lebanon, Gore sensed that his
friends were steeling themselves for another Gore loss.
</P>
<P>
   The tally went back and forth. But Gore's home base in Smith
County was one of the last to be counted, around 11 p.m., and Gore
ended up winning by just a few thousand votes, receiving 32 percent
of the vote to Rogers' 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at last, the elder Gore was allowed up on stage to speak,
though he was by some accounts nearly delirious with feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was never one to express himself a whole lot, but that was
explosion night for him,'' said Armistead. ``He was hollering,
shaking the hands. Senator Gore was just overly excited.''
</P>
<P>
   The papers the next day reported that the senior Gore told the
crowd, ``You elected me to Congress when I was 29 years old, and
you elected Al at the age of 28. He's starting out one year earlier
than I did, so maybe that means he'll go one step farther.'' In
fact, the senator had gone to Washington at 30, but this was not a
night for quibbles.
</P>
<P>
   Gore himself was so excited he just kept on thanking people.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time in the race, he emphasized his family
ties. ``I have a family that teaches you what public service is all
about,'' he said in his speech. ``That is what my family has taught
me.''

SHORTAGE PROMPTS OFFICIALS TO URGE DELAY ON FLU SHOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE BARNARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts residents will have to wait longer than
usual for the flu vaccine to arrive this year, and the supply will
be limited, prompting public health officials to urge people who
aren't acutely at risk to hold off on getting their shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Department of Public Health, which orders
about half the vaccines administered in the state, had requested
65,000 more doses than the state received last year, but instead,
officials expect to end up with 28,000 fewer doses.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, state officials want at-risk groups _ including the
elderly, people with chronic illnesses or weak immune systems,
women past the first trimester of pregnancy, health care workers,
and children _ to be vaccinated first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to, of necessity, focus on the highest risk people
first, but it does not mean that ultimately we can't immunize
others,'' said Dr. Alfred DeMaria, director of communicable
diseases at the state Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Public flu clinics, usually held in early September, will be
postponed two to four weeks, said DeMaria. He expects a shortfall
of at least 88,000 doses: The state ordered 745,000 to be
distributed this year.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is essentially a bad harvest, he said. Every year,
the World Health Organization holds a sort of virus popularity
contest, choosing the year's most prevalent flu strains as
ingredients for the vaccine on the hunch that they will also be the
most aggressive viruses the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Private companies licensed by the Food and Drug Administration
then take those strains, inject them into chicken eggs, and wait
for them to proliferate. The resulting crop is made into vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not always that simple: Because the manufacturers work
with different viruses each year, it is hard to predict how long
they will take to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like pregnancy,'' DeMaria said. ``You can't be
exact about when the baby's coming.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, one of the three strains, a new one called A-Panama
H-3 N-2, proved harder to grow than expected. It is the first time
that all the licensed manufacturers experienced problems
simultaneously, according to the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The other two strains, named after the places they were first
identified, are A-New Caledonia H-1 N-1; and B-Yamanashi.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the delay, two of the four manufacturers, Parkedale
Pharmaceuticals of Rochester, Mich., and Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories
of Marietta, Pa., were cited by the FDA for production problems.
The other two are Aventis Pasteur, Swiftwater, Pa., Medeva Pharma
Ltd., in the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control is urging organizers of
flu-vaccine campaigns nationwide to delay their programs by about a
month and take care of high-risk patients first.
</P>
<P>
   The problem comes at an unfortunate time; the Centers for
Disease Control this year lowered the recommended age for flu
vaccination to 50 from 65, so more vaccine is needed than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC estimates that the number of people at risk for serious
complications, such as hospitalization, is 70 million to 76
million. It is too soon to estimate how many doses will actually be
available, said spokeswoman Bernadette Burden.
</P>
<P>
   Once flu season begins and officials can see how aggressive the
flu is this year, DeMaria said, it will be easier to estimate how
many doses are needed.

GOING WITHOUT SAYING: MORE BUMPERS ARE BARE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARCIA BIEDERMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``My other car is a broom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rush is right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``World peace. (or whirled peas).''
</P>
<P>
   Long before Internet chat and constant-talk radio, Americans
expressed themselves on their cars. The Vietnam War was debated on
chrome: the peace symbols of the left versus the red, white and
blue slogans of the right. In 1972, the Texas Memorial Museum in
Austin examined the trend with an exhibit, ``Bumper Stickers: A
History of 20 Turbulent Years.'' And that was before President
Nixon's detractors came up with the self-congratulatory, ``Don't
Blame Me _ I Voted McGovern.''
</P>
<P>
   But as times have calmed and road manners have declined, bumpers
travel stickerless in much of the country. Not only do fewer
motorists show their political stripes, but fewer jalopies
proclaim, ``This car climbed Mount Washington.'' Drivers are seldom
asked if they hugged their kids today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fewer people are putting stickers on their cars,'' said Paul
Rosa, owner of Idiot Ink, a maker of bumper stickers in Manhattan.
``There are very few people making a living from this.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's cars are partly responsible, those in the business say.
Contoured, plastic-coated bumpers seem more sacrosanct than the
metal appendages of yesteryear. Those who lease are reluctant to
make adhesive-backed statements, since any residual damage can cost
them at the end of the term.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are die-hards. Robert Kempton of Staten Island,
N.Y., has 15 Christian-theme stickers on the back of his Plymouth
Voyager, including ``Eternity: Smoking or Non-Smoking?'' He
recently bought two more.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to spreading the gospel, ``they keep me out of
trouble,'' Kempton said. ``I can't pull into a bar.''
</P>
<P>
   But many motorists, mindful of road rage and political
polarization, seem reluctant to wear their hearts on their cars'
sleeves. ``If a person sees another person with a Hillary Clinton
bumper sticker, and they don't like her, they might bump the car,''
said Alan Handell, owner of Zale Koff Graphics in Manhattan, which
makes stickers and other materials for Democratic candidates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other reasons have more to do with the bottom line of modern
campaigns. Orders at Handell's company have dropped 50 percent in
five years. Money that campaigns once spent on printed materials
has gone to television, radio and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   First used in Warren G. Harding's successful presidential
campaign of 1920, bumper stickers became a fixture with the 1952
Eisenhower-Stevenson race, said Edmund Sullivan, former director of
the Museum of American Political Life in West Hartford, Conn. They
thrived until 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Troy, a professor of history at McGill University in
Montreal and author of ``See How They Ran,'' a history of American
presidential electioneering, said the turning point came during
Jimmy Carter's presidential bid. Under severe budget constraints,
the Carter campaign decided bumper stickers were a luxury and used
the money for television instead.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a backlash, Troy said. ``Party operatives and
people involved in grass-roots campaigning wanted the bumper
stickers, the buttons, the stupid little hats,'' he said. Some
money was restored.
</P>
<P>
   Troy said demand for stickers subsided in subsequent
presidential races. Now, he says, the only place where he sees many
campaign stickers is in Washington, where their display by those in
political jobs ``is more calculated than passionate,'' or at the
national political conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Weiner, president of Financial Innovations Inc. in
Cranston, R.I., which has produced Democratic merchandise since
1980, said, ``Definitely, the use of bumper stickers has been down
in the last eight years.'' Still, he said, stickers are popular in
``politically active'' areas like Ohio and Massachusetts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weiner's company sells Gore campaign stickers and other
paraphernalia through its Web site, www.goregoods.com. A single
bumper sticker is $4 plus $4.95 for shipping; another site,
www.goregear.com, sells stickers for $1 plus $2 shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Enthusiasm for a candidate plays a role, Weiner said, noting
that at least 10 million bumper stickers were produced for
President Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign, high by contemporary
standards.
</P>
<P>
   This year, sticker orders indicate enthusiasm for the Republican
ticket, said Ted Jackson, owner of the Spalding Group in
Louisville, Ky., the sole licensee for the George W. Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like 1984, the Reagan re-election,'' said Jackson,
adding that demand is far stronger than it was for the Dole
candidacy four years ago. His company's Web site,
www.georgewbushstore.com., sells stickers in minimum orders of 25
at 75 cents each; one comes free with every order of other goods,
like Bush polo shirts or bottled water. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For other types of stickers, too, strong sentiments tend to get
bumper space. Religious themes remain popular, along with
pro-choice and anti-abortion slogans, but sexual references and
profanity are gaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best sellers are in-your-face,'' said Rosa of Idiot Ink,
which sells through Sam Goody music stores and Spencer Gifts. Rosa
started his business 10 years ago, selling his first sticker (``My
kid beat up your honor student'') at comedy clubs where he
performed. Tastes have coarsened since. His current No. 1 sticker
involves beer, sex and ugly people.
</P>
<P>
   A New York FM station has taken advantage of the trend. WNEW's
``WOW'' stickers seem innocent enough, but those familiar with an
afternoon show on that station recognize the initials as a
reference to a campaign urging women to bare their breasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done a lot of promotions, but this one is phenomenal,''
said Ken Stevens, the station's general manager. ``You see them
everywhere.'' He said the campaign, which has been criticized as
offensive to women, has shown that people will use a bumper sticker
``only if they're passionate about it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For decades, average Americans felt that passion for politics,
said Troy, the historian. ``It was the national pastime.'' These
days, ``we brand ourselves less politically than stylistically,''
he said. ``Now shopping is the national pastime.''

A SHOW OF UNITY BY BUSH, MCCAIN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LODI, Calif. _ Standing as allies here for the first time since
their primary match-up, Governor George W. Bush and Senator John S.
McCain gave a show of unity Thursday in this heavyweight electoral
state, hoping to steal some thunder from the Democratic convention
set to begin here next week.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, the Arizona Republican who ran as a maverick commmitted
to overhauling the campaign finance system, lavished Bush with
praise, encouraging the hundreds of thousands of independents who
supported him in California to transfer their support to Bush. And
the Texas governor returned the favor, saying that it was ``awfully
helpful to have John McCain by my side'' in independent states and
more liberal areas such as the ones they campaigned in Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Both men sought to erase memories of their bitter disagreements
_ and, at times, negative tactics _ during the Republican
primaries. Arriving by plane in Monterey Thursday morning, Bush was
greeted on the airport tarmac by McCain, who gave him a
half-embrace. Half an hour later, McCain introduced Bush at a small
appearance at a museum devoted to author John Steinbeck. The two
then addressed a crowd of thousands at a train stop rally before
embarking on a three-hour journey through Central California. They
are scheduled to travel through Oregon and Washington, holding two
fund-raisers before returning for a night at McCain's Sedona ranch
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The events were part of a delicate strategy of utilizing McCain
in places where he had the greatest appeal during the primaries
without focusing so much attention on the Arizona senator that he
overshadows the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   And McCain seemed to know the limits of his role. Displaying
little of the fiery dynamism that marked his brief candidacy,
McCain spoke quietly and embraced ideas being stressed by the Bush
campaign. He did not mention his signature issue, campaign finance
reform, until asked by a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, meanwhile, used the backdrop of the National Steinbeck
Center to emphasize his commitment to the downtrodden, restating
his pledge, if elected president, to sign the reauthorization of
the 1996 Welfare Reform Act before its scheduled expiration in
2002. Claiming success with Texas welfare legislation that he
signed into law, Bush said, ``I think one of the real dangers as we
head into the 21st century is that some might be left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks were a counterpoint to similar claims made by his
Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore, who Thursday used a
campaign stop in Atlanta to tout the success of the Clinton
administration's welfare-reform program. Gore said that the Clinton
program had ``moved millions from welfare to work,'' saying that
with 6.6 million people on welfare nationwide the rolls are the
lowest they've been since 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides responded by pointing out that the Texas initiative
became law in 1995, a year before Clinton signed the federal bill.
And Bush's communications director, Karen Hughes, said that it was
only under duress that the Democratic administration did so.
``President Clinton vetoed welfare reform twice before reluctantly
signing it,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaigning in California came as a new independent poll
suggested that hemight have a real shot here. In a survey of more
than 2,000 adults taken before Gore announced his running mate, the
Public Policy Institute of California found that Gore had 40
percent of the support, while Bush had 37 percent. With a 2.5 to
3.5 percent margin of error, that would mean the two were running
in a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   In his appearances Thursday, McCain provided a little more humor
than is normal at Bush campaign events, calling Bush ``a good,
decent man, with his wonderful wife _ the brains of the outfit.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and McCain brushed off questions about their
differences, despite occasional signs of lingering animosity
between the two staffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I campaigned with John McCain. I campaigned against John
McCain. We've gone full cycle,'' Bush said. ``We were friends
before, and we're friends now.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain jumped in, adding: ``We share the core principles of the
Republican party. . . . Primaries are tough. They aren't bean
bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Thursday afternoon, as the train rolled throught the farm
hills of Central california, Bush and Mccain held a wide ranging
discussion with reporters, talking about everything from their
evolving relationship to the tactics of the Gore campaign. The two
men appeared relatively at ease with one another, although both
seemed to choose their words with care.
</P>
<P>
   Asked wether he would attend a Bush fund-raiser that drew in
so-called soft money, Mccain said he would prefer not to, but
refused to condem Bush for holding such events. Indeed, Mccain
practically gave Bush a green light to raise soft money, saying it
would be unfair to ask him to ``unilaterally disarm.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in turn, said he would never ask Mcain to attend. ``I'm
his friend,'' he said.

 &HT;    Healtheon/WebMD revenues quadruple in 'incredible quarter'
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Healtheon/WebMD on Thursday reported a quadrupling of
revenues and losses 29 times deeper than a year ago _ results the
company said amounted to ``an incredible quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, analysts agreed with the company's
interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be the way the Internet economy works.
Healtheon/WebMD, which means to electronically link everyone on the
health care system, is expected by analysts to virtually hemorrhage
money quarter-after-quarter. Analysts think that's fine as long it
is pouring money into acquiring competitors and stamping its brand
name in consumers' minds.
</P>
<P>
   So it was apparently acceptable to analysts that the
Atlanta-based company reported a loss of $518 million or $2.64 a
share, compared to a loss of $17.6 million or 25 cents a share a
year ago. Sales were $101.1 million during the three months ending
June 30, compared to just $22.7 million during the same period of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was less than what analysts predicted. Net losses, not
including non-cash charges, were $55.5 million, or 28 cents a
share. Consensus of analysts projected a 34 cent-a-share loss.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, companies compare results from year to year, but
so much has changed in the Net and for Healtheon/WebMD, that it
makes more sense to compare with the previous quarter, said Jeff
Arnold, chief executive officer. And compared to the first quarter
of this year, Healtheon/WebMD saw not just climbing revenues but a
decline in its loss, excluding non-cash charges.
</P>
<P>
   That is what counts, Arnold said. ``The loss number year over
year is irrelevant. What is more important is the sequential growth
from first quarter to second. And we had an incredible quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon/WebMD revenues were $65.9 million during the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold blamed most of the second quarter loss on the cost of
acqusitions and on a high-profile marketing campaign. The company
in May completed its acquisition of Envoy Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Growth meant economies of scale _ less cost in handling
transactions, Arnold said. That meant a widening profit margin, he
said. ``We were able to show that there is leverage in our business
model. As we grew the revenue we could apply 50 percent of it right
to the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold predicted profitability next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you trend it out, we will be profitable prior to the fourth
quarter of 2001 and that is before we (complete acquisitions of)
Medical manager and CareInsite.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold said the company's travails have not shaken his
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe the Internet can create efficiencies in
healthcare, and I don't see how you can not believe it, since
healthcare is so inefficient, we don't see how you can say anybody
other than us is in the best position to attack that
vulnerability.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts supported the company's interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Wieland, analyst at Prudential Securities, wrote that
``these are truly outstanding results, proving the company is
executing on its e-health connectivity strategy and successfully
integrating the assets of past acquisitions.''
</P>
<P>
   He called Healtheon/WebMD ``the unquestionable leader in the
e-health space,'' and predicted that the stock price _ which has
been sliding for a year _ will more than double.
</P>
<P>
   But Troy Dayton of Dresdner RCM Global Funds told Dow Jones that
the company _ and the Internet _ have a long way to go before
business success can be judged. Moreover, Healtheon/WebMD has made
so many recent acquisitions that it cannot yet be seen as a unified
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a decent quarter,'' he said. ``But these guys are going
to have to continue to show that they can integrate their
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon/WebMD stock continues to reflect investors' skepticism
about the Net, as well as the company. Shares on Thursday were
unchanged at $11.88, a 52-week low. The stock, which in early 1999
crested over $100, reached a 52-week high of $71.06 in January.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Stephen DeNelsky told Dow
Jones that the loss should be seen in perspective. ``The quarter
was not a disaster. They held things together nicely. It is not a
quarter that will make people go out and say 'I need to own the
stock today.'''
</P>
<P>
   The company this week also found itself defending Jim Clark,
founder of Healtheon before its merger with WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times column noted that since his April promise to
purchase $600 million in stock, he had bought a relative pittance.
Clark and the company say he was constrained by securities
regulations intended to prevent insiders from manipulating the
stock or committing fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The stock price has continued to languish, hurting a number of
investors, including some big ones.
</P>
<P>
   Janus, for instance, plunked down $930 million to buy 9 percent
of the company in February, according to the Wall Street Journal.

THREE-PRONG STRATEGY IN TIRE RECALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANTHONY FLINT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Faced with the business-crippling prospect of consumers
associating its tires with blowouts and death, Bridgetone/Firestone
Inc. is attempting to pull off a three-part strategy with its
massive tire recall: calm consumers, maintain civil ties with its
biggest partner Ford Motor Co., and limit damage from lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The product liability side of the equation will sort itself out
in the years ahead, litigation specialists say, with responsibility
for the unraveling tires perhaps ultimately shared, in some
proportion, by Firestone and Ford.
</P>
<P>
   But it may be too late for Firestone's image in the marketplace,
where consumers have long memories and the landscape is littered
with brands that have been tainted by recalls or mishaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone says, `Oh, you have new tires, what brand are
they, are they Firestone?,' my bet is (they'll be) quite a few
people who say they don't want that brand,'' said Stephen A.
Greyser, professor of marketing and communications at Harvard
Business School.
</P>
<P>
   ``One certainly could make an argument that says Firestone was
slow to respond, and did not take ownership, did not put the
consumer front and center,'' said Greyser, an expert in crisis
management. ``They may have underestimated the importance of
consumer confidence in terms of the reputation of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Firestone, owned by the Japanese parent company Bridgestone,
issued the recall Wednesday of 6.5 million Wilderness AT, ATX and
ATX tires for 15-inch rims, most of them on Ford sport utility
vehicles and pickup trucks. The action followed 50 lawsuits, 46
deaths, 80 injuries and a federal investigation of treads peeling
off tires on traveling vehicles, prompting rollovers and crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from both Firestone and Ford say they acted as quickly
as possible, but trial lawyers and consumer and safety advocates
say the problem should have been addressed sooner, particularly
after recalls of tires with similar problems in seven foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy for a critic to parachute in and say they should be
reacting to any death anywhere in the world. I'm not suggesting a
knee-jerk reaction, but by the time the deaths get up to 46,
somewhere between one and 46, that's the point where the company
one would think would take steps,'' said Greyser.
</P>
<P>
   The recall will neither establish responsibility for Firestone
nor extinguish future lawsuits, said Edwin Woodsome, partner at the
Los Angeles law firm of Howrey, Simon, Arnold and White, who
specializes in complex business litigation including product
liability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly one of the byproducts of a recall is the hope you do
head off future problems. But we've only seen the tip of the
iceberg,,'' said Woodsome.
</P>
<P>
   Two national class-action suits have already been filed. The
American Trial Lawyers Association of America has put together a
working group so plaintiff attorneys can share information and
possibly join forces. Several attorneys have complained that in the
cases settled thus far, Firestone has insisted on a gag order so
victims can not talk about their cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recall helps them by making them look like they're trying
to do the right thing, though it's part and parcel of damage
control,'' said David Heinlein, attorney with the Boston firm of
Heinlein &AMP; Beeler.
</P>
<P>
   After the first step of the recall, legal analysts say, there
may be an apportionment of blame involving both Firestone and Ford.
Ford's recommendation that tires be inflated to a lesser degree
than Firestone could play into the analysis, for example. When
tires are underinflated, there is more rubber on the road and heat
builds up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you underinflate a tire, if there's a heavy load, and if
you drive faster than the speed rating, the tire gets hot and can
disintegrate,'' said Russ Evans, a representative of the
International Tire Association, an informal trade group based in
Farmington, Conn. Heat is used to attach the tread and can make the
tread peel off, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Evans said Ford almost certainly helped design the
recalled tires for specific use on its vehicles. ``The tire is part
of the suspension system, it affects traction and mileage,'' he
said. ``All the manufacturers have gotten into the tire design
business.''
</P>
<P>
   There have reportedly been behind-the-scenes tensions between
Firestone and Ford on the inflation recommendations, but Ford is
one of Firestone's biggest customers and Firestone wants to
maintain future business.
</P>
<P>
   However, Firestone may not need to point fingers at Ford,
because plaintiffs' lawyers will almost certainly seek to scutinize
the full scope of liability, said Heinlein. ``They'll do that work
for them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Firestone can manage to stay on an even keel through the
coming thicket of litigation, the company faces its greatest
challenge in the rehabilitation of its brand name, marketing
experts say. This week's recall is the second largest for tires in
the U.S.; the largest, of 14.5 million tires, was in 1978 and was
also by Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   That recall was government-ordered, and although regulators did
not force this recall, Firestone officials are facing an
investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration. At the same time, Firestone will have to assure
consumers that only a small number of its products are at issue in
the recall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things they can do in the future. They may come
up with a process improvement or an improved tire, with third-party
independent testers, or their own tests monitored by a third-party,
to re-evoke consumer confidence,'' said Gesyer. `I'm not suggesting
the brand is dead, but they have to do some revitalization there.''

S.C.)  
 GORE MAKES IT CLEAR: HE'S NOT WRITING OFF THE SOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Ala., Ky., Ark., Miss., Tenn., Conn., Fla., N.C., By KEVIN SACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Vice President Al Gore surrounded himself with
centrist Democratic governors from Southern states Thursday and
delivered a stemwinding populist speech in an effort to declare
that the South is still in play in this year's election.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside Gore, a middle Tennessean and a Southern Baptist,
stood his running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, a Connecticut Yankee
and an Orthodox Jew whose introduction to the South came in 1963
when he helped register black voters in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   That would not have always been an alluring resume to many of
the independent white Southerners whom Gore and Lieberman must
capture in order to win states like Georgia this year. But the
Democrats gamely played up both Lieberman's religion and his
history Thursday, calculating that the South has changed, that
Lieberman's selection will excite minority voters, and that the
ticket's centrism may appeal to white Southerners.
</P>
<P>
   At the rally in Centennial Olympic Park, a New South symbol if
ever there was one, Lieberman said he saw ``how good our nation can
be'' when he watched his fellow student volunteers put their lives
on the line to register voters in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, my friends, in this great city of Atlanta, Georgia, I
am so proud to stand before you as the first Jewish-American lucky
enough to be a major party candidate for vice president of the
United States,'' he said. ``And when I look at Al Gore, the man who
made it possible, and I think about the courage and character that
went into making this decision, once again I see a glimpse of how
good our nation can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Most recent public polls, some of which are quite dated, show
Gore trailing his Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas,
in every Southern state except for his native Tennessee, and the
race appears closer than expected there. But Gore campaign
officials maintain that Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina
and Tennessee remain in play.
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategists said Thursday they were confident that
the resurgent appeal of statewide Democratic candidates in the
South would not transfer to a national election, and that Gore will
not replicate President Clinton's success in winning four Southern
states in both 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters in the South have for several decades made distinctions
between state Democrats and national Democrats,'' said Q. Whitfield
Ayres, a Republican pollster based here, ``and it's difficult for
national Democrats to convince Southern voters that they are
similar to the moderate Democratic governors they have elected.''
</P>
<P>
   But several of the Democratic governors disagreed, saying that
Lieberman's selection had been received warmly in their states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The values people had when I was growing up _ respect of
marriage and family, respect of the Sabbath, that's what they see
in Joe Lieberman,'' said Gov. James Hunt of North Carolina, who is
completing his fourth term.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said the choice helped by demonstrating Gore's
independence. ``Look,'' he said, ``we Southerners are not aliens
from another planet. Attitudes have changed, and the stereotype of
the South of 50 years ago is not the South of today. And remember,
populism was born in the South.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore embraced that populist tradition Thursday when he told the
crowd he would raise the minimum wage, provide prescription drug
benefits for seniors, lower school class sizes and ``take medical
decisions away from bureaucrats who work for HMOs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you remember what it was like eight years ago?'' he asked.
Someone in the crowd answered: ``Pitiful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitiful; you are exactly right,'' Gore said. ``We had $300
billion annual budget deficits. That bunch had quadrupled the
national debt in little over a decade. We were broke. High
unemployment. We'd had the worst recession since the 1930s. We saw
crime rising, families breaking up at a higher rate. All the
problems were worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that President Clinton and he had changed things, and
he reminded his audience that Bush said in his nomination
acceptance speech that the Democrats had ``coasted through
prosperity'' and taken the path of least resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish there had been less resistance,'' Gore said. ``I cast
the tie-breaking vote after all the ones on the other side voted no
for the change that was so needed. I wish there had been less
resistance when they shut down the government, not once but twice.
I wish there had been less resistance when we brought about the
changes that have now led to a dramatic transformation in our
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman also responded to Republican attacks, saying that the
Bush campaign's charges that the last eight years have been
squandered were ``nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you,'' he said, ``if you're one of the people
working in one of the 22 million jobs that have been created in
this country since 1993, these haven't been squandered years.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was joined Thursday by Gov. Don Siegelman of Alabama and
Gov. Paul Patton of Kentucky, along with Barnes and Hunt. Two other
Democratic governors from the South, Ronnie Musgrove of Mississippi
and Jim Hodges of South Carolina, did not attend.

   GORE-BIO-HOUSERACE (Undated) _ From his earliest days on the
stump, Al Gore showed both the best and the worst of himself as a
candidate. In his 1976 House race, he won because he outworked the
competition and had his facts down cold. Yet he also turned off
even some old friends in the process by presenting himself as more
conservative than he was. In that race, Gore's first job was to
differentiate himself from his father, Sen. Albert Gore, just as in
this one, the vice president must separate himself from another
political force, Bill Clinton. The question for Al Gore was then
and is now: Is he his own man? Often, for Gore, being his own man
has often meant going it alone. By Melinda Henneberger. (The story

Researchers have found that fervent fans become so tied to their
teams that they experience hormonal surges and other physiological
changes while watching games, much as the athletes themselves do.
Testosterone levels in male fans go up significantly after their
team wins and drop sharply after a loss, one study found. And while
science has not yet grappled rigorously with the broad question of

trip. Trot Nixon has emerged as a pretty good leadoff hitter.
Jurassic Carl Everett has erupted once more, and Pedro Martinez has
won twice and lost a three-hitter. The Sox played a
5-hour-34-minute game in Seattle and a 2:02 game in Anaheim.
Overall, they are 6-7 with three to play before they come home for
a 10-game stand.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox went to sleep in their Texas hotel after the sun came up
Thursday and Williams promised a true offday. Even Joe Kerrigan _
the nutty professor of pitching coaches _ said he would abstain
from going to the ballpark. Kerrigan and rehab project Bret
Saberhagen planned to play a little catch, but they may have used
the ballroom of the hotel to stay out of the stifling Texas heat.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox lost four straight after Everett returned from his
10-game suspension and have scored only seven runs in their last
four games. No one has used the wacky schedule as an excuse, but
it's easy to see the tired eyes in the clubhouse and the tired bats
at home plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not any secret that this has been strange,'' said Nomar
Garciaparra, who went 1 for 10 in Anaheim, but won Wednesday's game
with a three-run homer in the third. ``But we're not going to make
excuses. Every team has had to do something like this, I think. I
know it felt weird when we were in Boston for just those three
days. Guys were falling asleep at 4 in the morning. We were playing
day games and we were still on West Coast time.''
</P>
<P>
   Nomar's once-.400 batting average is ``down'' to .385.
Meanwhile, Everett went 1 for 12 in Anaheim and is at .311. After
hitting 20 homers in Boston's first 49 games, he has only seven in
his last 42 games. Since the beginning of July, he's done most of
his damage off the field.
</P>
<P>
   But what's most discouraging to Red Sox fans is the feeble
midseason acquisitions made by general manager Dan Duquette. After
years of success picking through the junkyard, this time it appears
the Duke has come away with bald tires and little else.
</P>
<P>
   While the Yankees picked up Denny Neagle, David Justice, Luis
Polonia, Luis Sojo, Glenallen Hill, and Jose Canseco, the Sox
answered with Ed Sprague, Bernard Gilkey, Mike Lansing, Rico
Brogna, and Rolando Arrojo. In Anaheim, Angels addition Ron Gant
tomahawked three home runs against Boston. The Red Sox acquired no
one with those abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Entering this season, many fans were fed up with John Valentin
and his $5 million salary, but Valentin (out for the season with a
knee injury) would look pretty good at third base right now.
Sprague has been dismal, hitting .206 with two homers and nine RBIs
in 30 games. Since Sprague replaced Wilton Veras, the Red Sox have
gotten virtually no production from their third basemen all season.
It was quite a moment when stylin' Manny Alexander pinch hit for
Sprague and hit a home run off Angels reliever Mark Petkovsek in
the ninth inning Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Was Sprague hurt?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, just a manager's decision,'' said Williams.
</P>
<P>
   And now they're working out Brian Daubach at third base.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing Frye with Lansing (.279) has been a wash. There is
nothing harmful, nor spectacular, about Lansing's game, but the Sox
are in need of more. Brogna hasn't had much of a chance yet, but
doesn't look like he's going to help this year. Sox fans were
hoping for something more than a ninth-inning defensive replacement
for Daubach. Gilkey is hitting .224 with one home run and seven
RBIs in 49 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Boston ranks 11th in the American League in scoring. Only
Detroit, Minnesota, and Tampa Bay have scored fewer runs. The Sox
scored a total of three runs in a three-game stretch (all losses)
during this trip and let's not forget the night they had 16
consecutive scoreless innings in Seattle. They are 12-18 in one-run
games.
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo is winless in two starts with a 6.55 ERA. He gets the
ball again Friday night against Texas's Ryan Glynn. The Sox go with
Tim Wakefield (6-6, and now the No. 2 starter) Saturday night and
Tomo Ohka (0-2) Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to figure who's going to carry the Sox into the
postseason. With Ramon Martinez on the shelf and Saberhagen slowed
in his comeback, there's going to be trouble with the spate of
makeup games down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's win snapped a four-game losing streak and the
usually reserved Williams admitted, ``Maybe it was important for
our whole team's confidence. We've lost some tough games.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: The weight of carrying the entire team appears to
be wearing a bit on Messrs. Garciaparra, P. Martinez, and Everett,
but the fading Sox are still in the hunt as they wrap up their last
monster trip in the heat and heart of Texas.

GOP TO NETWORKS: `NOT A MINUTE MORE' FOR DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Pa., Ariz.)   By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the race to be president, every second counts. At least that
was the message Republican officials sought to convey Thursday in
demanding that the three major television networks devote ``not a
minute more'' air time to the Democrats' convention next week in
Los Angeles than they had to the Republican gathering in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, the chairman of the Republican National
Committee, said in letters to the presidents of the news divisions
of ABC, CBS and NBC that he was concerned about reports ``that you
now plan to expand and augment your coverage in Los Angeles next
week.''
</P>
<P>
   He added the hope that ``based on your commitment to fair and
unbiased reporting, you will devote the same amount of time to the
Democrats' convention as you did to ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief among Nicholson's worries is that a speech to be delivered
by President Clinton on the convention's opening night, Monday,
will be given more coverage than the address by Gen. Colin L.
Powell on the first night of the Republican gathering.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman noted that CBS and ABC ran only portions of
Powell's speech _ NBC covered it only on its cable channel, MSNBC _
and that a speech by Laura Bush, the wife of Gov. George W. Bush,
which preceded Powell's address, received even less attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you now planning to give live coverage to Tipper Gore's
speech at the Democrats' convention?'' Nicholson wrote. ``And will
you be airing all of Bill Clinton's opening night speech?''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of ABC, NBC and CBS said Thursday that they planned
essentially to devote the same prime time coverage to the Democrats
as to the Republicans, but they rejected the idea that either party
could press them to match coverage minute to minute. They also
indicated that the president's speech may have more news value than
Powell's and so it may be harder to interrupt the coverage of his
address.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Friedman, executive vice president of ABC News, said
deciding how much time to devote was up to the networks. ``We'll
make decisions on the right amount of time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Akhtar, a spokeswoman for CBS News, said her organization
was using ``the exact same format'' in Los Angeles. ``But the
extent of our coverage is dependent upon news value. Our editorial
judgment of news events is not based on some minute-by-minute
calculation.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman's letters were not only a reflection of how
assiduously politicians seek television parity, but also how
decisive convention exposure on the networks was perceived to be.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford D. May, director of communications for the Republican
committee, said the treatment of the convention by the broadcast
networks, which commanded the bulk of the television audience, was
a major factor in the campaign. ``These are the parties' featured
events every four years,'' he said, ``and how much air time they're
given we think does really have an influence and an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   And because commercial television time is so expensive, May
added, ``If you give one party more time than the other, then in
effect you're making a campaign contribution to that party.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the broadcast networks have been scaling back their
prime-time commitment to conventions, Nicholson's objections seem
to be less about the total amount of exposure than about the
content of the coverage. The cable networks and PBS tend to
concentrate a lot more on what is happening on the podium, where
the parties' messages are conveyed most directly.
</P>
<P>
   A study by C-SPAN showed, for instance, that while PBS, CNN and
the Fox News Channel all devoted more than six hours to covering
speeches at the Republican convention, ABC, CBS and NBC each
covered between two and three hours of podium speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Network officials said Nicholson was not taking into account
their ability to be flexible about coverage. NBC News, in fact,
added a half-hour of prime-time coverage on the second night of the
Republican convention to broadcast the speech of Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz. Barbara Levin, an NBC spokeswoman, said the extra half hour
this time would be used for the president's address on Monday.

 &HT;    Competition's stiff for starters, reserves alike
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _It's usually obvious this far into training camp who's
going to make an NFL roster, with a few exceptions, and who's going
to start. But several jobs remain up for grabs on the Falcons
heading into tonight's preseason game against the Cincinnati
Bengals at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hotly contested positions during the preseason has
been defensive line, where starting tackles Shane Dronett and
Travis Hall have been receiving a push from Ed Jasper. Jasper will
start beside Dronett in tonight's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to measure, but competition makes us all better,''
said Dronett, who played at the University of Texas. ``Ed's a good
Texas guy (who played at Texas A&AMP;M). The bottom line is I think
we're going to be stout up front.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like to say is, that which doesn't kill you, makes you
stronger,'' he added. ``Or, it embarrasses you.''
</P>
<P>
   The race at backup running back is crowded by rookie free agent
Maurice Smith and veterans Ron Rivers, Gary Downs, Byron Hanspard,
Ken Oxendine and Winslow Oliver. Jamal Anderson, a lock, won't
handicap that race.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more competition now than since I've been here, no
question,'' said Anderson, who's entering his seventh season with
the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   And not just at running back. The secondary, wide receivers and
reserve quarterbacks all have tight competitions in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Former cornerback Ronnie Bradford began training camp at
starting free safety, but Gerald McBurrows is now co-No. 1. At wide
receiver, Terance Mathis, Shawn Jefferson and Tim Dwight are
golden, and 6-foot-5 Brian Finneran, who was added to the practice
squad late last season, appears close to locking up a berth.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran, Jammi German, Eugene Baker, Ronnie Harris, sixth-round
choice Mareno Philyaw and Kamil Loud are battling for probably two
spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to keep the best football players,'' receivers
coach Jack Burns said, ``and special teams will factor into it with
regard to (reserves).''
</P>
<P>
   At quarterback, Danny Kanell and Tony Graziani are competing for
the backup job. The loser might be cut, because rookie free agent
Doug Johnson could be kept as a developmental project at No. 3
quarterback.

 &HT;    Lawyer: Expect numerous lawsuits against Firestone
 &HT;    By Chuck McGinness
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A flood of lawsuits is expected
nationwide in the wake of a decision by Bridgestone/Firestone Inc.
to recall 6.5 million tires linked to at least 46 deaths, a West
Palm Beach attorney said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Don Fountain said he is now investigating 12 cases involving
Firestone tires in Florida, Georgia, California, Arizona and New
Mexico. That's the same number of defective tire cases involving
all manufacturers that he has handled in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has received
nearly 300 complaints about blowouts and accidents caused by tire
threads peeling off the Firestone ATX, ATX II and Wilderness
models. Initially, most of the complaints were from hot-weather
states _ Florida, Texas and California _ but they are now coming in
from all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of accidents and injuries will continue to rise as the
agency's investigation gets more attention, NHTSA officials said.
More than 100 lawsuits were filed nationwide in the past four
years, and about a third have already been settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're only seeing the tip of the iceberg,'' Fountain said.
``You'll see a lot more of them now.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, a recall of the Firestone 500 tires cost the
company more than $155 million and resulted in hundreds of
lawsuits. Financial analysts estimate the latest recall will cost
the tire maker about $300 million, not counting any liability
associated with the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of the tires are on Ford sport utility vehicles
and light pickup trucks, including the top-selling Ford Explorer.
Nissan, Toyota and Subaru also use the tires on their vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Crigger, executive vice president of Bridgestone/Firestone,
said the company has not been able to pinpoint any defect in the
tires. It's possible that driving in hot temperatures with
under-inflated tires may be factors in the reported accidents,
Crigger said.
</P>
<P>
   Fountain said he has shown in past cases that tire separation is
a manufacturing flaw. The Firestone tires do not have a ``heat
shrinkable nylon cap'' to hold the steel belts to the casings, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Firestone tires are the target of the NHTSA
investigation, Fountain said he has seen similar problems with
other tires.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, he won a $15 million verdict in Los Angeles
against Dunlop Tire Corp. and a Ford dealership for a California
man who was left a quadriplegic after a 1997 accident cause by a
tire blowout.
</P>
<P>
   Fountain said he will file suit in Palm Beach County Circuit
Court in the next month against BF Goodrich and Michelin North
America Inc., which purchased Goodrich in 1986, over an April 1999
accident that killed three children.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Ellis, 15; her sister, Fiona, 12; and brother, Andrew, 7,
were riding with their uncle, Michael Ellis, when his van blew a
tire and veered off State Road 80 near Belle Glade into a canal.
They were returning home to West Palm Beach from the First
Apostolic Church in Pahokee.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Ellis, the children's father and a preacher at the
church, was driving ahead of the van and watched the accident from
his rear-view mirror. He tried to save his children, but the van
sunk before he could reach it.

HOLLYWOOD IS SET TO EMBRACE LIEBERMAN CAUTIOUSLY 
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The entertainment industry is facing the
Democratic National Convention here next week with some last-minute
jitters: Vice President Al Gore's choice of Sen. Joseph Lieberman
as his running mate has chilled wealthy Hollywood Democrats, who
are upset that Lieberman is one of the Senate's most vocal critics
of Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   With moguls like Lew Wasserman, the former chairman of MCA, and
David Geffen, one of the owners of Dreamworks, and stars like
Barbra Streisand set to open their gated compounds for Democratic
fund-raisers and parties, Hollywood is hardly in a mood to publicly
voice nervousness about Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Democrats here who were once dismayed about his
negative views of Hollywood are now eager to play them down, if not
ignore them, while Republicans are delighted to remind Democrats
that Lieberman's positions on Hollywood are precisely those of many
in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so ironic _ they pick the chief Democratic critic of
Clinton as well as Hollywood,'' said Tom Strickler, a partner at
the Endeavor talent agency, and a Republican who supports George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Lieberman said that if the entertainment industry
``continues to market death and degradation to our children and
continues to pay no heed to the genuine bloodshed staining our
communities, then one way or the other the government will act.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Senate's most fierce Democratic critic of Hollywood and
what he views as society's moral decay, Lieberman has led hearings
on violence in video games and deplored sex and violence in films
and television. The fact that Lieberman has over the years teamed
up with William Bennett, who served in the cabinets of Presidents
Ronald Reagan and George Bush and has denounced Hollywood's values,
has also angered Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has called some top Hollywood supporters to ask what they
thought of his choice as running mate and received positive
response. But his own relationship with Hollywood is hardly as warm
as that of President Clinton, who not only seemed to enjoy palling
around with Geffen and the Hollywood elite, but raised millions of
dollars in campaign contributions here. In return, Clinton treated
his supporters here seriously, giving them the kind of importance
they crave.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Wiatt, a top talent agent who is president and chief
executive of the William Morris agency, and a Democrat, said,
``It's intolerable to think of the government regulating our
business and content, and Senator Lieberman has been vocal to the
point where he needs to tone down his rhetoric and not make this
industry the whipping boy for the decline of Western
civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wiatt added that the campaign is hardly about one issue, and
that Lieberman's record on most issues was in accord with many
people in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Warren Beatty, the actor who is also a liberal
Democrat, spoke a bit haltingly about Lieberman and his positions.
``I don't think it's possible to attribute the high level of mayhem
in this country to movies and music,'' Beatty said. ``He's a
talented man and an honest man. He's a man of obvious truthfulness.
He's a conservative Democrat. There's no question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Berg, chairman of International Creative Management, a top
talent agency, said: ``Some of the things Lieberman has said about
lyrics, content and theme are in basic conflict with the creative
process. I disagree with that specific theme. I still think the
vice president made a bold choice in picking him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's boldness in selecting an Orthodox Jew was greeted with
enthusiasm and some uneasiness in a community that has seen attacks
on Hollywood by conservatives and Christian fundamentalists as
veiled anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   But the selection has, in a way, turned the issue upside down.
Republicans here said that had their vice presidential candidate,
Dick Cheney, condemned Hollywood and invoked God in his speeches,
Hollywood would have been in an uproar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats could have selected Idi Amin as vice president
and Hollywood would have welcomed him,'' said Strickler, the talent
agent. ``There's so much hypocrisy here. The people here accept
every invitation to the White House. Except when they had a
conference on violence in the media. No one showed up for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lionel Chetwynd, a writer-producer who identified himself ``as
one of the three out-of-the-closest Republicans in Hollywood,''
said that the fact that Lieberman talks about his religion and God
_ and is not a right-wing zealot _ has left Hollywood liberals
confused.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the wealthiest Democrats in the entertainment
business who are especially friendly with Clinton _ at least
publicly _ were delighted with Gore's selection. ``It's a fantastic
choice!'' said Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman of Miramax, who is one
of the producers of a post-convention fund-raising show at the
Shrine next Thursday night. ``It reaches to the McCain
independents, it reaches a wider net.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Katzenberg, another owner of Dreamworks, said: ``Yes,
Lieberman has been critical, and held us in Hollywood to a very
high standard. It's not something we have often agreed upon in
terms of the solution. But to have someone as direct and honest and
doesn't pull punches is what leadership is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three decades, the heavily Democratic Hollywood
elite has used its money to embrace national candidates. But many
contributors here do so not simply because they agree with a
candidate on the issues, but because they revel in the games that
powerful politicians play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen people all the time hang out with politicians who
have one or two positions that would probably revolt one's values
or preferences,'' said Bob Bookman, a prominent literary agent at
the Creative Artists Agency, and a Democrat. ``But they're both
driven by a sense of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman will probably not hurt the Democratic ticket
financially. Gore has raised at least $880,000 in Hollywood,
according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. This
compares with about $688,000 raised by Bush and $22,000 for Ralph
Nader.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: A CONVENTION'S WORTH OF (PRETEND) CANDIDATES 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARYN JAMES    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a sly, perfectly timed nod to reality, the TNT film ``Running
Mates'' presents Tom Selleck as a candidate, James Pryce, who goes
to the Democratic convention at the Staples Center in Los Angeles
(where the actual Democratic convention begins on Monday). He has
sewn up the presidential nomination, and the event will be, as the
film puts it, ``a virtual coronation.''
</P>
<P>
   At the movie's turning point, Pryce is watching the television
news, sees that an abortion clinic has been bombed and stomps out
of his hotel room to go there. Aides try to hold him back, saying:
``Do we really have to get into this? It'll cost us.'' But the
indignant candidate says, ``If I'm going to run the country I'm
going to have to exercise an opinion at some point.'' Forget ``the
damn polls,'' he adds. Realism? There's a better chance of a
campaign getting soft money donations from Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Then the film tops itself. At the clinic Pryce actually tells a
gaggle of television cameramen, ``Why don't you turn those things
off?'' He has definitely become the candidate from another planet.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as one ad for the movie (to be shown Sunday night on TNT)
puts it with unintended meaning, ``Meet the candidate of your
dreams.'' He is the idealized fantasy figure of so much political
fiction: high-minded, ignoring polls, yet with a sexual history
that makes him human. Of course the fictional Pryce never takes a
stand on the abortion issue. (That would cost him with the movie's
audience, one way or another.) He does firmly _ and heroically, the
film would have us believe _ offer the opinion that bombing is bad.
And when he delivers a climactic speech, he talks about ``the
people'' being disenfranchised by ``the powerful,'' the inoffensive
political equivalent of a nondenominational prayer.
</P>
<P>
   The tepid ``Running Mates'' flounders because it is never sure
whether it wants to be satire or romantic sitcom (Pryce is
surrounded by women from his past) or political drama (he is
offered $100 million to choose the contributors' man as vice
president). But these telling central scenes reveal the soul of the
film, which is part of a feast of recent and forthcoming political
drama on television and film, in theater and books. (Several of the
films will be on television this weekend.)
</P>
<P>
   They are as up-to-the-minute as television's ``West Wing,''
which continues to gain momentum as the season's biggest success,
and as prescient as ``The Best Man,'' the Broadway revival of Gore
Vidal's 1960 play. They include post-Lewinsky cultural criticism,
as trenchant and enduring as that in Philip Roth's novel ``The
Human Stain'' and as vapid and already dated as that in Joe
Ezsterhas' fantasy memoir ``American Rhapsody.'' All reveal
something about the changing image of the president and national
politics and about the influence of the Clinton impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Roth approaches the issue in an effectively skewed way. ``The
Human Stain'' is about Coleman Silk, an academic forced to resign
when he is accused (falsely, he believes) of using a racist word;
who is having a quiet affair with an illiterate cleaning woman; and
who has an even more inflammatory secret in his past. This tragedy
about political, racial and sexual hypocrisy is set in the summer
of 1998, and Roth makes it clear that these events are part of the
same cultural moment as the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the summer in America when the nausea returned, when
the joking didn't stop,'' the narrator, Nathan Zuckerman, says,
``when the smallness of people was simply crushing ... and, on both
sides, people wondered `Why are we so crazy?''' People woke in the
morning to find ``they had dreamed of the brazenness of Bill
Clinton.'' Zuckerman himself dreams of a banner draped across the
White House reading: ``A HUMAN BEING LIVES HERE.''
</P>
<P>
   Most pop cultural versions of the president begin with a similar
humanity, then create a fantasy. It is now a given in fiction and
on screen that politics is a world of dirty tricks, scandal and
compromise. The ideal is a president like Pryce, who has a sexual
history but an insanely unrealistic idealism. He is human but also
better than that. (The multilayered title of George Stephanopoulos'
memoir captures the problem with real presidents: ``All Too
Human.'')
</P>
<P>
   In ``Running Mates,'' Selleck is a good guy faced with a
political dilemma: will he give in to the big money men, go along
with their piggish vice presidential candidate and become
president? Or will he choose the running mate so modest he stays at
a Holiday Inn, and who may cost him the election? In a film of such
predictable outcomes, this plot is not suspenseful.
</P>
<P>
   And Pryce's character is too whitewashed to be credible. In the
silliest scene, the women gather in the bathroom to discuss his
performance in bed, but the conversation reveals that his affairs
with his fund-raiser (Teri Hatcher), campaign manager (Laura
Linney) and political mentor's wife (Faye Dunaway) all happened
before he married. His devoted wife (Nancy Travis) is part of this
supposedly jolly forgive-all conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the film's grasp of image-making suggests how savvy
viewers have become about that aspect of politics. They know that
human failings are disguised for the sake of a political persona.
Fiction simply polishes the hero's image more.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Beatty's `Bulworth'
</P>
<P>
   Most films, like ``Running Mates,'' pander to the audience's
wishes. The rare exception is Warren Beatty's underrated 1998 film
``Bulworth'' (he is star, director and a writer), one of the best
political satires of recent years. He plays a California senator
running for re-election who at the start is sitting in his office
watching his own campaign ad. He hears himself say, ``I believe in
the old-fashioned values of honesty and decency and fidelity.'' He
hears himself oppose affirmative action. He is weeping with disgust
at the whole process, in the throes of an all-too-human meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   The funniest scenes are those in which the out-of-his-mind
Bulworth starts rapping, telling the truth in a world where honesty
equals political suicide. ``As long as you can pay, I'm gonna do it
all your way,'' he says, chanting, ``Big money/ Big money.''
</P>
<P>
   Beatty, in a brief interview on HBO, says, `` `Bulworth' is a
movie that you make when you know that you are not going to go out
and try to get votes.'' Someone should have dug up that quote
during his real-life, teasing flirtation with a presidential run
last year.
</P>
<P>
   `The American President'
</P>
<P>
   The satire of ``Bulworth'' is more scathing than all the hollow
speeches about people and power. The film has adult complexity and
political opinions. So does ``The American President.'' When the
film appeared in 1995, its most conspicuous element was the
sentimental love-at-first-sight plot, in which the widowed
president, Andrew Shepherd (Michael Douglas), dates an
environmental lobbyist, Sydney Ellen Wade (Annette Bening).
</P>
<P>
   Today the film, written by Aaron Sorkin (and directed by Rob
Reiner), reads like a blueprint for Sorkin's creation ``The West
Wing.'' It is filled with energetic White House staffers who are
adept at polling, public relations and political arm twisting. Even
the ``West Wing'' theme music echoes that of ``The American
President,'' though NBC says they were written by two different
people.
</P>
<P>
   At the start, the film focuses on the romance and wittily
demonstrates the the president is not an ordinary human. ``I'm just
a guy asking a girl over for a meal,'' he says, only to have Sydney
ask about a sudden noise. ``That's my ride,'' he tells her, as a
helicopter lands on the White House lawn.
</P>
<P>
   The film's villain, played by Richard Dreyfuss, is a
presidential candidate who attacks their affair and speaks before
the fictional Conservative Coalition of America. He asks, in a
speech that sounds awfully similar to some heard at the Republican
convention this month: ``Does New Hampshire want traditional
American values back in the White House? Does New Hampshire want
the pride back?''
</P>
<P>
   And when the Dreyfuss character invents sexual gossip about
Sydney, the heroic Shepherd won't retaliate in kind. ``They're
trying to get us to pitch the dirt.'' he says. ``Nobody wins these
fights.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `The West Wing'
</P>
<P>
   All this became the successful formula for ``The West Wing,''
with Martin Sheen promoted from his role as chief of staff in ``The
American President'' to president in the television series. His
Josiah Bartlet is more stentorian and pompous than the regular-guy
Shepherd, but they share a superhuman idealism. President Bartlet
is widely seen as a key to the show's success, tempering its
political realism with an idealized chief executive. This polished
image of the president plays well with real-life politicians. In
fact, on Sunday there will be a party on the ``West Wing'' set,
with people from the real White House (including John Podesta, the
chief of staff, and Joe Lockhart, the press secretary) visiting the
fictional Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Though media attention to scandals has exploded in recent years,
dirty politics is nothing new. ``The Best Man,'' which opens next
month, may be a clumsy old play but it is timely. It will keep its
original setting at a 1960 political convention in Philadelphia.
Charles Durning plays an aging president whose term is running out.
Spalding Gray and Chris Noth are the candidates fighting for his
endorsement and the nomination who have dirt on each other. (One
piece of information is sexual, the other about mental stability.)
``This is exactly the kind of thing I went into politics to stop!''
says Gray's character, the more reluctant to sling mud. ``The
business of gossip instead of issues, personalities instead of
policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Little has changed. In the forthcoming film ``The Contender,''
Joan Allen plays a senator named by the president (Jeff Bridges) to
fill the dead vice president's slot. Gary Oldman is the political
opposition who slimes her with her sexual past. ``Distortion.
Deception. Manipulation,'' says the film's trailer, offering a
catalog of politics as usual.
</P>
<P>
   The good guy in Joe's Klein's recent novel ``The Running Mate''
is Charlie Martin, a war-hero candidate in a tight Senate race. He
wonders whether to use damaging information about his opponent's
wife's abortion. And Martin's staff researches his own fiancee's
past, to protect themselves against damaging surprises. When she
finds out she says, ``You put on a good act, Charlie, almost
human.''
</P>
<P>
   This sluggish novel is not nearly as much fun as Klein's
``Primary Colors'' because it tries to graft the unconvincing
romance onto politics but lacks the charm that allows ``The
American President'' to get away with it. `Face-Time'
</P>
<P>
   Erik Tarloff's breezy, smart novel ``Face-Time'' is more
entertaining. The narrator is a White House speechwriter named Ben
whose girlfriend is having an affair with the president, who has
distinctly Clintonian traits. Ben is drawn by the president's
feel-their-pain sympathy for starving Africans, which he calls ``a
reaction more human than political.''
</P>
<P>
   But this novel knowingly exploits the idea that the president is
in a superhuman class of his own. ``How could I ever compete with
someone who occupied such a position, regardless of who and what he
was as a man?'' Ben wonders.
</P>
<P>
   His girlfriend pleads special circumstances. Getting any
``face-time'' with the president, much less sex time, is what she
calls ``the Holy Grail'' in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Politics can also be turned to nothing more than fun on screen.
Jim Lehrer's ``Last Debate'' is a clunky novel, but its mischievous
plot may work better in the forthcoming Showtime movie.
</P>
<P>
   James Garner and Audra McDonald play journalists who sabotage a
presidential debate between a racist, media-made candidate who is
poised to win and a good man who happens to be among the world's
worst campaigners. Ladies' Men
</P>
<P>
   Simply latching on to the political moment isn't enough, though.
In the fall television sitcom ``DAG,'' David Alan Grier is a Secret
Service agent who almost botches the job of guarding the president
and is demoted (yuk, yuk) to protecting the strong-willed first
lady (Delta Burke).
</P>
<P>
   The Off Broadway play ``High Infidelity,'' now in previews, has
a sitcom story, too. John Davidson plays a senator running for
President and Morgan Fairchild his wife. They go to counseling,
determined to save the marriage for political reasons. As the corny
title suggests, sexual secrets can't be far behind.
</P>
<P>
   But even a more pointed attempt at cultural criticism can fail
to grasp the moment. In ``American Rhapsody'' Ezsterhas uses a
he's-one-of-us baby boomer excuse to project his own ego on the
Clinton years. Once you've heard about the tabloid-friendly parts
(the monologue by the president's penis), the book's mixture of
fantasy and supposed fact is tedious, with a rehash of the Lewinsky
details that give new meaning to Clinton fatigue. Why bother with a
book that takes everything in Gennifer Flowers' memoirs as absolute
truth?
</P>
<P>
   The publisher lists ``American Rhapsody'' as nonfiction, and
even stranger things have happened with political books lately.
Last month, used bookstores had a run on a lame 1988 political
novel ``The Body Politic'' because one of its authors is Lynne
Cheney, wife of the Republican vice presidential candidate, Dick
Cheney. The book's fictional vice president (like Cheney, 59 years
old and a former secretary of defense) dies of a heart attack in an
adulterous moment with a network anchorwoman.
</P>
<P>
   His savvy press director has little trouble pretending that the
vice president is still alive because, as the book says, ``The vice
presidency is the worst kind of career move. Under the
Constitution, the only thing the job calls for is waiting: waiting
for the president to die or to be impeached.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the winds of political reality blow into fiction,
wittingly or not. But the best political drama treats its audience
as grown-ups and its characters as human, or at least partly human.

DOOR-TO-DOOR TALES FROM A NUMBERS MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa , Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   Charlie the enumerator remembers
when people used to answer their front doors with a smile. A lot of
us recall those times, when much business was done at the front
door _ someone selling something or wanting you to donate to their
charity. But now you barely see a Girl Scout on your porch unless
she's with her mother, and you know the mother.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Someone would ring the doorbell and he _ for often the seller
was a male _ would be holding a suitcase that was full of brushes,
or pots and pans or maybe encyclopedias, and asking if he could
come in. And people actually let him in the door. Trusting people
who didn't have big dogs or cans of mace, peep holes and dead
bolts.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest threat was his hustle, which might lead to writing
out a check for something you'd regret when a carton of baffling
vacuum cleaner attachments arrived in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   Pity the person who dares to knock these days. For, as Charlie
will tell you, he might be met by someone with a curse or a gun.
</P>
<P>
   But then, too, he might get invited into a stranger's life and
be the better for it. We lost more than access to chocolate mint
cookies when we became wary of the stranger on the other side of
the door.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie, who didn't want his real name used because of Census
Bureau confidentiality rules, has decided that maybe we really
don't have to be so afraid of each other, after all.
</P>
<P>
   On two different occasions as he made calls around California,
Charlie was met by a man with a gun. The first guy, upon hearing
that Charlie was with the government, explained he was a gunsmith
and just cleaning his collection. The second said he'd been doing a
little target practice. Both armed men live deep in the woods, and
each eyed Charlie like he was some kind of old-time ``revenuer''
sneaking around looking for a still, although it wasn't moonshine
they might be protecting. They answered his questions.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the front porch of another house, he started to ask
census questions of a young woman when he heard a man's voice yell
out in Spanish ``don't tell the S.O.B. anything.'' Charlie, who
spent most of his childhood in Mexico, hollered right back in
Spanish that if they didn't tell him anything today he'd be back
another day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before long, they were insisting I come inside, sit down, have
coffee. They said, `You're one of us.'''
</P>
<P>
   The same thing happened with a group of workers. ``When I walked
up, I heard them tell each other to be careful. I'm sure they
thought I was from the INS, but I told them right off it wasn't my
business if they were legal or not. We talked and I found out that
two of them were from the same part of Mexico where I grew up. We
all ended up eating tortillas and beans under a tree.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie's retired. He took a buyout from his company so he
doesn't have to work, but he says there are just so many days ``you
can enjoy your freedom to sit with a martini and look at the
view.'' He misses people. ``I would have paid the government to do
this,'' he says of his census job.
</P>
<P>
   A beer maker offered Charlie a sample, which he couldn't consume
on the job. But days later he returned with his own home brew so
the two could swap recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the woman who called out through her breezeway
that he should come around the back where she was sunning on her
patio.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was wearing sunglasses and nothing else. I tried to act as
antiseptic and businesslike as I could, but I could feel a trickle
of sweat running down my back.''
</P>
<P>
   An elderly couple had him come inside for tea and they talked
about their years in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   One woman started to cry when he asked how many people lived in
the home. ``Then she wanted me to give her advice about her
husband. I told her I thought counseling might be a good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   He got a tip on how to grow roses from a woman who insisted he
tour her garden. ``Alfalfa pellets and Epsom salts. I tried it and
it's working.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Trusting people is a two-way street,'' says Charlie. ``I show
that I trust a stranger by walking into their home, and they show
that they trust me enough to let me in. Of course I've got a piece
of plastic saying I'm who I say I am. But it made me realize how
we've become a society afraid of strangers.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that all are sweethearts. One day Charlie drove through an
open gate onto a piece of rural property to make a call. The
homeowner fumed at Charlie, ranted about government meddling and
then ran out and chained the gate shut so Charlie couldn't drive
out.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   It has long been assumed that ardent sports fans derive
excitement and a sense of community from rooting for a big-time
team. But a growing body of scientific evidence suggests that, for
some fans, the ties go much deeper.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers have found that fervent fans become so tied to
their teams that they experience hormonal surges and other
physiological changes while watching games, much as the athletes
themselves do.
</P>
<P>
   The self-esteem of some male and female fans also rises and
falls with a game's outcome, with losses affecting their optimism
about everything from getting a date to playing darts, one study
showed.
</P>
<P>
   Science is still grappling with many questions about why people
form such deep ties to sports teams, and it has not yet rigorously
confronted what may be the core question: Is avidly rooting for a
team good or bad for someone's health? But there are early clues,
some of them surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists have long suspected that many diehard fans are
lonely, alienated people searching for self-esteem by identifying
with a sports team. But a study at the University of Kansas
suggests just the opposite _ that sports fans suffer fewer bouts of
depression and alienation than do people who are uninterested in
sports.
</P>
<P>
   One theory traces the roots of fan psychology to a primitive
time when human beings lived in small tribes and warriors fighting
to protect tribes were true genetic representatives of their
people, psychologists say.
</P>
<P>
   In modern society, professional and college athletes play a
similar role for a city in the stylized war on a playing field, the
theory goes. Even though professional athletes are mercenaries in
every sense, their exploits may re-create the intense emotions in
some fans that tribal warfare may have in their ancestors. It may
also be these emotions that have in large part fueled the explosion
in the popularity of sports over the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sports heroes are our warriors,'' said Robert Cialdini, a
professor of psychology at the University of Arizona. ``This is not
some light diversion to be enjoyed for its inherent grace and
harmony. The self is centrally involved in the outcome of the
event. Whoever you root for represents you.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Cialdini pioneered research on fans in the 1970s. He began by
documenting that college sports fans were far more likely to wear
clothing with their team's logo on the day after victories than
after defeats, a phenomenon he called ``basking in reflected
glory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes possible to attain some sort of respect and regard
not by one's own achievements but by one's connection to
individuals of attainment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   His later research showed that sports fans tend to claim credit
for a team's success, saying ``we won'' to describe a victory, but
tend to distance themselves from a team's failure, saying ``they
lost'' when describing a defeat.
</P>
<P>
   But Cialdini's initial theories did not cover all spectators,
since some deeply committed fans, like the long suffering souls who
love the Chicago Cubs, remain loyal and fiercely attached to their
idols despite years of failure.
</P>
<P>
   Studies over the last decade showed that while the
run-of-the-mill spectator may abandon a team once it starts losing,
more committed fans, ride the same emotional roller-coaster as the
athletes themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, psychologists at the University of Kansas came up with
a survey for measuring a fan's attachment to his team. The scale
divides fans into high, low and moderate identification, based on
their responses to seven written questions.
</P>
<P>
   A raft of studies since then have that found ``highly
identified'' fans _ both men and women _ not only are less likely
to abandon a team when it is doing poorly, but tend to blame their
team's failures on officiating or bad luck rather than the other
team's skill. They also exhibit higher levels of physiological
arousal at games, spend more money on tickets and merchandise and
enjoy generally higher self-esteem than people uninterested in
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the highly identified fans who demonstrate this fierce
connection and feel elation and dejection along with the team,''
Cialdini said.

   Gene Hamm, a 37-year-old elevator mechanic from Staten Island,
says his passion for the New York Mets, ignited in his boyhood
during their wondrous 1969 season, has never been extinguished. He
watches every game he can on television, his emotions rising and
falling with every pitch, every hit, every managerial decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually feel myself sitting on the couch managing the
team,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm spent months at home last year, recuperating from a
job-related injury, and he said watching the Mets kept him from
slipping into depression. Then Kenny Rogers walked in the winning
run to seal the Atlanta Braves' victory over the Mets in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't walk in the winning run,'' he said, looking as if he
had swallowed a glass of lemon juice. ``I really wish they could
have won last year. That would have made me feel so much better.''

</P>
<P>
   Some recent studies suggest that some fans experience
physiological changes during a game or when shown photos of their
team.
</P>
<P>
   A study in Georgia has shown, for instance, that testosterone
levels in male fans rise markedly after a victory and drop just as
sharply after a defeat. The same pattern has been documented in
male animals who fight over a mate: Biologists theorize that
mammals may have evolved this way to ensure quick resolutions to
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   James Dabbs, a psychologist at Georgia State University, tested
saliva samples from different groups of sports fans before and
after important games.
</P>
<P>
   In one test, Dabbs took saliva samples from 21 Italian and
Brazilian men in Atlanta before and after Brazil's victory over
Italy in soccer's 1994 World Cup. The Brazilians' testosterone rose
28 percent on average, while the Italians' levels dropped 27
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In another study, at the University of Utah, Dabbs and a
colleague, Paul Bernhardt, found that male college basketball fans
whose responses to a questionnaire indicated they had a low opinion
of themselves registered the highest surges in testosterone after a
win.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dabbs said in an interview that the results suggest fans
empathize with the competitors to such a degree that they mentally
project themselves into the game and experience the same hormonal
surges athletes do. The contest, however, must be an important one,
like a playoff game, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really are tribal creatures,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Hillman, a psychologist now at the University of
Illinois, found that ardent football fans at the University of
Florida experienced extreme physiological arousal when they viewed
pictures of Gators football stars making game-winning plays, but
responded indifferently to pictures of other athletes and teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individuals that are highly identified with the team show
extreme arousal compared to the average fan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among zealous male and female fans, Hillman's study found, the
level of arousal _ measured by heart rate, brain waves and
perspiration _ was comparable to what the fans registered when
shown erotic photos or pictures of animal attacks, he said.

   For some fans, the emotional roller coaster of watching a game
can be addictive. John Herde, a 65-year-old accountant in
Manhattan, has been attending Rangers' games since he was a
teen-ager and owns season tickets. He remembers sitting in the
upper rows of the old Madison Square Garden as a boy and banging on
the ceiling when the team scored.
</P>
<P>
   What has brought him back to hockey games again and again, he
says, is the catharsis he feels when he gives free rein to his
anger or gloats openly in triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a release,'' he said. ``You can yell and scream and do
whatever. It's like therapy.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Edward Hirt of the University of Indiana has demonstrated that
an ardent fan's self-esteem tends to track a team's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Working with fans of Indiana University's basketball teams, Hirt
showed zealous fans pictures of very attractive members of the
opposite sex after a game and asked them to rate their ability to
get a date with that person.
</P>
<P>
   The results demonstrated that men and women who were diehard
fans were much more optimistic about their sex appeal after a
victory. They were also more sanguine about their ability to
perform well at mental and physical tests, like darts and word
games, Hirt found. When the team lost, that optimism evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   ``People identify themselves with a team through thick and
thin,'' he said. ``Your self-esteem will go up and down as your
team does well or poorly.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirt said the desire to belong to a group or society _ a need
once fulfilled mostly by religious and political organizations _
may explain why some fans remain loyal despite the repeated failure
of their teams. Fans of the Chicago Cubs, he pointed out, have not
enjoyed a World Series championship since 1908. Yet Wrigley Field
sells out almost every game.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Fans of the New York Jets present another example. The team has
not won a championship since 1969, when Joe Namath led the Jets to
a Super Bowl. In 1985, the Jets moved from Shea Stadium in Queens
to Giants Stadium in New Jersey, where they are a tenant in another
team's home.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Anzalone, a New York City firefighter, said he became
fascinated with the Jets when he was a boy in the 1960s, and
despite 30 years without a championship, has never lost faith in
the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an obsession,'' he says. ``The fans went over to New
Jersey and are still hanging tough, even with no Stadium and not
winning a Super Bowl since 1969.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Anzalone, who is 40, is better known as Fireman
Eddie to Jets' fans. Every game, he rides on his brother Frank's
shoulders, wearing a green and white fire helmet and leading the
fans in a J-E-T-S chant. His devotion to the team has gained him
some notoriety of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Anzalone's house in College Point, Queens, is painted green, the
Jets' color. He will only drive a green car. The room of his
3-year-old son Tyler is a shrine to the team, with footballs signed
by several Jets' most valuable players, a hat signed by Bill
Parcells and a team jacket from 1966.
</P>
<P>
   He says he still suffers with every loss. When Vinny Testaverde,
the Jets' quarterback, ruptured his Achilles' tendon early in the
opening game last season, Anzalone went to bed. ``I was sick to my
stomach,'' he said. ``I was sick that day. I knew the year was
shot.''

<P>
   In most cases, this deep attachment to a team can be healthy,
studies have found. Daniel Wann, a psychologist at Murray State
University in Kentucky, has done several studies showing that an
intense interest in a team can buffer people from depression and
foster feelings of self-worth and belonging.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Wann studied students at the University of Kansas,
demonstrating that ardent fans of basketball and baseball teams had
higher levels of self-esteem and suffered fewer bouts of depression
than did people who were not followers of sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of the traditional institutions are beginning to break
down, religion and family,'' Wann said. ``The human psyche is the
same and something has to take the place of that. Sports fills an
important void.''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Michelle Musler, one of the most visible Knicks' fans in New
York, acknowledges that her 27-year love affair with the team may
have had its genesis in loneliness.
</P>
<P>
   It began in the early 1970s. She was working, had been through a
divorce and had five children to raise. Once in a while, she said,
she got tickets from her company to Knicks games.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ex-husband ran away with the lady next door and I didn't
seem to fit into suburbia anymore,'' she said. ``The Knicks gave me
a purpose, something to do, a place to go. As a fan, I guess, there
is a sense of belonging. That you are a part of something.''
</P>
<P>
   Musler, 63, became a season-ticket holder in 1974 and has only
missed a handful of games since. A business consultant, she plans
her travel each year around the Knicks' schedule, tapes road games
to watch later and hoards newspaper accounts of her team. She once
flew through the night after an 18-hour day of work to make it back
from Hong Kong in time for a game.
</P>
<P>
   She has lost some friends over the Knicks, when she turned down
invitations to weddings and graduations because they conflicted
with the playoffs. These sacrifices, however, have repaid her, she
says, with new friends who share her obsession: sports writers,
team officials, season ticket holders and other fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened through the years is that the Knicks have
become my social life,'' she said.  &QL;

TWO CONGRESSMEN HOPE TO MEET WITH TAIWAN'S LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two lawmakers, one a Republican and the other a
Democrat, hope to meet with Taiwan's new leader during his
overnight layover in California on Sunday, despite warnings from
the State Department that the transit visa granted to President
Chen Shui-bian precludes public events, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed meeting, which immediately drew vigorous protests
from China, comes as President Clinton, party officials and
thousands of news reporters converge in Los Angeles for the
Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   It is the latest example of domestic brinkmanship over Taiwan, a
democratic island that enjoys broad support among members of
Congress, but which is considered a renegade province by China.
</P>
<P>
   The United States transferred diplomatic relations from the
government of the Republic of China on Taiwan to that of People's
Republic of China on the mainland in 1979, but has maintained
unofficial ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, under pressure from Congress, the Clinton
administration granted a visa to Taiwan's former president, Lee
Teng-hui, to visit his alma mater, Cornell University, in Ithaca,
N.Y. Although this was billed as a private visit, Beijing was
infuriated by what it saw as a move to upgrade Taiwan's
international status. In protest, it withdrew its ambassador from
the United States and conducted war games that culminated in the
firing of missiles in the vicinity of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., and Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn.,
said they would seek to meet with Chen, perhaps in the Long Beach
hotel where the Taiwanese leader is expected to rest overnight
before continuing on to the Caribbean on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope and expect to meet with President Chen in Los
Angeles,'' said Gejdenson, the ranking Democrat on the House
International Relations Committee. ``President Chen can provide us
all with a unique perspective on developments in the Asia-Pacific
region, including mainland China.''
</P>
<P>
   Gejdenson portrayed the proposed meeting as ``private,'' and
asserted, ``I don't believe that the State Department should
attempt to shut off this dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said the
transit visa granted to Chen was done ``for the safety, convenience
and comfort of the traveler'' and would rule out public meetings or
contacts with the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials noted, however, that Chen will not be
physically restricted to the Los Angeles airport, leaving them
largely powerless to bar encounters they view as inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just stick with the fact that this is a transit,''
Boucher said. ``We would expect the activities to be consistent
with that.'' He added: ``There are certainly not going to be any
meetings with administration officials.''
</P>
<P>
   As a courtesy, Chen will be greeted by the chairman of the
American Institute in Taiwan, the nominally private organization
that handles Washington's unofficial diplomatic relations with the
island, Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials angrily criticized what they said was an
attempt by the lawmakers to showcase American support for an
independent Taiwan with cameras already trained on Los Angeles for
the Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   Yuan Zhang, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy here, said
Beijing had been given assurances by the administration that Chen
would not play politics on American soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time they say it's a private visit, only for the comfort
and convenience of the traveler,'' Zhang said. ``But once the
arrangement is made, the Taiwanese officials take advantage of this
to engage in separatist activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the lawmakers said Chen's supporters have pressed
eagerly for the meeting, but Chen, who in the past advocated formal
independence for Taiwan, has so far failed to commit himself to it
because of pressure from the administration. The State Department
declined to characterize its contacts with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Al Santoli, Rohrabacher's foreign policy adviser, accused the
administration of trampling on democratic principles in order to
placate Chinese officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has nothing to do with offending Beijing,'' Santoli said.
``It's actually none of Beijing's business. This is our sovereign
territory.''

VERMONT RULING GIVES FRESH FOCUS TO CAMPAIGN REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Vt., Ind.)   By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A federal judge Thursday threw out parts of the
sweeping election-money overhaul that took effect in Vermont this
year, setting the stage for the latest major legal challenge to the
country's campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   The state may not impose mandatory spending limits on
candidates, he ruled, nor may it limit contributions from political
parties and from out-of-staters.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge, William K. Sessions III of U.S. District Court,
upheld Vermont's contribution limits, which are the lowest in the
country for individual donors to candidates. Contributors may give
a statewide candidate no more than $400 each, and a candidate for
the state House of Representatives no more than $200.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of change in the campaign finance system said that
though the ruling went partly against them, they welcomed it,
because Sessions seemed to be signaling that he wanted the case to
be examined by a higher court, and they said they planned to appeal
the ruling up to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not have asked for stronger language from a district
court judge with respect to why this matter needs to be reviewed by
a higher court,'' said John C. Bonifaz, executive director of the
National Voting Rights Institute, a nonprofit group specializing in
campaign finance litigation.
</P>
<P>
   In the scattered state-level push to clean up campaign finance,
Maine went first but Vermont arguably went farthest. When it
enacted a new campaign finance law that included mandatory spending
limits in 1997 _ like the $300,000 limit for gubernatorial
candidates _ it reopened the question of whether such limits were
constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   No other state has tried to impose such limits since the Supreme
Court's seminal Buckley vs. Valeo decision in 1976, which deemed
spending limits an unconstitutional violation of a candidate's
right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's ruling, Sessions quoted four sitting Supreme Court
justices who have indicated that they, too, may be willing to
reopen the Buckley ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Powerful, if not controlling, judicial commentary such as this
reinforces the view that the constitutionality of expenditure
limits bears review and reconsideration,'' Sessions wrote of the
justices' opinions. ``Spending limits are an effective response to
certain compelling governmental interests not addressed in
Buckley.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buckley case focused largely on the danger of corruption or
the appearance of corruption. In the trial that led to Thursday's
ruling, witnesses attested to several other ways that a lack of
spending limits hurt the country's political system: It fosters
greater public cynicism and political apathy, they said; it leads
to an abundance of rich, self-financed candidates; and it leads
officeholders to spend inordinate amounts of time raising money for
re-election instead of on their official duties.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Sessions said the testimony convinced him that
such problems were real. But, he said, he was bound in this case,
Landell vs. Sorrell, by the Supreme Court's decision in the Buckley
case.
</P>
<P>
   Because the appeal will take time, the ruling is expected to
stand at least through the current election campaign in Vermont _ a
campaign in which the playing field has suddenly shifted a bit.
</P>
<P>
   In the gubernatorial race, Gov. Howard Dean, a Democrat, has
chosen the ``public financing'' option included in the state's new
campaign finance law. After raising a bit of seed money to qualify,
he gets more than $250,000 in state money to run his campaign, and
he may spend no more than that.
</P>
<P>
   But the candidate expected to be his toughest opponent, Ruth
Dwyer, a Republican, no longer has to abide by the $300,000 cap on
her spending that had been in effect. Her campaign has already
raised about $140,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just keep raising money,'' she said. ``I have no idea
how much money we can raise. It's still hard with the $400
limits.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling does not affect the public-financing aspect of the
Vermont law, which was not challenged.
</P>
<P>
   James Bopp Jr., an Indiana lawyer who challenged the law on
behalf of the Vermont Republican Party and others, noted that the
decision fell into line with the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in
January upholding $1,000 contribution limits in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson, he said, is that ``it's going to be difficult to
strike down individual contribution limits _ but the good news is
that that rationale doesn't apply to parties.'' Testimony at the
trial had supported the special role parties play in the political
system, he said, and underscored that money from political parties
was not corrupting.
</P>
<P>
   As for the spending limits, ``this is a major defeat for the
reformers, who were hoping to get the court to overrule Buckley,''
he said. The campaign finance reform advocates had presented new
facts, he said, ``but I don't think it's the facts that matter;
it's the First Amendment that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Invoking the First Amendment, the American Civil Liberties
Union's Vermont branch had also challenged the new campaign finance
law, though it generally supports campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``This opinion,'' said Ben Scotch, its executive director, ``is
completely consistent with the proposition that reform of campaign
finance is a conundrum for nearly everyone.'' Sessions, he said,
``just adds his name to a long list of people who find this very
troubling.''

   WASHINGTON _ Traveling recently through Morocco, Lowell W.
Paxson marveled when he used his cell phone to view a street map
enabling his driver to find an obscure restaurant there.
</P>
<P>
   But to his critics in the telephone and regulatory worlds,
Paxson, the chairman of Paxson Communications Corp., which owns a
string of mostly small television stations, now seems to be one of
the biggest impediments to the proliferation of such technology in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   With the volume of Internet traffic doubling every 100 days, and
that traffic rapidly migrating from personal computers to wireless
devices such as cell phones and handheld computers, the airwaves
are running out of free space. And much of the airspace coveted by
the makers of wireless devices is in the hands of Paxson and a
small group of other broadcasters, including Barry Diller of USA
Networks and Sinclair Broadcasting Group, a major broadcaster based
in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The spectrum space controlled by the broadcasters was once
viewed as virtually worthless, but it is now perhaps one of the
most valuable assets in the new information age, as important as
oil and coal were during the Industrial Revolution. Cell phones,
handheld personal digital assistants, laptop computers and other
wireless devices need spectrum space to function.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcasters' sliver of spectrum space, occupying channels
60 to 69 in many major markets, was given to them for free by
Congress four years ago. In exchange, the broadcasters promised to
make digital television widely available by 2006, and return the
spectrum when they had done so.
</P>
<P>
   But the development of digital television has stalled. And since
the stations do not have to give up their spectrum licenses until
85 percent of all television viewers have switched to of digital TV
_ a milestone that may be decades off _ a bottleneck has developed,
with spectrum space in extremely short supply.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, telephone companies, Internet businesses and the
broadcasters are battling to determine which of them will control
the spectrum that makes the new wireless technology work, and at
what cost. In Britain, five licenses sold for a total of $35.5
billion in April. And government officials estimate that the space
now occupied by Paxson and the other broadcasters could be worth
billions.
</P>
<P>
   The fight is alarming both regulators and industry executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big story is that our spectrum policy in the United States
is totally messed up,'' said Reed Hundt, the former chairman of the
Federal Communications Commission who is now on the boards of eight
Internet companies (none of which is seeking a spectrum license).
``And right now the FCC is really holding a handful of hot coals.''
</P>
<P>
   The broadcasters say they cannot give up their spectrum licenses
until the regulators issue rules to help accelerate the transition
to digital television. They want the FCC to force cable companies
to carry signals for both traditional television and the new
digital TV, expanding the so-called ``must-carry'' rules. They also
want the agency to move faster to impose technical standards
allowing for easier coordination between digital broadcasters and
cable companies.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Regulators say they are moving rapidly on some of the rules the
broadcasters want, but say others are unfair and in at least one
instance probably unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   FCC Chairman William E. Kennard said this week that the
broadcasters had made unreasonable demands on his agency,
attempting to use their leverage as holders of valuable spectrum
licenses. ``The law put the broadcasters completely in the driver's
seat,'' he said. ``The broadcasters made a deal with the United
States Congress. They promised a lot of key people in Congress that
if you give us this spectrum, we will give the public high
definition television. But nobody really said that the American
public wanted it or what the business plan was. There were a lot of
promises made, but none has been fulfilled.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The telephone and Internet companies say they cannot make plans
to buy the available spectrum _ or even draw up business plans that
include the use of the spectrum _ until they know how and when the
broadcasters will make it available, and at what price. The
telephone companies interested in acquiring frequencies include
Verizon, Voicestream, Bell South, Nextel, Sprint and a joint
venture of Bell South and SBC Communications.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has raised significant concerns that venture
capitalists and investors in wireless technology will shift their
attention to Europe and Asia. Officials there, unencumbered by the
kinds of laws that have restricted the FCC, have been moving
swiftly this year to liberate the airwaves for newer uses. The
effect of this would be to shift technology investment _ and as a
result, technology innovation and development _ abroad.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Congress had ordered the FCC to auction the pieces of the
channel 60 to 69 spectrum that are not in the hands of the
broadcasters _ chiefly pieces outside urban areas _ sometime this
year. But many telephone and Internet companies have been unwilling
to put together significant business plans or bids for other parts
of the country, preferring to wait until spectrum in major markets
is available.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the FCC has rescheduled the auction three times
this year, and this month the agency announced it will not sell the
available spectrum until next spring. broadcasters and Internet
executives say even that new date may be overly optimistic, because
the agency is likely to be undergoing a transition to new
leadership after the Presidential election. As a consequence, they
say it is likely these issues may not be resolved for more than a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Some regulators have blamed Congress for giving away such a
valuable spectrum, while others fault the broadcasters for failing
to live up to their promise of rapidly rolling out digital
television. Had the broadcasters managed to do so, they would have
then vacated the extra spectrum they were given for the transition,
averting the current situation.
</P>
<P>
   But Paxson, who this week was in Washington pressing
congressional aides to prod the FCC into adopting must-carry and
other rules favorable to the broadcasters, blamed the failure of
digital television on large part on what he called the incompetence
of the FCC and its inability to move quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``On this subject, digital television, Kennard gets an F,''
Paxson said. ``Other than that, he has done a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   For months, Kennard has been warning of a spectrum drought
caused by demand outstripping supply just as the Internet migrates
from the wire to wireless devices such as cell phones and hand-held
computers.
</P>
<P>
   As consumers increasingly reach the Internet through wireless
connections, experts fear that the heavy use of the airwaves will
begin to create colliding signals and other problems that could
greatly frustrate the further development of the technology.
</P>
<P>
   Hundt estimates that at the current rate of growth, the
government must nearly triple the amount of spectrum available for
wireless Internet over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Signals transmitted on the space occupied by channels 60 to 69
possess highly desirable characteristics: they can pass through
walls and other structures with both great clarity and little
interference.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress decided to give away the spectrum to the
broadcasters rather than sell it, there were some members of
Congress, notably Sens. John McCain and Bob Dole, who called it a
terrible government giveaway. In his book about his term as
chairman, Hundt has called it the ``largest grant of government
largesse since the 19th century donation of 10 percent of the
public land in the West to three dozen railroad companies in order
to persuade them to build transcontinental railroads.''
</P>
<P>
   But government officials and industry lawyers now say that the
giveaway _valued at the time as high as $70 billion _ will never be
undone because of the enormous political clout of the broadcasters.
As a result, they say, the only solution to the current shortage of
available spectrum space is a negotiated settlement between the
telephone companies and the broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   For Paxson and the other owners of the stations broadcasting
from channels 60 to 69, the increasing value of the spectrum
presents enormous opportunities. He is in the process of developing
ways to use digital technology for multiple channels that will
enable him to begin new networks in partnership with NBC, and the
money he could get for his spectrum space would dramatically
increase the resources he has at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Paxson Communications, which has a market value of about $630
million, owns 19 stations in the coveted spectrum , more than any
other company. By many estimates, those frequencies are worth
billions of dollars to the telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Paxson, the inventor of interactive home shopping on television
more than two decades ago, bristles at any suggestion that he has
been hoarding the airwaves. He brushes off complaints by rivals
that he is holding back as he watches European auctions for
spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing this since 1954, and have been involved in
developing more of these stations than anyone else,'' he said. ``Am
I greedy? Of course not. I've got four million shareholders who
say, `What are you doing with digital? What are you doing with
spectrum?' ''

DRAMA OF SEPARATING CONJOINED TWINS DETAILED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When doctors at Brigham and Women's Hospital removed
Sandra and Darielis Soto from their mother's womb, the twins,
joined at the chest and belly, were crying, moving and, according
to their father, hugging each other with their arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like they were saying goodbye to each other,'' Ramon
Soto recalled Thursday as he described the bittersweet medical
drama in May 1999 when the conjoined twin girls, who shared a
single heart, underwent a long-planned and urgent surgical
separation so that one could survive.
</P>
<P>
   Kept from the media at the parents' request, the operation is
described in the current New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the single umbilical cord joining the twins to their
mother's placenta, Sandra _ who had no heart _ ``began to die,''
said Soto said by telephone from Paterson, N.J., where the family
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Darielis _ whose middle name, Milagro, means ``miracle'' _ would
have died soon afterward had the newborns not been separated to
relieve Darielis of the burden of circulating blood for two. And
even today, Darielis, who is 14 months old and healthy, has a chest
wall made up of ribs and other tissue that was once Sandra's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her sister did her a great favor in her death,'' said Dr.
Steven Fishman, the pediatric surgeon at Children's Hospital who
led the team that separate the conjoined, or Siamese, twins born
with a complex set of abnormalities apparently unprecedented in
medical history.
</P>
<P>
   The Sotos _ he's 25, she's 30 _ came from Puerto Rico to Boston
in February 1999 after ultrasound exams revealed the conjoined
twins and the couple, opposed to abortion, sought help at
Children's Hospital. Their arrival set in motion an elaborate plan
that would involve the Brigham (a center for high-risk deliveries)
and the adjacent Children', with expertise in fetal and newborn
surgery. Dozens of pediatricians, cardiologists, surgeons,
radiologists, obstetricians and others became involved in
evaluating the twins' condition and creating a blueprint for the
separation.
</P>
<P>
   The twins suffered from two abnormalities, each rare, but never
before seen in combination. Conjoined twins occur in about 1 in
30,000 to 1 in 100,000 births. The second abnormality, seen in
about 1 in 35,000 births, is a misconnection of blood vessels so
that one twin _ the one with the heart _ pumps blood into the other
twin, where it circulates backwards, keeping that twin alive, but
also sending ``used'' or deoxygenated blood back to the first twin.
</P>
<P>
   The second twin has no heart, or only a primitive single
chamber, and no major blood vessels that would make a heart
transplant possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Sotos came hoping that there would be some way to
save both babies,'' said Dr. Kathy J. Jenkins, a pediatric
cardiologist at Children's who, along with Dr. Mary van der Velde,
a specialist in fetal echocardiography, figured out the precise
problem with the babies' circulatory systems.
</P>
<P>
   In planning the separation surgery, the doctors had to know
whether the twins' internal organs were shared _ like the heart _
or merely fused together. Standard X-rays and CAT scans weren't
adequate. But experts in Brigham and Womens' Surgical Planning
Laboratory performed some digital magic. Led by Dr. Lennox P.J.
Hoyte, the specialists assembled many MRI images taken from
different angles into a 3-D image of the twins and their organ
systems.
</P>
<P>
   By hand, with a digital pen, they outlined the different organs
and assigned them invidual colors. After many hours of processing,
the 3-D model was complete and served as a guide for Fishman to
study as he planned the operation. There was some good news: the
gall bladder and bile ducts were not missing, as had been feared,
and that would make it much easier to divide the fused liver.
</P>
<P>
   The medical team hoped that Sandra Soto would make it to at
least 37 weeks' gestation before the twins were born, and they
scheduled a Cesarian section and the twins' surgery for the first
week in June, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But at 7 a.m. Sunday morning on that Memorial Day weekend, wheh
Soto was in her 36th week, surgeon Fishman got a telephone call at
home. Obstetricians told him that Soto's blood pressure had
skyrocketed due to a complication called pre-eclampsia: ``She's
going to have a stroke if we don't deliver her,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   Fishman shot back that, if they performed the C-section
immediately, the babies would die. The OB specialists said they
would need 90 minutes to prepare the operating room anyway. And,
although it was a holiday weekend, Fishman managed to pull together
the well-rehearsed surgical team for the separation.
</P>
<P>
   At the Brigham, obstetricians led by Dr. Errol R. Norwitz
carried out the C-section and cut the umbilical cord _ the only
source of blood for Sandra, the second twin. Immediately, the twins
were wheeled across the pedestrian bridge that joins Brigham and
Women's to Children's to the operating room.
</P>
<P>
   Fishman said he thought he was emotionally prepared to sacrifice
a malformed baby to save one with a chance to live. ``But when they
both came out pink, and crying, and the same size,'' it was a
shock, he said. ``But I knew I had to keep my eye on the ball or we
would have two dead babies.''
</P>
<P>
   All went well. Fishman divided the two at the chest and abdomen,
using ribs and tissue from Sandra to form a protective cage over
the heart, which protruded from Darielis' chest. (This was
corrected in later surgery.)
</P>
<P>
   Just the Childrens' part of the series of procedures is
estimated to have cost $500,000, said a hospital spokeswoman. Some
is being paid by Massachusetts and New Jersey Medicaid, and the
hospital will absorb the balance, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Darielis is a normal 14-month-old baby who says ``Papa''
and ``Mama'' and cries a lot, said her father. Her mother is
pregnant with another girl. The couple isn't sure what they're
going to name her, ``but we're thinking of `Faith,' '' said Ramon
Soto.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVO POLJE, Kosovo _ The Rev. Radivoje Panic has had more than
his share of parishes.
</P>
<P>
   He lived in Pristina, the Kosovo capital, for nearly 10 years,
and often gave sermons at a small church on Taslixhe hill. A
witness to terror by his own Serbs, humiliated by his inability to
stop the expulsion of Albanians from Pristina, he found himself
expelled by them in turn.
</P>
<P>
   He was assigned to a church here in Kosovo Polje, a largely
Serbian town a few miles southwest of Pristina, but it was badly
damaged by hand grenades a year ago, despite the British troops
nearby. About a month ago it was attacked again, reduced to rubble
by dynamite in a large explosion, the third church destroyed in six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Now Panic serves at the last remaining church in Kosovo Polje,
the Church of St. Nicholas, which is surrounded by barbed wire and
patrolled by troops. It's a bizarre life, and oddly lonely. However
potent religious symbols have been for Serbian nationalism and
identity, neither the Serbs nor the Albanians are especially devout
after so many years of Communism. Not many Serbs come to church _
mostly the old and those who want to light candles for the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Even on June 28, the anniversary of the famous 1389 battle that
marked the loss of this province to the Ottoman Turks for 500
years, only 11 people came here to worship. More surprising, only
70-odd came to mark the event at the early 14th-century monastery
at nearby Gracanica. Services there _ under the eyes of NATO
soldiers, who to some Serbs are the new Ottomans _ were conducted
by Patriarch Pavle, the head of the entire Serbian Orthodox Church,
and by Bishop Artemije, the church's leader in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At least 8,000 Serbs live around Gracanica, but even on such a
symbolic day, sighed the Rev. Sava Janjic, the bishop's aide and
spokesman, ``you could see the empty chairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Panic, who describes himself as a simple priest, tries to see
the situation as a whole. ``This is the tragedy of all of us, Serbs
and Albanians,'' he said. ``There's no way to justify what happened
or to improve on it. With the war and the bombing, the Albanians
were pushed to leave the cities, towns and villages, and after the
bombing stopped, the Serbs were pushed to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   He remained in Pristina throughout the war. ``To be frank,'' he
said, ``I didn't see anyone personally being expelled from their
apartments and houses, but I did see many Albanians leaving with
their goods. I asked people why they were leaving, and they said
that a lot of people were being pushed out of the apartments and
houses by Serbs with guns, and that they were afraid this would
happen to them.''
</P>
<P>
   There were a lot of armed Serbian police, he said, standing
guard and guiding those who were leaving.
</P>
<P>
   And what did he do?
</P>
<P>
   He looked away, out the window, toward the barbed wire. ``I
remember one instance, when we tried to explain to the police that
they were making a mistake, that this Albanian was a good man, that
we knew him. We tried at least individually to protect him. But
this cop told me to get out of there, that this was not my
business.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused again, played with a pencil. ``Individually and
collectively we have responsibility,'' he said slowly. ``But you
can't punish someone based on collective guilt. What is happening
now is not the responsibility of all the Albanian people. I woke up
one morning to see a large group of Albanians leaving Pristina.
How? Why? Could someone stop that? I explained one case.
Milosevic's propaganda did the worst things here and still does
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian Orthodox Church, which broke with President Slobodan
Milosevic over his failures in Bosnia, and which calls for his
resignation, was clear in its attitude toward the war in Kosovo,
Panic said. The church opposed NATO's bombing, but it also opposed
the wrong done to Kosovo's Albanians, the murders and expulsions.
</P>
<P>
   Sava, the bishop's aide, who often comes here to get a better
Internet connection on the church's telephone, says that the church
should have broken with Milosevic sooner, and that many priests
became too caught up in the nationalist fervor over Bosnia, with
some of them photographed atop advancing tanks. ``And too many
others were silent,'' Sava said.
</P>
<P>
   He and Artemije are regarded as traitors by Belgrade _ and by
some Kosovo Serbs _ for working politically with Washington and the
U.N. civilian leader here, Bernard Kouchner, to try to increase
security for Serbs and allow more of them to return. The church
leadership has also expressed regret and sorrow for Serbian actions
here.
</P>
<P>
   But its apologies to Albanians, and its call for tolerance and
forgiveness, ring hollow in Albanian ears, and many Serbs here
still seem unable to acknowledge what was done in their name or
even by their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war happened, and there was a lot of anger on both
sides,'' Panic said. ``Evil things happened to ordinary Albanians,
too, that's the tragedy. But the peace has been signed. What
happened, happened. There were 60,000 Serbs in Pristina and now
there are 238. But life must go on. And today I'm occupied mostly
with the problems of simple people, who did no evil to anyone. The
ones who did the evil have left.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war last summer, Panic's apartment was robbed many
times and his car stolen. ``There was no longer any way for me to
live in Pristina,'' he said. ``So in September, I left Pristina
forever and came here.''
</P>
<P>
   On Taslixhe hill in Pristina, the church where Panic once
preached, in the once-mixed ethnic neighborhood where he once
lived, is guarded around the clock by the Royal Fusiliers, with
their trademark feathers of red and white shooting out of their
caps. The church is fine, but there are few Serbs left to use it;
the soldiers, who keep watch from a sandbag shelter 24 hours a day,
in all weather, are bored to tears. But the minute they leave, they
know, the church will be vandalized and destroyed, as some 80
others have been.
</P>
<P>
   They have two dogs, mongrels, that keep them company. One they
have named NATO and the other Unmik, the acronym for the U.N.
Mission in Kosovo, which runs civilian life here.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO barks at all the cars,'' a soldier said, laughing. ``And
Unmik sleeps.''  &QL;

TRIBALISM MAY LEAD TO AGGRESSION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky., Va)  (With ARDENT-FANS) 
 By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The relationship between a fan's ardor and violence has remained
something of a mystery for psychologists, despite a raft of studies
and books on sports hooliganism in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Research by Daniel Wann and his colleagues at Murray State
University in Kentucky has shown that sports fans, as a group, are
no more aggressive than any other segment of society, including
people who do not care about sports.
</P>
<P>
   But Wann's research and work by other psychologists show that
ardent fans can become aggressive or even violent at a sports event
when their team is threatened with losing. Fans sometimes throw
batteries and other objects at players, or brawl with fans from the
opposing team. A theory proposed to explain this behavior is that
fans see the team as an extension of themselves, and so feel
personally threatened by a loss, Wann said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These highly identified people are more likely to act in an
aggressive fashion when the team suffers,'' Wann said.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also ample evidence that ardent fans can become
violent after a victory. For instance, violence erupted in downtown
Los Angeles in June after the Lakers won the NBA title. Denver
Broncos fans tore up their city in 1998 and 1999 after the team won
Super Bowls. Detroit Tigers fans rampaged through the streets and
clashed with police after the team's victory in the 1984 World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, where nationalist emotions often run high at soccer
matches, violence is even more common. This sort of violence owes
much to tribalism, psychologists say. Patriotism often mutates into
overt violence at soccer matches, as exultant winners are humming
with hormonal surges associated with victory and frustrated losers
are looking for scapegoats.
</P>
<P>
   Some violence perpetrated by fans of a winning team may also be
linked to surges in testosterone and a feelings of invincibility
fostered by soaring self-esteem, psychologists said. Indeed, an
older theory _ that watching violent sports serves as a catharsis
that makes people less likely to be violent _ has largely been
discredited.
</P>
<P>
   One intriguing study found that doctors see significantly
greater numbers of battered women in Washington emergency rooms on
the day after the Redskins win than on other days, including after
the team loses. The authors of the 1992 study could not prove a
link, but theorized that the football victories may have emboldened
men to act violently against their spouses and girlfriends.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of advocates for battered women used the study in
1993 to bolster a claim that 40 percent more women would be
battered on Super Bowl Sunday than on a normal day. But one of the
Washington study's authors, Janet Katz, a sociologist at Old
Dominion University in Norfolk, Va., said later that the coalition
had badly misinterpreted the results, which she described as
``interesting but very tentative findings.''

TOTAL RELIEF IN YANKEELAND AS CONE WINS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Cone needed one more strike to complete the
fifth inning in a lazy game where the Yankees already comfortably
led the Athletics by nine runs. Yet there were so many of the
41,011 fans standing and clapping and screaming that Yankee Stadium
felt as if it had been transported to a taut game in October.
</P>
<P>
   With his father and his cancer-stricken pitching coach in
attendance and with thousands of raucous people making everyone
temporarily forget this was an August rout, Cone uncorked a
fastball to Ben Grieve. Grieve missed it and then Cone let go of
three and a half months of frustration. He pumped his fist, he
pounded his fist into his glove and he exhaled. Finally, Cone
thought, finally.
</P>
<P>
   Cone won a game. He actually won a game for the first time since
April 28 as the Yankees pummeled the Athletics, 12-6. There were
feelings of total relief and total bliss in Yankeeland because
Cone, the creative, yet creaky, 37-year old who has contributed so
much in the four years with the Yankees before this one, ended his
streak of 15 straight starts without a victory. Cone won a game.
``I feel like I got a large gorilla off my back,'' said Cone. ``I
got rid of King Kong.''
</P>
<P>
   It was another emotional scene for Cone, whose father, Ed, sat
in Section 215 of the main box seats just to the right of the
plate. Ed Cone recalled how he had reminded his son not to get too
``overwhelmed,'' because it was simply another game. Regardless of
the circumstances, the father told the son, he was just pitching in
one more game, something Cone has been doing for many years.
</P>
<P>
   By the time it was over, Cone made it look like just another
game for him instead of what could have been one of his final
starts as a Yankee. Cone had a sturdy fastball, a sweet curveball
and a nasty slider and he stopped Oakland on two runs and eight
hits in six innings while striking out eight and walking one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a relief,'' said Ed Cone, who flew in from Kansas City
last Friday. ``I think the losing streak was getting to him and
working on him. He was out of synch and he was pressing. This was
great to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Mel Stottlemyre, the pitching coach who is undergoing treatment
for cancer of the bone marrow and was expected to be away from the
team for about 10 days, eschewed the advice of his doctor and his
wife and showed up to watch and tutor Cone. Stottlemyre is supposed
to avoid the sun so he found a shady spot in the bullpen during
Cone's warmups and stayed in the dugout during the game. He has
coached Cone for 11 seasons _ with the Mets and the Yankees. He had
to be here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I came back especially to see him,'' said
Stottlemyre, ``and I didn't come back to see a loss.''
</P>
<P>
   The karma was working for Cone, who called his father ``a
calming influence on me'' and said that Stottlemyre is ``the
strongest man I know.'' Once the Yankees battered Mark Mulder for
seven runs in two innings, it became obvious that Cone was a few
innings away from ending a streak in which he had lost eight
straight decisions. For a game that was essentially over, it was
unusually tense because of Cone's prolonged pursuit of his second
victory in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Giambi belted a two-run homer in the third to make it 7-2,
but Jose Canseco hit a monstrous homer off the facing of the
left-field upper deck and Glenallen Hill poked a two-run shot into
the right-field bleachers to inflate the lead to 10-2. Still, when
the first two As singled in the fifth, some tension returned. Could
Cone get through this jam? Would he crumble after being given a
lead of three or more runs for only the second time during his
winless streak?
</P>
<P>
   Cone said he got angry for the first time this season and
pitched with a fury, instead of in fear. He needed four pitches to
whiff Randy Velarde and got him to flail at a slider. He battled
the dangerous Giambi to a 3-2 count before firing a high, tailing
fastball past him. He moved to two strikes on Grieve and the fans
stood and hoped that Cone would get to five innings and be in line
for the victory. Cone fired the fastball, Grieve swung and Cone
pumped his fist.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably the best stuff I've had all year,'' said Cone.
``I had a big lead. I was thinking, `Not again.' I turned it up a
little.''
</P>
<P>
   He turned it up a lot. A second after Cone pumped his fist, Ed
Cone did the same thing. Then Ed Cone saw his son strand two more
A's to end the sixth, holding them to no hits in six at-bats with
runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``During this streak, I thought some people had given up on
him,'' said Ed Cone. ``I always thought he could still pitch. I did
that for those people. I was saying, `Yeah, he can still pitch.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cone had conquered the streak that has defined his season and he
had conquered himself, too. Doubts plagued Cone for the last few
months and he would struggle to fall asleep and get up and watch
videotapes of his pitching, searching for a solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, in the back of your mind, you wonder if it's ever
going to come,'' admitted Cone.
</P>
<P>
   Cone said there is a huge difference between being 2-10 and 1-11
because the Yankees are in first place and desperately need for him
to contribute. It was one solid start, one start that bought Cone
some time to salvage a piece of his season. Cone is not delusional
about his murky future, but he felt ``life'' in his arm again. And,
for the first time in 104 days, Cone won a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want enjoy today for today,'' said Cone. ``Tomorrow,
I'll wake up and still be 2-10. I'm going to enjoy today for
today.''

COMMENTARY: UNITING JERUSALEM 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been a few weeks since the Camp David slumber party broke
up, and while the two sides have been holding secret talks to try
to get things back on track, it's been slow going. Jerusalem
remains the major stumbling block.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that although the Israeli press has now
published the unprecedented compromises that Prime Minister Ehud
Barak offered the Palestinians at Camp David, Israelis are not up
in arms. One poll showed some 40 percent of Israelis ready to give
up Arab East Jerusalem without even knowing what they would get in
return, which is why I still believe Israelis will vote in favor of
a fair, far-reaching deal.
</P>
<P>
   True, the political midgets in Parliament are trying to cut
Barak to pieces. But at some level much of the public understands
that he is engaged in the greatest possible Zionist endeavor:
building secure boundaries for a democratic Jewish state that
doesn't rule over millions of Arabs, and in which Jewish Jerusalem
is recognized by the Arabs and the world as the capital of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   And although Yasser Arafat has been on a Magical Mystery Tour
since Camp David, trying to garner support, he has kept the
Palestinian streets quiet and his lines of communication to Israel
open. He still wants a deal.
</P>
<P>
   But that requires a wrenching compromise on Jerusalem. No one in
the Israeli, United States or Palestinian delegations will say this
publicly, but they all now know what a sustainable deal requires:
Israel must be given sovereignty over the Jewish Quarter of the Old
City, the entire Western Wall and all the Jewish neighborhoods, new
and old. And the Palestinians must be given sovereignty over all
the outer Arab neighborhoods, virtually all the inner neighborhoods
and the Muslim, Christian and Armenian quarters of the Old City.
What the Muslims call the Haram and what the Jews call the Temple
Mount must be shared, with joint sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has already offered a lot of this. He might as well go all
the way now, and at least get the benefit of a possible deal.
Either way, his opponents will accuse him of ``dividing
Jerusalem.'' This is a canard. As anyone who has visited Jerusalem
knows, it has been psychologically and religiously divided since
1967. The walls may be invisible, but they are high and thick. Many
Israelis never go to the Arab neighborhoods or the Old City,
because they know, even though Israel controls them, they are not
welcome. Many Arabs don't go to the Jewish sections, because they
too know they are not welcome. And tens of thousands of secular
Israelis have fled Jerusalem for Tel Aviv, because they do not feel
comfortable in a city dominated by the ultra-Orthodox.
</P>
<P>
   The real truth is, Jerusalem will be united only if it is
shared. Only when each side is secure in its own space will they
both feel free to experience the whole city. That's why Barak, in
offering to share Jerusalem, is really offering to unite the city
for the first time in its modern history.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, what the Jewish people were praying for all these
years was not to police the Muslim Quarter or collect the garbage
in Wadi Joz. What they were praying for was control of the Western
Wall, the Temple Mount, the Jewish Quarter, the Mount of Olives and
Mount Scopus. All those could be part of a united Jewish Jerusalem
that would be recognized by the Arabs and the world. But the price
is letting go of the Arab-Muslim parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one thing that became clear at Camp David, it is
that the Arabs don't know that the Jews had an independent kingdom
in Jerusalem hundreds of years years before the Prophet Muhammad
was born, and that Jerusalem is the symbol of Jewish religious and
national identity. And the Israelis don't appreciate that while the
Muslims have the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, the holy mosques
of Jerusalem are also integral to Muslim history and faith.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing Jerusalem, and the Haram-Temple Mount, is the only
sustainable solution. If the Israeli center can't embrace that _ or
if the Palestinians, Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia can't embrace
that _ then no final peace is possible. It's time for everyone to
show his real cards.
</P>
<P>
   The good news: If they can share Jerusalem, they can share the
Middle East. Because the only way they can share Jerusalem is by
acknowledging and respecting each other's deepest claims.
</P>

 &HT;    Foes called pretenders to vacant title
 &HT;    By Mike Tierney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Fighters occupy two corners of a boxing ring. In the
controversial case of Evander Holyfield vs. John Ruiz, two corners
also have evolved over the legitimacy of Saturday's bout.
</P>
<P>
   One maintains that it's a valid pairing of two worthy contenders
for the WBA heavyweight title.
</P>
<P>
   The other holds that it's a ``scam of sorts,'' in the words of a
boxing writer, for a belt ``that's been stolen,'' in the words of
the alleged victim, Lennox Lewis. He is the widely recognized
universal champion of the XX-large division _ in part frrom his
superiority over Holyfield in their two-fight series _ whose waist
wardrobe is incomplete without the WBA's belt.
</P>
<P>
   The second corner is crowded, which has put all parties attached
to Holyfield-Ruiz on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have trashed us,'' promoter Don King said of the Lewis
chorus, which includes a sizable portion of the media. ``They've
said (Holyfield-Ruiz) shouldn't have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is the Cliff Notes version on why it will happen:
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, by contract, was mandated to meet the No. 1 WBA
contender. Lewis asked out, citing a technicality, and defied the
organization by handpicking Michael Grant, who was then ascending
the charts with a bullet. The challenger can now be found in a sort
of Grant's tomb, unheard from since Lewis' second-round knockout of
him.
</P>
<P>
   The WBA's stance that Lewis abandoned the title was seconded by
a judge's ruling in federal court. The WBA put up a ``vacancy''
sign in its house of heavyweights. Because Ruiz and Holyfield are
ranked as the leading contenders, they will get it on while Lewis
stews. The rift over Saturday's fight stems partly from the wide
range of opinions on Ruiz, who has pounded on mostly palookas since
suffering a first-punch knockout by David Tua in 1996. His name is
conspicuously absent a top-10 ranking from a panel of presumably
objective boxing journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield concedes that the rankings of the three major
organizations are a colossal mess. The inconsistencies, he says,
``make them feel good to create commotion. They do it on purpose.
They could make it simple. Have one chart that you put on a Web
page. People could look at it and say, 'Here's the top fighters.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can send somebody to the moon, you can straighten this
out.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Holyfield makes no apologies for this bout. If
he can abide by the rules, occasionally submitting to mandatory
defenses throughout his career when it did not suit his best
interests, why shouldn't Lewis?
</P>
<P>
   ``He had an obligation,'' Holyfield said, ``and he didn't
fulfill it.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Holyfield pointed out, Lewis assumed the WBC title
himself after Riddick Bowe forfeited it by ducking out on a
required defense.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield traced the history of vacated titles before sticking
it once more to Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the heavyweight champions who were stripped because
they didn't fight (a mandatory),'' he said. ``They got all the good
ones. They stripped Ali, Tyson, George Foreman, Bowe. How can some
other guy (Lewis) come up and say, 'They're not going to strip
me?'.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz, who seems too naive to falsely beat the drums for a fight,
believes the guy in the opposite corner Saturday is the supreme
heavyweight anyway. Never mind what the public and the ratings say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sparred with (Lewis),'' he said. ``It seemed everything I
threw hit him. He was, like, an easy target.''
</P>
<P>
   But probably not as easy a target as Holyfield-Ruiz, the bout
that has put everyone on the defense.

   DURANGO, Spain _ It is not hard to find the spot on the sidewalk
here where Jesus Maria Pedrosa was gunned down in June as he walked
home on a quiet Sunday after watching a basketball game with
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Scrawled on the wall behind the spot where Pedrosa fell when a
single bullet tore through the back of his skull is blood-red
graffiti in Basque saying: ``ETA, we are behind you.''
</P>
<P>
   Europe's longest-running guerrilla rebellion exploded back into
life in December, when the Basque separatists, angry at what they
saw as a lack of progress in negotiations with Spain, ended a
14-month truce.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the shadowy organization, ETA, whose full name means
Basque Homeland and Liberty, has taken responsibility for a
widening wave of death and destruction, with more than a dozen
attacks in July alone.
</P>
<P>
   Spaniards are angry at the new wave of violence and frustrated
at the failure to solve a conflict that _ unlike Northern Ireland's
_ attracts almost no interest in the outside world. Vigils have
been held across the country, and more than half a million people
marched in Madrid to protest the ETA's additional assassinations
and car bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Juanjo Gastaniazatorre, like Pedrosa a councilor in this small
Basque town for the center-right Popular Party, which governs in
Madrid, sighed at the graffiti marking the place of his colleague's
death. Sometimes efforts are made to take it away, he said. ``But
it just comes back.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest wave of terrorism has crisscrossed the country,
seeming to prove that ETA can strike at almost any target, anywhere
it likes: explosions have gone off in a rich Basque suburb and
outside a shopping mall in downtown Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   The dead include local politicians like Pedrosa, and Jose Maria
Martin Carpena, who was gunned down in front of his wife and
daughter in Malaga, in the south, apparently just because he was a
member of the Popular Party.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, the victims were outspoken Basques. One was a
Basque journalist who had increasingly criticized the more moderate
nationalists for not taking a more active stance against violence.
He was shot four times in the head and throat as he went to buy a
newspaper in Andoain.
</P>
<P>
   And just two weeks ago, Juan Maria Jauregui, a retired Socialist
Party governor of a Basque province and a man who had repeatedly
pressed for peace talks, was assassinated while home on vacation
from his job in Chile. A bullet hole is still visible in the yellow
wall of his restaurant, the Cafe Fronton, where he died.
</P>
<P>
   A waitress who witnessed the killing cannot sleep at night and
does not come to work these days. The owner, J.L. Izaguirre, said
the two assassins sat at the bar for a while drinking coffee. One
wore a hat and dark glasses, which seemed odd to everyone. But not
odd enough, he said, because no one reacted.
</P>
<P>
   Izaguirre, who was reluctant to give his full name, said that
all he felt about the latest rash of violence was weariness _
though he could not seem to stop glancing at the white pock mark in
his wall. ``We are all tired of this,'' he said. ``First terrorism,
then a cease fire, then terrorism again. It goes on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   ((On Thursday, the ninth victim of the recent killings, a
Spanish army lieutenant, was buried. And near the Basque mountain
village of Markina, Agence France-Presse reported, about 100
separatists, carrying Basque flags of green and white crosses on a
red background, decorated with black ribbons, mourned an ETA
commander and three suspected accomplices who died on Monday when
the car in which they were carrying explosives blew up.))
</P>
<P>
   Fear is growing among the 5 million residents in the rich and
industrialized Basque region, an area of rugged hills that
stretches across the French and Spanish border at the Atlantic end
of the Pyrenees and includes Bilbao and San Sebastian. Three years
ago, by one survey, 50 percent said they were afraid to talk
politics with at least some of the people they knew. Today, about
70 percent say they are afraid.
</P>
<P>
   ``One can wonder if democracy can even function there,'' said
Emilio Lamo de Espinosa, the director of a prestigious Madrid
research group, Instituto Universitario Ortega y Gasset.
</P>
<P>
   In Durango, Gastaniazatorre said the Popular Party sometimes
could not get people to run in local elections. He himself survived
one assassination attempt, and his country house was burned to the
ground last year. He hardly leaves his Durango residence and takes
two bodyguards whenever he does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't go to restaurants or anything like that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Basques are one of the most ancient peoples of Europe,
identified even in the Roman times as fiercely dominant of this
area. During the Middle Ages, Spanish rulers accorded them special
liberties in acknowledgment of their customs and traditions. The
Basque language appears to be related to no other.
</P>
<P>
   In more modern times, the Basques suffered heavy repression
under the dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco. Angry at Basque
support of the leftists in the Civil War, Franco sought to stamp
out any vestige of Basque identity.
</P>
<P>
   After Franco's death in 1975 and Spain's return to democracy,
huge changes were introduced. In hopes of defusing various
separatist movements, the new order gave all the country's regions
a great deal of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Basque voters never ratified Spain's new constitution. The
killing began in 1968, and in democracy, the bloodshed continued.
By now, ETA has been blamed for more than 800 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys continue to show that maybe 30 percent of Basques still
hope for sovereignty. Only 10 percent of the population identifies
itself as Spanish, about 60 percent say they are both Spanish and
Basque and about 30 percent say they are Basque only.
</P>
<P>
   Arnaldo Otegi, the spokesman for Euskal Herritarok, the radical
nationalists seen as ETA's political wing, says that violence will
not end until the Basques have an independent state. Autonomy, he
said, is not what anyone cares about.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``In this time of globalization, why is it hard to understand we
need our own country?'' Otegi asked. ``We are an industrialized
country with a $16,000-a-year average income. Why can't we decide
our own future? Why is it different for us than for the
Palestinians? Is the difference between them and us that we don't
wear the scarf?''
</P>
<P>
   Otegi makes no apologies about the loss of life. ``You have to
have the dead,'' he said, ``or else people will say there is no
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the cease-fire, Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
has continued to take a hard line with the separatists, declaring
simply that he will not deal with terrorists. ``They are not going
to see us blink,'' he said at Jauregui's funeral on July 30.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say the problem is that the government gave too
much away when Spain became a democracy. ``The regions in Spain are
the most autonomous and independent in all of Europe,'' said Felipe
Sahagun, a columnist for the newspaper El Mundo. ``They gave away
all the cards 20 years ago. How can they negotiate now? They have
nothing to give.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are critical of the government's actions during the
14-month truce, noting that only one meeting took place between the
two sides. ETA was not satisfied with what it calls a half-hearted
gesture to bring Basque prisoners closer to home, rather than have
them scattered as far away as the Canary Islands. In addition, a
top Basque negotiator was arrested during the truce, infuriating
the separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that ETA agreed to the truce only because it was
weakened by arrests in the late 1990s and needed to regroup. During
the truce, police officials say, ETA agents stole eight tons of
explosives from a French army barracks. Some of that materiel was
recovered, but some was used this year in attacks, the officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   There is also widespread speculation that ETA is now in the
hands of younger, more hot-headed leaders not as well known to the
police.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, optimism is in short supply. Jonan Fernandez, general
coordinator of Elkarri, a nonprofit pro-separatist peace group
based in San Sebastian, is a lonely voice in seeing the conflict in
its final stages, hoping that ETA will again abandon violence and
make new overtures for a negotiated solution.
</P>
<P>
   But he bemoans the lack of international interest. ``Why,'' he
asked, ``is there no Camp David for us?''

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR CONE, SECURITY IS TEMPORARY 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Albatross. That was the word David Cone volunteered
after beating the Oaklands Thursday, his first victory since all
the way back on April 28.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what exactly the concept of ``albatross'' meant to him,
Cone put his hands to his neck and made the gesture of removing a
heavy weight.
</P>
<P>
   He was, as usual, absolutely right. In his own fevered mind,
Cone had become a latter-day version of the haunted character in
the poem ``The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,'' by Samuel Taylor
Coleridge (1772-1834).
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had lost 13 straight games in which Cone had
started, a streak of epic proportions for an organization that
normally commits professional euthanasia upon a pitcher who has not
won recently. However, Cone is special, and deserved these three
months of faith. For all the kind thoughts, Cone was adrift in
uncharted waters, bumming himself out and concerned he was dragging
down the morale of his teammates. He could imagine the Yankees
reacting to him the way strangers responded to the cursed mariner
himself:
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear thee and thy glittering eye, And thy skinny hand so
brown,'' as Coleridge wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Cone had done nothing as terrible as slaying the revered sea
bird, with its 10-12-foot wing spread, thereby bringing down the
wrath of a rainless sky and a becalmed sea upon an entire ship.
Perhaps Cone's transgression has been turning 37, or something so
mundane as fouling up his pitching mechanics, but in baseball
terms, either can be the equivalent of a cosmic hex.
</P>
<P>
   He had eight losses and seven no-decisions to show for his last
15 starts, even on a team of power and depth, leading its division
</P>
<P>
   ``Water, water, everywhere, nor any drop to drink.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing streaks like this are a mere trifle on other clubs. The
Mets, in their erratic glory, have not only Anthony Young's 27
consecutive losses over 1992-93, but Craig Anderson's 19 straight
losses over their first three seasons, to say nothing of Roger
Craig's 18 straight in 1963. The Bronx single-season record for
consecutive losses is a mere 11 by one George Mogridge in 1916,
before the Yankees were the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Cone wanted no part of that. He is a complex chap under the best
of circumstances, opening himself up to the press but also known to
retreat into literal or figurative darkness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried everything to the point of overdoing it,'' he said
of his mental and spiritual gyrations during the streak. ``I now
understand how athletes can exacerbate a slump.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre, the skipper of this luxury liner, said he did not
realize how gravely Cone needed a victory ``until he said it,''
Torre said, heavy emphasis on the ``he.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly as bad as actually losing games, Cone began to fear that
whatever he had might be catching. ``My streak has been an
albatross on the whole team,'' he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, said some of the Yankees, including Tino Martinez, who
added: ``He carried himself very well on the days he didn't pitch.
He was obviously frustrated the day he pitched, but he's been a
great teammate.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone saw himself casting negative vibrations: ``And I had done a
hellish thing, /And it would work 'em woe,'' as the guilt-wracked
mariner put it.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees tried everything short of incantations over Cone's
uniform and toeplate, even sending sent him down to the noted
exorcist, Professor Connors of Tampa. The Ancient Mariner did
indeed bring disaster to his shipmates, but this tale takes a
happier tack with David Cone and the Yankees. A fresh new platoon
of bashers clubbed Oakland into submission early and often
Thursday, for an ultimate 12-6 victory. Cone pitched six innings,
gave up two runs, and had reason to be encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``A spring of love gushed from my heart, /And I blessed them
unaware,'' Cone might have said, if Coleridge had not written those
words two centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   He said he thought he had turned the corner when he began to
``get angry'' on the mound Thursday, finding a familiar source of
energy. He struck out three opponents with two runners on base in
the fifth inning, and punctuated it with a pump of his fist. He was
ahead, 10-2, and he could see wind in his personal sails, although
morbidity runs deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since then, at an uncertain hour, /That agony returns/ And
till my ghastly tale is told, /This heart within me burns,'' the
mariner says near the end of the poem.
</P>
<P>
   For Cone, the agony was temporarily obscured Thursday, but he
maintained his own view of the world: `Tomorrow, I wake up still
2-10,' he said. `But right now ...''
</P>
<P>
   The ancient mariner would have understood.

LIEBERMAN, DEMOCRATS AT ODDS ON AFFIRMATIVE ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON AND SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In his appearance with Vice President Al Gore
Thursday, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman recalled his commitment to
civil rights during the 1960s _ helping to register black voters in
the South and joining in the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s historic
1963 March on Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But neither man mentioned that in March 1995, Lieberman called
affirmative action programs ``patently unfair.'' In August 1995,
the think tank affiliate of the Democratic Leadership Council,
which Lieberman heads, called for a ``radical overhaul'' of such
programs that would have eliminated race-based preferences in
government contracting and hiring.
</P>
<P>
   And just last month, Lieberman, as DLC chairman, signed the
group's ``Hyde Park Declaration,'' which said the think tank should
``resist an `identity politics' that confers rights and
entitlements on groups.'' The declaration said the DLC's goal for
2010 should be to ``shift the emphasis of affirmative action
strategies from group preferences to economic empowerment of all
disadvantaged citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   That appears to put Lieberman at odds with the party's platform,
and Gore, who strongly endorses affirmative action. But late
Thursday, a spokesman for Lieberman, responding to questions from
the Globe, asserted that Lieberman, despite the views he has stated
or endorsed on several occasions, also supports affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Gerstein, the spokesman, said Lieberman was one of a number
of prominent Democrats in 1995 who ``raised questions about the
future of affirmative action and its effectiveness.'' After the
senator was criticized for his remarks, Gerstein said Lieberman
``clarified'' his position and ``reaffirmed his support for
affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   The declaration he signed last month, Gerstein insisted, merely
reflects Lieberman's hope that by 2010, such programs will no
longer be needed. Lieberman has twice voted against GOP attempts to
gut government affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore needs enthusiastic support from the party's liberal base,
and especially from minority voters, so Lieberman's relative
conservatism on some issues is a delicate topic. But it is also one
with a potential benefit: It might help draw some moderate to
conservative voters into Gore's column.
</P>
<P>
   With Gore and Lieberman hoping for a unified nominating
convention in Los Angeles next week, civil rights leaders, as well
as gay rights leaders who have been troubled by some of Lieberman's
past votes, said they are satisfied that Lieberman supports their
positions.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia's nonvoting
delegate in the House, said in an interview that she and other
members of the Congressional Black Caucus, during a conference call
with Lieberman on Monday, embraced him as the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true that his position on affirmative action has not
always been as unequivocal as (that of) people like me, for
example,'' Norton said. But, she said, ``I have no sense that he is
against affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a non-issue,'' said William Galston, a former White
House domestic policy adviser who has long been an ally of both
Gore and Lieberman. ``Whenever there is a disagreement, the vice
president will subscribe to the agenda and policies of the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   But that would require quite a turnabout for Lieberman. Just
after he took over as DLC chairman in 1995, Lieberman clearly
stated his opposition to affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to reporters after a speech, Lieberman said, ``You
can't defend policies that are based on group preferences as
opposed to individual opportunities, which is what America has
always been about.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Lieberman said he supported a California ballot
initiative, later approved in 1996, which ended racial preference
programs in that state. ``When we have such policies,'' he said,
``we have the effect of breaking some of those ties in civil
society that have held us together because they are patently
unfair. Those who are the victims are going to lose out when a
choice is made based on group preference rather than on individual
ability.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, just after Republicans won control of the US House
with a conservative agenda that included abolishing affirmative
action, Democrats were divided over how to respond to preference
programs that had generated substantial voter resentment.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1995, after a months-long review, President Clinton
declared that the government should ``mend'' such programs rather
than eliminate them, and focused on ending a handful of government
programs that amounted to quotas.
</P>
<P>
   But a month later, in August 1995, the Progressive Policy
Institute, an affiliate of the DLC, issued a report criticizing
Clinton. Instead, it recommended retaining affirmative action by
law only in college admissions, ending it for government hiring and
contracting, and making it voluntary in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, Chuck Alston, the DLC's director, said
the council's new Declaration, which covers a range of issues, was
adopted at a conference in Hyde Park, N.Y., in May. He said
Lieberman, who remains DLC chairman, signed the document last
month. It was only printed last week.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other DLC members who signed it was Senator John F.
Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, who was one of the three
finalists to be Gore's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Alston agreed that the declaration's language could be
characterized as expressing opposition to affirmative action
programs, ``in that it advocates other means than affirmative
action'' for ending discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Charles B. Rangel, a Democrat of New York and a
member of the Congressional Black Caucus, said his view is that
Lieberman opposes quotas, and not affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because quotas have had adverse effects on the Jewish
community, they have opposed quotas,'' Rangel said of Lieberman,
who is Jewish. ``But when it comes to fairness and equity, to
set-asides and opportunities for minorities, Joe Lieberman is just
where we want him to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights groups have also expressed wariness about Lieberman's
views in the past, though he has high ratings from both gay rights
and civil rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, for example, Lieberman voted for an amendment offered
by Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, which cut off
federal funds to any school district that used educational
materials that could be interpreted as supporting homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   David M. Smith, the communications director of the Human Rights
Campaign, which advocates on behalf of gay rights, said in an
interview that Lieberman ``has evolved'' over time. A statement
issued by the the organization hinted at its wariness, saying
Lieberman's record on gay rights was ``mostly positive'' and his
votes reflect ``a growing understanding of our issues.''
</P>
<P>
   One well-known civil rights leader, who expressed concern about
Lieberman's views on affirmative action, was nonetheless supportive
of Gore's choice, especially, he said, if it helps Gore win the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   The leader, who asked that he not be quoted by name, said he was
more concerned with the voting record of Lieberman's opposite
number, GOP vice presidential nominee Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does Joe Lieberman have Ted Kennedy's record on these issues?
No. Does he have a perfect rating? No. But he's certainly 10 times
better than the Republican alternative.''
</P>

DIVISIVE SQUABBLING MARKS REFORM PARTY CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Like all good zingers, the line was
fiercely funny and unexpectedly obvious.
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase the question put to one of the two grown men now
slugging it out for their party's presidential nomination:
Shouldn't the Reform Party be renamed the Reform School Party?
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of day _ again _ for the third party that once
showed so much promise. Gone are the middle-American manners, the
sense of nationwide solidarity. Instead, the heirs to party founder
Ross Perot's mantle have been reduced to name calling.
</P>
<P>
   The barbed back-and-forth between presidential aspirants Patrick
Buchanan and John Hagelin has buried any chance the Reform Party
has to be taken seriously by voters, at least in the short term.
Even the delegates who paid their own way to Long Beach, who took
vacation time to be here, conceded as much. Supporters of both
candidates say they are embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the shouting, the shoving and the formation of a
second, separate convention Thursday, the delegates and the
candidates insisted the Reform Party will emerge stronger than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Priding themselves as decent, hard-working Americans from all
walks of life, members said they cannot conceive of the party's
collapse. They said growing pains are natural, especially with
$12.6 million in federal funds at stake for the triumphant nominee.
As they sat on floors and leaned against walls waiting for the
action to start, many also said they didn't mean to sound like
pollyannas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure a lot of people will think we're nuts, but a lot of
other people will see a chance to have their voices heard with this
party,'' said Tim McCoy, a printer from Minnesota. ``I really
believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Donna Campbell, a San Francisco-area office manager who
supports Hagelin, ``Even with what's happened, if people like
Hagelin, if we can get to them, we're looking for 20 percent of the
vote. Really, I am. Look, things happen for the best.''
</P>
<P>
   The catch Thursday was that the Reform Party suddenly found
itself with two conventions, one featuring Buchanan in the official
convention center, the other starring Hagelin in the convention
theater next door, each complete with security men wearingearplugs
and carrying walkie talkies. Each candidate had on the red tie that
is requisite among aspiring politicians.
</P>
<P>
   But Hagelin's breakaway convention was pulled together so
hastily that the red, white, and blue balloons ubiquitous at
political events nationwide were red, yellow and blue. Copies of
the scheduled events, straight off the copying machines, were still
warm.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Buchanan forces were doing their best to
stick to a 9-page, minute-by-minute schedule that they consider the
official convention program. Again and again, each side declared
itself the rightful Reform Party, the one with a real chance to
sway American voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The catharsis will have a silver lining; the roots of the
party are here,'' Hagelin insisted in response to the Reform School
Party question put to him by a reporter in the morning. ``The party
is poised to rebound. The American people will see that.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, at his news conference, Buchanan called Hagelin ``a log
who has been thrown on the tracks of a runaway express train.'' He
stressed that his movement was ``about building a new Reform Party
that is much more energized about the issues of sovereignty and
trade.''
</P>
<P>
   This party, or that party, was at issue for the umpteenth day,
with no resolution in sight and sound bites coming straight from
the schoolyard. Hagelin and his loyalists continued to charge that
Buchanan, a socially conservative former TV commentator, has
illegally hijacked the party for his own purposes, most of them
nefarious. Buchanan and his loyalists once again tagged Hagelin, a
physicist and former professor at Maharishi University of
Management in Fairfield, Iowa, as a Johnny-come-lately, as well as
a sore loser who won't let go.
</P>
<P>
   Even by the convention's close on Sunday, which candidate will
receive the federal funds is likely to be unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Each side expects to see the other in court.
</P>
<P>
   But while delegates on both sides of the 9-year-old party
lamented the disruptions _ whether they were the initiators or the
recipients _ party officials applauded the fervor behind them. At
least, they said, they were not presenting a fake front as they
believe the Republicans did in Philadelphia last week and the
Democrats are likely to do next week in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passion is good. Passion deserves to be in politics, not
scripts,'' said Gerry Moan, a Buchanan backer who is interim
national chairman of the Reform Party. ``It is not pushing your
dirty laundry under the rug. This is a viable party.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Donna Donovan, chairwoman of the Connecticut Reform Party
and a Hagelin supporter, ``We're not militant types; we're just
citizens. But we will not compromise our principles. We have to
keep our promises to America, and I'm glad to say we're doing that
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Hagelin's people marched over to confront Buchanan's
and hours afterward, all of the energy threatened to eviscerate the
Reform Party. As Russell Verney, the former national chairman and
Perot confidant, put it, the party might be best off by not
reaching the 20 percent threshold necessary to qualify for federal
funding next time around. That way it can concentrate on building
state organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``All (the money) does,'' Verney said, ``is attract fruits and
nuts.''

COMMENTARY: THE STAKES ARE LOW 
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ This is the sound of the Reform Party's
presidential nominating convention:
</P>
<P>
   ``Traitor! Traitor!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Brownshirt tactics!''
</P>
<P>
   ``No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting rooms of the Long Beach Convention Center have been
the subject of a fierce territorial battle over the last few days.
The tide finally turned in favor of the forces supporting Pat
Buchanan, who won the critical backing of the center's rent-a-guard
service. ``All our rights are gone! We're being held prisoner!''
cried an Iowa delegate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's happening all over America,'' said another Reform Party
member, somewhat obscurely.
</P>
<P>
   People, this is what our politics has been missing: Rump
caucuses and delegate challenges and speakers fighting for control
of the microphone. The process that gave you the Mensheviks versus
Bolsheviks, the nomination of Warren G. Harding and the Chicago
Seven is back!
</P>
<P>
   This would be one exciting political event if only anybody cared
about the fate of the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   It is, at least, a cautionary lesson in what happens when a
political movement wraps itself around a single personality. For
the last two elections, the Reform Party was exactly as popular as
Ross Perot. When he lost interest, all that was left was a group of
alienated political junkies with nothing much in common but a
tendency to cultivate peculiar displays of facial hair.
</P>
<P>
   When Pat Buchanan volunteered to become Perot's replacement, it
apparently didn't occur to the party leaders that Buchanan would
replace them with his own loyal lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go home, you're nobody now,'' a Buchananite yelled at Russell
Verney, the former party head. Then came total rupture, two
conventions, two slates of officers, two balloon-blowing-up
machines, two prospective presidential nominees.
</P>
<P>
   You don't want to know the details. Let the authorities sort it
out. This is God's way of punishing the Federal Election Commission
for not doing more about campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Buchanan Reform Party'' now has control of the original
hall, which is decorated with cranky-looking American eagles and
lots of bunting, all paid for by you the taxpayers with federal
funding. (This is supposed to be the party of election reform, but
its convention has set the cause of federal financing back a
decade.) The other side is meeting down the street, at the Long
Beach Arts Center. The retired Queen Mary and a block-wide aquarium
full of jellyfish are somewhere in between, along with ``Ice
Dogs,'' which is either a hockey team or a really repulsive form of
fast food.
</P>
<P>
   While Party One celebrates the glory of Pat Buchanan, the rebels
are going to nominate John Hagelin. Hagelin's qualifications to be
president, which have already won him the nod of the Natural Law
Party, include the facts that he's a physicist and a former
professor at Maharishi University of Management in Fairfield, Iowa.
The two of them will duke it out in court for the $12.5 million in
federal matching funds the party qualifies for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe firmly there is a chance Pat Buchanan will be
elected president of the United States,'' said the candidate's
sister, Bay. The explanation of how Buchanan is going to parlay the
victory for control of the Long Beach Convention Center into the
presidency involved repeated use of the terms ``free media'' and
``Hail Mary pass.'' But the main point seems to be getting Buchanan
included in the presidential debates, with the help of ``pressure
from the public'' and a battery of lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, this whole convention is an excellent demonstration of
why Buchanan should be kept out. The debates are for candidates who
have to accept the discipline that comes with seriously attempting
to win the support of half the voting population of the country.
The Reform Party is currently not only a cheesy fringe operation,
but a fractionalized cheesy fringe operation, torn between a man
whose greatest political triumph was winning slightly more than a
quarter of the vote in a New Hampshire primary, and the guy from
the Maharishi University of Management. Let them sink into
obscurity in peace and quiet.

 &HT;    Walker enters Hall 20 years after leading Georgia to title
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Herschel Walker still calls himself one of the ``fastest guys in
the NFL.'' But the only thing the former University of Georgia
running back is carrying these days is his 10-month-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, 38, hasn't played in the National Football League since
1997. He never officially retired and says two NFL teams invited
him to workouts this summer. World Championship Wrestling has asked
Walker to face Bill Goldberg in the ring, and he still has dreams
of competing in Tae Kwon Do in the Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 38 years old, but I'm still one of the best conditioned
athletes out there,'' Walker said. ``Like a boxer that should be
getting out of the game but continues to stay in it, I continue to
train myself. I still feel that if I wanted to play football, I
could play. I'm in the shape to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's greatest player ever will be enshrined tonight into
the College Football Hall of Fame in South Bend, Ind. Walker, who
led the Bulldogs to the national championship in 1980 and won the
Heisman Trophy two years later, is the 11th former Georgia coach or
player to earn the honor. Former defensive back Terry Hoage will
become the 12th when he is formally inducted in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were solid throughout the (1980) football team, but
the one thing that we were missing was a really great tailback,''
said Georgia athletics director Vince Dooley, who coached the 1980
team. ``Herschel was absolutely the missing piece of the puzzle
that enabled the team to fit and become a champion.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been nearly two decades since Walker, the powerful
freshman from Wrightsville, made his college debut in Tennessee's
Neyland Stadium. With the Bulldogs trailing the Vols 15-2 late in
the third quarter, Walker took over and scored a 16-yard touchdown,
running over defender Bill Bates en route to the end zone. Walker
scored again on a 9-yard run that provided the difference in the
Bulldogs' 16-15 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to play in that game, but through the grace of
God, coach Dooley gave me an opportunity to get into the game,''
Walker recalled. ``I think Georgia was looking for a running back,
and that's where my luck came in. I think if another running back
had come to Georgia at that time, they might have done the same
things that I did.''
</P>
<P>
   That's highly unlikely. Before leaving Georgia after his junior
season, Walker broke 11 NCAA, 16 Southeastern Conference and 41
school records. His career rushing total of 5,259 yards is still
the fifth-best mark in NCAA history, even though he played in at
least 10 fewer games than the players ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   But Walker is best remembered for the 1980 season, in which he
set an NCAA freshman record with 1,616 rushing yards. He set the
Bulldogs' single-game record with 283 yards against Vanderbilt, and
gained 150 yards and scored two touchdowns in Georgia's 17-10
national championship victory over Notre Dame in the Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I did not think he would have the impact as fast as
he did,'' Dooley said. ``I thought midway through his freshman year
he might work his way in there. There was no question he was going
to play against Tennessee, but in fairness to the other tailbacks,
I didn't start him. I figured if Herschel was going to win the job,
he'd have to win the job in front of everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we put in Herschel, it was like night and day,'' Dooley
said. ``I don't think he knew where he was running, but one thing
was for sure _ he was going somewhere in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   With Walker in the backfield, Georgia won all but one of its 33
regular-season games from 1980-82. The Bulldogs won SEC
championships all three seasons and haven't won one since.
</P>
<P>
   Walker left Georgia on Feb. 25, 1983, when he signed an $8
million contract with the New Jersey Generals of the fledgling
United States Football League. For three years, Walker carried the
USFL on his back, earning MVP honors twice and gaining more than
7,000 all-purpose yards. But the USFL was a financial failure and
folded in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I would have done exactly the same thing (today),''
Walker said. ``In the USFL, people noticed that I could catch the
ball. I caught a few passes at Georgia, but I think people would
have stereotyped me if I would have gone into the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``People didn't realize that I had the talent to do all the
different things that I did,'' he said. ``They would have never
known that if I'd gone into the NFL. I would have just been an
I-formation back.''
</P>
<P>
   After the USFL collapsed, Walker signed with the Dallas Cowboys
as a free agent in 1986. He spent 15 years in the NFL, including
his first three with the Cowboys. In 1989, Walker was part of the
largest _ and perhaps most controversial _ trade in league history.
</P>
<P>
   Five games into the 1989 season, the Minnesota Vikings traded
five players and eight draft picks to Dallas for Walker. By the
time the last picks of the deal were made in 1992, the trade had
netted the Cowboys 19 new players, many of which helped Dallas win
three Super Bowls in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Vikings finished 21-22 in games in which Walker
played, and missed the playoffs three seasons in a row. Walker
signed with the Eagles in 1992 and was the team's offensive MVP in
his final season in '94. Walker's final three NFL seasons were
spent as a special-teams player and blocking back with the New York
Giants and Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   While Walker has received deserved recognition for his college
performance, he and others wonder whether his professional career
has been overlooked. Walker's 18,168 all-purpose yards rank fifth
all-time in the NFL. If you add in the 7,115 all-purpose yards
Walker gained in the USFL, he leads NFL career leader Walter Payton
by nearly 3,500 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Walker says he might be ostracized for playing in the USFL when
voters decide whether he should be inducted into the Pro Football
Hall of Fame. At the time of his decision to turn pro, the NFL
wouldn't accept college underclassmen into the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``People try to be politically correct and they're saying, 'He
shouldn't get into the Hall of Fame like Pete Rose shouldn't be
because of what he did,''' Walker said. ``If you start looking at
that, you're not looking at anyone's athletic ability. When people
are making decisions like that, I don't want to be a part of it. A
guy should get in for what he's done on a football field, and not
what he's done off of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro Football Hall of Fame voter John Clayton, of ESPN, said he
doesn't think Walker's time in the USFL will be held against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's going to be on the fringe (of getting into the
Hall of Fame) and may not make it,'' Clayton said. ``But there's no
penalty for playing in the USFL. Do you think it's going to affect
Reggie White? Do you think it's going to affect Jim Kelly or guys
like that when their time comes? But Walker is going to be going up
against some great running backs when his name comes up.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a development that could hasten the end of the
strike by more than 86,000 employees of Verizon Communications, the
company and its unions resolved an issue at the heart of their
dispute Thursday, people close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon will make it easier for the unions _ Communications
Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers _ to organize some of the employees currently in non-union
jobs in the company's wireless division. The unit, Verizon
Wireless, is the nation's largest wireless operator, and its
employees are not striking. The wireless operation is is managed
and majority owned by Verizon, the nation's largest
telecommunications employer, in a venture with Vodafone Airtouch of
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are other issues still to be resolved, and labor
experts said it remained unclear whether the wireless workers would
want to join a union, the strike's key sticking point has been
settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're at a situation where the rest of the issues
could come together pretty quickly,'' said Eric Rabe, a spokesman
for Verizon.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement reached Thursday would allow workers at Verizon
Wireless within the strike region to use an expedited organization
process called a card check, in which workers are allowed to join a
union if a majority of employees at a work site signs cards saying
they want to join. The card check is considered quicker and easier
than holding elections.
</P>
<P>
   This concession by Verizon could have far-reaching industry
implications, coming from the company that is both the nation's
largest wireless carrier and the largest local telephone company.
Altogether, Verizon, formed by Bell Atlantic's recently completed
acquisition of GTE Corp., has 260,000 employees. Verizon provides
wireless telephone service in 31 states and wireless service in 50
states. For the most part, the fast-growing wireless industry is
not unionized.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the union did not win an all-out victory on the wireless
issue, because the card check will be allowed only in the strike
region _ the 12 Eastern states, from Maine to Virginia, and the
District of Columbia, that made up the former Bell Atlantic
territory.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen how this issue might play out in other
parts of the country as various other parts of Verizon's union work
force come up for contract renewal in coming years. And for that
matter, it is not certain whether workers in Verizon Wireless, who
are relatively well-paid, will want to become union members.
</P>
<P>
   So far, fewer than 50 of Verizon Wireless' 32,000 employees are
union members. And only about 8,000 of those employees are in the
region covered by the current contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a slam-dunk,'' said Paul Osterman, professor of
management at MIT. ``The unions will have to articulate very well
what they can offer to the wireless people.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In any case, negotiators for Verizon and the unions representing
the striking workers now plan to turn their attention to other
issues.
</P>
<P>
   As the strike enters its sixth day, talks will address union
concerns that include the subcontracting of work to nonunion
workers in new technology areas like the installation of high-speed
Internet lines. Other issues on the table include job stress,
mandatory overtime and a new contract for the handful of employees
at Verizon Wireless who are already union members.
</P>
<P>
   The strike has made it difficult for the company to respond to
repair calls from customers, to install new lines or answer many
directory assistance requests. Moreover, acts of vandalism during
the strike have taken thousands of phone lines out of service in
New York City and other parts of the strike region.
</P>
<P>
   The strike has also strained relations between Verizon's
management and its striking rank-and-file technicians and customer
service representatives.
</P>
<P>
   In the largest display of this tension so far, some 8,000
striking workers protested Thursday outside Verizon's headquarters
on Sixth Avenue in midtown Manhattan, in a rally that formally
began at 11 a.m. As the ranks of demonstrators swelled, thousands
of workers spilled into Bryant Park, which is across the avenue
from the headquarters building.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the rally, John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO,
said the strike was important not just to Verizon employees but
also to other workers across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no peace for this renegade corporation until it
stops outsourcing good union jobs,'' Sweeney said, prompting cheers
from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Between speeches, the demonstrators shouted such slogans as ``We
will win'' and ``Shut them down,'' while a contingent of more than
100 police officers looked on. The crowd was generally peaceful,
but some strikers screamed and blew whistles at managers walking
into the Verizon headquarters building.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our future.'' said James Nicholson, 29, a striking
employee from the Bronx. ``wireless is a growth industry. We built
this company and we should have a chance to grow with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some employees expressed concern nervousness over the
possibility the company might bring in non-union replacement
workers during the strike. ``Scabs will pay,'' read some banners
waved by the strikers. Kevin Keenan, 24, of Brooklyn, had used a
marker to scrawl ``Scab Hunter'' across his T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the strikers who packed into Bryant Park trampled flower
gardens, destroyed 10-year-old ivy beds, and broke a fiberglass
sculpture of roses, said Daniel A. Biederman, president of the
Bryant Park Business Improvement District.
</P>
<P>
   He said it would cost about $6,000 to replace the plants, but
did not know the price of repairing the sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Andrew McInnis, a spokesman for the New York City Police
Department, said the strikers had a permit to demonstrate along
Sixth Avenue. As for the spillover into Bryant Park, ``it's a
public park,'' he said. ``Anybody is allowed to demonstrate in a
public park. That's the basis of the American way.''

HADASSAH LIEBERMAN USED TO BEING DIFFERENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARCELLA BOMBARDIERI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDNER, Mass. -- The first thing Hadassah Lieberman's mother,
Ella Freilich, says about her daughter is a surprise, a comment
from left field. But it proves to be a telling tidbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would have been an actress, if her father would permit
her,'' said Freilich about her daughter, the wife of Al Gore's
running mate, Senator Joseph Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Hadassah Lieberman, then, is a woman at home in the limelight, a
woman complimented by an audience. She is also a woman of family
and tradition, a good girl from a small town where the social woes
of the 1960's seemed far away.
</P>
<P>
   Even though her strict immigrant parents and her observant
Jewish upbringing made her different from her peers in the town of
Gardner, she never rebelled. Without any sign of angst, for
example, she gave up the theater and found other areas of interest,
like government and political science.
</P>
<P>
   Born half a world away to Holocaust survivors, then reared in
central Massachusetts (and educated at Boston University and
Northeastern), Lieberman is very much a product of both those
origins, according to friends and Lieberman herself. Those who know
her well say she is strong and passionate, but also unassuming and
gentle.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's got a lot of class and a lot of elegance,'' said Pattie
Gallant Mitchell, her best friend from high school. She's not
afraid to speak her mind, but she's also loving and soft in a lot
of ways.''
</P>
<P>
   What separates Lieberman, 52, from many political wives is her
immigrant background and the horrors her Czech family experienced
in the Holocaust. Her mother survived the Auschwitz and Dachau
concentration camps and her father escaped from a Nazi slave labor
camp. In an interview Thursday, Lieberman said that growing up the
daughter of Holocaust survivors has shaped both her personality and
the way she has lived her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain strength to the way you're raised,'' said
Lieberman, after a campaign appearance with Tipper Gore in front of
400 supporters at the Elm Street School, which used to be Gardner
High when Lieberman was a teen here. ``A certain, almost, I don't
want to use the world guilt - that's not the right word - but you
do feel a pressure that you have to make it, you have to move
forward for all the people that didn't make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the war, Samuel Freilich was a scholar, rabbi, and
lawyer. Drafted into a Jewish slave-labor battallion in Hungary
after the German occupation, he was forced to march to the Russian
front with 60,000 other Jews. He escaped in 1945, helped resettle
Jews and set up schools for orphans. Ella Freilich survived the
death camps, the rest of her family did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suffered, I and my husband. We returned after the
Holocaust, young people, orphans, with my parents destroyed,'' said
Freilich from her home in Riverdale in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Just months after the Soviet Union took power in Czechoslovakia
in 1948, Ella and Samuel, married a year, fled with Hadassah, then
an infant. In New York, the rabbi taught himself English, and
Lieberman said she can still remember him practicing with language
tapes. Then he looked for a posting in a synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gardner seemed like a nice town,'' said Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   A nice town it proved to be. Freilich became a leader of the
small, but vibrant, Jewish community as rabbi of Congregation Ohave
Shalom.
</P>
<P>
   Hadassah -- whose name means Esther in Hebrew -- spoke only
Yiddish, which she still understands, until she started
kindergarten. Her Jewish upbringing did place limits on the
popular, pretty girl. She couldn't drive a car or attend a dance on
Shabbat - Friday night and Saturday. Nor could she eat at friends'
homes, since her family kept kosher. She never complained, though,
friends say, but instead enjoyed relaxing, reading and taking walks
on the sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   Until Hadassah came along, school dances and proms had always
been on Friday nights. Her close-knit group of friends petitioned
the school and got the prom changed to a Saturday night, so
Hadassah -- fun-loving and a gentle tease -- could go.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was a drama star as well as a good debater. The school
scheduled all plays to meet her needs -- Thursday night, Saturday
night and Sunday. Thursday, Lieberman joked about her days dressing
up as a football and doing monologues during half-time, or
mortifying her brother with a Joan of Arc routine.
</P>
<P>
   She loved reading, especially Shakespeare and poetry, said
Mitchell, who walked with her to and from school every day. The
girls gossiped about boys, but Hadassah never had a steady
boyfriend. Her father, very strict, did not want her to date a
young man who wasn't Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course she was beautiful and boys were crazy about her,''
Mitchell said. ``But the few who were Jewish were intimidated
because her father was the rabbi.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Holocaust was seared in their souls, the Liebermans
were also very patriotic, grateful to the United States for the
freedom it represented. Mitchell remembers sobbing with Lieberman
when the two heard news of John F. Kennedy's assassination.
</P>
<P>
   After high school, Lieberman spent two years at Stern College,
the women's branch of Yeshiva University in New York. She then
transfered to B.U., she said, for the theater scene, and because
she wanted to focus on political studies, especially China and
Maoism. She earned a degree in government in 1970, the same year as
Tipper Gore and the year B.U. held no commencement because of the
turmoil of the Vietnam era. Lieberman went on to earn a master's
degree in political science at Northeastern.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's first marriage was to a rabbi, Gordon Tucker. They
had a son, Ethan, now 24, who is married and studying to be a
rabbi. She divorced in 1981, then married Joseph Lieberman in 1983.
They have a daughter, Hana, 13, who attended the rally along with
Ella Freilich and Ary Freilich, a real estate investor in New
Jersey. Samuel Freilich passed away several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen Hadassah as happy as she is since she's been
married to Joe,'' Mitchell said. ``She was fairly fine in a
traditional marriage, but she was just cut out for this. She never
thought she could be so complete.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Lieberman has done public relations work and
health care consulting, but has made raising her daughter a
priority. She has also been active in charitable causes, serving on
the board of the Auschwitz Jewish Center Foundation and undertaking
several ventures to promote women's health. She is helping a
Jerusalem hospital, for example, tackle heart disease among Arab
and Jewish women.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's extremely committed to making the world a better
place,'' said U.S. Assistant Surgeon General Susan Blumenthal, a
friend. ``Being a Holocaust survivors' daughter has given her that
sense of social justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Religion plays a major role in Joe and Hadassah's life. They
maintain Shabbat, and send Hana to an Orthodox school. Many have
wondered how such strict observance will affect their campaigning,
and Thursday was a test. It happened to be an important Jewish
holiday, Tisha B'Av, when observant Jews fast. But Lieberman would
not reveal whether she was fasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a traditional fast today, some people do fast, and that's
all I can tell you, right now,'' said Lieberman.
</P>

LOTS OF JOBS UP FOR GRABS ON PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A plethora of injured players, including the team's
major draft picks, and a choppy schedule have made the first Camp
Belichick a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick had fewer two-a-days than any Patriots coach in the
1990s. Part of the reason was the schedule, with two of the five
exhibition games coming during camp at Smithfield, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor was the injury-depleted roster. Belichick had to
take it easy on his healthy players, lest they join the walking
wounded. Still, Belichick said progress was made in conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Following Friday night's game against the hyped-up Washington
Redskins, whose owner, Daniel Snyder, will spend nearly $100
million on payroll, the Patriots return to Foxborough with a
one-practice-a-day schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the roadblocks, the Patriots come into Friday night's
game 2-0, with wins over San Francisco (20-0) and Detroit (13-10).
The defense has been strong and disruptive, the offense shaky.
</P>
<P>
   Battles for roster spots and starting jobs, and many are up for
grabs, will intensify as the first cuts, slated for Aug. 22,
approach.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick has been evasive about what starting spots are sewn
up. With Drew Bledsoe a given at quarterback, other spots that are
close to locks are wide receivers Terry Glenn and Vincent Brisby,
center Damien Woody, defensive end Willie McGinest, defensive
tackle Chad Eaton, cornerback Ty Law, safety Lawyer Milloy, middle
linebacker Ted Johnson, outside linebacker Chris Slade, kicker Adam
Vinatieri, and punter Lee Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at the jockeying.
</P>
<P>
   Backup quarterback: John Friesz, in the doghouse since failing
the running test (he has since passed), auditions for the No. 2 job
Friday night. With experience his strongest attribute, Friesz is
the incumbent backup. He has plenty of competition from the mobile
and popular Michael Bishop. Even if Friesz slips behind Bishop on
the depth chart, he will likely stay on the roster over rookie Tom
Brady, who despite completing 13 of 19 passes in two games, is
likely earmarked for the practice squad even if it means risking
losing him on waivers to another team.
</P>
<P>
   Running back: All eyes are on J.R. Redmond, the team's
third-round pick out of Arizona State and latest hope to replace
Curtis Martin. Though he fumbled numerous times in Wednesday's
practice, Redmond, recovering from groin surgery, will get his
first game time Friday night on special teams and in the backfield.
He has a long way to go to beat out Raymont Harris, but there is
time.
</P>
<P>
   Fullback: The candidates are Tony Carter, Chris Floyd, and
Harold Shaw. This is a dying position league-wide and not a
prominent one in this offense, but don't discount third-year man
Shaw. He is a top special teams player who appears on most of the
first-team cover units. He's a hard-nosed runner, more of a cross
between running back and fullback, but he also blocks well. Carter
is valuable for his veteran presence and receiving ability. Floyd
has the makings of the best pure fullback, but he has to prove he
can stay healthy (which he has so far) and can catch the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver: After Glenn, Brisby, and Troy Brown, there is
some competition. Third-year receiver and enigma Tony Simmons
hasn't looked good and lost his first-unit status. Local favorite
Sean Morey (Brown) has performed well on special teams and caught a
big 47-yard pass late in the win over the Lions. He'll be fighting
Shockmain Davis, Tony Gaiter, and newly acquired Dane Looker for
one or two spots.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end: A big area of concern. Veteran Eric Bjornson has the
only catch in two games. Rod Rutledge blocks well. Harvard free
agent Chris Eitzmann has performed well in the running game but
hasn't had a pass thrown his way. Rookie Dave Stachelski is a
nonfactor.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive line: After Woody, good luck. Rookie Greg
Robinson-Randall, a fourth-rounder out of Michigan State, has made
a strong impression at right tackle. Jason Andersen's versatility
helps his cause. Bruce Armstrong will be the starting left tackle
barring physical setbacks, but we won't see veterans Todd Rucci,
Grant Williams, or Lance Scott until later in camp. The versatility
of Lane and Andersen gives Belichick some flexibility, and he may
drop a bomb and cut one of the veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive line: After McGinest and Eaton, rookies Jeff Marriott,
Dave Nugent, and Reggie Grimes, and second-year nose tackle Garrett
Johnson are competing for starting spots with veteran Brandon
Mitchell, who hasn't played yet. Veteran Henry Thomas, who will be
out until the final exhibition game, and second-year end Greg
Spires will have to make it as situational players.
</P>
<P>
   Linebackers: Which two players will start on the inside?
Assuming Johnson is one, Tedy Bruschi and Andy Katzenmoyer are
waging a hot battle for the other slot. Katzenmoyer may have the
edge because of his size and quickness. Chad Cascadden, Rob
Holmberg, John Munch, Marc Megna, Maugaula Tuitele, and Casey
Tisdale are battling for four more spots.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive backs: The biggest battle is who starts between
Antonio Langham and Kato Serwanga. Langham has the edge because of
his Belichick ties (Cleveland) and knowledge of the system.
Serwanga has come a long way as a cover corner. Rookie Antwan
Harris figures as the extra corner. Tebucky Jones has to lose the
free safety job. Chris Carter is his competition, with Larry
Whigham in the distance (his special teams role is safe). Tony
George is buried behind Lawyer Milloy at strong safety.

 &HT;    Former rivals vow victory in November
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALINAS, Calif. _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush welcomed help from
former foe Arizona Sen. John McCain during his whistle-stop tour
through California's Central Valley Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Side by side, the former rivals pledged to work together to win
support from Democrats and independents who flocked to McCain
during the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   McCain _ a three-term senator and Vietnam War hero _ dealt Bush
his only real threat, beating Bush badly in New Hampshire and later
in Michigan in the race for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   McCain endorsed Bush in May after dropping out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who repeatedly sparred with Bush during the primary,
praised the governor and wife, Laura.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to lead this nation,'' McCain said . ``I'm proud to
be a part of this crusade. I support Governor Bush. I'm grateful to
him and I'm proud of him.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the two men agree on the theme and the specifics of
Bush's campaign and said they will continue to discuss McCain's
signature issue, the role of soft money in political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging their tough fight, McCain said: ``Look, primaries
are tough. They aren't a beanbag.''
</P>
<P>
   But both men were eager to put lingering questions about their
relationship behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primaries are family squabbles,'' Bush said. ``It was a tough
campaign. I'm a better candidate as a result of John entering the
race. He ran a great race. He really did. We were friends before
and we're friends now and that's what you can tell the independent
voter.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain spoke at the Steinbeck Center, an archive of the
works of author John Steinbeck whose classic novel, ``The Grapes of
Wrath,'' achingly depicted Depression-era poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Bush used the setting to affirm his support for welfare reform
legislation. President Clinton vetoed welfare reform legislation
twice before signing it into law in 1996. Next year, Congress must
vote to reauthorize the law before it expires in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``... We'll see how the opposition handles this issue, whether
or not they will stand up and say loud and clear that the welfare
reform bill, passed in both the House and Senate, signed by this
President, needs to be reauthorized,'' Bush said. ``I think it
does. I stand strongly on the side of the welfare reform that's
taken place. I stand strongly on the side of continuing to help
people help themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign spokesman Doug Hattaway said the vice president
wants the law reauthorized.
</P>
<P>
   Following the event, Bush and McCain boarded a bunting-draped
Amtrak commuter train for a winding trip through heavily
agricultural Monterey and San Joaquin counties.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats outnumber Republicans in both counties and President
Clinton won both in the last two elections. Bush's political staff
estimates that 26 percent of the voters in Monterey and 22 percent
of the voters in San Joaquin counties are swing voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain will campaign in Oregon and Washington Friday,
before arriving in Arizona Saturday. In a impromptu press
conference on the train, McCain said the two would go hiking around
his ranch, where Bush and his wife will spend the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try to show Governor Bush how Arizona barbecue is
far better than anything he's ever experienced in Texas,'' McCain
said.
</P>
<P>
   Laughing and joking, the two dismissed Gore campaign efforts to
re-air some of the bitter primary exchanges between Bush and
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we really wanted to, we could circulate those things that
Bradley and Gore said about each other as well,'' McCain said.
``It's foolishness and we all know it and people will take it for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he is confident he can perform well in California. A
recent poll indicates that the race in the Democratic-leaning state
may be tightening. A poll by the Public Policy Institute of
California had Gore with 40 percent, Bush with 37 percent, Green
Party candidate Ralph Nader with 8 percent and Pat Buchanan, with 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do we have a chance,'' Bush said. ``We're going to do
well and it's awfully helpful to have John McCain by my side.''

CHILD POVERTY RATE IS DECLINING BUT REMAINS HIGH, STUDY FINDS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Child poverty rates fell significantly in many
states in the current economic boom, but nationwide, and in all but
a handful of states, child poverty is still higher than it was 20
years ago, according to a study released on Thursday by the
National Center for Children in Poverty at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   More than 13 million American children, 3 million more than in
1979, live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Here in California, where one out of six of the nation's poor
children live, child poverty has been a particularly stubborn
problem. According to the study, from 1979 to 1993 the child
poverty rate soared by 90 percent as the Golden State was badly
tarnished by recession, and declined only 14.9 percent in the next
five years of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The recent decline was encouraging but still lagged behind the
rest of the nation, which saw a 17.1 percent decline after a 38.8
percent increase from 1979 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, according to census data, the child poverty rate
rose from 16.2 percent in 1979 to 18.7 percent in 1998, the most
current information available.
</P>
<P>
   Elected officials and child advocates across the country, cited
low wages and high living costs as primary factors in the
persistence of child poverty. Deborah Leff, president and chief
executive officer of America's Second Harvest, the nation's largest
domestic hunger relief organization, said a family earning minimum
wage is ``literally earning thousands of dollars under the poverty
line,'' which in 1998 was $16,666 for a family of four and today is
$17,050.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can get off welfare, work hard, play by the rules and
still not be able to feed your family,'' Leff said.
</P>
<P>
   The report does not say why some states, like Illinois and New
Jersey, have seen significant declines in child poverty rates since
1979, and others have seen increases or relatively minor declines.
</P>
<P>
   Whether welfare reform has had any effect on child poverty rates
is also unclear, said Julian Palmer, a spokesman for the children's
poverty center.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Goerge, assistant director of the Chapin Center for
Children at the University of Chicago, said Illinois' early welfare
overhaul, with generous benefits, which began in 1993, helped
explain why the state's children have risen out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   That program, for instance, allowed welfare recipients to
continue receiving health benefits and food stamps while easing
into full-time employment, long before other states allowed such a
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really does make a big difference,'' said Goerge. ``You
have the incentive to work. You can make more money and not get
penalized.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline Tencza, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department
of Human Services, said the state has taken money saved through the
reduction of Aid to Families with Dependent Children payments and
spent it to help people who get off welfare.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Tencza said, ``We have been able to take money
that had been spent for cash assistance, that is welfare checks,
and spend it in other areas. We moved $100 million that previously
had been spent on cash assistance on subsidized child care.''
</P>
<P>
   At $125 to $150 a week, the cost of child care often accounts
for 40 percent or more of the take-home pay of a former welfare
mother who has just joined the work force, Tencza said.
</P>
<P>
   But in Georgia, where welfare caseloads have been cut by more
than half since 1997, the number of children in poverty jumped more
than 29 percent from 1993 to 1998, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   Michael L. Thurmond, commissioner of the Georgia Department of
Labor and the architect of the state's welfare reform plan, said,
``I don't think anyone ever believed that the immediate result of
welfare reform would be the reduction of poverty.'' Poverty, he
said, can take generations to overcome and ``generational problems
require generational solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, poverty has dogged Zena Garcia's life and her
children's for years. But this year was going to be different. This
year, Garcia was going to do something special for her son James'
12th birthday next Thursday. Maybe she would take him to the zoo or
buy him one of those foldable scooters every kid seems to zip by
on. This year was going to be different, because this year her
husband, Manuel, 36, had a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband is working as hard as he can but it's still not
enough to pay the bills,'' Mrs. Garcia, 43, said here the other
day. ``I haven't been able to pay the phone bill in two months and
they're about to cut it off. And on Friday, I have to make a
choice: Pay the gas bill or buy shoes for my daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter, Virginia, is 6 and will start first grade in the
fall. Garcia knows what her choice will be. She is going to buy her
daughter a pair of shoes. If the gas is shut off, ``we'll deal with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the same thing for my kids that every parent wants,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Garcia works as a cook's assistant in a hospital, but has
no steady hours and no benefits. He takes home between $399 and
$500 every two weeks. He repeatedly has applied for part-time or
full-time status, which would provide the family with crucial
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're waiting and praying that it happens,'' Zena Garcia said.
Mr. and Mrs. Garcia, who were born in this country, both completed
a job training program at St. Joseph Center in nearby Santa Monica,
an organization that helps poor families. But so far Mrs. Garcia
has not been able to find work and has returned to school to earn a
high school equivalency degree. As their case worker, Lupe Rojo,
said, the Garcias are doing all they can to make it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets depressing,'' Mrs. Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   Her son, James, lives in a home for troubled children. She talks
to him every other day on the telephone and that is why her phone
bill is so high. She has not had the heart to tell him that he
cannot go to the zoo or have a scooter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to hurt,'' she said. ``It's going to hurt me.''
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter, Virginia, has been pestering her about a scooter
of her own. But seeing her mother near tears the other day, the
child put a hand on Mrs. Garcia's shoulder and said, ``Only get
one, because I'll share mine with James.''

TWO BIG ONLINE TOY SELLERS TO MERGE UNITS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us and Amazon.com said Thursday that they were
merging their online toy-sales units, an acknowledgment that
selling toys on the Internet has been too hard for each of them
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Starting later this year, toysrus.com will direct users to a toy
section of Amazon.com. Customers will be able to use their Amazon
accounts to buy toys, books, tools and other merchandise in a
single order that will be shipped in one box.
</P>
<P>
   But Amazon's role will shift from being a store proprietor to
being something more like a mall owner. Toys ``R'' Us will buy the
inventory, set the prices, write the item descriptions and get
credit for the revenue and any potential profits or losses. Toys
``R'' Us will pay Amazon to use its Internet site and to house the
merchandise in its warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This allows both of us to reach profitability in our toy
businesses significantly sooner than we would have been able to,''
said Jeffrey P. Bezos, chief executive of Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also helps each company avoid the more troubling
aspects of its toy business.
</P>
<P>
   Last Christmas, Toys ``R'' Us was hit by myriad operating
problems, from crashes on its Web site to an inability to deliver
toys when promised. Amazon was able to satisfy customers, but it
did so at a big cost. It had ordered so many toys that it had to
take a $39 million writedown on its unsold inventory, a huge number
relative to its total sales of toys and children's merchandise of
$95 million in the fourth quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon has found toys a more difficult business than books and
records. They are big and expensive to ship. They must be ordered,
largely from Asia, six months ahead of time, forcing a retailer to
predict children's whims. And unlike books, unwanted toys cannot be
returned to manufacturers for credit.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us will sell its three distribution centers, which
analysts estimate it had spent $50 million to build. And Amazon
will sell Toys ``R'' Us its inventory of toys. Neither company
would say if a charge would be taken to cover those costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are getting better, but they are three years ahead of us,
and we would never catch up,'' said John Eyler, chief executive of
Toys ``R'' Us.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts praised Amazon for getting out of a tough business.
</P>
<P>
   ``They capitulated,'' said Lauren Levitan, an analyst with
Robertson Stevens. ``They needed to do something to mitigate their
inventory risk and create a more predictable business for
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The move is not without a cost to Amazon's image. ``I am struck
by the irony of the visionary poster boy for the new economy being
mated with the poster child of eroding retail brands,'' Levitan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Caruso, a retail analyst with Merrill Lynch, said the
highlight of the deal was that the market for Toys ``R'' Us might
not be eroding as fast as some had feared.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tells you the success Amazon had in books is not going to
be repeated in other areas, and the Internet toy market is not
going to be as large as everyone thought,'' he said. ``That means
that Toys `R' Us is not going to be vulnerable sitting there with
all those stores.''
</P>
<P>
   This vision of the toy market is vastly different from a year
ago, when half a dozen companies were preparing to spend an
estimated $200 million to promote online toy stores. Christmas
proved to be a Waterloo for many of them. Toysmart, an online store
backed by Walt Disney, failed, as did Red Rocket, a toy store owned
by Viacom. And KBKids.com, controlled by KB Toys, the No. 2 store
chain, has abandoned its plan for a public offering and has laid
off 30 percent of its work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great news for us,'' said Toby Lenk, the chief
executive of eToys, the No. 1 online toy store. ``Last year we had
half a dozen competitors. Now our two remaining competitors are
merging into one.''
</P>
<P>
   Lenk said he expected the steep price cutting of last year to be
far less severe this Christmas. ``A lot of the players doing the
insane discounting are just not here anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, however, were largely unmoved by the deal. Shares in
Toys ``R'' Us closed unchanged at $17.375. Amazon shares slipped
43.75 cents, to $30.4375. Etoys dropped 9 cents, to $3.9375.
</P>
<P>
   Under the arrangement with Amazon, online customers will no
longer be able to return toys to stores, as Toys ``R'' Us customers
have been able to do. Conversely, though, most will no longer have
to pay sales tax.

CUSTOMERS RESPONDING TO RECALL FIND FEW NEW TIRES AVAILABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.J., Fla., Calif.)   (See also TIRE-FIRESTONE, TIRE-BRIDGESTONE) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Matha was fuming as he sat outside a Firestone tire and
service center in Medford, N.J. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He pulled up to an automotive service center after hearing news
reports that the tires on his gold Ford Explorer had been recalled
by the manufacturer because tests found defects that may have
contributed to several dozen deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard that they're putting people off because there's a
shortage of replacement tires, but I'm not taking no for an
answer,'' Matha, a pharmaceuticals salesman said. ``We have a baby,
we're very safety conscious and the car has not moved out of the
driveway since the recall was announced.''
</P>
<P>
   But, like thousands of vehicle owners across the country, he was
turned away without new tires.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Wednesday that millions of Firestone tires were
being recalled sent panicked customers rushing to service centers
Thursday only to be told , in many cases, that they would have to
wait more than a year for replacements.
</P>
<P>
   The recall began in Southern and Western states and will be
expanded across the country over the next 18 months. The wait for
new tires will be longest outside the Southern and Western states,
where intense heat is suspected of causing treads to separate from
tires. The staggered replacement plan has alarmed consumer
advocates as well as vehicle owners. Several of the groups
threatened suits over the delays, and New York Attorney General
Eliot Spitzer wrote federal officials voicing his concern over the
recall program.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturer, Bridgestone/Firestone, defended the regional
replacement plan . ``We will do everything we can to get them
replaced, but we are focusing our efforts on parts of the country
where their have been most of the incidents,'' said Cynthia
McCafserty, a spokeswoman for Bridgestone/Firestone. The company
intends to purchase competitors' tires to meet replacement demand.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage has led to long waiting lists at service centers,
from New York to the Sun Belt and has forced many tire dealers to
turn customers away at a time when families are preparing for long
summer road trips.
</P>
<P>
   William Molloy was upset Thursday after sales representatives at
a Garden City, N.Y. tire dealer told him he would have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make sense,'' said Molloy, 33, whose Explorer is
outfitted with the tires being recalled. ``The guy told me that
they are sending them all down South; it feels like a runaround. I
don't want to be worried about tires blowing out on the highway.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the replacement program calls for most but not all
of the replacement tires to be sent to authorized dealers in
Southern and Western states, where the most serious accidents have
occurred. Indeed, as word of the recall spread, so did the rumors.
Many vehicle owners with tires that were not a part of the recall
were misinformed and showed up at dealerships Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that the public was confused about which tires were
being recalled, Ford said Thursday that it would take out full-page
advertisements in many large newspapers to explain which vehicles
typically had the tires as factory-installed equipment and which
did not.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone and Ford did not identify the vehicles at their news
conference on Wednesday, and this appeared to have backfired.
</P>
<P>
   Roberson Jeudy, 25, a New York City police officer whose Ford
Expedition has Wilderness AT tires that need to be replaced,
complained about how Firestone was handling the recall. ``I don't
think it is fair. California is not the only state they are
serving,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer, New York's attorney general, agreed, saying that ``a
defective product is a defective product.''It is simply not
acceptable to acknowledge a serious safety hazard, offer immediate
relief for some consumers while telling other consumers to wait up
to 18 months until the problem is corrected.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer sent a letter to Rosalyn G. Millman, a deputy director
of the National Highway Traffic Administration, requesting that the
agency review Firestone's recall plans.
</P>
<P>
   But McCafserty, the Firestone spokeswoman, said the rationale
behind starting in the Southern and Western states was that it
appeared heat was a contributing factor to problems with the tires
and all the serious accidents involving them occurred in the
region's targeted in the recall's first phase. The company plans to
focus on getting new tires to customers based on where they are
driving, even if it is not necessarily where they live, she added.
</P>
<P>
   The last major Firestone recall was in 1978, when the now
defunct Firestone Tire &AMP; Rubber Co. was fined $500,000 by federal
regulators and forced to recall more than 14 million of its
500-series tires that were defective. Firestone nearly went
bankrupt after that recall and was later bought by Bridgestone
Corp. in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of the tires in question in the current recall
came new on sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks made by the
Ford Motor Co. over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   The names of the recalled tires are ATX, ATX II and Wilderness
AT, all for 15-inch wheels, with a size designation that is
P235/75R15. All such ATX and ATX II tires being recalled, but only
those Wilderness AT tires that also have a Transportation
Department 10-digit designation starting with the letters VD are
being recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Several lawsuits have been filed against Firestone, on behalf of
consumers, contending that all of the Wilderness tires should be
replaced. Some plaintiff lawyers said Thursday that many of their
lawsuits involved the failure of tires that were not included in
the recall and were being offered by Firestone as replacements for
the recalled tires.
</P>
<P>
   Even in states like Florida, which is among the states included
in the first phase, Firestone officials acknowledged that many
consumers would have to wait for replacements. Olson Tires, an
authorized Firestone dealer in Boca Raton, Fla., had run out of
tires by Wednesday afternoon, hours after the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday afternoon, the dealer had already built up a backlog
of requests for more than 35 tires. Olson told customers it was
expecting shipments of replacement tires over next couple days, but
that did little to appease ancy drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Davis, a teacher's aide from Coconut Creek, Fla. said her
family had planned a weekend trip to the islands off of Florida's
western coast for a short vacation before school started but called
off those plans after she left Olsen with the original tires still
on her Ford Explorer. ``I'm not going to do anything until this is
taken care of,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers across the country expressed similar concerns. ``Who
wants to drive around waiting for your tires to blow?'' Gwenivere
O'Neil, an actress, complained after filling out a form at a
Hollywood, Calif. dealership that did not have an replacement tires
available.
</P>
<P>
   Pablo Medina, the manager of La Cienega Firestone, an
independent dealer in Los Angeles, said that the recall left many
consumers concerned about all Firestone products. ``There is
nothing I can do,'' Medina said, adding that he was waiting for
instructions from Firestone about how to deal with the recall.

THE THUNDER AND CAUTION OF A HIGHLY-MOTIVATED RAY LEWIS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTMINSTER, Md. _ It took only a short time before Baltimore
Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis got a taste of what his return to the
National Football League was going to be like after the nationally
televised trial in which he was accused of killing two people.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens were scrimmaging recently against the Washington
Redskins and Lewis was doing what he always does: hitting hard,
running fast, simply dominating. Suddenly the voice of a fan
wearing a Redskins jersey rose over the clang of banging shoulder
pads. Other voices joined in.
</P>
<P>
   They yelled to Lewis, ``We know you did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis had been waiting for that first comment from a fan, and
when it came, he said, he felt no twinge of anger. He said the
harsh words rolled off his back like water in a rainstorm.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Lewis had faced the real possibility of spending
the rest of his life in prison, where there are no Super Bowls or
big paychecks. So tough words from a few fans meant little to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't play in between the lines,'' Lewis said, ``I do.
You know what? Guys who yell that stuff aren't fans; they're jerks.
I can't let them bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   Little seems to bother Lewis right now as he works his way back
to normalcy in his private and professional lives while
simultaneously changing his lifestyle. Lewis maintains that he will
now choose his friends better and that when he does go to a night
club, he will try to avoid the more raucous hangouts.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis also says he will take the extraordinary step of hiring an
off-duty police officer to accompany him whenever he is in a social
setting.
</P>
<P>
   A bodyguard for an All-Pro NFL linebacker? Not bodyguard in the
true sense of the word; after all, Lewis has muscles on top of his
muscles. He simply wants an extra set of eyes to watch his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain situations where I might go out and do
something with friends or my teammates,'' Lewis said. ``Even in the
most careful setting something can happen. I want to make sure what
happened to me in Atlanta never happens again. I want to have an
officer with me who will say, `Ray Lewis was with me the entire
time.' That's what you have a bodyguard for.''
</P>
<P>
   Please forgive Lewis if he seems overly cautious. As recently as
May, he was wearing an orange prison jumpsuit after being accused
of taking part in the stabbing death of two men outside an Atlanta
night club hours after the Super Bowl. Lewis and two friends,
Reginald Oakley and Joseph Sweeting, were charged with murder and
aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The trial ensued and Lewis, rightly or wrongly, became a symbol
of NFL athletes run amok. But the prosecution's case crumbled and
in early June the murder charges were dropped in exchange for a
guilty plea by Lewis to obstruction of justice, a misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis admitted that he had not told police investigators all
that he knew about the murders when he was questioned shortly after
the incident, and that he had told his co-defendants to say nothing
about what had happened. As part of the deal, Lewis agreed to
testify against Oakley and Sweeting, who were later found not
guilty by a jury.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those tortuous months, anyone expecting a downtrodden,
or extremely bitter, Lewis will be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can sit here and gripe, I can grind, I can be mad at the
world and hate everybody,'' he said. ``But that's not me.
</P>
<P>
   ``But let me be honest with you. You're always going to have
some moments where you have these thoughts in your mind saying,
`Why would people treat me like that?' That's the tough part about
it. Not to the point where I want revenge. No, I didn't like the
way the prosecution treated me. No, I didn't like the way the
police handled me. I did not like that. Never will. But I don't
hold a grudge. I'll just never have dinner with those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience actually motivated Lewis, who at age 25 is
already one of the NFLs premier linebackers. Lewis was the league's
leading tackler last season, with 167, and he has been selected for
the Pro Bowl three times in his four NFL seasons. His team will
play a preseason game with the Jets tomorrow night in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis worked out each day after court in Atlanta with his good
friend Shannon Sharpe, and as a result Lewis is a sturdy 253 pounds
with 7 percent body fat. He is in the best shape of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was happening to me made me push myself even harder,''
Lewis said. ``Sometimes we would walk out of the weight room, and
then turn around and go back in, because I would think of the
trial, and it would make me angry, and then I'd want to take it out
on the weights.''
</P>
<P>
   He now reaps the benefits of those workouts, as does his team.
Because of solid free-agent signings, including that of Sharpe, a
tight end from Denver, an excellent draft from the most underrated
personnel department in football and a motivated Lewis on what last
season was already the league's second-ranked defense, there is no
question Baltimore is a Super Bowl contender.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens are dreaming of a championship, but their motivation
goes beyond Xs and Os. The players _ indeed, the entire
organization _ have rallied around Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   To a man, his teammates view him as someone who made serious
mistakes in judgment with his choice of friends and his lying to
the police, but nevertheless was someone overcharged by a zealous
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   No one in football was more loyal to Lewis than the Ravens'
owner, Art Modell. When Lewis needed money to pay for an estimated
$1.5 million in legal fees, Modell advanced a portion of Lewis'
salary. Most of all, Modell defended Lewis, both to the NFL and to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Modell's motive was keeping a great talent from going to
prison, but an equally large reason was Modell's belief in being
loyal to his players. Modell says he also felt strongly that Lewis
was not guilty of murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was criticized by people in the league office for leading
with my chin,'' Modell said. ``I told the league, `If I am going to
lead, it should be with my chin.' People in the league said, `Well
what if he's guilty?' I told them, `He's not capable of killing
anybody.'''
</P>
<P>
   It does not take long when watching a Ravens practice to hear a
sudden sound that is a cross between colliding cars and a bolt of
thunder. The noise is Lewis crashing into a running back or an
offensive lineman. No player in the sport hits harder and none is
more motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think about where I could have ended up, where I might
be right now,'' Lewis said, ``that makes football all the more
important.''  &QL;

 &HT;    NCAA weighing pullout over flag
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt and Tony Barhnart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - As the NCAA today considers moving the 2002 Final Four
men's basketball tournament out of Georgia in response to
opposition to the state flag, officials worry the timing may hurt
efforts to resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Martin Luther King III, president of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, sent a letter to NCAA President
Cedric Dempsey asking that the tournament be relocated to another
state if Georgia doesn't remove the Confederate battle emblem from
the flag by March 31, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes responded that pulling the tournament from
Georgia would be a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Removing the Final Four from Georgia would not be productive
to the ongoing debate about Georgia's flag,'' Barnes said. ``This
is a difficult issue about which discussions are ongoing. Actions
like this do nothing but inflame and excite emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, King said the Confederate emblem represents ``the
most reprehensible aspects of American history for people of
African ancestry'' and for others who ``know and understand the
destructive horrors created by slavery in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   NCAA spokesman Wally Renfro confirmed the issue would be
discussed by the executive committee during its regularly scheduled
meeting today in Indianapolis. He said a statement would likely be
released afterward.
</P>
<P>
   NCAA officials were not surprised by King's request.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had several discussions with the SCLC and the NAACP
about the flag issue and knew that this request would be coming,''
Renfro said. ``The letter from the SCLC, however, was the first
thing we have gotten in writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the SCLC has called for pulling the men's
basketball Final Four from Atlanta in 2002 and 2007 and the women's
basketball Final Four in 2003 out of the Georgia Dome if the
confederate symbol is not removed from the Georgia flag by next
spring.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-member committee, made up of university presidents, is
the most powerful body in college athletics and must ultimately
approve all NCAA legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Legislature added the Confederate battle emblem to
the state flag in 1956 in what critics say was an act of defiance
to U.S. Supreme Court-ordered school desegregation.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, civic and business leaders and key state lawmakers have
met in recent weeks to discuss how best to avoid a potentially
explosive election-year fight that could polarize the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome external pressure at the appropriate time,'' said
Calvin Smyre (D-Columbus), an African-American who heads the
Democratic caucus in the state House. But ``I'm not at that
juncture yet to call for a boycott . . . .''
</P>
<P>
   State lawmakers will take up the issue in January, Smyre said.
``I don't want to operate in the confinement of threats,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Tyrone Brooks (D-Atlanta), one of the prime sponsors of
legislation each year to change the flag, said the SCLC's request
doesn't conflict with that overall plan.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said SCLC officials never intended for the letter to be
made public. He said King ``was trying to communicate in private
with the Final Four,'' but added that he agreed with the call to
move the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said the potential loss of such major sports events would
underscore among the business community the seriousness of the
issue. ``It's going to catch their attention. It will send a signal
to them that they should be more active in helping us resolve this
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   If the NCAA decides to pull out, it would be a major blow, said
Gary Stokan, president of the Atlanta Sports Council. He estimated
the economic impact for the men's games in 2002 at $50 million and
the women's games in 2003 at $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Stokan said he hopes to talk with King and has called NCAA
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flag can only be changed by a vote of the state
Legislature and since they don't go into session until January,
there's nothing we can do at this juncture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time in recent months that the NCAA has dealt
with the issue of the Confederate flag. It still has not fully
resolved its stance with South Carolina, where first- and
second-round games in the men's basketball tournament are scheduled
for Greenville in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP and the National Association of Basketball Coaches
asked that the tournament be taken out of South Carolina if the
Confederate flag was not removed from the Capitol in Columbia. The
flag was taken off the Capitol building and moved to a nearby site
on the Capitol grounds. Dissatisfied with that compromise, both
parties are still asking for the boycott to continue.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia the Confederate emblem is incorporated into the state
flag's design. Meanwhile, the Coalition to Change the State Flag, a
group of civil rights and religious groups, plans a November summit
in South Georgia to devise a strategy for lobbying the Legislature
next year. Brooks said the summit will include not only black
lawmakers and clergy, but also will reach out to Republicans, South
Georgia Democrats and business leaders from around the state in an
attempt to avoid a divisive fight like South Carolina's.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time King has pushed for such action
against Georgia's flag. In April, he used a ceremony commemorating
the anniversary of his father's assassination to threaten an
SCLC-sponsored boycott if the flag isn't changed during the 2001
legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, former Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson criticized
such a boycott, saying it would hurt the city of Atlanta, which has
``done the right thing'' by removing the state flag from city
facilities and by pushing for a change in the design.
</P>
<P>
   Other flag opponents say the SCLC's effort isn't the most
effective way to build support for restoring Georgia's flag to the
pre-1956 design.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is: Do you want publicity or do you want
results?'' said Rep. Bob Holmes (D-Atlanta), an African-American
and director of the Southern Center for Studies in Public Policy at
Clark Atlanta University.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the flag first need to devise an overall strategy,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're out front like a general without an army following
you, you don't usually win,'' Holmes said. ``I want (the change) as
bad as anybody (but) if you get in a political situation where you
back people to the wall before you sit down and talk to them, it
might boomerang on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes said the main groups hurt by moving the basketball games
would be the city of Atlanta, which has a large minority population
and city leaders who already have removed the state flag from
municipal facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Any decision by the NCAA to move sports events out of Georgia
would be a severe blow to the city's successful sports image. In
addition to the men's and women's Final Four tournaments, the
Georgia Dome is scheduled to host the NCAA men's Southeast Regional
in March and several other basketball events over the next 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta also has submitted bids to host NCAA first- and
second-round tournaments in 2004 and 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure this episode doesn't hurt those bids,''
Stokan said. A spokesman for the Southeastern Conference, which
holds its championship football game at the Dome each December,
said the SEC had received no inquiries concerning its events in
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Atlantic Coast Conference supported the
coaches' call for a boycott of South Carolina during the ACC
baseball tournament. The tournament was still held in Fort Mill,
S.C., but the participating athletes were housed in nearby
Charlotte, N.C. The 2001 men's ACC basketball tournament is set for
the Georgia Dome in March.

   ``We've had several discussions with the SCLC and the NAACP
about the flag issue and knew that this request would be coming,''
Renfro said. ``The letter from the SCLC, however, was the first
thing we have gotten in writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the SCLC has called for pulling the men's
basketball Final Four from Atlanta in 2002 and 2007 and the women's
basketball Final Four in 2003 out of the Georgia Dome if the
confederate symbol is not removed from the Georgia flag by next
spring.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-member committee, made up of university presidents, is
the most powerful body in college athletics and must ultimately
approve all NCAA legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Legislature added the Confederate battle emblem to
the state flag in 1956 in what critics say was an act of defiance
to U.S. Supreme Court-ordered school desegregation.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, civic and business leaders and key state lawmakers have
met in recent weeks to discuss how best to avoid a potentially
explosive election-year fight that could polarize the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome external pressure at the appropriate time,'' said
Calvin Smyre (D-Columbus), an African-American who heads the
Democratic caucus in the state House. But ``I'm not at that
juncture yet to call for a boycott . . . .''
</P>
<P>
   State lawmakers will take up the issue in January, Smyre said.
``I don't want to operate in the confinement of threats,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Tyrone Brooks (D-Atlanta), one of the prime sponsors of
legislation each year to change the flag, said the SCLC's request
doesn't conflict with that overall plan.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said SCLC officials never intended for the letter to be
made public. He said King ``was trying to communicate in private
with the Final Four,'' but added that he agreed with the call to
move the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said the potential loss of such major sports events would
underscore among the business community the seriousness of the
issue. ``It's going to catch their attention. It will send a signal
to them that they should be more active in helping us resolve this
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   If the NCAA decides to pull out, it would be a major blow, said
Gary Stokan, president of the Atlanta Sports Council. He estimated
the economic impact for the men's games in 2002 at $50 million and
the women's games in 2003 at $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Stokan said he hopes to talk with King and has called NCAA
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flag can only be changed by a vote of the state
Legislature and since they don't go into session until January,
there's nothing we can do at this juncture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time in recent months that the NCAA has dealt
with the issue of the Confederate flag. It still has not fully
resolved its stance with South Carolina, where first- and
second-round games in the men's basketball tournament are scheduled
for Greenville in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP and the National Association of Basketball Coaches
asked that the tournament be taken out of South Carolina if the
Confederate flag was not removed from the Capitol in Columbia. The
flag was taken off the Capitol building and moved to a nearby site
on the Capitol grounds. Dissatisfied with that compromise, both
parties are still asking for the boycott to continue.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia the Confederate emblem is incorporated into the state
flag's design. Meanwhile, the Coalition to Change the State Flag, a
group of civil rights and religious groups, plans a November summit
in South Georgia to devise a strategy for lobbying the Legislature
next year. Brooks said the summit will include not only black
lawmakers and clergy, but also will reach out to Republicans, South
Georgia Democrats and business leaders from around the state in an
attempt to avoid a divisive fight like South Carolina's.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time King has pushed for such action
against Georgia's flag. In April, he used a ceremony commemorating
the anniversary of his father's assassination to threaten an
SCLC-sponsored boycott if the flag isn't changed during the 2001
legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, former Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson criticized
such a boycott, saying it would hurt the city of Atlanta, which has
``done the right thing'' by removing the state flag from city
facilities and by pushing for a change in the design.
</P>
<P>
   Other flag opponents say the SCLC's effort isn't the most
effective way to build support for restoring Georgia's flag to the
pre-1956 design.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is: Do you want publicity or do you want
results?'' said Rep. Bob Holmes (D-Atlanta), an African-American
and director of the Southern Center for Studies in Public Policy at
Clark Atlanta University.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the flag first need to devise an overall strategy,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're out front like a general without an army following
you, you don't usually win,'' Holmes said. ``I want (the change) as
bad as anybody (but) if you get in a political situation where you
back people to the wall before you sit down and talk to them, it
might boomerang on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes said the main groups hurt by moving the basketball games
would be the city of Atlanta, which has a large minority population
and city leaders who already have removed the state flag from
municipal facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Any decision by the NCAA to move sports events out of Georgia
would be a severe blow to the city's successful sports image. In
addition to the men's and women's Final Four tournaments, the
Georgia Dome is scheduled to host the NCAA men's Southeast Regional
in March and several other basketball events over the next 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta also has submitted bids to host NCAA first- and
second-round tournaments in 2004 and 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure this episode doesn't hurt those bids,''
Stokan said. A spokesman for the Southeastern Conference, which
holds its championship football game at the Dome each December,
said the SEC had received no inquiries concerning its events in
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Atlantic Coast Conference supported the
coaches' call for a boycott of South Carolina during the ACC
baseball tournament. The tournament was still held in Fort Mill,
S.C., but the participating athletes were housed in nearby
Charlotte, N.C. The 2001 men's ACC basketball tournament is set for
the Georgia Dome in March.

`CECIL B. DEMENTED': US AGAINST THEM (THE HOLLYWOOD PHILISTINES) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When was it that the films of John Waters stopped seeming so
subversive and began feeling like nostalgia-drenched fables of
rebellion with a warm and fuzzy tinge?
</P>
<P>
   Or is just that the times have changed enough for us to realize
that Waters' movies have always essentially been cheery twisted
sitcoms improvised by a goofy extended family in an imaginary
suburban attic? Snug in their Saturday afternoon play world, the
actors gleefully pluck whatever garish costumes catch their eye
from a giant trunk and turn the pop culture wars of the last
half-century into sophisticated children's theater.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Waters' movies, you always have the us-against-them
notion of 1950s squares being tweaked by bohemians, hippies and
freaks. Or, to look at it differently, the world is divided into
grim, gray-faced adults and a liberated minority who refuse to grow
up and like nothing better than to expose themselves at the dinner
table.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, of course, the notion of us-against-them is almost
comforting in its complacency. Yet it is still not entirely
shopworn. Even now, Waters' movies have a way of clearing the air
by pointing out that most of us take life, especially sex, far too
seriously. Only those with no sense of humor would deny that there
is a grain of truth in his reduction of politics, art and sex in
the age of television into smut-littered games of dress-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cecil B. DeMented,'' his newest comedy, is an amusing,
cunningly made but less-than-hilarious outcry against Hollywood
philistinism, an easy target if ever there was one. Although the
movie takes swipes at everything from Pauly Shore to ``Patch
Adams'' to the inflated price of movie popcorn, its spirit is so
cheery that little if any genuine outrage registers.
</P>
<P>
   Like his last movie, the much funnier ``Pecker,'' ``Cecil B.
DeMented,'' which opens Friday at the Angelika Film Center, has a
strong autobiographical undertow. It is set in Baltimore, Waters'
hometown, and the cast includes such members of Waters' informal
repertory company as Mink Stole, Ricki Lake and Patricia Hearst.
The title character, an autocratic director who is the leader of a
guerrilla troupe of cinema terrorists, suggests a mad Stalinist
version of Waters' own background as an underground filmmaker and
lends a witty new dimension to the term ``cult director.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Cecil B. DeMented,'' Cecil and his band of revolutionaries
kidnap a spoiled Hollywood star (Melanie Griffith) at the Baltimore
world premiere of her newest movie and force her to star in their
own guerrilla production, directed in a style Cecil calls
``ultimate reality.'' Among other inspirations, the movie plays on
Hearst's background as the victim of a political kidnapping who
during her ordeal appeared to adopt her captors' cause.
</P>
<P>
   As the movie bounces along, the pseudonymous Cecil B. DeMented
(Stephen Dorff), who is only too eager to die for his cause,
suggests a comic hybrid of Charles Manson and Abbie Hoffman made up
to resemble Andy Warhol. Glaring maniacally under a shock of blond
hair, Dorff, who has specialized in sullen rebels with and without
causes, plays his role more or less straight.
</P>
<P>
   The role of Honey Whitlock, the glamorous Hollywood star who is
whisked off the stage in the middle of a premiere benefit for the
Maryland Heart Fund, gives Griffith her most engaging screen
performance since ``Working Girl.'' With her baby-doll voice and
pinup figure, wafting a welcoming, compliant sensuality, Griffith
has always projected a mixture of coy dim-wittedness and street
smarts, which turns out to be just right for the role of Honey.
</P>
<P>
   A vain, mean-tempered diva before her kidnapping, Honey is given
a sawed-off haircut and satanic makeup that transform her into
something vaguely resembling the bride of Frankenstein, but she
quickly adjusts to her new life. As the kidnappers' notoriety
spreads and she finds herself a cult movie heroine, she takes to
the role of revolutionary, risking her safety to jump off roofs as
Cecil and his revolutionary band, the Sprocket Holes,
simultaneously stage and film surprise attacks at local movie
theaters. In one of the movie's wittiest sequences, they infiltrate
the set of a sequel to ``Forrest Gump'' starring Kevin Nealon and
run afoul of the Teamsters, who join the local police in chasing
them down.
</P>
<P>
   The Sprocket Holes, a typical John Waters melange of freaks and
outcasts, include Cherish (Alicia Witt), a former porn star; Raven
(Maggie Gyllenhaal), a Satan-worshiping makeup artist; and Lyle
(Adrian Grenier), a pill-popping Method actor. Just about everyone
is sexually confused in one way or another. But since Cecil has
decreed no sex until the movie is completed, they all live in a
state of desperate frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cecil B. DeMented'' is consistently amusing and smart in its
choice of targets, but it lacks the manic edge of some of Waters'
earlier movies. Its gross-out moments aren't as joltingly funny.
And Griffith, for all her charm, doesn't project the ravenous comic
ferocity that Kathleen Turner brought to her homicidal title role
in ``Serial Mom.'' By the end of the movie, it still isn't entirely
clear if she has gotten the joke.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif _ Ross Perot's Reform Party, eight years after
bursting onto the national political stage, split Thursday into two
separate conventions that would each produce a nominee claiming to
be the party's true presidential candidate and the rightful
recipient of $12.6 million in federal campaign money.
</P>
<P>
   As Perot kept his distance, remaining in Dallas and showing no
sign of trying to heal his party from behind the scenes, the
crucial issue before the 600 delegates at the dueling conventions
was not just whom to nominate but how to save the party from
self-destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The squabbling that erupted here was unlikely to end with the
nominations. With so much money at stake, many people here say the
fight seems certain to end up in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate cause of the noisy and deep divide was Pat
Buchanan, a one-time Republican and hard-right political
commentator. Allies of Perot could only stand by as Buchanan went
on to take over many of the party's state organizations, in part
because most of them fell into disarray after Perot dropped out of
politics two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, an accomplished political strategist, was able to
stuff the dispirited local ranks with followers from his days on
the edges of the Republican Party. He rode into Long Beach with the
most delegates, confidently declaring Thursday morning that he
would be the party's nominee because ``we've won it fair and
square.'' The old Reform guard, he said, should ``give it up'' and
make way for the new guard.
</P>
<P>
   The old guard, supporters of Perot who were present at the
founding back in 1992, were having none of that and split, taking
their placards, chants and mumbles to another convention hall down
the street. Their preferred nominee, John Hagelin, a physicist who
previously ran twice for president on the Natural Law Party ticket,
asserted that he, not Buchanan, would represent the true Reform
Party in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted the strength of his run would at least equal that
of Perot in 1992, when the billionaire Texan made political history
by spending millions from his personal fortune to capture almost 20
per cent of the popular vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to reach back to the 20 million people who voted
for Ross Perot in 1992,'' he said, ``the people who are not looking
for a right-wing extremist.''
</P>
<P>
   That was political music to the ears of old Perot allies. They
do not necessarily all pine for Perot's return, but many describe
themselves as true believers in the reform agenda that he first
began advocating a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel better about things now that we've split off from the
Buchananites,'' said Leroy Mueller, a retired machinery parts
distributor from Rhinelander, Wis. ``But I worry still about out
the party's future. I was with Ross from the start, from back in
1992, and he never meant for the party to have a right-wing slant.
Reform was his thing _ reform the government _ not abortion and gun
control and prayers and the like. Can we ever get it back to the
way Ross had it, to the time when we were all excited and ginned up
and had our eyes on a new horizon? I just don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buchananites had their eyes on their own horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' said Paul Rezel, an orthopedist from Fort Wayne, Ind.,
``reform is fine but I came to the Reform Party because Pat
Buchanan was the Reform Party. The Republicans weren't doing it for
me, and neither were the Democrats. What Pat says is what I care
about.''

A REPENTANT CLINTON REVIEWS HIS PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BARRINGTON, Ill. _ Four thousand church members bowed
their heads Thursday and prayed for a sinner in their midst _ a man
who, like them, was struggling in his life with right and wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guide his path,'' intoned Bill Hybels, senior pastor at the
Willow Creek Community Church. ``Fill him with your wisdom and
cause him to keep growing personally and maturing.''
</P>
<P>
   The man before them was President Clinton, and he had just
described how his life had spun out of control after an adulterous
affair, how his job sometimes overwhelmed him, how the past seven
and a half years had had low moments and wonderful ones, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not careful when you have this kind of job, it can
overtake you,'' the president said wistfully, sitting on a swivel
chair on a stage in an enormous church. ``You can believe it's even
more important than it is. You can let it take up even more time
than it should. It can crowd out all that other stuff that keeps
you centered and growing and whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has reflected on impeachment before, and he has
discussed his religious beliefs throughout his presidency. But his
reflections Thursday amounted to a live public interview on the
personal travails of his presidency, conducted by a pastor who has
counseled him regularly since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm now in the second year of a process of trying to totally
rebuild my life from a terrible mistake I made,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody can say, `Hey, the state of my spiritual
life is great, it's constant and it's never going to change.' I
think I've learned enough now to know that's not true, that it's
always a work in progress and you just hope you're getting better
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not getting better,'' he said, ``chances are you're
getting worse.''
</P>
<P>
   His appearance at the church came at a delicate time, just days
before the Democrats are to open their political convention in Los
Angeles, and shift the spotlight from Clinton to Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Gore have also expressed their annoyance that Clinton
and Hillary Clinton plan such a prominent role at the convention
and in high-profile events leading up it. The president's
headline-grabbing remarks here on the eve of the convention _ on a
topic Gore would prefer to forget _ will likely add to their
annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Gore campaign continued to express frustration over
the repeated dredging up of Clinton's affair _ already back in the
news because Gore's vice presidential pick, Sen. Joseph Lieberman
of Connecticut, had criticized Clinton so openly about it.
</P>
<P>
   One Gore adviser observed drily, ``We're trying to keep the
focus on the future and on the issues that matter to the voters,
and this isn't in that category.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Gore aide said the campaign hoped that the selection of
Lieberman, the first Democratic senator to chastise the president
openly, would underscore that the ticket was separate from the
president and also that the president's comments clearly reflected
that his affair had been his own problem.
</P>
<P>
   But White House aides said there had been no political
calculation in sandwiching the president's confessional between an
educational event in Chicago and an evening in New York City for
Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate bid.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had promised Hybels _ who described himself as the
president's ``behind the scenes spiritual adviser'' _ that before
he left office he would appear at one of Hybels' leadership
summits, which draw pastors and other church leaders from around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appearance at the religious retreat had been
contentious. Some conservative pastors had opposed the visit and
had insisted that Hybels not go easy in his questioning of Clinton
in his missteps. And Hybels, in a sympathetic way, obliged.
</P>
<P>
   He asked about the president's dog, Buddy. He asked about the
issues the president cares most about and how he wants to be
remembered. But he asked as well about Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's face appeared on two large screens in the church
auditorium, the kind of close up that the television networks use
to show the awkward, perspiration-inducing moments of an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have given evidence that I need to be in church,''
Clinton said at one point, referring to the fallout from what he
called ``my personal crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he continues to rebuild his life after his affair
with a White House intern, and he said he continues to grapple with
the state of his character and integrity.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he had also found a silver lining in the whole
uncomfortable public airing of his missteps. ``In a funny way, when
you realize there's nothing left to hide, it sort of frees you up
to do what you ought to do anyway,'' the president said of his
ongoing counseling sessions.
</P>
<P>
   He said the embarrassing episode had humbled him, and he
encouraged other politicians to seek spiritual advisers to guide
them throughout the pressures of public office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that even presidents must realize that they were
flawed, both as politicians and policymakers. ``I am quite sure
that some of my positions are wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment episode aside, Clinton said the lowest moment of
his presidency came when he learned that 18 U.S. soldiers had been
killed in a military action he had ordered in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt the sickest I have been since I have been here,'' he
said, adding that all military actions were a strain on him. ``You
know the chances are some of them are going to die.'' And even if
U.S. soldiers do not die, they are likely to kill someone else, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton rattled off far more positive recollections from his
presidency _ legislation that had passed, foreign-policy successes,
standing with Nelson Mandela in the prison cell where he had spent
so much of his life. And Clinton said he would miss the ups _ and
even the downs _ of being president.
</P>
<P>
   More than riding on Air Force One or hearing ``Hail to the
Chief'' when he walks into a room, or waking up every morning in
the White House, Clinton said, ``what I will miss more than
anything else is the job.''

 &HT;    Dell's sales growth fails to meet expectations
 &HT;    By John Pletz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Dell Computer Corp. struggled through a tough
second quarter, beating Wall Street's earnings estimates but
posting lower sales growth than it had expected.
</P>
<P>
   The company said Thursday it's still working to shake off a Y2K
hangover in government sales in the United States and among
corporations in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Dell earned 22 cents per diluted share, 1 cent more than the
consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson
Financial. A year ago, Dell earned 19 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Net income was $603 million, up 19 percent from $507 million
during the year-ago quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But the number many were focusing on was revenue. Dell's sales
grew 25 percent to $7.7 billion, but came in below the 30 percent
growth Dell told analysts to expect at the beginning of the year.
In the second quarter last year, the company's revenue was $6.1
billion, an increase of 42 percent over the prior year.
</P>
<P>
   Shipments fell even faster. Dell said its shipments increased 22
percent during the quarter, compared to an estimated 55 percent in
the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts had lowered their revenue estimates in recent
weeks after two leading market-research firms said shipment growth
slowed more than previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's stock, which has dropped 26 percent in the last three
weeks, closed down 6 cents at $41.75 per share Thursday in regular
trading before results were announced. It fell to $40.19 in
after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   The stock had already felt most of the impact, analyst Kurt King
of Banc of America Securities wrote Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Vice Chairman Kevin Rollins assured analysts during a conference
call that it can still meet 30 percent growth for the full fiscal
year, which ends in late January. But some are taking a
wait-and-see attitude, citing a maturing personal-computer market.
</P>
<P>
   Dell underestimated how long it would take for spending in some
sectors to recover from Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   ``Revenue was $200 million lower than expected, coming primarily
from a slowdown in Europe and the (U.S.) government sector slow
coming out of Y2K,'' he said. ``All the fundamentals of the
business are very, very healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell is working to overhaul its European operations, which have
been struggling for more than a year. Rollins said that even though
revenue in Europe grew just 10 percent during the quarter,
profitability rose 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going after more profitable business _ notebooks,
servers and storage _ where we can make some money rather than just
give it away,'' Rollins added.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue from notebook computers, which carry higher margins and
are replaced more frequently, increased 60 percent during the
quarter, twice the rate of its desktop business.
</P>
<P>
   The company continues to add to its service and peripherals
business. ``Beyond-the-box'' revenue grew to $1.3 billion, about
half of which came from services, up 35 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Online sales increased to $50 million per day, or half its
total. That's up from $40 million per day in the first quarter and
$30 million, or 40 percent of total sales, a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Home and small business sales , Dell's fastest-growing segment,
were up 46 percent, compared to 67 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's doing extremely well,'' Rollins said, ``growing at triple
the rate of the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   He said already there are signs that government contracts are
returning to normal, and corporate buying in the United Kingdom and
Germany is recovering.
</P>
<P>
   If government buying doesn't rebound in the third and fourth
quarters _ ``and it might not,'' Rollins said _ Dell can make up
the difference elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bodes well for the future because the floodgates will open
at some point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is confident Dell can deliver on continued growth
in a market some say is slowing. ``We expect to see good seasonal
upturn in every region,'' said Roger Kay, an analyst with research
firm IDC.
</P>
<P>
   But for Dell to hit 30 percent growth in an industry that's
expected to grow just 20 percent this year ``will be a challenge,''
Kay said.
</P>
<P>
   The picture isn't likely to get better after that, Ashok Kumar,
an analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, who predicts desktop PC
growth will drop by more than half, from 18 percent this year to 8
percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Kumar has been critical of Dell recently and downgraded the
stock from strong buy to buy, also doubting the company could
sustain 30 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important issue is back in December and January, when they
lowered revenue guidance to 30 percent, the consensus was they'd be
able to beat that easily,'' he said. ``Now they're breaking a sweat
just to meet that.''

 BUSH IS JOINED BY McCAIN ON WEST COAST TOUR

<TEXT>
<P>
   LODI, Calif. _ With an eye toward independent-minded voters here
and elsewhere on the West Coast, Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John
McCain on Thursday joined forces on the campaign trail for the
first time in the 2000 presidential race, burying their once-bitter
rivalry under a resolve to put a Republican in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had wanted passionately to be that man, and his
appearance beside Bush in California, Oregon and Washington this
week could be seen as the latest chapter in a tale of political
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Having formally endorsed Bush and having praised him from the
stage of the Republican National Convention, McCain was now hitting
the stump with the man who beat him for the Republican presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   He also did a jig around the questions reporters asked about the
sharp differences between him and Bush on issues like tax cuts and
campaign finance reform. McCain redirected their attention toward
what he said was his overarching support for, and belief in, Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``We share the core principles of the Republican Party,'' McCain
said at a news conference the men held around midday in Salinas,
which sits in the middle of a largely Democratic county with an
unusually high percentage of the so-called swing voters who had
found McCain attractive during the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primaries are tough,'' he said. ``But never at any time did I
intimate that I would do anything but support the nominee of the
party.''
</P>
<P>
   If that made him sound like he was taking a needed dose of
medicine _ a metaphor McCain jokingly used when endorsing Bush in
May _ his comments at an event in Salinas preceding the news
conference were a bit more resounding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud to be part of this crusade,'' McCain said then.
``I'm proud of him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor said at the news conference that he and the
Arizona senator had a long, lasting bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primaries are family squabbles,'' Bush said. ``We were friends
before and we're friends now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers said McCain's presence had grown from a previous
offer to do whatever the Bush campaign thought best for their
effort. McCain proved especially popular with the swing voters
prevalent in this region of the country, so Bush's advisers said
that he could be particularly helpful here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think he has a lot of appeal to California's
independent-minded voters,'' said Karen P. Hughes, the campaign's
director of communications. Gerry Parsky, chairman of the
campaign's California effort, noted that in the state primary in
March, McCain attracted about 725,000 independent or Democratic
voters, while Bush drew only 500,000.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The joint appearances gave the campaign of Vice President Al
Gore an opportunity to turn the tables on the Bush campaign, which
had spent the past few days noting policy disagreements between
Gore and his running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is a strong leader, and it says a great deal about him
that he picked someone who does not agree with him on every
issue,'' said Douglas Hattaway, a Gore campaign spokesman. ``Bush
apparently lacked that leadership in bypassing John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Hattaway was referring to Bush's selection of Dick Cheney, the
former defense secretary, instead of McCain, as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ''You won't hear Bush and McCain talking about issues very
much,'' Hattaway added. ``If they actually talked about issues, it
would turn into a debate.''
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta on Thursday, Gore and Lieberman were supposed to use
an appearance with four Southern governors to hail the Clinton
administration's record in cutting welfare rolls and to promote
``the next critical phase of welfare reform,'' according to a
release issued by the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Gore and Lieberman made more generic speeches and
barely mentioned welfare. Aides said they were not sure why Gore
veered from his planned remarks.
</P>
<P>
   In the release, Gore vowed to help long-term welfare recipients
find work by extending existing welfare-to-work grants to state,
local and faith-based organizations. He also said he would ``fight
to promote responsible fatherhood'' by creating programs that help
low-income ``dead-broke dads'' find work so they can support their
children. He proposed denying credit cards to parents who owe child
support.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's appearances with McCain in Salinas preceded a train trip
that they took north toward Sacramento. The men planned to cap
three days of campaigning on the West Coast with a visit to
McCain's cabin in Sedona, Ariz., on Saturday. Bush and his wife,
Laura, were to be overnight guests of McCain and his wife, Cindy.
</P>
<P>
   During the train trip, McCain and Bush chatted with reporters
for about 25 minutes, and McCain had plenty of praise for Bush,
especially for his efforts to portray the Republican Party as a
home for a broad spectrum of voters.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also derided the Gore campaign's efforts to remind voters
that he had once attacked Bush's tax-cut plan as excessive and that
he advocated much stricter regulation of campaign contributions
than Bush favors. ``It's foolishness,'' McCain said, ``and we all
know it. And people will take it for that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' said Bush, ``we're glad they're talking about us.
Isn't that right, Senator?''

SHAW MIGHT LEAVE LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ Brian Shaw, a key role player in the
Lakers' championship run last season, might bolt the team for a
better offer, his agent said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers want to re-sign the free-agent guard but are hoping
he'll return for a slight raise over the $1 million he made last
season. Agent Jerome Stanley believes the Lakers should pay his
client the $2.25 million salary-cap exception.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Lakers are unwilling. They hope to use the $2.25
million slot to land a much-needed power forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's looking less likely than it had in the past'' that Shaw
will come back to the Lakers, Stanley said.
</P>
<P>
   Because Shaw earned an extra $1 million last season _ courtesy
of a deal that sent him from Portland to the Houston Rockets, who
then waived him _ Stanley is considering anything less than $2
million ``a pay cut.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers don't see it that way but haven't given up efforts to
keep him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian Shaw was an incredibly valuable piece to our team last
year. ... We're very optimistic that he'll be a Laker next year,''
general manager Mitch Kupchak said. ``We'll do everything we can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: The Lakers announced they have signed second-round draft
pick Cory Hightower. He'll earn the rookie minimum, about
$317,000. &QL;

 &HT;    Democrats launch bid to win Georgia
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Vice President Al Gore introduced running mate Joe
Lieberman to a sympathetic crowd in Atlanta on Thursday and pledged
the two would fight to continue the nation's record economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
   At a boisterous rally in Centennial Olympic Park, Gore warned
voters not to listen to Republican claims that the country was
worse off now than when President Clinton was elected in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you remember what it was like eight years ago?'' Gore
exhorted the crowd. ``We were broke _ high unemployment. We had the
worst recession since the 1930s. We saw crime rising, families
breaking up at a higher rate. Everything was worse.''
</P>
<P>
   In focusing on the economy, Gore signaled that the Democrats
will attempt to copy the formula Clinton used in 1992 to capture
some of the South and defeat President George Bush, who Clinton
claimed was out of touch with the economic realities facing average
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman also indicated they will make a strong bid to
win Georgia, which Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole won by
a whisker in 1996. The Democratic team appeared on stage with
Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes and Govs. Jim Hunt of North Carolina, Don
Siegelman of Alabama and Paul Patton of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief response to a reporter's question after the rally,
Gore said he believed ``absolutely'' that he and Lieberman could
win in the South, noting that he won seven primaries in his first
presidential bid in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from the South,'' Gore said. ``I know that people here in
the South understand why it's so important to keep the prosperity
and progress going. It would be hard on families and communities to
go back to the old ways of the old guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the rally, Gore and Lieberman met privately in Atlanta
with about 40 civic and religious leaders to map strategy for
boosting Democratic turnout. They also held a meeting to discuss a
Democratic National Committee fund-raiser that Gore will host in
Atlanta on Sept. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Polls taken more than six weeks ago, before the Republican
National Convention in Philadelphia and before Gore picked
Lieberman to be his running mate, showed the vice president
trailing Texas Gov. George W. Bush by six points in Georgia,
according to state Democratic Chairman David Worley.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore strategists and state Democrats have significantly
upgraded Gore's chances in Georgia, in part because of the death of
Republican Sen. Paul Coverdell.
</P>
<P>
   Having Sen. Zell Miller, appointed by Barnes to replace
Coverdell, on the ballot changes the dynamics of the Georgia
presidential race, state party officials believe, because the
popular former governor may draw more Democratic voters to the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a tremendous opportunity for us here, not
only on the senatorial level but on the presidential level as
well,'' said state Attorney General Thurbert Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, known as a fierce partisan, took a moment at the beginning
of his speech to express his sympathy to Coverdell's family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is a partisan gathering,'' Gore said. ``But I know
that you also join with us in the sentiment that Paul Coverdell was
a dedicated public servant who brought to politics something that
we really need today, and that is courtesy and civility.''
</P>
<P>
   In brief opening remarks, Barnes introduced Lieberman as a
Northern version of Georgia's retired Sen. Sam Nunn, who hewed to
the same centrist Democratic orthodoxy as Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Gore later reminded the crowd, which included a number of
African-Americans, that Lieberman volunteered during the civil
rights movement to register black voters in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman likened his selection as the first Jewish vice
presidential candidate to the vision of inclusiveness that the late
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. championed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, my friends in this great city of Atlanta, Georgia, I am
so proud to stand before you as the first Jewish American lucky
enough to be a vice presidential candidate,'' Lieberman said.

 LONG BEACH, Calif.: care about. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a few nervous moments Thursday, it appeared that the feuding
factions would clash. Following Hagelin's first news conference at
a nearby hotel, his supporters marched into the Convention Center
chanting, ``Reform, reform, reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the Buchanan delegates were gathering, but as the
Hagelin group approached, Gerald M. Moan, the Buchanan faction's
acting chairman, addressed the Buchanan delegates in a loud voice,
saying, ``I'm asking you to be nonconfrontational. We are
professional and hospitable.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, the Buchanan supporters allowed the Hagelin group to
proceed to the front of the delegate meeting room, where they were
turned away because of questions over their registration. After
singing, ``We Shall Overcome,'' they reversed their course and
walked toward the Performing Arts Center.
</P>
<P>
   While ideology is the source of much of the discord within the
party, the financial question looms large, too. Initially, the
Federal Elections Commission will have to decide which faction gets
the money. But no one here expects that decision to stand without a
court challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Hagelin said Thursday they had filed an
administrative complaint with the Federal Election Commission,
contending that the Buchanan forces were able to amass a majority
of delegates because he broke party rules to get them elected and
also broke party rules over how primaries were conducted.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the commission, Sharon Snyder, said the
complaint arrived Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard A. Goldman, a lawyer representing Hagelin's campaign,
said the complaint contended that Buchanan submitted names of
ineligible voters to be sent primary ballots, specifically that the
names were contributors to Buchanan's former presidential campaigns
when he was running as a Republican. Goldman also said the
complaint contended that Buchanan allies illegally took control of
a pre-convention party meeting here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman said the complaint argued that for both reasons,
Buchanan should be disqualified from the primary and barred from
receiving the federal money.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said his campaign officials had consistently argued
that they rigidly followed rules in submitting names.
</P>
<P>
   They also asserted that they did nothing improper at the Tuesday
meeting. Chiding his opponents for mounting a strategy he claimed
was based on failure, he said, ``They came out here with this
little prank in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the complaint represents the opening move in what
could be a long administrative and legal process before the
commission releases the money to anyone. Both campaigns said that
federal money would play a huge role in getting the candidate and
his issues before voters, even though the amount pales in
comparison with the $67.5 million that Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
and Vice President Al Gore will each receive as the nominee of a
major party.
</P>
<P>
   By commission rules, once the complaint is received, the panel
members have five days to notify the defendant, who then has 15
days to respond. Then, after a review of the charges and defense,
the panel can either dismiss the complaint or find reason to
believe violations of election law occurred, triggering an
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   If commission lawyers then believe violations have taken place,
the defendants have 15 days to argue why they should not be cited
for violations. If their arguments fail, the two parties are
required to begin settlement talks. And if those efforts, the
matter goes before the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But even without an investigation, Snyder said, if two requests
for the money are submitted _ and both sides here say they will
seek it _ the commission can take as long as 15 days to consider
the requests, after which it can deny one or both.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, she said, the matter would most likely end up in
court.
</P>
<P>
   Once the dual conventions began, they proceeded on calm and
similar tracks. The early hours of each were spent on considering
challenges to delegates. About two-thirds of the original 596 were
attending the pro-Buchanan session while the other third were at
the pro-Hagelin meeting.

<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush can talk about education, he can talk about
compassionate conservatism and he can even expound on crime and
punishment. But he better stay away from the subject of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   He'll get pounded on that, even if his opponent is from a state
that's strictly minor league when it comes to the national pastime.
</P>
<P>
   As the former Rangers' boss marches toward the White House,
Texas teams are taking a pounding and find themselves in a
desperate battle with Pennsylvania to stay out of last place. There
are seven states that have two major-league teams and, as of this
morning, Texas was 11/2-games behind Pennsylvania for the worst
record among the seven.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers and the Houston Astros were a combined 96- 130,
while the Pittsburgh Pirates and Philadelphia Phillies were 97-128.
New York, as usual, was leading at 126-95, followed by Illinois
(120-105), Ohio (115-109), Missouri (113-113) and Florida
(107-119).
</P>
<P>
   Anybody for a game of football?
</P>
<P>
   California has five teams, so we'll leave them out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Rangers moved to Texas, they and the Astros have never
once combined to have the best record among two-team states. The
closest they came was in 1981, when they went 118-97. Ohio also won
118 games that year, but the Indians and Reds combined to lose only
93 games, giving them the coveted Rand McNally Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The past two years have been especially bitter for the Texas
boys. The sons of Tom Hicks and Drayton McLane combined to win a
record 192 games last year and 190 the year before. But both times
they were blown out of the water by the Big Apple as New York won
202 games in 1998 and 195 last year.
</P>
<P>
   It's heartbreaking, but what can you do when the Yankees can
throw $2 million away on a 36-year-old pinch hitter who can hardly
walk? However, it's not as if George Steinbrenner and his Queens
cohorts have dominated the Rand McNally Cup in the 28 years since
the Rangers moved to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   New York has won the past three, giving it eight overall. But
that has merely pulled them into a tie with Pennsylvania for the
overall lead with eight. Pennsylvania won a record five in a row in
1976-80 during the glory years of Willie Stargell and Mike Schmidt,
again in 1983 and two more in 1990-91, when Barry Bonds was in
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio is right behind with seven Rand McNally Cups. In addition
to 1981, Ohio won in 1973-75 when the Big Red Machine was on a
rampage in Cincinnati and again in 1994-96 during the heyday of
Albert Belle and the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri and Illinois have each won two Rand McNally Cups, and
Ohio and Pennsylvania shared the trophy in 1992. Florida, joining
the competition in 1998, has yet to be a factor. But at least
Florida has an excuse. The Rangers and the Astros have none.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, Texas is threatening to have the worst record
in the Rand McNally competition for the first time since 1975. The
Rangers and the Astros were at the bottom in 1972-73 and 1975, but
not since then. Florida has had a stranglehold on that dubious
honor the past two years, but the Marlins' surge this year gives
Florida a chance to avoid the basement.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio and Illinois have each finished last seven times. Thank
goodness for the Indians, those lovable Cubs and Jerry Reinsdorf.
Pennyslvania is next with five, followed by Texas. New York,
Missouri and Florida have each had the worst record twice.
</P>
<P>
   But now Texas is headed for the basement, which isn't going to
look good for the Rangers' former owner who grew up as a big Astros
fan.

   Informix Corp., which recently created an office of the
president in Massachusetts, Thursday announced it will close its
Menlo Park, Calif. headquarters and relocate to Westborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The move will also lead to the dismissal of 430 employees _ 10
percent of its work force _ mostly in Northern California. The
company will take a $75 million to $90 million one-time
reorganization charge to cover the cost of severance pay and the
elimination of functions and facilities that have become redundant.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new corporate structure, Informix will merge five
businesses and consolidate them into two groups to streamline
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to hire about 100 people in Westborough over
the next 12 months. The new headquarters will include the office of
the president, corporate marketing, human resources, legal and
corporate finance departments.
</P>
<P>
   The Informix restructuring stems from the the ascension of Peter
Gyenes four weeks ago to the presidency of the 20-year-old database
software tools and e-commerce software developer. He was president
of Ardent Software, the Westborough company that Informix acquired
in March for $1.1 billion. Gyenes replaced Jean-Yves Dexmier who
was president of Informix for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from Menlo Park Thursday, the 54-year-old Gyenes said
the employees were ``totally surprised but recognized the need for
this change.'' He said about two dozen Informix people will be
asked to relocate to Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   In consolidating operations, Gyenes said Westborough, which has
about 200 Ardent employees will gain an additional 40 people who
move over from an Informix sales and sales support office in
Burlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   When the relocation is completed later this year, Informix will
employ as many as 340 people in a single facility in Westborough.
Currently, Informix headquarters employees are spread out in seven
buildings in Menlo Park, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``This change is motivated to get people to work together in
fewer locations and to improve our overall productivity,'' said
Gyenes, adding that Informix will also consolidate some of its back
office information service operations in Lenexa, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Informix stock, which has plunged 59 percent this year, Thursday
closed at $4.84375, up nearly 16 cents.

   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rangers hitting coach Rudy Jaramillo took one
look at Ricky Ledee and saw Ruben Sierra: a big leg kick and a big
swing.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to get his newest student turned around, Jaramillo told
Ledee to dump the leg kick and try the simple slide step that most
hitters use. It's the same slide step Gabe Kapler had until
Jaramillo suggested that Kapler try a Sierra-like leg kick.
</P>
<P>
   Confused? Don't be.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to get your body in motion somehow; the
fundamentals are still the same,'' Jaramillo said. ``The main thing
is to find something that works for each individual hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Leg kick or not, the Rangers' hard-working hitting guru takes
the same basic approach with each hitter. It all starts with hours
in the hitting cage working on proper mechanics. As long as hitters
learn to wait on pitches until the last possible instant, then
react quickly, everything else will fall into place, Jaramillo
said.
</P>
<P>
   That approach is working tremendously for Kapler, who has
emerged from his half-season slump to take a 23-game hitting streak
into tonight's game with the Boston Red Sox. A hit tonight and
Kapler would tie the club record of hitting in 24 consecutive
games, set by Mickey Rivers in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give a lot of credit to Rudy,'' Kapler said. ``There's still
a long ways to go, but the confidence Rudy showed in me was
something. When people around you feel confident in you, it
instills a lot of confidence in yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapler and Jaramillo have been working together since spring
training. But somehow everything seemed to click after the All-Star
break.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a complete new swing over anything I've ever done,''
Kapler said. ``I started believing it more after the All-Star break
and more recently. When you have success, that's when you really
start to believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Jaramillo wants to hear: a hitter who trusts
himself. Jaramillo said the worst thing a hitter can do while at
bat is worry too much about his mechanics _ something he saw
immediately with Ledee when he was acquired last month and with
Kapler in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Kapler is discovering the confidence essential for any
hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, when he goes to the plate, his mind is clear,'' Jaramillo
said. ``He's thinking how to compete and how to beat the pitcher.
He lets everything else take care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   In 27 games since the All-Star break, Kapler is hitting .346
with six home runs and 20 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about mechanics so much at the beginning of the
season, and now I'm trusting the mechanics,'' Kapler said. ``I'm
still super-hesitant to say I have it down because that's when it
comes back to bite you. But when you start to figure it out, then
the down times, when things aren't going so smoothly, they're not
huge dives. They're little bumps in the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapler's surge has been the brightest spot for the Rangers as
they've stumbled to a 10-16 record since the All-Star break. It has
also been an immensely important one.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers figured out a long time ago they aren't going to the
playoffs this year. As shortstop Royce Clayton said in a moment of
supreme frustration after Wednesday's loss, ``This season ... stunk
from Day One, and it stinks now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers know that success from here on out will not be
measured by victories or losses but by how much improvement their
young players show. That's true not only for Kapler, Ledee and
third baseman Mike Lamb but also for starting pitchers Matt
Perisho, Doug Davis and Ryan Glynn.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the approach I'm taking the last two months,''
Jaramillo said. ``I have a plan: work as hard as I can to get these
\Rhitters\S better. The more comfortable these guys get, the more
confident they're going to be going into next year.''
</P>
<P>
   It also helps the Rangers plan. If Ledee comes on and Kapler
continues his surge, the Rangers are going to feel much better
about their outfield and be able to concentrate more on getting
their pitching staff straightened out.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler's hitting streak still brings one bittersweet thought to
mind. As well as he is playing, the Rangers wish Ruben Mateo was
right there with him, coming on just as quickly. But Mateo broke
his leg June 2 and is lost for the season. Each game that passes
means one more lost to Mateo's development time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably most disappointing of anything other than our
record,'' manager Johnny Oates said. ``He hasn't been here to play.
I had visions of him and Kapler, side by side, doing the same
things Kapler is doing for me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mateo's not there. The Rangers have to settle for Lamb
flirting with .300 and Kapler flirting with a team record. They
hope Ledee can join them. They hope the young starting pitchers
will also come around.
</P>
<P>
   When you've been in last place for more than two months, it's
the best you can hope for.

<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ As the new Cowboys head coach, Dave Campo
is already far ahead of Chan Gailey in one important area: Michael
Irvin damage control.
</P>
<P>
   A week into his first training camp here in 1998, Gailey
suddenly found himself overwhelmed with the media frenzy of
``Scissor-gate.'' It wasn't Gailey who sliced Everett McIver's neck
in a dorm room fight, but in a no-win situation for Gailey, his
reputation was cut up by an angry media convinced he was
stonewalling on the facts.
</P>
<P>
   It was Michael holding the scissors, but strangely, he didn't
catch as much media abuse as Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   This week, when yet another Irvin episode surfaced in Plano, all
Campo had to do was shrug and answer, ``no comment.'' There were no
follow-up questions. Michael is Campo's friend but no longer his
football responsibility. What Irvin now does off the field doesn't
impact the Cowboys on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of `former Cowboy' why don't you media guys start
saying `Fox TV's Michael Irvin,' '' one club official joked
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly people associated with the team feel deeply for
Michael. But on days like Wednesday, after word reached training
camp of Irvin's arrest, you could sense a feeling of relief. The
crazy man does damage only to himself this time, and not to the
team concept and family concept that Campo is trying to restore to
the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   There will be an ongoing argument that Irvin's Valley Ranch
roots are so deep that his latest craziness brings yet another
round of image erosion to the organization. To each his own on that
one. But after all this water under all those Irvin bridges, it
takes a perception-stretch to link Michael's ongoing act with
anybody other than Michael himself.
</P>
<P>
   The timing was excellent for Campo. Irvin was leaving Valley
Ranch as Campo was being promoted. Trouble walked out the door, and
because Michael's contract was up, he didn't take any salary-cap
money with him, either. Perfect. Just perfect. Cold-hearted, too,
which means Campo would never say such a thing. But that's life in
the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Gailey was never heard uttering it, but don't you
just know that two years ago, right here at Midwestern State
University, he was privately wishing Irvin was on a slow football
boat to Cincinnati, San Diego or any other NFL outpost.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Campo is lucky this way. He's been on the job since
January and has yet to face one public-relations ``crisis.''
Considering the firestorm of police-blotter activity that has
engulfed the NFL, the Cowboys come across as squeaky clean, which,
yes, has something to do with Irvin not being around anymore. And
also something to do with the ongoing effort of Jerry Jones to bag
up the trash, put it on the curb, and have it hauled away.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, winning remains a top priority, and by Cowboys
standards, there hasn't been nearly enough of that. Eventually,
that's the way Campo will be judged. He's no different than any
other guy trying to survive as an NFL head coach. Football
expertise, people skills, salary-cap room and, above all else,
talented players, are the obvious necessities for success.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, someway, Jones continues to stay a jump ahead of
49ers-like salary-cap destruction. It's a juggling act, but so far
it's working.
</P>
<P>
   There is cap room available. Plus, the Cowboys have never had a
head coach who can equal Campo in the area of people skills. He's
as hands-on as Jimmy Johnson was when it comes to dealing with the
players, but seemingly with more sincere motives. It would be nice
to think Campo's strength in this area is related to the lack of a
PR crisis thus far, and yes, there probably is a connection. Then
again, so is Irvin's retirement.
</P>
<P>
   We haven't seen Campo make a critical decision in a game, have
it backfire, and witness the tell-tale follow-up. How does he
react, and how do the players react? But if that football stuff is
all Campo ever has to worry about, then he's got a leg up in the
coaching game.
</P>
<P>
   This we do know: The players aren't going to blame themselves
for failure. This team is no different from other teams _ it will
turn on a head coach to protect personal butts.
</P>
<P>
   That brings us to the talent level Campo has inherited, which
like Gailey before him, is not up to elite standards. Then again,
elite standards in today's NFL moves like quicksand. You have to be
careful where you step. The ground is always changing. Otherwise,
the St. Louis Rams wouldn't be defending Super Bowl champs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only one team _ Washington _ is supposed to go 16-and-0 this
season,'' Campo said yesterday, smiling because he knew that quote
would make old pal Norv Turner stew. ``We do think, we are better
than maybe given credit for.''
</P>
<P>
   And in one off-the-field area, certainly better off than having
had to deal this week with another Michael Irvin crisis.

<P>
   DALLAS _ SMU coach Mike Cavan is expecting either his offensive
or defensive coordinator to stop being his best friend soon. And
it's all because of a freshman player who is turning heads.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Rushbrook has impressed Cavan in the first two days of
freshman practice this weekend. The 5-foot-10, 175-pound Rushbrook
is a multifaceted player who runs a 4.4-second time in the 40-yard
dash and was an All-District 1-5A selection at Andress High School
in El Paso last season. But with Rushbrook's ability at free safety
and wide receiver, Cavan has to decide where to put him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he's going to be a good player because my offensive
coordinator \RLarry Kueck\S and defensive coordinator \REric
Schumann\S have been recruiting me the last few days,'' Cavan said.
``They're so nice to me right now, they want him bad. One of them
is not going to like me, but I have to make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Cavan said he will decide what position Rushbrook will play
soon.  &QL; 
Thank the maker?
</P>
<P>
   Cavan considers assistant coach Pat Henderson's desire to direct
SMU's young special-teams units ``a godsend.'' The Mustangs had
divided special-teams duties among coaches in the past; Henderson,
who was interim coach at Tulsa for four games in 1999, had also
worked with special teams during a three-year stint as an assistant
at Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really fell into my lap,'' Cavan said. ``He knows what
he's doing, and that will help a bunch.''  &QL; 
Simonton doesn't stray
</P>
<P>
   Jason Simonton, a linebacker who played his senior season in
1999, returns to SMU this season as a student assistant. That's
especially good news for his replacement, sophomore Vic Viloria,
who returns to the team after being academically ineligible in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done a great job of letting me know some of the things,''
Viloria said. ``He was such a great player. They'll be tough shoes
to fill, but I don't mind the pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Simonton, of Duncanville, led the Mustangs with 125 tackles last
season (second in the Western Athletic Conference) and finished
with 308 in his collegiate career.  &QL; 
Up next
</P>
<P>
   The Mustangs are scheduled to have their first full practice
today, going from 8 to 10 a.m. and from 2 to 4 p.m. SMU plans to
have two-a-days on Saturday and Monday and one practice on Sunday.
The team's first full-pads practice is Tuesday.

   DALLAS _ Senior defensive tackle Chase Schavrda is seeing
unusual sights around the SMU campus these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``In years past, we didn't have ribbons going down the hall and
`Beat Kansas' this and `Beat Kansas' that,'' Schavrda said at SMU's
annual football Media Day yesterday. ``We've never had any of that
stuff before.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a new optimism on the SMU campus as the 2000 season
approaches. And most of it has to do with the new ``house'' at the
corner of Mockingbird Lane and Airline Road.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald J. Ford Stadium, the Mustangs' new field, is nearing
completion after two years of construction and is scheduled to be
the site of the team's season opener against Kansas on Sept. 2. And
while there is added excitement about the team's new uniforms _
they feature a darker blue _ the stadium is the talk of campus.
</P>
<P>
   The $56 million stadium, which has a seating capacity of 32,000,
brings the Mustangs back on campus after a five-year stay at the
Cotton Bowl. Sports information director Chris Walker said 9,400
season tickets have been sold as of Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have something that these kids have never had,'' coach Mike
Cavan said. ``We haven't had a home here. This will be different
for our guys, and they're excited about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Junior quarterback Josh McCown remembers the adrenaline rush he
got two years ago when the Mustangs opened at Arkansas in front of
50,000 raucous fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see how much of a factor it can be,'' McCown said.
``It's definitely something you can look forward to. I think it's
going to help us out, with our fan support being there.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior offensive tackle Jeff Erxleben is also eager to play in
the new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be great,'' Erxleben said. ``I think everybody's
excited about it, and we're ready to get out there and start
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the excitement is mixed with a little apprehension
from some of the other veteran players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty-six million is a lot of money,'' junior defensive end
Kevin Aldridge said with a smile. ``I'm thinking about that. But
once we realize we're really what counts, not the stadium or
uniforms, I think things will be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Schavrda also feels a little tension, but it mainly centers
around the Mustangs' slow start in recent seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to come out and win,'' Schavrda said. ``If we come
out and do that, then we get things rolling. The pressure is on,
though, for sure.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Hillary Rodham Clinton tries to rebut the favorite
attack line of her opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, that she has never
held public office and has no record, she and her husband are
aggressively trying to reverse the reclusive image that she
projected after her failure on health care reform.
</P>
<P>
   Now Mrs. Clinton says that rather than retreating, as the White
House maintained, she was in fact working hard behind the scenes
proposing, drafting and lobbying for certain legislation, budget
appropriations and administration policies.
</P>
<P>
   Her record, she said, includes work on a major Clinton
administration child-care initiative, a huge federal-state
children's health insurance program, adoption and foster care bills
and foreign aid appropriations for small loans overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record's there, and what I did is sort of self-evident I
think, but it may come as new information to a lot of people,''
Mrs. Clinton said in a recent interview, acknowledging the
contradiction between the years of stressing more traditional first
lady duties and the role she claims now.
</P>
<P>
   The president joined in this week at a fund-raising dinner for
his wife, listing various issues and saying, ``She basically had an
unprecedented level of activity in her present position over the
last eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Mrs. Clinton acknowledged that she had learned
to take a more subtle approach in pushing her projects because of
the health care debacle in 1994, a humiliating defeat for the
administration that banished her from a public policy role next to
her husband. But when she was asked if, by speaking so openly, she
might alienate voters disturbed by her deep involvement in her
husband's administration, she retorted: ``Well, that's why you
never knew about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed later about whether her new descriptions of acting as,
in essence, a senior presidential adviser went beyond the job of
first lady, Mrs. Clinton laughed out loud and said: ``I'm not going
to have it any more. And the next first lady doesn't have to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's campaign dismissed Mrs. Clinton's efforts to establish a
legislative history. ``If she were running in Massachusetts, she'd
take credit for the Boston Tea Party,'' said Dan McLagan, the
congressman's chief spokesman. ``The bottom line is, she's never
lifted a finger for New York and is now trying to create an
imaginary record.''
</P>
<P>
   Agency heads, other administration officials, Democrats and some
Republicans on Capitol Hill generally confirm Mrs. Clinton's
assertions, but say that her role was kept quiet to avoid the kind
of vilification she had attracted over her central part in health
care policy. As Mrs. Clinton put it: ``People were saying, `We
don't care if you exercise influence as long as we don't know about
it.''' In any case, she said, ``I wasn't interested in getting
credit for these things.''
</P>
<P>
   No longer does she consider that tactic helpful to her political
ambitions. ``If somebody's going to say, `Well, she's never done
anything,''' Mrs. Clinton said, ``I'm going to say, `Well, you
know, I want to tell you what I did, and you can make your own
judgments.' I think that's a fair and accurate way to have somebody
evaluate what I could do in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton described her White House issues staff, which has
offices in both the West Wing and the old Executive Office
Building, ``as part of the domestic policy operation in the White
House.'' Although she also has a small staff in the East Wing to
handle first lady social responsibilities, Mrs. Clinton said that
``I realized very soon that, you know, if I had some first lady
staff over here, I wouldn't be able to get things done.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that she and her policy staff had the responsibility
for pushing legislation and programs that would benefit children,
women and health care _ issues that have concerned her, she said,
for the last 30 years. Several of Mrs. Clinton's staff had the
title of assistant to the president and were officially on the
staff of Bruce Reed, but generally reported to the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's Democratic supporters on Capitol Hill echo her
claims. ``Her office and her in particular were key allies of ours
and the progressives in the Senate who were trying to pursue an
agenda in the areas of children, education, health care and job
training,'' said Nick Littlefield, an aide to Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy of Massachusetts. He added that ``once we discovered that
Mrs. Clinton was running a public advocacy organization inside the
White House, it followed automatically that we would start talking
to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Although much of Mrs. Clinton's work at the White House was in
fact the traditional advocacy and speechmaking of modern first
ladies - and also of Eleanor Roosevelt, her role model _ Mrs.
Clinton said that on many issues she was directly involved in the
business of government.
</P>
<P>
   She said, for example, that the Clinton administration program
to guarantee free immunizations for poor and uninsured children,
passed in 1993, ``was basically drafted in my office under my
supervision.'' The program was a precursor to health care and its
policy was largely rejected by Congress, but the Clinton
administration did get $585 million for vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton also said that her staff had a large part in the
development of the Corporation for National Service, the Clinton
administration's domestic version of the peace corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hired Shirley Sagawa, who had been Ted Kennedy's person on
national service, and so basically it was my staff that was
involved in drafting that legislation,'' she said. Eli J. Segal,
the first chief executive of the Corporation for National Service
and the 1992 Clinton campaign chief of staff, called the first
lady's assertion ``100 percent correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Among her other accomplishments, Mrs. Clinton said she helped to
initiate and promote the Children's Health Insurance Program,
created by Congress in 1997 to provide $24 billion over five years
to states to insure children.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a one-woman army inside the White House to get this
done,'' said Littlefield. He said that Kennedy, who was the major
force behind the bill, enlisted Mrs. Clinton's help in the spring
of 1997 when the president became ``skittish'' about the program.
Littlefield said the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, was
threatening that it was a ``deal buster'' on the balanced budget
agreement that he and President Clinton had reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point we went to Mrs. Clinton and said, `You've got to
get the president to come around on this thing,''' Littlefield
said. ``And she said, `Absolutely.' And we very quickly noticed a
change. The president was very much on board.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said she helped to draft and lobbied for bills on
adoption and foster care. It was late on a Sunday near the end of
the 1997 congressional session that Rep. Dave Camp, a conservative
Michigan Republican who was frantically negotiating to save an
adoption bill, got a call in the House cloakroom from Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 9:30 or 10 at night,'' Camp recalled. ``I thought only
congressional night owls did that. I was surprised. You know,
you're working wearily on these things, and you're worrying whether
this is doing any good.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton gave him a pep talk, Camp said, and told him the
bill was worth it. Today, although Camp is enthusiastically
supporting Lazio, Mrs. Clinton's opponent in the Senate race in New
York, he admits that the first lady's intervention was important.
``I want to be honest,'' he said. ``It was helpful to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, an administration priority designed to speed up the
adoption of children in foster care, had been heavily promoted by
Mrs. Clinton on Capitol Hill. Four days after her call, it passed
the House and Senate and was soon signed into law by the president.
Almost immediately, Mrs. Clinton and her White House staff began
working with the Department of Health and Human Services on a new,
related bill to provide more government help to 18-year-olds who
age out of foster care. One version of that bill was virtually
drafted in Mrs. Clinton's office, according to Rep. Ben Cardin, the
Democrat who sponsored it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the first lady's priority, and she developed the
administration's legislation,'' Cardin said. ``And pretty much what
was passed by Congress was what the administration proposed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's role, however, is disputed by Republicans, who
say they knew nothing about it. ``I wrote the bill,'' said Rep.
Nancy Johnson of Connecticut, the Republican sponsor who introduced
her own version in the House. Rep. Tom DeLay, a foster parent and
the aggressive anti-Clinton House majority whip who pushed the
bill, said that if Mrs. Clinton was involved, ``I never saw it.''

THREE-PRONG STRATEGY IN TIRE RECALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANTHONY FLINT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Faced with the business-crippling prospect of consumers
associating its tires with blowouts and death, Bridgetone/Firestone
Inc. is attempting to pull off a three-part strategy with its
massive tire recall: calm consumers, maintain civil ties with its
biggest partner Ford Motor Co., and limit damage from lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The product liability side of the equation will sort itself out
in the years ahead, litigation specialists say, with responsibility
for the unraveling tires perhaps ultimately shared, in some
proportion, by Firestone and Ford.
</P>
<P>
   But it may be too late for Firestone's image in the marketplace,
where consumers have long memories and the landscape is littered
with brands that have been tainted by recalls or mishaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone says, `Oh, you have new tires, what brand are
they, are they Firestone?,' my bet is (they'll be) quite a few
people who say they don't want that brand,'' said Stephen A.
Greyser, professor of marketing and communications at Harvard
Business School.
</P>
<P>
   ``One certainly could make an argument that says Firestone was
slow to respond, and did not take ownership, did not put the
consumer front and center,'' said Greyser, an expert in crisis
management. ``They may have underestimated the importance of
consumer confidence in terms of the reputation of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Firestone, owned by the Japanese parent company Bridgestone,
issued the recall Wednesday of 6.5 million Wilderness AT, ATX and
ATX tires for 15-inch rims, most of them on Ford sport utility
vehicles and pickup trucks. The action followed 50 lawsuits, 46
deaths, 80 injuries and a federal investigation of treads peeling
off tires on traveling vehicles, prompting rollovers and crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from both Firestone and Ford say they acted as quickly
as possible, but trial lawyers and consumer and safety advocates
say the problem should have been addressed sooner, particularly
after recalls of tires with similar problems in seven foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy for a critic to parachute in and say they should be
reacting to any death anywhere in the world. I'm not suggesting a
knee-jerk reaction, but by the time the deaths get up to 46,
somewhere between one and 46, that's the point where the company
one would think would take steps,'' said Greyser.
</P>
<P>
   The recall will neither establish responsibility for Firestone
nor extinguish future lawsuits, said Edwin Woodsome, partner at the
Los Angeles law firm of Howrey, Simon, Arnold and White, who
specializes in complex business litigation including product
liability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly one of the byproducts of a recall is the hope you do
head off future problems. But we've only seen the tip of the
iceberg,,'' said Woodsome.
</P>
<P>
   Two national class-action suits have already been filed. The
American Trial Lawyers Association of America has put together a
working group so plaintiff attorneys can share information and
possibly join forces. Several attorneys have complained that in the
cases settled thus far, Firestone has insisted on a gag order so
victims can not talk about their cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recall helps them by making them look like they're trying
to do the right thing, though it's part and parcel of damage
control,'' said David Heinlein, attorney with the Boston firm of
Heinlein &AMP; Beeler.
</P>
<P>
   After the first step of the recall, legal analysts say, there
may be an apportionment of blame involving both Firestone and Ford.
Ford's recommendation that tires be inflated to a lesser degree
than Firestone could play into the analysis, for example. When
tires are underinflated, there is more rubber on the road and heat
builds up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you underinflate a tire, if there's a heavy load, and if
you drive faster than the speed rating, the tire gets hot and can
disintegrate,'' said Russ Evans, a representative of the
International Tire Association, an informal trade group based in
Farmington, Conn. Heat is used to attach the tread and can make the
tread peel off, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Evans said Ford almost certainly helped design the
recalled tires for specific use on its vehicles. ``The tire is part
of the suspension system, it affects traction and mileage,'' he
said. ``All the manufacturers have gotten into the tire design
business.''
</P>
<P>
   There have reportedly been behind-the-scenes tensions between
Firestone and Ford on the inflation recommendations, but Ford is
one of Firestone's biggest customers and Firestone wants to
maintain future business.
</P>
<P>
   However, Firestone may not need to point fingers at Ford,
because plaintiffs' lawyers will almost certainly seek to scutinize
the full scope of liability, said Heinlein. ``They'll do that work
for them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Firestone can manage to stay on an even keel through the
coming thicket of litigation, the company faces its greatest
challenge in the rehabilitation of its brand name, marketing
experts say. This week's recall is the second largest for tires in
the U.S.; the largest, of 14.5 million tires, was in 1978 and was
also by Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   That recall was government-ordered, and although regulators did
not force this recall, Firestone officials are facing an
investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration. At the same time, Firestone will have to assure
consumers that only a small number of its products are at issue in
the recall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things they can do in the future. They may come
up with a process improvement or an improved tire, with third-party
independent testers, or their own tests monitored by a third-party,
to re-evoke consumer confidence,'' said Gesyer. `I'm not suggesting
the brand is dead, but they have to do some revitalization there.''

GALAXY WILL LOAN HERNANDEZ TO CLUB AMERICA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ There is no official word from Major League
Soccer, but newspaper reports in Mexico and Galaxy coach Sigi
Schmid have confirmed that striker Luis Hernandez will be loaned to
Club America of the Mexican first division after the MLS season.
</P>
<P>
   In May, MLS paid nearly $4 million in transfer fees to purchase
Hernandez's contract from Tigres, signing him to a three-year
contract. As part of the deal, MLS promised that it would loan
Hernandez to a European team in the offseason if there was
interest. However, loaning Hernandez back to a Mexican team is a
surprise to most.
</P>
<P>
   MLS executive vice president Ivan Gazidis is on vacation and
unavailable for comment, but Hernandez joining Club America means
that ``El Matador'' will miss the first two and a half months of
the 2001 MLS season. He could return in June, but would miss
additional games while Mexico attempts to qualify for the 2002
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew going into this acquisition he was either going to
Europe or back to Mexico,'' said Schmid. ``Europe would have been
better because he would have returned earlier. It's something we
have to accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it's the same deal we had with Carlos Hermosillo.
Once Hernandez's season in Mexico is finished, he will rejoin us.
We just have to make the most out of the four or five months that
he's with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, whose wife Nancy delivered their third child, a
daughter, on Wednesday, will miss Saturday's crucial match against
the Kansas City Wizards and Wednesday's game against Colorado. Both
games are at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who has a five-game point streak with the Galaxy,
remained in Mexico so he could train with Mexico's national team in
preparation for Tuesday's World Cup qualifying game against Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Schmid could have forced Hernandez to play Saturday, but he
backed off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a situation where the Mexican Federation wanted to
bring the players in earlier than they're allowed by FIFA,'' said
Schmid. ``If we would have held him, they probably wouldn't have
selected him and that's something you don't want to do to a player.
We've got bigger fish down the line in the playoffs and we want to
make sure we have Luis when that time comes.''
</P>
<P>
   DECISIONS, DECISIONS: With Wednesday's U.S. Open Cup
quarterfinal victory over San Jose, league officials have a
decision to make. The Galaxy is scheduled to meet the Chicago Fire,
a 5-1 winner over Dallas, in the semifinals Aug. 23 at a site to be
determined.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Galaxy visits Chicago on Aug. 19 for a
regular-season MLS match.
</P>
<P>
   There are three scenarios possible. The Aug. 19 game could serve
as the Open Cup semifinal. The Galaxy could remain in Chicago and
play the semifinal a few days later, or L.A. could return home and
play the match at Cal State Fullerton on Aug. 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we're playing them on the 19th, I would like them to
come back here for the Open Cup match,'' said Schmid. ``It would be
better for us, we would have Luis back for that game.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Galaxy beats Chicago, it will play the winner of the New
York/New Jersey-Miami game for the championship Oct. 22 at a site
to be determined. &QL;

TIRE TECHNOLOGY HAS BRED CONSISTENCY AND COMPATIBILITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TIRE-REACT, TIRE-BRIDGESTONE) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one yet knows what caused a disproportionate number of
Firestone tires to fail on Ford Explorers, or why many of the
failed tires seem to come from one Firestone plant in Decatur, Ill.
But when it comes to tire design, manufacture and composition in
general, experts are unanimous about one thing: Tires on the road
today are safe, when they are used as intended.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general reason for tire failure is tire abuse by drivers,
not tire manufacture,'' said Edward J. Wagner, a consultant in
Louisville, Ky., who often serves as an expert witness _ both for
and against tire companies _ in product-liability lawsuits. Among
other mistakes, consumers let their tires get low on air, or put
wrong-sized tires on their vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Consumer Reports studied six all-weather tires for
sport utility vehicles _ none of them made by Firestone. It checked
how well they braked, took corners, held the road in snow or rain
and otherwise performed. ``We've found no tires with dangerous
performance attributes,'' said R. David Pittle, technical director
of Consumer Reports. Even the lowest-ranked tire _ a Goodyear
Wrangler RAF _ ``ranked in the middle of good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That was not always the case, of course. When radial tires were
first introduced in the United States in the late 1970s, they
brought their share of problems. Most were reinforced with
fiberglass, which often broke. And many had sidewalls that bulged
out, causing bumpy rides. One early radial, the Firestone 500,
leaked air, making it the subject of one of the largest tire
recalls in history.
</P>
<P>
   Now, all tire manufacturers use durable steel belts. And most
tires are made of sophisticated rubber compounds that can withstand
heat and friction. ``You almost can't buy a bad tire these days,''
said Robert Ulrich, editor of Modern Tire Dealer.
</P>
<P>
   No one is suggesting that tires are commodities, differentiated
only by advertising. Indeed, they are highly engineered products,
with each company keeping its particular curing temperature, tread
design and cocktail of rubber compounds a closely held trade
secret.
</P>
<P>
   Tires can be made up of as many as 200 different materials, from
rubbers to plastics to steel, amalgamated into more than 30
components. Some parts, like the tread or sidewall, are visible.
Others, like the steel belts for reinforcement, or the butyl rubber
interliners to keep air from leaking, are on the inside. There are
layers, called plies, of polyester, rayon and other materials. Most
tires have high-tensile steel wires, called beads, that keep tires
seated against the metal wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Each line of tires has a slightly different tread designed for
hugging the road better in wet weather, but all of them operate
loosely on the principle that the placement or depth of grooves on
the tire can keep the tire from accumulating water and
hydroplaning. Similarly, manufacturers tinker with the makeup of
rubber compounds to increase traction, and redesign treads to give
a quieter ride.
</P>
<P>
   Every tire represents tradeoffs. Put in a lot of carbon black to
make the tire more resistant to cuts and it may have traction
problems on wet pavements. Add silica to reduce resistance _ and
thus increase fuel economy _ and there can be a static electricity
buildup that causes a mild shock if you touch the car.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, some tire manufacturers have added extra nylon
reinforcement to make tires more durable. Joan Claybrook, director
of Public Citizen, the consumer rights group, has frequently
suggested that American tire manufacturers do the same. But most
American tire experts say the nylon does not add anything to tire
performance.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part _ ad campaigns to the contrary _ tires are
compatible, making it possible for consumers to replace one tire at
a time with whatever brand they prefer.
</P>
<P>
   All tires are manufactured to specifications laid out by the
Tire and Rim Association, a trade group that decides the minimum
and maximum amount of air the tire should hold and the size of car
or load it should carry. The ``DOT'' stamp that appears on tires is
a Department of Transportation certification that the tires conform
to the association's standards and have passed its tests for
resistance to puncture, endurance, stability and such.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every manufacturer makes their tires compatible expressly so
consumers can move between Brand A and Brand B and Brand C,'' said
William M. Hopkins, Goodyear's vice president for technical
planning.
</P>
<P>
   There have been cases of companies voluntarily recalling tires
because the beads were cracking, or for other structural problems.
But Marvin Bozarth, executive director of the International Tire
and Rubber Association, says the vast majority of the recalls over
the past 20 years were of tires that had been inadvertently
mislabeled, not tires that had performed badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are small differences among tires, but there are no big
differences,'' he said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A California congresswoman who is an ally of Vice
President Al Gore's announced Thursday that she was going ahead
with plans to hold a fund-raiser on Tuesday at the Playboy mansion
in Los Angeles, despite pleas from Gore's campaign and Democratic
leaders to move the event.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic party officials responded quickly, yanking the
congresswoman, Rep. Loretta Sanchez, from the coveted speaking slot
she had at the national convention next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done everything we can, and now we have no alternative
but to take action,'' said Joe Andrew, the chairman of the
Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez said Gore's staff had encouraged her to switch sites,
but after consulting with the board of directors of her political
action committee, she decided Thursday to keep her 600 invited
guests and donors at the mansion. Playboy executives and Sanchez's
aides say the event will be sedate.
</P>
<P>
   The $5,000-a-plate fund-raiser, which will coincide with the
Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, has angered Roman
Catholic groups as well as some Hispanic organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We selected a high-profile venue to highlight the important
work of Hispanic Unity USA,'' Sanchez said Thursday, referring to
her political action committee. ``The event is sold out, and it
will be a great success.''
</P>
<P>
   Aghast at the image the fund-raiser at Hugh Hefner's house would
project, no matter how stodgy the actual party, Gore's campaign and
Democratic leaders have tried for weeks to persuade Sanchez to move
the event.e.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has accepted $1,500 for his campaign this year from
Hefner and his daughter, Christie, voiced his displeasure early,
and this week party leaders stepped up the pressure by threatening
to cancel her Sanchez's speaking slot at the convention, which they
did Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials said they might also push to remove her as
vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, a position
for which she had been picked by Gore, and that he might even
withdraw his support for her re-election.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to Sanchez on Thursday, Andrew wrote: ``As a
father of young children, I tried to convey to you my dismay at the
kind of message that this event would send. I told you how
Democratic state chairs, Latinos, leaders of women's groups and
just plain Democrats have called and told me that this event was
neither appropriate nor reflective of our party's values. But you
refused to budge.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, Gore's press secretary, said that Gore had made it
clear that he disapproved. ``Al Gore is not participating,
supporting, condoning or giving his imprimatur in any shape, way or
form to this event,'' Lehane said. ``We've conveyed our thoughts in
every way we can. Obviously, we're reaching the end of the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans Thursday offered their own thoughts on the Playboy
mansion fund-raiser, pointing out that Democrats have accepted more
than $104,000 in contributions since 1992 from the Hefners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore's campaign team suggests they're embarrassed by the
idea of having a Democrat fund-raising event held at the Playboy
mansion,'' said Jim Nicholson, the chairman of the Republican
National Committee. ``They may not like talking about it, but they
sure do enjoy that Playboy money.''
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, the embarrassment comes at a most inopportune time.
Just this week, he selected Sen. Joseph Lieberman as his running
mate, a reserved Orthodox Jew who publicly excoriated President
Clinton for his affair with a White House aide.

   MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ Lisa Raymond celebrated her 27th
birthday Thursday by beating qualifier Daja Bedanova in the
estyle.com Classic's second round.
</P>
<P>
   It's a nice present, to be sure, and there were others. The
Women's Tennis Association assigned her the first match Thursday,
giving her ample time to rest at the beach and enjoy a dinner at
the house of tour member Kimberly Po's mother.
</P>
<P>
   But the one gift Raymond really wants _ an Olympic berth _ has
been denied.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being the world's No.1-ranked doubles player, Raymond
will not be going to Sydney. The U.S. Tennis Association chose the
Williams sisters to play doubles.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond has hired a lawyer, Greg Becker, and has filed a
grievance seeking instatement.
</P>
<P>
   Becker spoke with the USTA on Thursday to try to set up the
details for arbitration but didn't finalize anything. Raymond's
case must be concluded before Aug. 24, which is the day the U.S.
Olympic Committee must submit the names to the International
Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how I feel. I feel really good about what I'm doing,''
Raymond said. ``I feel good taking a stand. Bottom line, I feel I
deserve that spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Becker alleged the USTA failed to follow its selection process,
which calls for berths based on the WTA rankings as of July 9.
Also, there can't be any discretion or subjectivity.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, Lindsay Davenport, Venus Williams and Monica Seles
were the top American-ranked singles players, so they made the
team.
</P>
<P>
   That left one doubles spot, and U.S. captain Billie Jean King
selected Serena Williams to play doubles with her sister. Serena
hasn't played enough doubles to earn a ranking.
</P>
<P>
   King has said it was a difficult decision to make, but she had
to make a choice. Becker says that shows King used discretion.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond has 14 doubles titles, including mixed doubles titles at
Wimbledon in 1999 and the U.S. Open in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Gigi Fernandez was ranked No.1 in doubles and played Olympic
doubles in 1992 and '96 with Mary Joe Fernandez, not her regular
partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, (the Olympics) is a goal of mine, and I thought
it's been earned,'' Raymond said. ``To attain that ranking, and
have the opportunity taken away (is a shame).'' &QL;

<P>
   The billionaire boy's club of America's Cup contenders appeared
to become one member stronger Thursday. With the announcement from
San Francisco that Larry Ellison, the CEO of Oracle Corp. and the
owner of the maxi yacht racer Sayonara, had acquired the assets of
fellow San Franciscan Paul Cayard's America One syndicate, Ellison
seemed on the verge of making an official challenge for the cup in
New Zealand in 2003. No figures were divulged.
</P>
<P>
   Cayard, speaking from his headquarters in San Francisco, was
accompanied by Bill Erkelens, who was Ellison's project manager for
the building of Sayonara in 1995 and until recently served as the
boat's captain. Cayard said that Ellison had basically purchased a
complete America's Cup starter kit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've sold substantially all our assets,'' said Cayard, whose
team advanced to the challenger's finals in last spring's cup
before being eliminated by Italy's Prada Challenge. ``That includes
our two America's Cup boats, our base in New Zealand, all the
tools, sheds, and sail loft _ the whole package, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Cayard or Erkelens would comment on specific details of
Ellison's campaign; an official announcement is expected next week.
Whether Ellison himself will have an on-the-water role remains to
be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sailed in the Seventies a bit, then disappeared from
sailing until 1995, when he built Sayonara,'' Erkelens said of
Ellison. ``But the boat's been active since then, and just finished
the Chicago-Mackinac Race. He seems to enjoy it more and more with
every regatta, which is leading us in this direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Cayard said Thursday that he had considered pressing forth with
another America One challenge, but felt that it was too much of a
longshot considering recent cup developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between March and April, it became clear that at least three
billionaire challenges were being formed to go along with Prada,
which was the one highly financed challenge last time,'' said
Cayard. ``Along with Ellison, there was Craig McCaw of Seattle and
Ernesto Bertarelli from Switzerland, the guy who hired Russell
Coutts and all the other Team New Zealand sailors.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means there are four teams in the fray who are going to
spend $80 million and have the means and will to probably go beyond
that figure,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the realization that we could probably raise between $20
and $25 million, it was pretty clear to me that we're in a new era
that didn't give us a high probability of winning,'' Cayard said.
``As unfortunate as that may be, I felt it was the prudent and
responsible decision to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Cayard would not discuss the nature of his role with the
new syndicate, he hinted that he would be part of Ellison's crew,
which is likely to be skippered by the Kiwi cup veteran and
longtime Sayonara skipper Chris Dickson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to work with a team from San Francisco that has a
great chance of winning,'' Cayard said, ``and I think Ellison's
group, using the assets we developed, would be that kind of a
team.''  &QL;

 DELL COMPUTER'S 2nd-QUARTER EARNINGS BEAT EXPECTATIONS  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dell Computer Corp. reported record revenues and earnings
Thursday, beating analysts' estimates for its second fiscal quarter
by a penny. But the company's revenue growth rate slowed for the
third consecutive quarter, and some analysts questioned its
continued ability to lead the industry.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended July 28, Dell reported earnings of $603
million, or 22 cents a diluted share, up 19 percent from $507
million, or 19 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales
rose 25 percent, to $7.67 billion from $6.14 billion, in the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected Dell to earn 21 cents a share, according
to First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Dell shares fell 6.25 cents Thursday to close at $41.75, 30
percent below its 52-week high of $59.6875.
</P>
<P>
   Ashok Kumar, an analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, lowered
his rating for Dell stock to buy last week from strong buy, citing
concerns about slowing sales growth.
</P>
<P>
   Kumar said Thursday that Dell remains too dependent on sales of
desktop PCs and basic servers. ``I expect revenues to come under
increasing pressure until the company develops a meaningful storage
and services strategy,'' he said. ``Compared to the competition,
Gateway continues to extend its consumer penetration while a
reviving Compaq along with IBM, HP and Sun continue to dominate the
enterprise, all with sizable storage and services businesses,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jim Vanderslice, Dell's vice chairman, said in a telephone
interview that analysts' concerns were overstated. ``We had a
record quarter,'' he said. ``We grew at twice the combined rate of
our 10 largest competitors. I think what the industry is worried
about is are we going to make our 30 percent year-over-year growth
projection,'' he said, adding, ``I would say we're on track to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   And Michael Dell, the company's chairman and chief executive,
said in a statement, ``There remains tremendous room for expansion
in all product categories, customer groups and regional markets,
and the fundamental advantages of our direct model are more
compelling than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell has long benefited from a business model in which it builds
each computer to order, and sells the finished machines directly to
customers. The model allows Dell to keep inventory costs far below
the costs of its competitors, and to incorporate new components in
its designs more rapidly, which tends to keep average selling
prices higher. But competitors like IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Compaq
have narrowed the gap, and can all say they offer broader lines for
corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   Dell said unit sales growth in the second quarter was 22 percent
over all, and faster in enterprise servers, storage products and
notebook computers, which it considers strategically important
categories. Revenue through www.dell.com represented about 50
percent of total sales and averaged more than $50 million a day by
the end of the quarter, up from $30 million in the prior year.

PFIZER CEO TO STEP DOWN AT END OF YEAR; SUCCESSOR ANNOUNCED 
</HEADLINE>
   By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   William C. Steere Jr., the chief executive of Pfizer Inc., will
retire from that post at the end of the year and be replaced by
Henry A. McKinnell, a 29-year manager of the drug company, who has
long been seen as its next top executive. Steere will remain
chairman for several months after he leaves the CEO job.
</P>
<P>
   Since Steere took over in 1992, Pfizer's sales have doubled, and
over the last five years, its stock price has increased more than
400 percent. After it merged with Warner-Lambert this year, Pfizer
became the largest drug company in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, Steere, 64, was not shy about taking
credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the perfect time to leave,'' he said. ``I've done my
part. We're No. 1. Now Hank has to figure out how to keep us
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who cover the drug industry say they expect McKinnell
to lead Pfizer much as Steere has. But they say it will not be easy
for the new executive. Last month, for example, Pfizer disappointed
Wall Street with second-quarter results that showed flat sales for
Viagra and Zithromax, two of its top-selling drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``McKinnell is taking a company that has become huge and
successful,'' said Sergio Traversa at ING Barings. ``I don't know
how much room there is for improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinnell, 57, is president and chief operating officer of the
company. He has also been president of Asian operations and worked
for six years as chief financial officer. He is a Canadian citizen
and grew up on an island in the Strait of Georgia near Vancouver.
He has an M.B.A. and a doctorate in business from Stanford
University.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnell said he was excited to lead Pfizer at a time when
genomics and biotechnology are changing the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you've seen anything yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Steere will continue as chairman until Pfizer's annual meeting
in April. After that, he will remain a member of the board. He said
he would also work for Pfizer as a consultant and continue to lobby
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he plans to spend more time scuba diving and
spearfishing and at his home in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recently bought a boat but had nowhere to put it,'' he said,
``so I bought a marina.'' &QL;

THESE DAYS, DODGERS ANYTHING BUT A HIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ First and second, none out in the ninth inning
Wednesday against the Chicago Cubs in a tie game and the Dodgers
are unable to score.
</P>
<P>
   First and third, none out in the 10th and down a run and Devon
White strikes out, Mark Grudzielanek hits a softer-than-soft liner
to second base and Gary Sheffield pops out foul.
</P>
<P>
   Surprised?
</P>
<P>
   Well, don't be. The Dodgers are a fundamentally challenged power
team that scores runs like an American League team. They hit the
ball over the fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to live and die by the sword. We're going to hit
the three-run homer or we're not,'' shortstop Kevin Elster said.
``I don't think we can try to do something that we're not really
capable of doing. We tried that (Saturday) night and got thrown out
three times trying to steal. We don't hit the home run, see you
later. That's the type of team (management) built.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are 51-31 when they homer and 35-15 when they hit at
least two home runs in a game. They are third in the National
League with 161 homers, fifth in runs scored with 591.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, they are 8-23 when they don't homer, are 11th in the
National League with a .262 batting average and, more than anything
else, are 5{ games behind San Francisco because they go through dry
spells with the long ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were 2{ games out of first place when they arrived
in Philadelphia a few days before the Republican National
Convention. They proceeded to score four runs in three games, hit
no homers, lose two of three and begin an abysmal 12-game stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Primed to make a move on first place, the Dodgers went 5-7
against the Phillies, Pittsburgh, Milwaukee and the Cubs. They
averaged 3.67 runs per game, scored two or fewer runs six times,
and though they hit 13 homers, seven came in the last two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no one particular thing to do to score runs, there's
100 different ways to score them,'' said Sheffield, who leads the
majors with 36 homers. ``There's one way when guys are real hot to
hit the home run, but when that's not happening we need to be a
versatile team. You can't just rely on the home run all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were baffled by Cliff Politte, Jimmy Anderson, Paul
Rigdon and Ruben Quevedo, all of whom had one common trait _ they
threw a bundle of off-speed pitches that kept the hard-swinging
Dodgers lineup off kilter.
</P>
<P>
   During the 12-game span, Sheffield (.270, 10 for 37), Green
(.227, 10 for 44), Karros (.156, 7 for 45) and Hundley (.080, 3 for
28) have all struggled to produce runs. They're were a combined 30
for 154 (.195) with seven homers and 14 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those pitchers, they're able to locate,'' Dodgers hitting
coach Rick Down said. ``When you get guys that are changing speeds,
and you're not getting fastballs to hit in fastball counts, you're
not going to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty of baserunning blunders, failed sacrifice
attempts, grounders to the left side with none out and a runner on
second base, that illustrate the type of offense the Dodgers are
not.
</P>
<P>
   But all that's needed is a quick look at the recent 2-4
homestand for a pair of examples of gaffes that cost the team.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's extra-inning loss to Milwaukee, Sheffield was
thrown out trying to steal second with the score tied in the ninth
inning and Green and Eric Karros due up.
</P>
<P>
   Monday against Chicago was just a mess. Grudzielanek was on
third with no outs, but broke home on Sheffield's grounder back to
the mound. He was tagged out, and his failure to get in a rundown
caused Sheffield to get doubled-up running to second.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Dodgers are 14-15 in one-run games, 11-11 in two-run
games and 6-9 when tied after eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't continue to make those sort of mistakes and expect to
be playing for anything come, even September,'' Karros said.
``Every club, I don't care if it's the Giants or the Diamondbacks,
is going to have spells where they don't hit or they don't pitch
well. But when you are struggling like that, you can't make mental
mistakes.'' &QL;

U.S. ACTS TO TIGHTEN PROTECTION OF WETLANDS
</HEADLINE>
  By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration Thursday proposed new
rules to protect environmentally sensitive wetlands from
development, a response to what administration officials called a
recent rash of destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that in the last two years, some 20,000 acres
of wetlands and an additional 150 miles of streams had been
destroyed because of what they portrayed as a loophole opened by a
court decision three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules, to take effect after a 60-day period of public
comment, would close that loophole by adding greater detail to
regulations that specify what kinds of wetlands development require
an environmental impact review by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, issued by the Environmental Protection Agency and the
Army Corps of Engineers, are part of the administration's effort to
fight the court decision, issued in January 1997 by a federal
district judge in Washington and upheld in June 1998 by the
District of Columbia U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Interpreting unspecific language in the Clean Water Act, both
courts held that developers did not need to obtain a federal permit
to excavate, drain or ditch a wetland as long as they did not dump
soil on the property in question. The EPA had sought as early 1993
to subject all development on wetlands to strict environmental
review, but that approach was rejected by the courts, which ruled
in favor of arguments made by developers and by the National Mining
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Among the winners in that case was the National Association of
Homebuilders, which Thursday expressed strong disagreement with the
new rules. ``This is a bad decision,'' said a spokeswoman, Susan
Asmus, ``and it is not consistent with the previous court rulings
or with the Clean Water Act.''
</P>
<P>
   In her own announcement, Carol Browner, administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency, said: ``Today's proposal will
allow us to go as far as we can through administrative reforms to
close this loophole and protect wetlands. The action we take today
strengthens the protection of vital resources for future
generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly the Sierra Club hailed the decision as an important
strengthening of environmental safeguards. ``Limiting this loophole
should protect the streams and wetlands that are home to thousands
of birds, fish and other wildlife,'' said Robin Mann of the club's
National Wetlands Committee. ``Streams and marshes protect our
communities by acting as a natural sponge, soaking up water that
would otherwise flood our neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials warned that the action would not in
itself be sufficient to guard against destruction of wetlands, and
called on Congress to strengthen the Clean Water Act further.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``wetlands'' is generally used to describe marshes,
swamps, bogs and similar areas typically situated between dry land
and bodies of water. These areas play important roles in filtering
and cleansing water, in serving as a reservoir for flood water, and
in harboring fish and shellfish populations.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA's announcement Thursday vividly described the areas'
significance. ``Destruction of wetlands,'' the statement said,
``can increase flooding and runoff potential, harm neighboring
property, cause stream and river pollution and result in the loss
of valuable habitat.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1700s, the agency said, over half the nation's
wetlands have been lost to development and other activities. Seven
states, it said, have lost more than 80 percent of their original
wetlands.

AUSTIN PUTTS HIS WAY TO THE LEAD AT THE BUICK OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND BLANC, Mich. _ When Woody Austin comes to the Buick Open,
his game somehow comes together.
</P>
<P>
   In 169 starts on the PGA Tour, the 1995 Buick Open is the only
tournament Austin has won. Five years later, at the same event,
Austin enjoyed a round that he will talk about for the rest of his
life.
</P>
<P>
   Making almost every putt he looked at, and leaving Tiger Woods
and the rest of a strong field in pursuit, Austin's nine-under-par
63 gave him a two-stroke lead after Thursday's opening round at
Warwick Hills Golf &AMP; Country Club. Paul Azinger, who shot a 65, was
alone in second place, while Vijay Singh and Joe Ozaki were tied
for third at 66. Woods, looking rusty in his first tournament since
winning the British Open, shot an opening-round 70, leaving him
seven strokes off the lead heading into Friday's second round.
</P>
<P>
   Austin almost equaled the course record of 62, set by Jim Furyk
in 1995 and equaled by Sonny Skinner in 1997. It was the best
putting round Austin has ever had, at any time, on any course.
Austin needed only 22 putts, including 14 one-putts, in a round
that featured 11 birdies and only two bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   How could anyone have seen this coming? In five full seasons on
tour, Austin has never finished in the top 150 in putting. How
badly has Austin struggled this year? He started the season by
missing the cut six consecutive times.
</P>
<P>
   So forgive Austin for smiling after Thursday's round. At least
for one day, he planned to enjoy his lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, I always putt well on this place, and today,
I made almost every putt I could've made,'' said the 36-year-old
Austin, who is 108th on this year's tour money list. ``These are
the best greens on tour, and even though I played late in the
afternoon, the ball still rolled smoothly. I have played so bad,
for so long, I just wanted to make sure I didn't back off. After I
made a bogey on my ninth hole, it was important that I came right
back and kept making birdies down the stretch. This is the first
time in a long time that I played 18 good holes instead of just
nine.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting his day on No. 10, Austin birdied his first five holes,
showing immediately that he was on top of his game. Ball-striking
is the strength of Austin's game, and with solid drives and
excellent approach shots, he kept giving himself birdie
opportunities. Through 13 holes, Austin never had to make a birdie
putt longer than 12 feet. His first long putt for birdie came at
No. 6, Austin's 15th hole, when he made a 25-footer. At No. 7,
Austin made a 15-footer for birdie.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest letdown of his day came on his final hole, No. 9,
when Austin pulled his drive into the left rough, then hit a poor
second shot over the green and underneath the grandstand. After
getting a free drop behind the green, Austin chipped to 10 feet,
but missed the putt and settled for bogey, costing him a tie for
the course record. But at that point, he hardly cared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to see some positive things about my game, and I
did,'' Austin said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods had a streaky day. He made a rare double-bogey. He missed
a putt from 18 inches. Yet, when the day ended, he was still two
under par, making three consecutive birdies on the back nine that
turned around his day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little tough to get my rhythm,'' Woods said. ``I
started out birdie-birdie, but I didn't feel that great over the
ball, and it ended up catching up with me. I had the same focus I
normally do. I just couldn't hit the shots where I wanted. You
can't play well all the time, that's the great thing about this
game. Today was a perfect example of that. I wasn't that far off,
but I was off.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods birdied the first two holes, but it wasn't long before the
rust from his two-week layoff appeared. At the par-4 No. 5, Woods
made bogey, hitting his second shot over the green, chipping 10
feet past the hole, then missing the putt. Then came his
double-bogey at the par 3 No. 8, when he hit a bad tee shot left of
the green, hit a high flop shot over trees and onto the green, then
three-putted. At No. 10, Woods missed an 18-inch par putt, staring
at the hole in disbelief as the ball spun out of the hole.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Woods regrouped with birdies at No. 11, No. 12,
No. 13 and No. 16, to give himself a positive feeling heading into
Friday. But the day belonged to Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a dream round,'' Austin said. ``I made every putt I
could have made until the last hole. I can't ask for anything
better than that.'' &QL;

IN CAMPAIGN SEASON, TNT BACKS AN ALSO-RAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for times and channels.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Democratic candidate for president is the governor of a
mid-American state. He's an idealist. One ideal, it seems, is to
sleep with every woman he meets, except his own daughter.
</P>
<P>
   That's ``Running Mates,'' which was first conceived by
co-executive producer Al Ruddy in, ahem, 1992 and might have been
considered prescient if it had been televised then.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, it's merely a mess _ a TNT movie that tries mightily to
be a comedy, gives up for lack of results and finally devolves into
sap-saturated drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running Mates'' is a must, however, for film fans who can
never be too appalled by a Faye Dunaway performance. The director,
Ron Lagomarsino, doesn't just allow Dunaway to chew scenery. He
sets her loose to graze on the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Dunaway plays the miserable, neglected, vodka-soaked wife of a
senator (Robert Culp) who's in the running for a vice-presidential
nod as the Democrats convene for their national convention in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The man who'll make the decision is Michigan Gov. James Pryce
(Tom Selleck, who shaved off his Thomas Dewey mustache for the
role).
</P>
<P>
   Pryce _ a not so subtle name, inasmuch as the whole movie is
about whether he has a price _ has sewn up the presidential
nomination and now must select a running mate. His political
scruples, or lack of them, will be revealed in his choice.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Culp character, the contenders are a reform-minded
senator from Colorado (Bob Gunton) and a sneering senator from
Texas (Bruce McGill) who is favored by big business interests.
</P>
<P>
   Pryce and the veep contenders aren't the only characters
jockeying for gain. The women around Pryce have their agendas.
Besides Dunaway, they're Laura Linney as Pryce's savvy campaign
manager, Teri Hatcher as a dippy fund-raiser with ties to Hollywood
moguls, and Nancy Travis as Pryce's wife, hell-bent on preserving
an ounce of family privacy.
</P>
<P>
   All four women find they have much in common. All right, one
thing in common. They've all slept with Pryce. A few, maybe, when
he was single.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was good,'' says Dunaway. ``Young, but good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The best,'' says Hatcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had better,'' says Linney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmmm,'' says Travis.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting thing is, this is as close to real as ``Running
Mates'' gets.
</P>
<P>
   The clingy drama blossoms improbably at the close, when Selleck
takes the podium to accept the nomination and announce his running
mate.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it's done, right? No? Ruddy's co-executive producer
is an old Jimmy Carter hand, Gerald Rafshoon, and he's supposed to
know.

   Showtime's ``The Thin Blue Lie,'' premiering Sunday, is a more
satisfying movie, a fact-based journalistic thriller about an
investigative reporter (Rob Morrow) who uncovered police brutality
in Philadelphia in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Morrow plays Philadelphia Inquirer _ for some reason the
Inquirer is called the Examiner in the movie _ reporter Jonathan
Neumann, whose expose earned him a Pulitzer Prize and helped bring
down the city's mayor, ex-cop Frank Rizzo.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Sorvino plays Rizzo. Randy Quaid plays Neumann's less
abrasive reportorial partner.
</P>
<P>
   It was a heck of a story. Neumann found that homicide
detectives, under pressure to clear cases, routinely beat
confessions out of suspects. In time they threaten to beat Neumann
into silence.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is a City Hall variation of ``All the President's
Men.'' Director Roger Young infuses the film's ersatz Philly with a
murkily pervasive sense of danger, and there's even a secret source
who calls himself Deep Nightstick.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the characters are composites, and by necessity Young
keeps the movie far ahead of the actual plodding pace of
investigative reporting. But it's a well-told story, smartly
scripted and fronted by a restlessly involving performance from
Morrow.
</P>
<P>

   Proving that it's not all ``The Sopranos'' and Peabody Awards,
HBO premieres a series called ``G-String Divas'' on Saturday. At
last, a partner in grime for the pay cable channel's ``Real Sex''
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``G-String Divas'' profiles exotic dancers. One of the two
profiled Saturday calls herself Ginger. She's a Villanova graduate
and a skilled hustler. One of her regular admirers is so dopey that
he says he's falling in love with her. For her part, Ginger says
she's ``like a vulture'' in search of carrion.
</P>
<P>
   Due to an incomplete preview tape from HBO, I'll pass on the
usual rating. Let's just say that the Little Man never quite sat
erect.

DNA FREES INMATE YEARS AFTER JUSTICES REJECTED PLEA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz.)   By BARBARA WHITAKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Larry Youngblood did not need
to be released from prison just because evidence that might have
exonerated him on child molestation charges had been damaged. But
this week, 12 years later, DNA testing of evidence in the case set
him free. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the Supreme Court reversed a ruling by the Arizona
Court of Appeals, which had overturned Youngblood's conviction for
the 1983 crime on the ground that his due process had been violated
by the failure to safeguard evidence in the case. Specifically, the
authorities had failed to refrigerate underwear, making it
impossible to determine whether there was any semen on the clothing
that was Youngblood's.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court held, 6-3, that a defendant's rights were not
denied unless the authorities were acting maliciously and knew the
evidence could prove innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have before us a flawed legal precedent that stands on
the shoulders of an innocent man,'' said Dr. Edward Blake, a
forensic scientist with expertise in DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Blake, along with defense lawyers, said the ruling had
undermined what were once progressive mandates that put the onus on
the government to collect, maintain and properly preserve evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those organizations that are poorly run or mismanaged or
don't give a damn,'' he said, ``the Youngblood case was a license
to let down their guard and be lazy. The effect that had was
generally to lower the standards of evidence collection.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the state appellate court set aside the conviction
again in 1990, arguing that the state's constitution was broader
than the federal government's, the state Supreme Court reinstated
the conviction in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Youngblood, now 47, returned to prison and served his sentence
concurrently with a five-year sentence for an assault conviction he
received while out of prison. In 1998, he was released, but he was
returned to prison last year after violating the sex offender law
when he failed to report a change of address.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, his lawyers requested new, more sophisticated DNA
tests on the evidence that were not available in 1983. The test
results, several months in coming, cleared Youngblood. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rick Unklesbay, chief criminal deputy in the Pima County
Attorney's Office, said Thursday that officials regretted what had
happened but had acted in good faith. ``Based on the testimony of
the victim, collaborating evidence and the technology available at
the time,'' he said, ``everyone felt we had the right person.
Everybody feels bad and it's unfortunate that Youngblood spent time
incarcerated, but we did what we thought was right at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Youngblood, he said: ``For 17 years, I knew I was
innocent. They tried to get me to plea for less time, but I would
never confess, especially to something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am angry,'' he added. ``They took the best years of my
life.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has long been assumed that ardent sports fans derive
excitement and a sense of community from rooting for a big-time
team. But a growing body of scientific evidence suggests that, for
some fans, the ties go much deeper.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers have found that fervent fans become so tied to
their teams that they experience hormonal surges and other
physiological changes while watching games, much as the athletes
themselves do.
</P>
<P>
   The self-esteem of some male and female fans also rises and
falls with a game's outcome, with losses affecting their optimism
about everything from getting a date to playing darts, one study
showed.
</P>
<P>
   Science is still grappling with many questions about why people
form such deep ties to sports teams, and it has not yet rigorously
confronted what may be the core question: Is avidly rooting for a
team good or bad for someone's health? But there are early clues,
some of them surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists have long suspected that many diehard fans are
lonely, alienated people searching for self-esteem by identifying
with a sports team. But a study at the University of Kansas
suggests just the opposite _ that sports fans suffer fewer bouts of
depression and alienation than do people who are uninterested in
sports.
</P>
<P>
   One theory traces the roots of fan psychology to a primitive
time when human beings lived in small tribes and warriors fighting
to protect tribes were true genetic representatives of their
people, psychologists say.
</P>
<P>
   In modern society, professional and college athletes play a
similar role for a city in the stylized war on a playing field, the
theory goes. Even though professional athletes are mercenaries in
every sense, their exploits may re-create the intense emotions in
some fans that tribal warfare may have in their ancestors. It may
also be these emotions that have in large part fueled the explosion
in the popularity of sports over the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sports heroes are our warriors,'' said Robert Cialdini, a
professor of psychology at Arizona State University. ``This is not
some light diversion to be enjoyed for its inherent grace and
harmony. The self is centrally involved in the outcome of the
event. Whoever you root for represents you.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Cialdini pioneered research on fans in the 1970s. He began by
documenting that college sports fans were far more likely to wear
clothing with their team's logo on the day after victories than
after defeats, a phenomenon he called ``basking in reflected
glory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes possible to attain some sort of respect and regard
not by one's own achievements but by one's connection to
individuals of attainment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   His later research showed that sports fans tend to claim credit
for a team's success, saying ``we won'' to describe a victory, but
tend to distance themselves from a team's failure, saying ``they
lost'' when describing a defeat.
</P>
<P>
   But Cialdini's initial theories did not cover all spectators,
since some deeply committed fans, like the long suffering souls who
love the Chicago Cubs, remain loyal and fiercely attached to their
idols despite years of failure.
</P>
<P>
   Studies over the last decade showed that while the
run-of-the-mill spectator may abandon a team once it starts losing,
more committed fans, ride the same emotional roller-coaster as the
athletes themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, psychologists at the University of Kansas came up with
a survey for measuring a fan's attachment to his team. The scale
divides fans into high, low and moderate identification, based on
their responses to seven written questions.
</P>
<P>
   A raft of studies since then have that found ``highly
identified'' fans _ both men and women _ not only are less likely
to abandon a team when it is doing poorly, but tend to blame their
team's failures on officiating or bad luck rather than the other
team's skill. They also exhibit higher levels of physiological
arousal at games, spend more money on tickets and merchandise and
enjoy generally higher self-esteem than people uninterested in
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the highly identified fans who demonstrate this fierce
connection and feel elation and dejection along with the team,''
Cialdini said.

   Gene Hamm, a 37-year-old elevator mechanic from Staten Island,
says his passion for the New York Mets, ignited in his boyhood
during their wondrous 1969 season, has never been extinguished. He
watches every game he can on television, his emotions rising and
falling with every pitch, every hit, every managerial decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually feel myself sitting on the couch managing the
team,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm spent months at home last year, recuperating from a
job-related injury, and he said watching the Mets kept him from
slipping into depression. Then Kenny Rogers walked in the winning
run to seal the Atlanta Braves' victory over the Mets in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't walk in the winning run,'' he said, looking as if he
had swallowed a glass of lemon juice. ``I really wish they could
have won last year. That would have made me feel so much better.''

</P>
<P>
   Some recent studies suggest that some fans experience
physiological changes during a game or when shown photos of their
team.
</P>
<P>
   A study in Georgia has shown, for instance, that testosterone
levels in male fans rise markedly after a victory and drop just as
sharply after a defeat. The same pattern has been documented in
male animals who fight over a mate: Biologists theorize that
mammals may have evolved this way to ensure quick resolutions to
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   James Dabbs, a psychologist at Georgia State University, tested
saliva samples from different groups of sports fans before and
after important games.
</P>
<P>
   In one test, Dabbs took saliva samples from 21 Italian and
Brazilian men in Atlanta before and after Brazil's victory over
Italy in soccer's 1994 World Cup. The Brazilians' testosterone rose
28 percent on average, while the Italians' levels dropped 27
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In another study, at the University of Utah, Dabbs and a
colleague, Paul Bernhardt, found that male college basketball fans
whose responses to a questionnaire indicated they had a low opinion
of themselves registered the highest surges in testosterone after a
win.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dabbs said in an interview that the results suggest fans
empathize with the competitors to such a degree that they mentally
project themselves into the game and experience the same hormonal
surges athletes do. The contest, however, must be an important one,
like a playoff game, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really are tribal creatures,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Hillman, a psychologist now at the University of
Illinois, found that ardent football fans at the University of
Florida experienced extreme physiological arousal when they viewed
pictures of Gators football stars making game-winning plays, but
responded indifferently to pictures of other athletes and teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individuals that are highly identified with the team show
extreme arousal compared to the average fan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among zealous male and female fans, Hillman's study found, the
level of arousal _ measured by heart rate, brain waves and
perspiration _ was comparable to what the fans registered when
shown erotic photos or pictures of animal attacks, he said.

   For some fans, the emotional roller coaster of watching a game
can be addictive. John Herde, a 65-year-old accountant in
Manhattan, has been attending Rangers' games since he was a
teen-ager and owns season tickets. He remembers sitting in the
upper rows of the old Madison Square Garden as a boy and banging on
the ceiling when the team scored.
</P>
<P>
   What has brought him back to hockey games again and again, he
says, is the catharsis he feels when he gives free rein to his
anger or gloats openly in triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a release,'' he said. ``You can yell and scream and do
whatever. It's like therapy.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Edward Hirt of the University of Indiana has demonstrated that
an ardent fan's self-esteem tends to track a team's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Working with fans of Indiana University's basketball teams, Hirt
showed zealous fans pictures of very attractive members of the
opposite sex after a game and asked them to rate their ability to
get a date with that person.
</P>
<P>
   The results demonstrated that men and women who were diehard
fans were much more optimistic about their sex appeal after a
victory. They were also more sanguine about their ability to
perform well at mental and physical tests, like darts and word
games, Hirt found. When the team lost, that optimism evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   ``People identify themselves with a team through thick and
thin,'' he said. ``Your self-esteem will go up and down as your
team does well or poorly.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirt said the desire to belong to a group or society _ a need
once fulfilled mostly by religious and political organizations _
may explain why some fans remain loyal despite the repeated failure
of their teams. Fans of the Chicago Cubs, he pointed out, have not
enjoyed a World Series championship since 1908. Yet Wrigley Field
sells out almost every game.

   Fans of the New York Jets present another example. The team has
not won a championship since 1969, when Joe Namath led the Jets to
a Super Bowl. In 1985, the Jets moved from Shea Stadium in Queens
to Giants Stadium in New Jersey, where they are a tenant in another
team's home.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Anzalone, a New York City firefighter, said he became
fascinated with the Jets when he was a boy in the 1960s, and
despite 30 years without a championship, has never lost faith in
the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an obsession,'' he says. ``The fans went over to New
Jersey and are still hanging tough, even with no Stadium and not
winning a Super Bowl since 1969.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Anzalone, who is 40, is better known as Fireman
Eddie to Jets' fans. Every game, he rides on his brother Frank's
shoulders, wearing a green and white fire helmet and leading the
fans in a J-E-T-S chant. His devotion to the team has gained him
some notoriety of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Anzalone's house in College Point, Queens, is painted green, the
Jets' color. He will only drive a green car. The room of his
3-year-old son Tyler is a shrine to the team, with footballs signed
by several Jets' most valuable players, a hat signed by Bill
Parcells and a team jacket from 1966.
</P>
<P>
   He says he still suffers with every loss. When Vinny Testaverde,
the Jets' quarterback, ruptured his Achilles' tendon early in the
opening game last season, Anzalone went to bed. ``I was sick to my
stomach,'' he said. ``I was sick that day. I knew the year was
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, this deep attachment to a team can be healthy,
studies have found. Daniel Wann, a psychologist at Murray State
University in Kentucky, has done several studies showing that an
intense interest in a team can buffer people from depression and
foster feelings of self-worth and belonging.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Wann studied students at the University of Kansas,
demonstrating that ardent fans of basketball and baseball teams had
higher levels of self-esteem and suffered fewer bouts of depression
than did people who were not followers of sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of the traditional institutions are beginning to break
down, religion and family,'' Wann said. ``The human psyche is the
same and something has to take the place of that. Sports fills an
important void.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Michelle Musler, one of the most visible Knicks' fans in New
York, acknowledges that her 27-year love affair with the team may
have had its genesis in loneliness.
</P>
<P>
   It began in the early 1970s. She was working, had been through a
divorce and had five children to raise. Once in a while, she said,
she got tickets from her company to Knicks games.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ex-husband ran away with the lady next door and I didn't
seem to fit into suburbia anymore,'' she said. ``The Knicks gave me
a purpose, something to do, a place to go. As a fan, I guess, there
is a sense of belonging. That you are a part of something.''
</P>
<P>
   Musler, 63, became a season-ticket holder in 1974 and has only
missed a handful of games since. A business consultant, she plans
her travel each year around the Knicks' schedule, tapes road games
to watch later and hoards newspaper accounts of her team. She once
flew through the night after an 18-hour day of work to make it back
from Hong Kong in time for a game.
</P>
<P>
   She has lost some friends over the Knicks, when she turned down
invitations to weddings and graduations because they conflicted
with the playoffs. These sacrifices, however, have repaid her, she
says, with new friends who share her obsession: sports writers,
team officials, season ticket holders and other fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened through the years is that the Knicks have
become my social life,'' she said.  &QL;

SEC APPROVES REGULATION AGAINST SELECTIVE DISCLOSURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DANNY HAKIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission approved a new rule
Thursday that bans companies from giving important information to
analysts and professional investors before disclosing it to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   The rule should accelerate the so-called democratization of
investing fostered by the Internet. Over the last few years, online
trading, financial message boards and the rapid-fire dissemination
of news from Web sites have helped close the gap between average
investors and Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Regulation FD _ short for fair disclosure _ should benefit small
investors even more, said Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the SEC
</P>
<P>
   ``High-quality and timely information is the lifeblood of
strong, vibrant markets,'' Levitt said. ``But when that information
travels only to a privileged few, when that information is used to
profit at the expense of the investing public, we must ask, `Whose
interest is really being served?'''
</P>
<P>
   Though the full text of the regulation will not be released for
several days, it will require that companies give Wall Street
professionals and individual investors equal access to information
and will give companies 24 hours to inform the public after
accidental disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   A company could not, for example, disclose a profit warning on
quarterly earnings to analysts at 5 p.m. and issue a news release
to the public the next day. Instead, it would have to inform
everyone at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the regulation say it could lead to an
``information blackout'' if companies grow more cautious about
talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will actually hurt, rather than help, the investing
public,'' said Stuart Kaswell, a senior vice president for the
Securities Industry Association, the top trade group for Wall
Street firms like Merrill Lynch. The concern is that some
companies, used to filtering sensitive information through favored
analysts, could disclose less as an end result.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many companies say they'll clam up,'' Kaswell added.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts think there will be an uncertain transitional
period as companies learn to live by the new rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that most of the time when you have a proposal
like this, you'll have predictions of horror stories,'' said Joel
Seligman, dean of the School of Law at Washington University in St.
Louis. ``Most of the companies find a way to live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary investors will gain access to information either by
reading news releases or watching for a company's SEC filings,
which can be found on Web sites. Broadcasts over the Web may be
acceptable in some cases, but postings on a company's Web site will
not be sufficient enough notice on their own.
</P>
<P>
   The rule, which will take effect in two to three months, will
not ban selective disclosure to the media, to firms that rate
corporate bonds or to a company's customers and suppliers _ as was
proposed in the original draft released last December. It will also
exclude information about initial public offerings and foreign
companies whose shares trade in the United States. And the
regulation will affect only senior management and officials who
speak with analysts and stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be some tough questions,'' said Daniel J.
Kramer, a securities lawyer and partner at Schulte, Roth &AMP; Zabel in
New York. ``If an analyst calls a lower-level person in the
company, can that person return the call, and what can they say?''
</P>
<P>
   Kramer said, however, that the fact that infractions will be
handled by the SEC and that the regulation will not allow
shareholders' suits, is positive for companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gives comfort to companies that they're not going to be
subject to a lawsuit any time there's an unintentional violation.''
</P>
<P>
   The new rule will undoubtedly transform how Wall Street
securities analysts do their jobs. There will be fewer, if any,
face-to-face meetings with top-level executives, and no hot tips to
deliver to prominent clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the principal benefit of this will be to enforce the
independence and objectivity of the securities analyst,'' said John
C. Coffee Jr., a Columbia University law professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, corporate executives have a key weapon to hold over
the securities analyst,'' he said. ``An analyst, to remain
competitive, has to get as much or more selective disclosure as his
competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC received nearly 6,000 letters and e-mail messages, most
in support of the measure. Some were detailed legal briefs. Others
were more blunt criticisms of the way business is conducted on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vegas would love to play by these rules,'' one correspondent
wrote about existing regulations in an e-mail message posted on the
SEC's Web site. The measure passed on a rare split decision. The
only Republican member of the commission, Laura Unger, dissented in
a 3-1 vote. Two other rules intended to strengthen existing
prohibitions against insider trading passed unanimously.

PATRICIA MOYES, WRITER WHO CREATED SLEUTHING PAIR, DIES AT 77 
</HEADLINE>
   By SARAH BOXER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patricia Moyes, the British mystery writer who created Detective
Chief Superintendent Henry Tibbet and his ``merry and plump and
comforting'' wife, Emmy, died on Aug. 2 at her home in Virgin
Gorda, in the British Virgin Islands. She was 77.
</P>
<P>
   Moyes was known for her cozy, highly civilized, solidly plotted
mysteries. As Jack Sullivan once wrote in The New York Times Book
Review, Moyes handles ``indecorous events'' with ``a minimum of
violence and fuss.'' She makes ``drug dealing seem more like bad
manners than bad morals.''
</P>
<P>
   Moyes wrote 19 mysteries, including ``Dead Men Don't Ski''
(1959), ``Death on the Agenda'' (1962), ``Murder a la Mode''
(1963), ``Murder Fantastical'' (1967), ``Falling Star'' (1964),
``Johnny Underground'' (1965) and ``Death and the Dutch Uncle''
(1968). She also wrote ``Many Deadly Returns,'' which was published
in 1970 and won the Edgar Allan Poe Special Award from the Mystery
Writers of America, as well as ``Angel Death'' (1980), ``Black
Girl, White Girl'' (1991) and ``Twice in a Blue Moon'' (1993). Her
stories also appeared in Ellery Queen and Alfred Hitchcock
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Dublin in 1923, Moyes, who was known as Penny, was
raised in England. She was the daughter of Ernst Pakenham-Walsh, a
judge on the high court in Madras, India, and Marion
Pakenham-Walsh. She went to Overstone Girls' School near
Northampton, England.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, she joined the Royal Air Force and became a radar
operator and flight officer. In the Women's Auxiliary Air Force,
she wrote revue sketches for barrack concerts and a movie script
for an RAF documentary film about radar, which was produced by the
Rank Organization.
</P>
<P>
   For eight years, Moyes was the assistant to the actor and
director Peter Ustinov. She translated Jean Anouilh's play
``Leocadia,'' which was produced on Broadway in 1957 as ``Time
Remembered,'' starring Richard Burton, Helen Hayes and Susan
Strasberg. Moyes also collaborated with Ustinov on the film script
for ``School for Scoundrels,'' which came out in 1960. From 1958 to
1962, she was an assistant editor for British Vogue and wrote the
``Shophound'' column for the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Moyes was married twice. Her marriage to John Moyes ended in
divorce in the 1960s. Her second marriage was to James Haszard, a
linguist who worked as an interpreter at the International Court of
Justice in the Hague and later at the International Monetary Fund
in Washington. He died in 1994. She is survived by a sister,
Barbara Nicholson of Hampshire, England.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959 Moyes wrote her first novel, ``Dead Men Don't Ski,'' on
a whim, introducing Chief Superintendent Henry Tibbet and Emmy, a
British sleuthing couple.
</P>
<P>
   In her subsequent mysteries Moyes stayed with that duo. When she
moved to the Virgin Islands in the late 1970s, her characters moved
with her. In ``Angel Death,'' the crime takes place at a resort
hotel on a Caribbean island.
</P>
<P>
   Moyes, a cat fanatic who was deeply involved a project to
control the breeding of feral cats in the Virgin Islands, also
wrote ``After All, They're Only Cats'' (1973) and ``How to Talk to
Your Cat'' in 1991, which the crime columnist for The New York
Times Book Review, Marilyn Stasio, called ``an affectionate little
book about cat behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthea Morton-Saner, Moyes' agent in London, said: ``She was one
of those women who are considerably more intelligent than they let
on. She wore her intellectual ability very lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   Moyes once confessed her writing secret, The Times of London
noted: she wrote, she said, ``for my own pleasure.''

 &HT;    Tigers ready to pounce on ACC
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEMSON, S.C. _ Here's the hot rumor floating around Clemson's
football camp: Linebacker Keith Adams, a first-team All-American
last season and the nation's leading tackler with 176 stops, will
line up in the offensive backfield on short-yardage situations this
season.
</P>
<P>
   There's a whole lot of stuff floating around Clemson these days
_ mostly lofty expectations _ which might even give pause to coach
Tommy Bowden's dad, Florida State coach Bobby Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   The Adams rumor is intriguing, and maybe not all that
far-fetched. After last season, when Bowden doubled the team's
victories from the year before and went to the Peach Bowl, why not?
The Tigers lost to Mississippi State to finish 6-6 after going 3-8
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything's possible,'' said junior center Kyle Young, dancing
around the Adams rumor. ``If he does carry the ball, I'd hate to be
the one hitting him.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, an academic All-American who will begin his third year as
a starter, grew up in the shadow of Memorial Stadium and has seen
Clemson games all his life. But even he stops short of predicting a
victory over Florida State and an 11-0 sweep by his Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going into every game thinking we can win,'' Young said.
``Certainly, 11-0 is our goal, but it's unrealistic. From a fan's
perspective, I think eight wins would be acceptable after winning
six last season. That's not my perspective; that's a fan's
perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   The small village of Clemson is abuzz with expectations these
days. In Charles &AMP; Al's Barber Shop, across the street from the
Keith Street Pub &AMP; Grill, the chatter has been non-stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have players that come in here, lots of students, lots of
people who live in town,'' co-owner Chris Leach said. ``Some have
expectations we'll win 'em all. I think most people would be happy
if we won just two _ Florida State and South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers were No. 17 in the Associated Press preseason poll
released last weekend. Bowden said his main goal is to finish the
year in the Top 25. ``That would be a logical step for this program
to take,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers were picked to finish second behind Florida State at
the ACC preseason meetings. Even that prediction concerned the head
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's kind of quick, picking us second,'' Bowden said. ``I'm
not trying to lower expectations; I'm just trying to be
realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bowden's realist approach often falls on deaf ears, even
those of his players
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I think we can win the ACC,'' Adams said. ``I'm not
content with second. Second is nice, but first is better. If I
don't make as many tackles this year as I made last year, I won't
be mad. If we don't get down to Miami (for the Orange Bowl), I'll
be mad.''
</P>
<P>
   The hype over Clemson isn't just fanaticism. The Tigers return
18 starters, including quarterback Woodrow Dantzler, who started
six games when Brandon Streeter was injured. Dantzler completed 55
percent of his passes for 1,506 yards, nine touchdowns and six
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Woody knows the system; he can run it,'' Young said. ``And
there's not a man on the team who would hesitate to follow him down
the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemson has embraced Bowden's wide-open style, which helped him
lead Tulane to an 11-0 regular-season record in 1998. The Tigers'
offense, earth-bound most of the 1990s, aired it out last season to
the tune of 246 yards passing a game and averaged 404 yards total
offense, third best in the ACC. Defensively, the Tigers employed an
attacking scheme and were third in total defense (338 ypg) and
second in the league in takeaways (26).
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offense is so fast-paced, our defense has to be, too,''
said Adams, who led the ACC with 16 sacks and 35 tackles for
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been setbacks. Clemson learned Tuesday that it will
be without starting tackle Akil Smith, who's out for the season
with a pulmonary embolism. But offensive line is still expected to
be a strong suit. Even without Smith, the Tigers return eight of
nine linemen who played last season.

JAAP MARAIS, IMPLACABLE PROPONENT OF APARTHEID, DIES AT 77 
</HEADLINE>
   By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Jaap Marais, a fiery orator and
right-wing political leader whose 30-year battle to uphold strict
government-enforced racial segregation continued even after
apartheid had ended, died Tuesday night. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was unknown, said Louis van der Schyff,
general secretary of Marais' Herstigte Nasionale Party, known as
the HNP.
</P>
<P>
   Marais' political life coincided with the rise and decline of
white right-wing politics here. In 1969, he abandoned the governing
National Party, in part, because it was considering integrating
sports. He helped found the HNP that year and became its leader in
1977, making his reputation as a firebrand who opposed the smallest
efforts to moderate apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   But as the years passed and his hair turned white and his
hearing dimmed, Marais watched his party's membership dwindle, his
popularity wane and the few remaining white right-wing parties lose
their relevance. In the election of 1999, the extreme right
garnered less than 1 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Still, friends say Marais never wavered from his beliefs, and
even in recent months, Marais was praying for the apocalypse, the
cataclysm that would lead to the collapse of the black government,
a disastrous civil war and the triumphant return of some form of
white rule.
</P>
<P>
   In his heart, his friends said, he was still the influential
politician who said in 1981 that he would show blacks ``who is the
boss in white South Africa.'' And as party leader, he continued to
work late into the night, writing articles, defending his ideas and
ignoring critics who dismissed him as an old man stuck in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say, `Things are different now and you must be
different,' but he never changed,'' Pieter Engelbrecht, the HNP's
administrative secretary, said in an interview. ``He talked very
much about the good ways of the old days and how he would like to
have them now.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he was never depressed. He was a fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought this government would come to a fall, and everyone
would take to the streets. Out of that turmoil and bloodshed, there
might be new borders. Countries would come out of that. Everybody
would go to some piece of land. You and your own would defend
yourself. That was his idea, that it might happen like that. He
thought maybe it might happen sooner than you think. He didn't know
his life would be that short.''
</P>
<P>
   Marais was born on Nov. 2, 1922, van der Schyff said. He joined
Parliament in the '50s and reached the height of his power in the
early '80s.
</P>
<P>
   The party was virtually wiped out in the elections in 1989. But
Marais refused to disband. He was a devoted disciple of Prime
Minister Hendrik Verwoerd, the architect of apartheid, and was
determined to fight against the prospect of black rule.
</P>
<P>
   He was also described as an intellectual who loved poetry,
particularly Eliot and Keats, and translated Shakespeare's ``Julius
Caesar'' into Afrikaans. Even as an older man, he took pains to
pore through all the local newspapers daily, including The Sowetan,
the newspaper directed at black readers.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Marais was writing an article about globalism
when he collapsed at home. He was taken to Eugene Marais Hospital
in Pretoria, where he died about an hour later. HNP officials said
doctors suspected that he died from internal bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are his wife, Marie; a son, Japie; and a daughter,
Marjorie.
</P>
<P>
   Friends said Marais never considered emigrating, even after
apartheid ended in 1994. Party officials would not say how many
members the party had, but political experts said the party had
been irrelevant for at least 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   That did not deter Marais, convinced that it was the country,
not he, that should change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party was never a success, but Marais was a very stubborn
man,'' said Z.B. du Toit, who edited the HNP newspaper from 1983 to
1987 and now works as a senior editor at Rapport, a newspaper
published in Afrikaans. ``He didn't have much of an inclination for
pragmatic, tactical politics, and that was his weakness.''

U.S. MOVES TO BLOCK A NEW FORM OF TAX SHELTER 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Treasury Department took another step Thursday
in its long-running effort to curb the use of tax shelters, acting
to shut down a sophisticated new tax-reduction technique that it
said was being marketed to corporations and wealthy individuals by
some of the big accounting firms.
</P>
<P>
   The technique, similar to another that was banned by the
Treasury and the IRS in December, was used to generate artificial
tax losses through investments in partnerships, Treasury officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   They said they had information suggesting that the shelter was
being offered to clients of at least one or two of the Big Five
accounting firms, although they said they were not sure which ones
and declined to single out any of them. They said they had no
information about how much revenue the government might have been
losing in the form of foregone tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   To clamp down on the shelter, Treasury officials said the IRS
would formally adopt a position that any tax losses generated by
the technique were artificial and would be disallowed. The action
can be taken administratively, and does not require legislation or
other congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said the action again
highlighted the need for broad legislation to crack down on
tax-avoidance efforts, which have grown in use as accounting firms
and tax lawyers comb through the tax code looking for wrinkles that
can be exploited to reduce tax liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Closing tax shelters is an essential element of tax fairness,
and to minimize the tax burden on American families,'' Summers said
in a conference call with reporters. ``This particular shelter
points up the need for more comprehensive approaches so we are in a
position to act preventively rather than, as in this case, after
the fact.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been pressing Congress for
several years to pass legislation to curb tax shelters. But
Republicans in Congress have balked, saying they are concerned that
any such wide-ranging legislation might inhibit legitimate tax
transactions in the name of stopping questionable practices.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury officials said that in the last few years they had
wiped out tax shelters that would have reduced tax revenues by as
much as $60 billion over the next 10 years. The federal government
expects to take in about $2 trillion in tax revenues this year.
</P>
<P>
   Providing sophisticated tax reduction advice to clients has
become a big business for accounting firms and lawyers. But it has
also provoked some unease among tax professionals, some of whom say
they are concerned that the techniques they are promoting in some
cases go over the line from legitimate tax-minimization efforts to
illegal tax-avoidance schemes.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction the Treasury described Thursday is based on a
similar technique known as a bond and options sales strategy, or
BOSS, which was barred by the IRS in December. The new variant,
dubbed ``son of BOSS'' by Treasury officials, appears to have been
developed by accountants just this year, they said. A senior
Treasury official said the government learned of the technique
through a tip provided to the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   The technique is built around differences in the ways that
investment partnerships account for the values of their assets and
liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In an example provided by a Treasury official, a taxpayer could
place into a partnership an asset and a liability that on their
face are of equal value. But the liability _ for example, a call
option to buy an asset at a specific price _ could be structured in
such a way that its value for tax purposes is considerably less
than the asset, giving the partnership an artificially high value.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership could then be sold for a nominal amount,
generating a paper loss that could be used to offset income from
other transactions.

REVERSAL BY CHINA LETS CHEN COMPETE FOR U.S.
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yueling Chen, the first Chinese woman to win an Olympic gold
medal in track and field, was granted a waiver by Chinese sports
officials Thursday to compete in race-walking for the United States
at the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, the Chinese Olympic Committee objected to Chen
competing for the Americans and it appeared that she would be
ineligible for Sydney. Although she gained her U.S. citizenship on
April 12, international Olympic rules require that an athlete wait
three years to compete after becoming naturalized in a new country.
</P>
<P>
   A waiver is often granted, but the Chinese initially refused.
The reason is not clear. Some officials believe Chinese track and
field officials resented the fact that a high-profile athlete such
as Chen came out of retirement in a new country. The first part of
her career ended after she won the 10-kilometer race walk at the
1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. She returned to
competition in 1998; last month, she finished second in the
20-kilometer walk at the U.S. track and field trials.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hybl, president of the USOC, decided to pursue the case.
Earlier this year, the Chinese granted waivers to three athletes to
compete in table tennis and badminton for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Hybl sent a fax to the Chinese Olympic committee,
saying that a waiver ``would be consistent with the spirit of
cooperation and international goodwill that exists between our two
nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Hybl then went one step further and placed phone calls to the
top two officials in the Chinese Olympic Committee, President Yuan
Weimin and Secretary-General Mingde Tu, said Mike Moran, a
spokesman for the USOC. The personal touch seemed to work. Thursday
the Chinese responded positively by fax, granting the waiver to
Chen.
</P>
<P>
   Officials speculated that Beijing was reluctant to anger the
Americans at a time when the Chinese were seeking to be hosts for
the 2008 Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, 27, who lives in Escondido, Calif., said Thursday in a
statement: ``I always knew that once the Chinese Olympic Committee
understood my situation clearly, they would change their mind. I
will endeavor to do my absolute best, after which I will be happy
to assist China in their 2008 Olympic bid.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   I really liked (beginitalic)The Replacements (enditalic)the
first time I saw it - when it was called (beginitalic)The Longest
Yard(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it was (beginitalic)Major League(enditalic). Or
(beginitalic)Necessary Roughness(enditalic). Or any of a dozen
sports movies that feature a ragtag band of misfits who succeed
against all odds.
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, (beginitalic)The Replacements (enditalic)lives
up to its name. It's essentially a collection of spare parts from
other movies, a cheesy knockoff without a whit of creativity.
</P>
<P>
   The film stars Keanu Reeves as a quarterback who blew the big
college game but gets called back to action after NFL players go on
strike. The movie wastes no time in trotting out every sports movie
stereotype and overused scene.
</P>
<P>
   The replacement team (the fictional Washington Sentinels),
includes the usual gang of underdogs we see in every movie: the
psycho linebacker, the overweight sumo wrestler, the wisecracking
receiver with bad hands, the oddball kicker, the gun-toting
gangster and the Bible-thumping preacher.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget the platitude-spewing coach, played by Gene
Hackman. He becomes a parody of himself about halfway through,
mostly because he's stuck reading dialogue left over from
(beginitalic)Hoosiers(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   You have to wonder why Warner Bros. made this turkey at all,
especially since the last NFL strike was in 1987. You get the idea
the script was moldering on a shelf somewhere, right next to the
(beginitalic)Rocky VI (enditalic)screenplay. Whoops, I guess that's
a bad example.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, its anti-union message finds really great timing,
given the current actors' strike in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the story, which is simply a collection of scenes
from other sports movies. There's the initial goofy practice
sequence, the argument in the cafeteria, the contemplative moment
in the empty stadium, the bar brawl, the jail cell dance number and
big locker room speech.
</P>
<P>
   There are some laughs here and there, but they mostly dry up in
the second half, when the movie just pounds out the formula.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)The Replacements (enditalic)also features John
Madden and Pat Summerall, real-life football announcers who read
their lines with all the enthusiasm of Soviet newscasters. Madden's
performance is especially stilted, sounding much like the
mix-and-match one-liners he records for his ubiquitous football
video games.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, the movie doesn't even get its football right.
Since when does the season end on Thanksgiving? Since when do the
cheerleaders go on strike with the players? Since when do teams
carry only one quarterback?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's only a movie, but it's certainly likely to attract
football fans, who will spot the obvious flaws, such as skinny
Reeves shucking off 250-pound linebackers on his way to the end
zone.
</P>
<P>
   At the screening I attended, the film broke with about 20
minutes left in the movie. That gave the audience time to guess at
the ending.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, we all guessed right.

THOMPSON AND TORRES QUALIFY FOR SYDNEY IN NEW BODYSUITS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ They entered the pool looking more like speed
skaters than swimmers, wearing bodysuits from neck to ankle, for
the first big showdown at the U.S. Olympic trials in the women's
100-meter butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   When the swimmers splashed to the finish line, Jenny Thompson
had won her 24th national championship, touching first in 57.78
seconds, ahead of Dara Torres, who took second in 57.86. The
winning time was not a national record, much less a world record,
but Thompson, 27, could take great satisfaction in knowing that she
had qualified in an individual event for the 2000 Summer Games next
month in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, she failed to taper her training properly,
developed insomnia from stress and did not qualify for the Atlanta
Olympics in any individual event. She is tied with Bonnie Blair for
the most gold medals won by an American woman _ five _ but all of
her victories have come in relays. Next month, at Sydney, she will
get another chance to win an individual event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a step along the way; my real goal is to win in Sydney,''
Thompson said. ``This is a huge part of it. There's a lot of
anxiety. There's such relief and happiness that I get this
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Finishing second was no less an impressive achievement for
Torres, the holder of two gold medals in Olympic relays who
returned to competitive swimming last year after a seven-year
layoff. She fell short of the American record of 57.58 that she set
on Wednesday in the preliminaries, but, at 33, Torres will become
the first American swimmer to compete in four different Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's 100-meter breast-stroke, Ed Moses of Burke, Va.,
set an American record of 1:00.54, edging Pat Calhoun, who took
second in 1:01.09.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson and Torres are both coached by Richard Quick at
Stanford University. They now train at different times. Torres and
Thompson are seeking Olympic gold medals in the same events _ the
100 butterfly and the 50 and 100-meter freestyle _ which has
created a natural tension between two athletes with voracious
appetites for winning.
</P>
<P>
   As alike as they are in talent, the swimmers are different in
personality. Torres is an ebullient beauty who grew up in Beverly
Hills, Calif. Thompson, who grew up in Dover, N.H., is a model of
Yankee circumspection. She is also studious and is headed for
medical school at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Thompson reached 50 meters six hundredths of a second
behind Torres, but overtook her down the homestretch. Afterward,
she and Torres hugged and slapped hands. In Sydney, they will be
chasing the world record of 56.64 seconds set on July 22 by Inge de
Bruijn of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   How did Torres recover so much speed after coming out of
retirement?
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Quick publicly questioned the legitimacy of
three gold medals won by the Irish swimmer Michelle Smith. His
suspicions proved correct last year when she was banned for spiking
a drug test with alcohol, having previously tested positive for
androstenedione, a steroid. Given the demonstrated cheating over
the last three decades by East German, Chinese and American
athletes, any remarkable performance by female swimmers brings
immediate suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   And now Torres, too, has sprinted to the top after a seven-year
layoff, cut and ripped and chiseled at 5-foot-11, 160 pounds. Her
best time in the 100 butterfly before this year was 1:00.21. Asked
how he could convince observers that her performances are
legitimate, Quick said, ``If I ever thought there was an athlete of
mine possibly cheating, I wouldn't coach them for one more
second.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres, who has never failed a drug test, performs an exhaustive
dry-land regimen of flexibility and weight training. The new
hydromatic suits are said to increase speed by up to 3 percent.
Quick added, ``I'd like to think we're on the cutting edge of what
can be done nutritionally and with supplements. You can achieve, it
just takes longer, what a steroid athlete achieves.''
</P>
<P>
   For several months, Torres and Thompson have been working with
Glen Luepnitz, who holds a doctorate in immunology and nutrition
and operates a cancer clinic in Austin, Texas. With a revolutionary
approach to diet, Luepnitz said, the swimmers can counter
competitors who use such banned substances as human growth hormone
and EPO _ synthetic versions of hormones that exist naturally, are
believed to be widely used and for which tests have not been
implemented.
</P>
<P>
   ``People see Dara and say the only way her body can get that way
is that she must be on drugs,'' Luepnitz said. ``I can't tell you
how furious that makes me.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who is 5-11, 160, and Torres eat six meals a day, have
their blood drawn and analyzed every two weeks and adhere to a
precise intake of supplements and amino acids that involves taking
as many as 20 pills a day, Luepnitz said. Small amounts of
creatine, the legal but controversial muscle enhancer, are also
used, he said, along with 100 grams of additional protein daily to
build musculature. Their diet consists heavily of vegetables, he
said, while starches are reduced to minimize the buildup of
subcutaneous fat.
</P>
<P>
   Amino acids that stimulate natural production of growth hormone
allow the athletes to train harder and longer and recover more
quickly, Luepnitz said. Iron supplements, amino acids, minerals and
B-complex vitamins aid in increasing red blood cell levels, legally
simulating the illicit use of the endurance drug EPO by athletes
who cheat, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can beat the cheaters without cheating,'' Luepnitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists cautioned that there have been few peer-review
studies on the effect of supplements and amino acids in enhancing
the performance of elite athletes. ``There are absolutely no
studies looking at 20 to 25 things taken together,'' said Dr. Gary
Green, an internist at UCLA who is chairman of the National
Collegiate Athletic Association's drug-testing program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be skeptical,'' Green added. ``My opinion is that
these results are achieved through hard work and training and
technique more than anything else.''

NASA will launch two rovers to Mars By MARK CARREAU 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In a bid to accelerate its recovery from back-to-back
failures, NASA announced Thursday that it will launch two golf
cart-sized robotic rovers instead of one to Mars in mid-2003.
</P>
<P>
   The $600 million salvo of identical space probes will head for a
pair of yet-to-be-selected basins near the Martian equator in
search of evidence that water was once abundant on the now arid
planet.
</P>
<P>
   Such a finding would point the way for future missions designed
to determine whether the Red Planet now harbors some form of life
or did billions of years ago, when, experts believe, the Red Planet
was warmer and wetter.
</P>
<P>
   Moisture quickly evaporates in the frigid, thin atmosphere over
the barren terrain of Mars, a transformation that is little
understood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are returning to Mars, this time with force,'' said Scott
Hubbard, NASA's recently appointed Mars program manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millions of miles away, the Red Planet beckons to us with that
age-old mystery of whether life ever formed there. We think this
twin rover mission will allow us to move toward and answer to that
question.''
</P>
<P>
   The space agency's long-term strategy to address the issue was
derailed with the losses of its Mars Polar Lander in December and
Mars Climate Orbiter in September.
</P>
<P>
   A sweeping investigation determined that NASA had mismanaged and
underfunded the effort, cutting corners in pre-launch testing of
the spacecraft and the training of its ground personnel.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of last year's losses, NASA authorized a single
mission launch next year, a Mars orbiter. The decision effectively
combined the funding and personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Then in late June, the space agency announced that it would
launch one and possibly two landers to Mars in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Ed Weiler, NASA's associate administrator for space
science, disclosed that initially he favored just one mission.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, Hubbard and others persuaded him that for half
of the $400 million cost to develop the first probe, NASA could
launch a second. The $600 million estimate includes two spacecraft,
a pair of Delta 2 rocket launches and science costs.
</P>
<P>
   Lifting off on May 22 and June 4, the two probes would reach
their destinations on Jan. 2 and 20, 2004.
</P>
<P>
   In response to December's Polar Lander failure, both rovers will
land with parachutes and huge air bags, a strategy that worked
successfully on July 2, 1997, with the Mars Pathfinder and its
small Sojourner rover.

WILL QUANN REPLACE BEARD AS SWIMMING'S SWEETHEART?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Megan Quann is in innocence's womb right now,
luxuriating in its warmth. She's asserting her presence and every
time she kicks, U.S. Swimming smiles like a proud parent.
</P>
<P>
   Stardom's gestation period is a glorious time but what comes
next can be a shock to the system. The 16-year-old breaststroker is
steadily moving into position, clearing out of her comfort zone; as
soon as today she could be delivered into a cold, crazy world.
</P>
<P>
   If Quann doesn't scream and cry at the moment she becomes the
newest little sister of the U.S. Olympic swimming team, well,
chances are good she will later.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday in the preliminaries, Quann lowered her American
record in the 100-meter breaststroke for the fourth time in eight
months, to 1 minute, 7.12 seconds, then announced she has South
African Penny Heyns' world record (1:06.52) squarely in her sights.
She went half a second slower in the semifinals but was the top
finisher. Amanda Beard, who held the American record before Quann,
was fifth in the semis.
</P>
<P>
   Beard was the pacesetter, no matter what the times say. Before
Quann, Beard was the breaststroke's short-order cook, serving up
sizzling swims as requested. In Atlanta she showed a fearlessness
that belied her youth and a generation of kids watching at home
were emboldened.
</P>
<P>
   It's much more difficult for Beard now; her semifinal time of
1.09.01 was about one second slower than her American record
clocking of 1:08.09 in Atlanta in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Beard is 18 years old and _ dare we say it? _ grown up. It seems
inconceivable, we know, that the gangly, giggly, guileless girl who
carried a teddy bear around the deck like a security blanket at the
Trials four years ago now has a figure and a boyfriend and a
pierced tongue and a world-weary wariness.
</P>
<P>
   She confidently held court with reporters at the Indiana
University-Purdue University Natatorium four years ago but in the
same place on Thursday she had only a scattered audience. Quann,
standing nearby, was the one fielding softball questions rapid-fire
as if she were inside a batting cage.
</P>
<P>
   Quann was so relaxed, she could have been at a neighborhood
swimming party, not a swimming coronation. Beard glanced in Quann's
direction and smiled. She could have been looking at a photograph
of herself in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was much more nonchalant about things then,'' she said.
``Everything just rolled off my back. I wasn't paying attention to
things as much as I am now.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked Beard if she had any advice for Quann, her
would-be successor as America's sweetheart. ``Just to have fun,''
Beard said. ``To have fun is the only way to avoid falling in the
slump.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahh, yes, the dreaded sweetheart slump. It struck Beard before
the shine was off her two Olympic gold medals and silver medal from
the Atlanta Games. After the novelty of her celebrity wore off,
Beard found all the attention suffocating. She was pulled in so
many different directions she lost her way.
</P>
<P>
   All of the sudden she was a commodity, not just a high school
co-ed. Oprah Winfrey wanted to talk to her; Dennis Rodman called to
have lunch with her; Robin Williams requested her as a celebrity
triathlon teammate; the family at the next table at a restaurant
had to have her autograph.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the people in the stands at all her swim meets;
Beard felt sure she let them down if she didn't set an American
record every time she raced.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all those people watching you at the Olympics, you put a
lot more pressure on yourself to live up to everybody's
expectations,'' Beard said. ``Then you think they expect you to
swim the way you did in the Olympics every time you get in the
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Beard started to rebel against the sport that was making her
life so miserable. She began missing workouts for weak reasons in
the fall of 1996 and was almost relieved when ankle and wrist
injuries in 1997 gave her the excuse she needed to escape for three
months from the stress that swimming had become.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you start taking the sport too seriously, you put too
much pressure on yourself,'' said Beard, who will begin her
sophomore year at Arizona immediately after these Trials.
</P>
<P>
   The collegiate environment rekindled Beard's love for the sport.
Beard is having fun again, just like in 1996. Any other
similarities between the swimmer, then and now, are merely
cosmetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really want to know who that person was carrying around that
teddy bear,'' Beard said, grinning.
</P>
<P>
   She might want to ask Quann. &QL;

BUCHANAN NUDGES REFORM PARTY TO THE RIGHT 
 

</HEADLINE>
 PARTY-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Calling for a rebirth of morality in
America, Pat Buchanan began nudging the Reform Party to the right
Thursday after taking control of the party's national convention
hall and turning away opponents to his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Exhorting his supporters to ``build a party that will set about
making America a godly nation again,'' the three-time Republican
presidential candidate urged his Reform Party opponents to ``give
it up'' and go home.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, hundreds of party members loyal to founder Ross Perot
formally opened their own convention nearby, intent on nominating
John Hagelin, a little-known physicist and mediation-advocate who
already is running for president under the banner of the Natural
Law Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the main theater, this is the Reform Party
convention,'' Hagelin said after leading the anti-Buchanan forces
to a nearby meeting facility. ``We're going to conduct the Reform
Party convention. Pat Buchanan is conducting the Buchanan
convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin lauded his Reform Party allies, urging them to broaden
their appeal. ``The party has fallen, under the Buchanan candidacy,
to a low in popular support,'' Hagelin said.
</P>
<P>
   The best shot of reclaiming the party, Hagelin said, ``is not
through a message of exclusivity and intolerance, not through
embroiling ourselves in divisive social issues, but by putting
forward an inclusive message and a broad-based platform of common
sense reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   With each faction claiming to be the legitimate Reform Party
convention, the outcome of the Buchanan-Hagelin battle will be
handed to the Federal Elections Commission. The six-member
commission must vote within 10 days after it is asked over which
candidate is entitled to $12.6 million in federal campaign funds
due the party's presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, an attorney for Hagelin's supporters on Thursday
petitioned the commissioners _ three Democrats and three
Republicans _ not to award the money to Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan was nonplussed. ``They came out here with this little
prank in mind,'' the candidate told reporters in Long Beach, Calif.
``The only way they can beat us is to impede us,'' he said. ``They
ought to give it up. We've won this fair and square.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's comments came as he issued a statement that carries
the faint echo of his call for a cultural and religious war for the
nation's soul during the 1992 Republican convention in Houston, a
message that branded the GOP that year as intolerant and
mean-spirited.
</P>
<P>
   The ``statement of personal beliefs'' clearly signals Buchanan's
intent to break with the goals outlined in the Reform Party
platform, a document that is mostly silent on social issues. The
platform, crafted four years ago by Perot and his top lieutenants,
instead focuses on campaign finance reform and overhauling
government regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the Reform Party platform is silent on what have come to
be called the social, cultural and moral issues, I do not believe
presidential candidates can remain silent,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   The former television commentator decried ``rampant
homosexuality,'' ``Internet pornography,'' ``gambling houses,'' and
what he characterized as a ``polluted'' popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Americans today believe their country, in moral terms, is
headed in the wrong direction,'' Buchanan said, promising to
appoint only anti-abortion judges to the Supreme Court, to boot
gays from the military and ``make America God's Country again.'' &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Hillary Rodham Clinton tries to rebut the favorite
attack line of her opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, that she has never
held public office and has no record, she and her husband are
aggressively trying to reverse the reclusive image that she
projected after her failure on health care reform.
</P>
<P>
   Now Mrs. Clinton says that rather than retreating, as the White
House maintained, she was in fact working hard behind the scenes
proposing, drafting and lobbying for certain legislation, budget
appropriations and administration policies.
</P>
<P>
   Her record, she said, includes work on a major Clinton
administration child-care initiative, a huge federal-state
children's health insurance program, adoption and foster care bills
and foreign aid appropriations for small loans overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record's there, and what I did is sort of self-evident I
think, but it may come as new information to a lot of people,''
Mrs. Clinton said in a recent interview, acknowledging the
contradiction between the years of stressing more traditional first
lady duties and the role she claims now.
</P>
<P>
   The president joined in this week at a fund-raising dinner for
his wife, listing various issues and saying, ``She basically had an
unprecedented level of activity in her present position over the
last eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Mrs. Clinton acknowledged that she had learned
to take a more subtle approach in pushing her projects because of
the health care debacle in 1994, a humiliating defeat for the
administration that banished her from a public policy role next to
her husband. But when she was asked if, by speaking so openly, she
might alienate voters disturbed by her deep involvement in her
husband's administration, she retorted: ``Well, that's why you
never knew about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed later about whether her new descriptions of acting as,
in essence, a senior presidential adviser went beyond the job of
first lady, Mrs. Clinton laughed out loud and said: ``I'm not going
to have it any more. And the next first lady doesn't have to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's campaign dismissed Mrs. Clinton's efforts to establish a
legislative history. ``If she were running in Massachusetts, she'd
take credit for the Boston Tea Party,'' said Dan McLagan, the
congressman's chief spokesman. ``The bottom line is, she's never
lifted a finger for New York and is now trying to create an
imaginary record.''
</P>
<P>
   Agency heads, other administration officials, Democrats and some
Republicans on Capitol Hill generally confirm Mrs. Clinton's
assertions, but say that her role was kept quiet to avoid the kind
of vilification she had attracted over her central part in health
care policy. As Mrs. Clinton put it: ``People were saying, `We
don't care if you exercise influence as long as we don't know about
it.''' In any case, she said, ``I wasn't interested in getting
credit for these things.''
</P>
<P>
   No longer does she consider that tactic helpful to her political
ambitions. ``If somebody's going to say, `Well, she's never done
anything,''' Mrs. Clinton said, ``I'm going to say, `Well, you
know, I want to tell you what I did, and you can make your own
judgments.' I think that's a fair and accurate way to have somebody
evaluate what I could do in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton described her White House issues staff, which has
offices in both the West Wing and the old Executive Office
Building, ``as part of the domestic policy operation in the White
House.'' Although she also has a small staff in the East Wing to
handle first lady social responsibilities, Mrs. Clinton said that
``I realized very soon that, you know, if I had some first lady
staff over here, I wouldn't be able to get things done.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that she and her policy staff had the responsibility
for pushing legislation and programs that would benefit children,
women and health care _ issues that have concerned her, she said,
for the last 30 years. Several of Mrs. Clinton's staff had the
title of assistant to the president and were officially on the
staff of Bruce Reed, but generally reported to the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's Democratic supporters on Capitol Hill echo her
claims. ``Her office and her in particular were key allies of ours
and the progressives in the Senate who were trying to pursue an
agenda in the areas of children, education, health care and job
training,'' said Nick Littlefield, who worked with Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy of Massachusetts and was the staff director to the Health,
Education and Labor Committee at the time. He added that ``once we
discovered that Mrs. Clinton was running a public advocacy
organization inside the White House, it followed automatically that
we would start talking to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Although much of Mrs. Clinton's work at the White House was in
fact the traditional advocacy and speechmaking of modern first
ladies _ and also of Eleanor Roosevelt, her role model _ Mrs.
Clinton said that on many issues she was directly involved in the
business of government.
</P>
<P>
   She said, for example, that the Clinton administration program
to guarantee free immunizations for poor and uninsured children,
passed in 1993, ``was basically drafted in my office under my
supervision.'' The program was a precursor to health care and its
policy was largely rejected by Congress, but the Clinton
administration did get $585 million for vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton also said that her staff had a large part in the
development of the Corporation for National Service, the Clinton
administration's domestic version of the peace corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hired Shirley Sagawa, who had been Ted Kennedy's person on
national service, and so basically it was my staff that was
involved in drafting that legislation,'' she said. Eli J. Segal,
the first chief executive of the Corporation for National Service
and the 1992 Clinton campaign chief of staff, called the first
lady's assertion ``100 percent correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Among her other accomplishments, Mrs. Clinton said she helped to
initiate and promote the Children's Health Insurance Program,
created by Congress in 1997 to provide $24 billion over five years
to states to insure children.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a one-woman army inside the White House to get this
done,'' said Littlefield. He said that Kennedy, who was the major
force behind the bill, enlisted Mrs. Clinton's help in the spring
of 1997 when the president became ``skittish'' about the program.
Littlefield said the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, was
threatening that it was a ``deal buster'' on the balanced budget
agreement that he and President Clinton had reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point we went to Mrs. Clinton and said, `You've got to
get the president to come around on this thing,''' Littlefield
said. ``And she said, `Absolutely.' And we very quickly noticed a
change. The president was very much on board.''

SALMON IS A STEADY STAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Forgive Tim Salmon if he's not used to this
type of thing.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon had just hit career home run No.222 Wednesday night in
the sixth inning off Red Sox pitcher Jeff Fassero. The right
fielder circled the bases, trotted into the dugout and sat down.
</P>
<P>
   But the normally docile Edison Field crowd stood and cheered.
</P>
<P>
   And cheered.
</P>
<P>
   And cheered.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after several minutes as the Red Sox were making a
pitching change, Salmon was prodded by his teammates to take a
curtain call. He did.
</P>
<P>
   ``That surprised me,'' said Salmon, who will take a career-best
17-game hitting streak into tonight's game against the Yankees.
``Because I only tied the record, I didn't break it. Maybe after
the next one I'll go to the top step of the dugout.''
</P>
<P>
   Like nearly all athletes who set records, Salmon says he'll
appreciate his accomplishment more when he is finished playing. But
he admitted that tying a mark held by Brian Downing has some
special meaning to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think about Brian Downing and think about all the
Angels greats, like Downing, Nolan Ryan and Chuck Finley, it's nice
to be mentioned in that light,'' he said. ``You think about Brian
Downing and the type of player he was _ a tough, hard-nosed,
grind-it-out type of player.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Salmon's consistency that has put him on top of the home
run list along with Downing. He has hit 25 or more home runs in six
seasons, and 20 or more in seven of eight seasons. He ranks among
the Angels' all-time leaders in batting average, hits, games, total
bases, extra-base hits, at-bats, doubles, RBI and runs.
</P>
<P>
   For all he's done, he's never made an All-Star team. Part of the
reason for that is his unassuming personality. It's a quality of a
player who is so consistent he is often overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mo Vaughn is a superstar,'' Salmon said. ``Darin Erstad is a
rising superstar. We've got all kinds of young phenoms. I'm kind of
the steady-Eddie, plugging along the whole time.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't gone unnoticed by those who watch the Angels closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides being a very talented and obviously very popular
player,'' manager Mike Scioscia said, ``he plays hard, he plays
hurt and is probably the most consistent Angel ever to play. And
Angels fans recognize that.''
</P>
<P>
   His recent hot streak has his average to a more Salmon-like
.296. But he had to overcome a slow first half to get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm swinging the bat decent and have a good idea what I'm
trying to do up there,'' he said. ``I wish I could have started
doing this in April.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bench coach) Joe Maddon told me all year, `Wait until Tim
Salmon gets hot. You're not going to see anybody better,'''
Scioscia said. ``I hope he carries it the rest of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   RARE SLUMP: Erstad is going through his biggest _ and only _
slump of the season, hitting just .177 (11 for 62) in his past 14
games, his average falling from .382 to .357.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ersty's going to be fine,'' Scioscia said. ``He's showing
signs of having a much better approach. He's working out some
mechanical flaws that crept into his swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been so consistent for so long, he hits a little bump in
the road and every says `What's wrong?' It happens to everyone.'' &QL;

 NEW YORK: on board.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She also said she helped to draft and lobbied for bills on
adoption and foster care. It was late on a Sunday near the end of
the 1997 congressional session that Rep. Dave Camp, a conservative
Michigan Republican who was frantically negotiating to save an
adoption bill, got a call in the House cloakroom from Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 9:30 or 10 at night,'' Camp recalled. ``I thought only
congressional night owls did that. I was surprised. You know,
you're working wearily on these things, and you're worrying whether
this is doing any good.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton gave him a pep talk, Camp said, and told him the
bill was worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Today, although Camp is enthusiastically supporting Lazio, Mrs.
Clinton's opponent in the Senate race in New York, he admits that
the first lady's intervention was important. ``I want to be
honest,'' he said. ``It was helpful to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, an administration priority designed to speed up the
adoption of children in foster care, had been heavily promoted by
Mrs. Clinton on Capitol Hill. Four days after her call, it passed
the House and Senate and was soon signed into law by the president.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, Mrs. Clinton and her White House staff began
working with the Department of Health and Human Services on a new,
related bill to provide more government help to 18-year-olds who
age out of foster care. One version of that bill was virtually
drafted in Mrs. Clinton's office, according to Rep. Ben Cardin, the
Democrat who sponsored it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the first lady's priority, and she developed the
administration's legislation,'' Cardin said. ``And pretty much what
was passed by Congress was what the administration proposed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's role, however, is disputed by Republicans, who
say they knew nothing about it. ``I wrote the bill,'' said Rep.
Nancy Johnson of Connecticut, the Republican sponsor who introduced
her own version in the House. Rep. Tom DeLay, a foster parent and
the aggressive anti-Clinton House majority whip who pushed the
bill, said that if Mrs. Clinton was involved, ``I never saw it.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she oversaw and helped develop a $21 billion White
House initiative on child care. Reed, the presidential adviser,
said that he, Mrs. Clinton and others at the White House worked
with other agencies of the government to develop the package of
programs, culminating in a December 1997 meeting with agency heads
``that the first lady chaired.'' Present at the meeting, Reed said,
were Robert Rubin, then the secretary of the Treasury, and Donna
Shalala, the secretary of the Department of Health and Human
Services. So far, Congress has given the Clinton administration a
small part of what it requested.
</P>
<P>
   She also took credit for helping to procure $140 million
annually in the foreign aid budget for micro-credit, or
small-enterprise loans, to help poor women around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did at her behest was to negotiate a micro-enterprise
initiative with Congress,'' said J. Brian Atwood, who was the
administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development at
the time, 1997, when Mrs. Clinton announced the initiative in a
speech on Capitol Hill. ``The Congress was very interested in it,
but I think she clearly was a catalyst for doing as much.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said she also sparked interest in micro-credit programs
among treasury officials. ``It isn't that she came out of the White
House and said `Do this, do that,''' said Rubin. But he said that
after Mrs. Clinton saw a successful bank for poor women in India,
she spoke to him about importing the methods to this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people were unaware of micro-credit,'' he said.
``But she really brought the issue to life, and gave it energy. And
she did it by persuading everybody else what she had seen. What
Hillary did was to get the federal government involved.''
</P>
<P>
   These are other initiatives that Mrs. Clinton lists as
accomplishments:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Save America's Treasures'' has raised $100 to $200 million
in public and private money to help preserve 593 designated
``treasures,'' among them the homes of Edith Wharton in
Massachusetts and Harriet Tubman in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   _ She says she pushed the administration into expanding Medicare
coverage, since January 1998, to pay for annual mammograms for
Medicare patients age 40 and over. Previously Medicare covered
mammograms every other year.
</P>
<P>
   _ She helped procure $40 million in government aid for the
training of pediatricians at children's hospitals. ``I finally got
it into the president's budget,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``And I think
I got it into the budget for '99, if I'm right. Then we had to make
sure that it stayed in the budget.''
</P>
<P>
   David S. Weiner, the chief executive of Boston Children's
Hospital and a leader of the hospital lobbying group that worked
with Mrs. Clinton to get the money, said that ``there were many
people involved, but without her initial championing we would have
been simply another voice in the wilderness.'' He added that ``she
really helped our group of institutions strategically, and she
advised us to who the key legislators were that we needed to
connect with.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview this month, Mrs. Clinton also said that after
the painful health care defeat, she learned more subtle approaches
to dealing with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that you get total congressional buy-in from
the very beginning,'' she said, ``and not just lip service about
the process.'' She explained: ``We thought we were doing what the
leadership wanted us to do when it came to health care. But we
assumed too much. We should have had them do much more of the
involved work. They basically said, `We can't figure out how to do
this ourselves, so you go do it.' And we didn't understand that at
that moment we should have said: `Well, no, that's not the way it's
going to work. We'll help you do what you want to do, you know,'
even if it was our idea.''
</P>
<P>
   On the subsequent adoption and foster care bills, Mrs. Clinton
said: ``You had to go around planting ideas with people. You had to
go around sort of eliciting interest, and then saying, `What a good
idea. We might be interested.'''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``We always tried to create the opportunity for it to
be their idea, their legislation, their name on it. We'd push it,
we'd help draft it, we'd lobby it, I'd do what I needed to do. But
it needed to be a real partnership in order to be successful.''

   NORTHERN IRELAND: NO OBJECTIONS TO A PARADE
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the main Catholic neighborhood of Londonderry have
dropped objections to a parade by 30,000 Protestants through the
city on Saturday after rare direct talks between the rival
communities produced agreements on limiting routes and reducing the
police presence. Under an agreement hailed as a model for settling
disputes during the so-called summer marching season, the Bogside
Residents Association will not protest the annual parade by the
Apprentice Boys organization celebrating the relief of the city in
1689 from the siege by the forces of the Catholic King James II.

   BOSNIA: RULING AGAINST FORMER LEADER
</P>
<P>
   A group of Bosnian women and children won a $745 million
judgment against Radovan Karadzic in a Manhattan federal court.
Jurors awarded the money after the judge entered a default judgment
against Karadzic, the former Bosnian Serb leader, who has been
indicted by the international war crimes tribunal and is believed
to be in Bosnia. The lawyer for the women said she would seek to
recover the money from any of Karadzic's assets that could be
found.

   URUGUAY: INQUIRY INTO DISAPPEARANCES
</P>
<P>
   A peace commission set up by President Jorge Batlle began an
effort to find information on scores of people who disappeared
while the country was ruled by a military dictatorship between 1973
and 1984. Human rights groups want information on 180 missing
people, 30 of whom disappeared in Uruguay and 150 more in
Argentina, Chile and Paraguay under a joint military government
program known as Operation Condor.

   ERITREA, ETHIOPIA: U.N. PEACEKEEPERS URGED
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan has recommended a 4,200-strong U.N.
peacekeeping force to police the border between Eritrea and
Ethiopia following a peace treaty signed in June by the two
countries. Two years of intermittent war along the border has cost
tens of thousands of lives.

   ZIMBABWE: FARMERS DROP LAWSUITS
</P>
<P>
   The Commercial Farmers Union, which represents the country's
4,000 white farmers, said it was withdrawing its lawsuits against
the government in hopes that the move would pave the way for more
amicable negotiations on land redistribution. The farmers union had
filed suits against the government for failing to remove black
squatters, and officials promptly took a tougher line against the
farmers.

   SRI LANKA: A LEADER STEPS DOWN
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike _ who became the world's
first woman to be a prime minister in 1960 after her husband was
assassinated _ retired from the largely ceremonial position at age
84 because of ill health. Her daughter, Chandrika Kumaratunga, is
president of the country and its real power. Bandaranaike, who has
been unable to walk for years, said she wanted to make way for a
younger person who could campaign actively for the party in
national elections.

   SRI LANKA: REBEL BASE DESTROYED
</P>
<P>
   The government said its new fighter aircraft destroyed a
military base of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, separatist

Chalai on the Jaffna peninsula. The rebels fired surface-to-air
missiles, but did not hit the air force jet fighters, the
government said.

   China executed four men, including a Taiwanese fishing boat

Counterfeit bank notes have been a growing problem, and execution
is common for crimes the government deems serious. But executing

FUAD SERAG EDDIN, 89, FIGURE IN EGYPTIAN POLITICS FOR 50 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ Fuad Serag Eddin, a mainstay of Egyptian politics
who fought British colonial rule before the 1952 revolution and
headed the largest opposition party, the Wafd, against successive
Egyptian governments, died Aug. 9 after having suffered a heart
attack in a hospital here. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 50 years, Serag Eddin personified the Wafd Party _
which has been permitted, then banned and then licensed again _
since it began in 1919. His own career, interrupted by a prison
term as a dissident, mirrored his party's.
</P>
<P>
   He was born to a family that held vast cotton-growing estates in
the Nile Delta region on Nov. 2, 1910. Serag Eddin earned a law
degree from King Fouad University, now Cairo University, in 1930
and became an assistant prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected to Parliament in 1936, its youngest member at the
time. In 1948, he won a Senate seat. Serag Eddin was a minister in
every government of Egypt's last monarchs, beginning in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Wafd since 1936, he became active in the
movement to end British control over the country and its kings. As
interior minister in 1952, he ordered the Egyptian police to fire
their last bullets at British tanks that were invading the Ismailia
governate. The battle, on Jan. 25, is commemorated each year in
Egypt as the Day of the Police.
</P>
<P>
   But Serag Eddin's service to the monarchy made him suspect after
the revolution led by Gamal Abdel Nasser and his fellow army
officers. As with other rich families, the Serag Eddin family lost
many of its holdings to nationalization. Serag Eddin was sentenced
by a revolutionary court to 15 years in prison, but was released
after having served three years.
</P>
<P>
   The Wafd Party, like all other political groups, was banned by
Nasser after the Egyptian republic had been established. Serag
Eddin revived the party, as the New Wafd, in 1978, in a period of
liberalization under President Anwar Sadat. But after quarrels with
Sadat, Serag Eddin quickly suspended its operations.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the men remained tense and then worsened,
after the signing of the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, which Serag
Eddin opposed. In early 1981, he was imprisoned in a crackdown on
dissent, being released after Sadat's assassination in October
1981. Serag Eddin then started a long court battle to revive the
party.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, he won permission to operate the Wafd, and it has since
then been the second largest party, after the National Democratic
Party, with five seats in the People's Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Serag Eddin was still head of the party and chairman of the
board of the party newspaper at his death. The Wafd, under his
leadership, fiercely opposed normalizing relations with Israel. In
more recent years, it called for political reform, while constantly
attacking government policies and ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are Serag Eddin's brother, Yassin, the deputy leader
of the Wafd and a member of Parliament; two daughters, Naela and
Faiza; and five grandchildren, Fouad Badrawi, also a Wafd member of
Parliament; Abdel Aziz Badrawi, Hassan Badrawi, Nevine Badrawi and
Tarek al-Kazemy.

   Verizon Said to Yield on Key Issue
</P>
<P>
   In a development that could hasten the end of the strike by more
than 86,000 employees of Verizon Communications, the company and
its unions resolved an issue at the heart of their dispute
Thursday, people close to the talks said. Verizon will make it
easier for the unions to organize some of the employees currently
in non-union jobs in the company's wireless division. Although
there are other issues still to be resolved, and labor experts said
it remained unclear whether the wireless workers would want to join
a union, the strike's key sticking point has been settled.

   Firestone Customers Find Few New Tires Available
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Wednesday that millions of Firestone tires were
being recalled sent panicked customers rushing to service centers
Thursday only to be told, in many cases, that they would have to
wait more than a year for replacements. The recall began in
Southern and Western states and will be expanded across the country
over the next 18 months. The wait for new tires will be longest
outside the Southern and Western states, where intense heat is
suspected of causing treads to separate from tires. The staggered
replacement plan has alarmed consumer advocates as well as vehicle
owners.

   SEC Approves Regulation To End Selective Disclosure
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission approved a rule that
would ban companies from giving important information to analysts
and professional investors before disclosing it to the public. The
rule should accelerate the democratization of investing fostered by
the Internet. Online trading, financial message boards and the
rapid-fire dissemination of news from Web sites have helped close
the gap between average investors and Wall Street. Opponents of the
regulation say it could lead to an ``information blackout'' if
companies grow more cautious about talking.

   Clinton administration officials are close to resolving national
security concerns and allowing Japan's NTT Communications to
purchase the American Internet service provider Verio for $5.5
billion, people involved in the negotiations said. Shares of Verio
rallied on hopes that NTT's $60-a-share purchase will proceed after
a three-month delay. Verio rose $3.6875, to $57.1875.

average crept up 2.93 points, or 0.03 percent, to 10,908.76. And

been seen as its next top executive. Since Steere took over in
1992, Pfizer's sales have almost tripled, and over the last five
years, its stock price has increased 500 percent. ``It's the
perfect time to leave,'' Steere said. ``I've done my part. We're

WHERE HINDENBURG FELL, MIDAIR CRASH REVIVES TALK OF CURSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J., Pa., Md.)  By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKEHURST, N.J. _ A grim hush fell over the Airship Tavern on
Thursday afternoon as the enlisted men and naval engineers put down
their beers and glanced up at the overhead television, its screen
showing the wreckage of a shattered aircraft that took the lives of
six of their co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the midair collision of two small planes near here
killed 11 people, those who work at this sprawling military base
were trying to grapple with the loss of so many colleagues at once
_ and with an unsettling history of air disasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is just so devastated,'' said Ellie Cameron, a
bartender at the tavern, which is filled with photographs of the
Hindenburg, which burned here in 1937, killing 36 people. ``It's
too much to bear.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who work and live in this township some 70 miles south
of Manhattan, aviation disasters have always been closely
associated with the Lakehurst Naval Air Engineering Station, which
specializes in technology for aircraft carriers.
</P>
<P>
   At the base entrance, a Blue Angel F-4 jet stands as a memorial
to three naval stunt pilots who died here in 1973 when two fighter
jets collided in a training exercise. In 1933, the crash of the
Navy airship U.S.S. Akron, based at Lakehurst, took 73 lives. Only
three crewmen survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got assigned here, people told me, `That's the place
where bad things happen,' '' said Petty Officer Second Class Louis
Lemos, 25, a base accountant. ``I guess they were right.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 11 passengers killed, six worked here as civilian
engineers, managers or logisticians. The seventh naval employee
worked from a base near Philadelphia. The other four victims were
pilots, including one in training.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has affected everyone on the base,'' said Pamela Schott,
who is coordinating a team of 20 counselors. ``Many people knew the
victims for 20 or more years, so the loss has had a real ripple
effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane that took off from Lakehurst was a Piper Navajo, a
commuter plane that seats 10, making its morning run from the base
to Patuxent River Naval Air Station in Maryland. All the passengers
had meetings at the air station and were to have returned that
evening.
</P>
<P>
   One of those killed, Michael Simodejka, 52, a logistics
management specialist from Toms River, made the trip almost every
week, said his wife, Patricia.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first shuttle trip for John Zukow, who usually took
commercial flights to Maryland. An engineering technician and
former paratrooper, Zukow, 56, lived in Berkeley Township with his
wife, Kathleen.
</P>
<P>
   The other workers from Lakehurst were Angelo George, 39, a
program manager from Toms River with a wife and four young
children; Robert G. Polo, 39, a logistics management specialist
from Barnegat; John Vail Jr., 36, a program manager from Howell,
and Cynthia Kovacs, 39, a mechanical engineer from Robbinsville
whose husband, Wayne, also works at Lakehurst.
</P>
<P>
   A co-worker, Dennis Dusenshine, said Kovacs helped design
systems to prevent midair collisions.
</P>
<P>
   She had also survived breast cancer, working the entire time she
was undergoing treatment. Kovacs was declared free of cancer in
February, said Pattie Odoardo, another co-worker. ``It's very
heartbreaking,'' she said, ``to see someone survive such a terrible
disease and then go like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The seventh Navy employee, David Dahlen, 57, lived in
Warminster, Pa., and worked as a contractor with the Naval
Inventory Control Point in Philadelphia. Dahlen, who along with
Kovacs boarded the plane at the Trenton-Mercer Airport, was
involved in foreign military sales and logistics management.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots of the Piper Navajo were Joseph Peter Mari, 37, of
Toms River and Daniel Groff, 38, of Forked River, who had a wife
and young son. The two men, employees of Patuxent Airways of
California, Md., often flew the shuttle together.
</P>
<P>
   Mari, who was single and lived with his parents, was planning to
return to aviation school in the fall, his father, Frank, said.
Although he enjoyed flying commuter planes, his goal, his father
said, was to fly commercial jets.
</P>
<P>
   The other aircraft involved in the crash, a four-seat Piper
Seminole, was being flown by Craig Robinson, 28, and a student
pilot, Jason Wismer, 20, of Bensalem, Pa. Robinson, a police
officer with the Washington Township Police Department, was a
flight instructor in his free time.

   SALINAS, Calif. _ Asserting that California is up for grabs in
November, Texas Gov. George W. Bush plowed through the fertile
heartland of this Democrat-dominated state Thursday even as his
rival's supporters geared up for next week's convention in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Standing shoulder-to-shoulder with U.S. Sen. John McCain of
Arizona _ a proven magnet for independent voters _ the Republican
presidential nominee traveled this state seeking undecided voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there's a chance of carrying California,'' said
Bush, who called Democrats' predictions of an almost uncontested
victory here for Vice President Al Gore ``wishful thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   That is despite the fact that the state went overwhelmingly for
President Clinton and Gore in 1992 and 1996. It is considered a
must-win state for the Democratic presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   While California political analysts do not dismiss Bush, they
say the Golden State still appears to be Gore's to lose _ despite a
recent statewide poll showing just a 3 percent difference between
the two candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is serious about making California a competitive state. I
think in the end it will all come down to turnout, and in the end
we are more of a Democratic state than a Republican state,'' said
Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a faculty member at the Claremont Graduate
School in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffe sits on the board of the Public Policy Institute, which
issued new poll results Thursday, showing the gap between Gore and
Bush narrowing.
</P>
<P>
   It pegged Gore's support at 40 percent, compared with 37 percent
for Bush, and it concluded that Green Party candidate Ralph Nader,
with an 8 percent following, was siphoning more support from Gore
than Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was conducted the first week in August, however, during
the GOP convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing of the poll makes it of less value,'' said Jeffe,
since candidates traditionally get a bump in polls during their own
political conventions.
</P>
<P>
   However, Jeffe noted that Nader does appear to be drawing more
potential Gore voters, which could hurt the Democrat in a close
race.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's environmentalist supporters are particularly concerned.
In a letter published in the New York Times on Thursday, Robert F.
Kennedy Jr., a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council,
warns that Nader's candidacy ``could siphon votes away from Al Gore
_ the environment's most visible champion since Theodore Roosevelt
_ and lead to the election of George W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mark DiCamillo, director of the respected Field Poll,
said that Gore continues to do better in California than he does
nationally, where post-convention polls had him behind Bush by
double digits.
</P>
<P>
   A mid-June Field Poll had Gore leading Bush by 11 points, 46-35,
with Nader garnering 7 points and Buchanan 2.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush hopes to benefit this week by campaigning in
California with McCain, DiCamillo said that he doubts the Arizona
senator's popularity will rub off on the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain is not on the ticket. I think his effect is just that
of an endorser, and endorsements aren't really that influential,''
he said. ``If McCain had been on the ticket, you would have been
talking about something qualitatively different.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was Bush's first campaign road trip with his former
rival from their intense primary battle. The Arizona war veteran
will accompany Bush again today in Oregon and Washington before
they head to McCain's home state on Saturday for a break.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do we think we can do well in those states, we think
we can carry those states,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are states that in the past couple of election cycles,
people have said Republicans don't have a chance. It's awfully
helpful to have John by my side in states where there are a lot of
independent-thinking people,'' the Texas governor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud to be part of this crusade,'' said McCain, who also
called it a campaign of unification.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced from spending many years in the state that
California is clearly in play. A recent poll showed it's virtually
tied,'' McCain told reporters after he and Bush greeted supporters
at the National Steinbeck Center.
</P>
<P>
   With bushels of fresh produce as a backdrop, McCain said
California is ripe for the picking by the GOP because significant
numbers of Democrats and independents are known to vote for some
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   As he did last week in the Midwest, Bush rode a train to make a
series of stops in towns where crowds had gathered. Starting with a
train station rally that drew about 7,000 people, Bush and McCain
rode a chartered Amtrak train northward to Lodi and Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffe said that the train ride was a smart way of getting free
local media coverage in a state where politics often takes a back
seat to freeway chases and celebrity sightings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The train is all over the local news,'' she said. &QL;

   SANTA MONICA, Calif. _ Demonstrators pushed vacuums out into the
streets of this seaside Los Angeles suburb Thursday, interrupting
rush hour traffic in hopes of drawing attention to a hotel labor
dispute that could prove embarrassing to Democrats gathering for
their national convention.
</P>
<P>
   As one group of demonstrators erected a barricade of Eurekea
uprights, others, including at least some workers from the Loews
Santa Monica Beach Hotel, made up beds in the middle of Ocean
Avenue, waited on tables or dusted furniture they had moved to the
street.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 480 demonstrators participated, and about 50 were
arrested when they sat in a circle and refused orders to disperse.
</P>
<P>
   The protest, coming just four days before the kickoff of the
Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, has quickly
escalated from a localized labor dispute into a potential
embarrassment for Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff pits a key Democratic constituency _ organized
labor _ against a major Gore campaign contributor _ Loews Hotels
Chief Executive Jonathan Tisch. And the focus of the battle is a
hotel booked with convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Union activists are trying to organize the 400 housekeepers,
waiters and bellhops at the beach front hotel. Only one other hotel
along Santa Monica's shoreline is unionized.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders have accused Loews of trying to stifle their
organizing efforts. Company officials counter that a third of their
hotels already are unionized, and that all they are seeking is a
secret ballot vote on the union question.
</P>
<P>
   Like most major unions, the Hotel Employees &AMP; Restaurant
Employees International Union supports Gore's candidacy, and some
of the protesters sported ``Viva Gore'' buttons. But they could not
resist using the exposure the Democratic convention would draw to
their cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree it looks bad,'' said David Koff, a senior research
analyst for the union. But Koff insisted the clash demonstrates the
``contradiction which is fighting for the soul of the Democratic
Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Favian Gonzalez , a hotel waiter, also acknowledged the
political tightrope facing the unions and the vice president.
``Obviously there is a political climate,'' he said. ``That's just
life. They can't always worry about politics. Obviously if he is a
Democrat then he should be supporting labor.''
</P>
<P>
   While sympathetic to the hotel workers' cause, many Democrats
fear the battle in Santa Monica threatens to give Gore a black eye
among union members, just as he is trying to rally the troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are elements within the labor community which are very,
very excited about him, but there are some who aren't,'' noted one
Washington-based Democrat, who asked not to be named. ``And he
can't have a fractured labor community going into this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore presidential campaign refused to discuss the Loews
hotel dispute directly. ``I think it's clear that Al Gore supports
the cause of working families,'' a spokesman said, adding that Gore
and his running mate, U.S. Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., ``have a
record and an agenda that reflects that.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the rank and file, many union members already are
ambivalent about the centrist, free-trade-supporting Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The United Steelworkers of America, for instance, endorsed Gore
early on, but ``they are still in the process of trying to rev up
the troops,'' said one labor expert.
</P>
<P>
   The 31,000-member California Nurses Association _ one of
California's largest labor organizations _ has thrown its support
behind consumer advocate Ralph Nader, the Green Party's nominee,
and the Teamsters union has threatened to endorse Nader.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the United Auto Workers formally endorsed Gore,
while still giving a nod to Nader. ``While two candidates have
offered progressive, pro-working family programs, it is clear that
only one of the progressive candidates can win this election,'' UAW
President Stephen Yokich said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret that we disagree _ and disagree sharply _ on
NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement) and on granting
China permanent normal trade relations,'' Yokich said. ``Yet even
on trade where we don't see eye to eye, Al Gore is better _ much
better _ than George W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Seth Harris, an associate professor at New York Law School, said
a UAW endorsement should not be underestimated, since it brings
ground troops to swing states like Illinois, Ohio and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The union activists in Santa Monica also are supporting a
``living wage'' proposal that would require the hotels to pay their
workers at least $10.69 an hour. Hotel officials, along with other
business leaders, are supporting a rival measure that would only
require companies doing business with the city to adhere to a
living wage standard.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel conflict is so ticklish for Gore because Tisch is a
longtime supporter and friend. According to the Center for
Responsive Politics, Tisch has ponied up more than $190,000 in
campaign contributions for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But Tisch _ himself a delegate to the convention _ has no
intention of trying to reach a quick settlement in the dispute
before the Democratic bash.
</P>
<P>
   While conceding ``we'd prefer not to have this dispute
happening,'' Loews spokesman Richard Mintz said Tisch will not try
to hurry up and settle the matter before the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a fiduciary responsibility to our shareholders,''
Mintz said. ``We have an obligation to our employees, to make sure
their wishes are fairly expressed.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday _ the day before the convention starts _ AFL-CIO
President John Sweeney, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and a number of
Democratic lawmakers are expected to attend a rally at the hotel in
support of the workers.

<P>
   CHENEYS STUMP IN OHIO
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney and his wife, Lynne, visited an elementary school
Thursday in Pickerington, Ohio, a largely Republican suburb of
Columbus, to hammer home the importance of reading and Gov. George
W. Bush's broader emphasis on education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The single most significant problem we face, especially in
this day and age, is finding skilled, trained people to fill the
jobs that are out there,'' Cheney said. ``But oftentimes our
schools have failed us. What's the source of the failure? Lots of
times the kids can't read. If we don't get those children reading
by the third grade, all the evidence shows that it's very hard to
get them back into the system and benefit from education.''

<P>
   A CLAY FAMILY TRADITION
</P>
<P>
   In a five-way race to succeed retiring Rep. William Clay, D-Mo.,
the congressman's 44-year-old son, state Sen. William Clay Jr., won
the Democratic primary this week in the 1st Congressional District.
The race had been expected to be close, but Clay won handily,
sweeping St. Louis and elsewhere running slightly ahead of his main
rival, Charlie Dooley, a member of the St. Louis County Council.
</P>
<P>
   The race could determine how Missouri's congressional districts
are redrawn next year, particularly the 1st District and the
adjacent 3rd District of Rep.Dick Gephardt, the House minority
leader. A victory by Dooley might have resulted in a shift of the
district's boundaries farther into the suburbs of St. Louis County.
That would have enabled legislators to extend Gephardt's district
north, into the heavily black _ and securely Democratic _ terrain
of St. Louis.

POLO RALPH LAUREN SUES JORDACHE OVER POLO EMBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALLISON FASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Forget the horses and the wooden mallets. This polo
match is taking place in a courtroom, not on a field.
</P>
<P>
   Polo Ralph Lauren, the fashion company is on one side, and the
U.S. Polo Association, the governing body of the sport since 1890,
and Jordache, are on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Jordache manufactures men's and women's sportwear for the
association. The clothes have the association's name and a double
image of a horse with a polo-playing rider. Polo Ralph Lauren says
in a lawsuit that the use of the name ``polo'' and the symbol of a
polo player on a horse on clothes infringes on the Polo Ralph
Lauren trademark by confusing consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we think they don't have the right to call
themselves the United States Polo Association, because of course
they do,'' said Anthony Lo Cicero, a lawyer for Polo Ralph Lauren
in New York. ``But when they use the word `polo' in an emphasized
way and use symbols that look like our symbol and copy our trade
dress _ the way in which trademarks appear _ then we consider that
trademark infringement.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordache rejects those arguments, and in a countersuit filed
this week contends that Polo Ralph Lauren has now pressured some of
Jordache's customers to stop buying its goods.
</P>
<P>
   Polo Ralph Lauren ``has contacted customers of Jordache and
licensees of the U.S. Polo Association and attempted to intimidate
them to stop buying product, claiming that all the logos infringe
on Polo Ralph Lauren,'' said Robert A. Spiegelman, a lawyer for
Jordache. ``They've probably caused Jordache to lose many millions
of dollars in sales _ going to stores and customers of Jordache and
making false statements.''
</P>
<P>
   Polo Ralph Lauren has faced off before with the polo
association. A year ago, a federal court ruled that the association
had to change the name of its official magazine, Polo. And in 1984,
a federal judge ruled that Ralph Lauren's company could have
trademarks and logos that the association had argued were generic
to the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interesting thing will be to see how the court draws the
lines between the two _ to respect each of their rights but to
avoid confusion,''said Tony Fletcher, a trademark lawyer at the New
York office of Fish &AMP; Richardson PC, who is not involved in the
current case.
</P>
<P>
   Jordache is no stranger to legal fights. The company battled
with rival jeans maker Guess in court for seven years before
reaching a settlement in 1980.

THOMAS FORAN, 76, U.S. ATTORNEY WHO PROSECUTED THE CHICAGO SEVEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thomas Aquinas Foran, a Chicago trial lawyer best known as the
pugnacious prosecutor in the Chicago Seven conspiracy case of 1969
and 1970, died Aug. 6 at his home in suburban Lake Forest, Ill. He
was 76.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Foran was a senior partner in Foran &AMP; Schultz, the firm he
founded in 1957. His name was one of the brightest in his city's
legal profession, but to the outside world it was inextricably
linked to some leading characters of a turbulent era.
</P>
<P>
   There were Jerry Rubin, Rennie Davis and Abbie Hoffman, who took
their Vietnam War protests to the streets. There was William M.
Kunstler, the raspy-voiced defender of unpopular people and causes.
</P>
<P>
   There was Judge Julius J. Hoffman, an equally combative presence
on the bench of U.S. District Court. And there was Foran, the U.S.
attorney and doggedly determined prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   The seven defendants at the four-and-a-half-month trial stood
accused of inciting the riots that swirled around the Democratic
National Convention in 1968. Foran and his prosecuting team
obtained convictions against five of them _ David Dellinger, Tom
Hayden, Rubin, Hoffman and Davis _ for the lesser charge of
crossing state lines with intent to incite a riot; two defendants
were acquitted, Lee Weiner and John R. Froines.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman imposed prison sentences on the five, as well as on
Kunstler, whom he held in contempt. None of them served any time in
prison because an appeals court threw out the convictions and
rebuked Hoffman for unseemly conduct in court and procedural
errors.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Foran was born in Chicago. He interrupted his college
education to serve as a torpedo bomber pilot in the Pacific in
World War II. After the war, he graduated with a bachelor's degree
in philosophy from Loyola University and received his law degree at
the University of Detroit in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   In private practice, he established a solid reputation as an
expert in eminent domain law, representing the city of Chicago in
major public works projects. But he also acted as counsel for
property owners.
</P>
<P>
   As a U.S. attorney, from 1968 to 1970, he established a
remarkable conviction record in the fight against organized crime,
successfully prosecuting more than 150 people.
</P>
<P>
   Foran is survived by his wife of nearly 50 years, Jean Burke
Foran; three sons, John, Edmund and Stephen; three daughters,
Elizabeth Yore, Julie Rebarchak and Regina Thibeau; a brother, Dr.
John Foran; a sister, Grace Szalinski; and 16 grandchildren.

ALL TIGER, ALL THE TIME?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's not just the cover kid on the new issue of Time magazine,
but his head covers three of the four letters in the title, barely
leaving room for an ``E.''
</P>
<P>
   Can Tiger Woods get any bigger?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's the point of putting this ``exclusive'' interview
out there ahead of, oh say, the Democratic National Convention or
other pressing news stories of the day. After all, Time's story is
about ``how the greatest golfer in the world risked it all in his
quest to become the greatest golfer in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to ruin the story for everyone _ who has time to read Time
anyway? _ but this life-altering development has nothing to do with
Tiger's stance on race, creed or color of his club covers.
</P>
<P>
   He just changed his freakin' swing, OK? Save the transparent
graphics for Golf Digest.
</P>
<P>
   A MODEST PROPOSAL: The only compelling note to come out of that
Time story is this Tiger tidbit: ``About 50 percent of those who
watch Woods play on TV have never played.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's true _ and, again, it's in Time, so it must be _ TV
has no choice but to change the way it covers tournaments where he
is competing.
</P>
<P>
   Simply, create a separate Tiger Channel, one that exclusively
follows him around the course, shot by shot, checking his yardage
card, joking with his caddy, scowling at someone in the crowd who
takes his picture during a backswing or interrupts his train of
thought by yelling to a friend on a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Then throw the rest of the tournament on a cable channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that could happen in the future,'' admits Lance
Barrow, CBS' coordinating producer for golf who has the distinct
pleasure of recording Tiger's almost every move this weekend from
the Buick Open in Michigan and then next week when he defends his
PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an expert on this subject, but in any sport 10 years
down the road, in any game, if you want to watch a wide receiver,
or if you're only an Ernie Els fan, you'll be able to focus only on
him somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   We've heard all about this technology before, where you become
the director at home and pick which camera angle you want to
follow. But we're suggesting an even more extreme measure of
satisfying these ``Survivor''-crazed audiences.
</P>
<P>
   We can't wait 10 years. We can't wait 10 more minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the way other PGA pros talk, they'd be more than happy
if they didn't have to share TV time with Tiger any more than they
already do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, talking about today's technology, Tiger is lucky the
PGA isn't into reality programming,'' quipped David Feherty, CBS'
witty course reporter. ``Otherwise he'd have been voted off the
broadcast long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   YET ANOTHER ``OUTSIDE'' TAKE: ESPN's newish weekly ``Outside the
Lines'' show (7:30 a.m. Sunday, repeated at 10 a.m. on ESPN2) plans
to examine the Tiger effect on the game and the culture in the next
Bob Ley-hosted show.
</P>
<P>
   HATS OFF TO VISSER: She said watching the first ``Monday Night
Football'' exhibition telecast a week ago was ``bittersweet,'' kind
of like ``going to an old boyfriend's wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, Lesley Visser has no bitterness toward ABC for
bouncing her off the high-profile event. She says she's happily
going back to CBS Sports, for that matter, where the former Boston
Globe reporter spent her first six years in TV before defecting to
the ABC family seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I should be flattered that it took two people to
replace me,'' said Visser, displaced by new producer Don Olhmeyer
from ``MNF'' as a sideline reporter in favor of Melissa Stark and
Eric Dickerson.
</P>
<P>
   Visser said she had two years remaining on her ABC/ESPN
contract, and the network offered her some choice assignments (such
as hosting ``Wide World of Sports'') to stay. The chance to work on
the NFL, NCAA basketball and the U.S. Open tennis tournament for
CBS, as well as do stories for that network's news shows like ``48
Hours'' was what Visser decided was more important.
</P>
<P>
   She added that there's been no real thought to join an ageism
lawsuit against ABC, pursued by former reporter Donna DeVarona.
Visser, it could be surmised, would have something to complain
about since the younger Stark was the one who got her job, which is
basically no more than window dressing on a telecast.
</P>
<P>
   CBS Sports chief Sean McManus, who called Visser's hiring a
``no-brainer,'' said he doesn't believe decisions on sports talent
these days are that cut and dried based on sex or race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every decision is (completely) subjective,'' he said, ``but
whatever it is, I believe it's based on ability. These days of
categorizing someone as a male or female are behind us.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I hope so.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHAT SMOKES &QL; 
-- To mark the anniversary of the first televised major-league game
_ the Dodgers-Cincinnati game from Ebbets Field on Aug. 26, 1939,
which station W2XBS sent to about 500 homes in New York _ Fox will
do a ``turn back the clock'' broadcast of the Aug. 26 Dodgers-Cubs
game from Wrigley Field. Meaning, Fox's coverage with Joe Buck and
Tim McCarver will do each inning as it would have been during that
decade, starting with the 1930s and progressing steadily. Meaning,
it'll be in black-and-white with a two-camera setup for that first
inning, progression to instant replay capabilities and color by the
fifth inning (representing the 1960s) with more graphics and super
slo-mo cameras by game's end. &QL; 
-- A clutch interview. Scott Verona at the dunk.net Web site had an
extended Q-and-A posted on the site hours after Lakers executive
Jerry West officially announced his retirement Monday. Verona did
the interview at West's Bel-Air home last week. &QL; 
-- Early favorite at NBC to do XFL play-by-play (and actually do it
willingly): Chris Marlowe &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
-- More ESPN sexual harassment findings. Michael Freeman, the New
York Times writer who authored the ``uncensored history'' book of
the all-sports network that was released earlier this year,
confirmed that two more male employees have been punished for
inappropriate behavior toward female employees. One on-air anchor
was suspended a week. Another well-regarded producer and one of the
most senior people at the Bristol, Conn., offices was suspended for
one month after what Freeman discovered was his seventh offense.
The latest incidents will be chronicled in depth in the paperback
version of the book to be published. &QL; 
-- Kenny Mayne, ESPN's deadpan ``SportsCenter'' anchor, is the
unusual choice to liven up the network's new game show called ``2
Minute Drill'' by acting as the host. By the time the show debuts
Sept. 11, Mayne will hopefully be so amused by the simplicity of
this game that he'll convey as much. &QL; 
-- A big shout-out to Randy Sparage ... easy on the Fred Flintstone
bellowing from the Fox Sports Net Regional Sports desk. It's loud
enough with rah-rah reports (you can only call the Dodgers ``our
boys in blue'' once a telecast), but the additional yabba-dabba-dos
don't help the volume control, either. &QL;

AS METS WIN, PIAZZA GLANCES TOWARD FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Mike Piazza rapped his knuckles on the wooden locker
stall, chasing away the baseball gods who would zap him for the
statement he was making.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I can hope is that we as a ballclub keep
playing well and pushing it,'' said Piazza, the New York Mets
catcher. ``If we happen to make the playoffs this year, to have a
week or so to get ready for the playoffs would be the ideal
situation. But as we saw last year, you're not always afforded that
luxury.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Piazza caught 30 of the Mets' final 32 games as the
team stumbled toward the postseason. It is becoming easier for the
Mets to see a safer path to this October.
</P>
<P>
   They beat the Houston Astros, 10-3, Thursday to complete a 5-2
road trip that followed an 8-1 homestand. The Mets are four and
one-half games ahead in the wild-card standings, and they trail the
Atlanta Braves by two and one-half games in the National League
East.
</P>
<P>
   For the Mets to go further this season _ to reach the World
Series _ it will help if Piazza is rested. He was 4-for-4 Thursday,
with four runs batted in, one day after clubbing a 445-foot,
three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza's batting average is .351, and he is five runs away from
100 runs batted in. But he is tracking a more important statistic:
games caught. Piazza has caught 86 games, and he is nearing the
100-game barrier, a benchmark for catching durability.
</P>
<P>
   He has gotten extra rest this year from a series of minor
injuries, including a sprained knee that gave him three days off
this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a risk you run when you're catching so much,
physically: the hot weather, the schedule, going back and forth
with the time changes, you're just going to hit a wall,'' Piazza
said. ``When you get injuries, especially having such quality guys
on the ballclub, I know I can take an extra day or two, which has
the residual effect of keeping your legs fresh and preventing you
from getting that run down.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza's legs looked fresh enough Thursday. He took third on a
wild pitch and scored in the third inning, and he scored from first
on a double by Robin Ventura in the seventh. Ventura also had four
runs batted in, on a pair of two-run doubles. Those hits came as
the Mets piled on the Astros' bullpen for three-run innings in the
seventh and eighth that put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Bobby Jones had kept the Astros down. He gave up two
bases-empty home runs to Jeff Bagwell, but permitted no other runs
over eight innings. Jones improved his record to 7-5, and he has a
2.94 earned run average in 10 starts since accepting an assignment
to Class AAA Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates have noticed an obvious difference in Jones'
confidence. It is reflected in the ground balls he gets, Ventura
said, the third baseman, and his presence on the mound. Since Jones
returned, there is a feeling that he will get the ground balls he
needs. Jones allowed 10 hits Thursday, but he got three ground-ball
double plays.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, Jones, an All-Star in 1997 who seems headed for his
first 10-victory season since then, is an important contributor
again.
</P>
<P>
   Jones missed time with an injury earlier this year, as did Rick
Reed and Darryl Hamilton. Both of those players are back, and the
Mets with minor injuries _ Edgardo Alfonzo and Jay Payton _ are
returning to form.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo hit .458 on the road trip, and Payton homered for the
second game in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, who returned on Wednesday after missing four months
with a toe injury, started in right field Thursday and scored four
runs. On Wednesday, he hit a homer and on Thursday he hit a triple.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hamilton played right field for the first time in seven years,
starting there because Manager Bobby Valentine misunderstood Derek
Bell, who Valentine thought asked for an off day on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He mentioned, `If you're going to do something, tomorrow would
be a good day,''' Valentine said. ``But it was kind of taken out of
context. Suffice it to say, Derek came in today and said, `Oh,
that's not what I meant.'''
</P>
<P>
   But if there was any friction between Bell and Valentine, it did
not seem so in the dugout. As Bell grooved to a song on the
public-address system between the second and third innings, the
manager shuffled from behind and boogied past him. Bell, and the
rest of the players on the bench, broke up in laughter.
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of trip for the Mets, who are carefree and
healthy and could be headed for a happy ending.

TROJANS GET FIRST COMMITMENT FOR 2002
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ It's still the early stages of recruiting for
the Class of 2001, but USC has gotten off to an impressive start
for 2002 with an oral commitment from offensive tackle Alex Potasi
of Narbonne High in Harbor City, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Potasi (6-foot-6, 320 pounds) is only 16 years old and about to
begin his junior year, but he decided to make his college decision
now even though he might be considered the top lineman in the state
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to go there,'' Potasi said. ``I've always
liked USC and it's close to home. I felt comfortable doing it. I'm
ready to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Narbonne High coach J.R. Munoz said Potasi has received letters
from every Division I college in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say he's the most awesome specimen I've ever
coached,'' Munoz said. ``Alex has all the physical attributes and
the skills to play in the NFL. He was doing things as a sophomore
that it takes years and years to do. As far as size and talent, he
ranks up there with the best of all time in this area.''
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted that oral commitments are nonbinding and
Potasi has another 18 months before he has to make his official
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ACOSTA REDSHIRTS: Center Carlos Acosta of Moorpark (Calif.)
College will redshirt after leaving the team last week to resolve
personal issues. He will rejoin the Trojans when school starts Aug.
28 and have two years of eligibility remaining.
</P>
<P>
   KELLY NURSES KNEE: Sophomore wide receiver Kareem Kelly did not
complete the morning practice and sat out the afternoon session to
rest his strained knee. Kelly was scheduled to see the team doctor
Thursday night, but said he probably would take today off and
return for Saturday's scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt tightness in my knee so I came out,'' Kelly said. ``I'm
a little sore. I'm probably going to take a day or two off. They're
holding me back. They know I'm a serious commodity as far as the
team goes.''
</P>
<P>
   DEPTH PROBLEMS: Three defensive linemen went down in Thursday
morning's practice. Senior defensive end Sultan Abdul-Malik
suffered a back injury, freshman defensive tackle Nathan Goodson
sprained his ankle and freshman tackle Kenechi Udeze strained his
neck.
</P>
<P>
   Goodson returned in the afternoon, while Abdul-Malik and Udeze
should be back today. Udeze was hurt when his helmet became locked
with offensive lineman Joe McGuire's. He was down on the ground for
several minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Strong safety Troy Polamalu also missed the afternoon practice
after taking a hard hit in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   WHO'S NO. 3? The starting tailback position is up for grabs
between Sultan McCullough and Malaefou MacKenzie, but apparently so
is the third-string position. Hackett said freshman Chris Howard
``had a heck of an afternoon'' practice and was pushing senior
Petros Papadakis for the No.3 spot.
</P>
<P>
   Papadakis had two staples inserted in his head Thursday after he
was hurt during morning contact drills. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ After Philadelphia police subdued demonstrations
at last week's Republican National Convention by closing
protesters' headquarters, activists here for the Democratic
gathering took pre-emptive measures Thursday to stop police before
police stopped them.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern
California filed a federal lawsuit seeking a temporary restraining
order against the Los Angeles Police Department, claiming officers
on 22 occasions have harassed, intimidated and arrested
demonstrators making picket plans and preparing banners and puppets
before the convention begins Monday. The court is expected to rule
by late today. (FRIDAY)
</P>
<P>
   ``Freedom of speech cannot survive in an atmosphere where fear
predominates,'' said ACLU staff attorney Dan Tokaji. ``Yet the LAPD
through its actions over the past several weeks, culminating in the
past few days, has deliberately created just such an atmosphere of
fear for protesters planning peaceful demonstrations around the
Democratic National Convention.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the LAPD said the department does not comment on
pending lawsuits. Telephone calls to the Los Angeles City
Attorney's Office were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Tokaji said that on July 8 California protest organizers leased
a building they call the Convergence Center just west of the
downtown district where the convention center is located. Almost
one week later about 11 officers entered without a warrant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a few minutes they came forward, they came clean and
acknowledged that one of the reasons they were here was because
they knew about the political protests that were being planned,''
Tokaji said.
</P>
<P>
   At other times protesters have reported hearing police
helicopters hovering at low levels around the buildings and have
seen officers spying on them with binoculars and cameras. Planners
have been cited for jaywalking around the building.
</P>
<P>
   During the Republican National Convention earlier this month in
Philadelphia, police raided a warehouse where protesters were
making banners and puppets and arrested about 70 people. The police
said they had obtained information that the building might contain
weapons or chemicals. Protesters said they had only paint and
tools.
</P>
<P>
   The action sparked a mini-riot later that day when a few
protesters confronted officers in the streets and damaged police
vehicles. More arrests were made on the street and subsequent
protests were without much steam.
</P>
<P>
   Tokaji said he fears Los Angeles police may be planning similar
actions against them.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday two officers stopped by the center and told protesters
``See ya Saturday,'' Tokaji said.
</P>
<P>
   Tokaji said he interpreted the remark to mean the LAPD is
planning some kind of action against the protesters at the center
that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``On at least two occasions they have referred to `on Saturday,'
'' Tokaji said. ``LAPD officials have spoken approvingly of the
pre-emptive strikes that were taken by police ... in Philadelphia.
... We believe, based on this pattern of activity and numerous
actions that have occurred thus far, that some kind of thing is
planned by the LAPD.''

U.S. IS SAID TO BE NEAR DEAL FOR NTT UNIT TO BUY VERIO
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: S.C.)  By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Clinton administration officials are close to
resolving national security concerns and allowing NTT
Communications of Japan to buy Verio Inc., a U.S. Internet service
provider, people involved in the negotiations said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The $5.5 billion deal has become a test case of the FBI's power
to police the Internet and guard against espionage when a company
controlled by a foreign government buys an American Internet
gateway. NTT Communications is a subsidiary of the Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone Corp., which is 53 percent owned by the Japanese
government.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a Monday deadline, NTT officials ended a prolonged
standoff and offered to adhere to FBI terms, which would
effectively set up a separate American-controlled office within the
Japanese-American company that could execute court-ordered wiretaps
without oversight of the Japanese parent company, the people said.
</P>
<P>
   American officials are also insisting on legally binding
commitments that give the government recourse if the combined
company fails to cooperate with investigators or compromises the
secrecy of law enforcement actions, the people said. Negotiations
were continuing Thursday on the details, and a final resolution
could come on Friday, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Verio rallied Thursday on hopes that NTT's $60-a-share
purchase would proceed after a three-month delay. Shares of Verio
rose $3.6875, or almost 7 percent, to $57.1875.
</P>
<P>
   The United States often insists on safeguards when companies
controlled by foreign governments buy American telecommunications
and military concerns. But this is the first time national security
considerations have been raised in the case of a cross-border
Internet company acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI wants to raise a firewall that would make it harder for
a company controlled by a foreign government to interfere with
official eavesdropping or to use Internet service providers for
espionage. Internet service providers route data for their
customers, not unlike the way phone companies handle voice and data
communications.
</P>
<P>
   Until negotiations resumed Thursday, NTT and Verio had been
reluctant to agree to set up a structure like the one the FBI
wanted, people involved in the talks said. The companies were said
to fear that doing so might put them at a competitive disadvantage
because customers might think that their data would be better
protected by other service providers.
</P>
<P>
   The case prompted an investigation by an interagency task force
known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States,
which is headed by Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers. Unless
the matter is resolved amicably, the committee must report to
President Clinton by Monday with a recommendation on whether the
president should block the deal for national security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Summers called a high-level meeting with numerous Cabinet
officers and senior White House officials to discuss the standoff,
but canceled the session Thursday morning after NTT put a new offer
on the table, people involved in the matter said. The remaining
disagreements were described as relatively minor.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said Summers could convene the committee's
principals by phone on Friday to end the investigation and remove
obstacles to the merger if the negotiations produced an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials were thought to be highly
reluctant to block the transaction, fearing it would send a
negative signal about foreign investment in the fast-growing
American Internet sector.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation comes as Deutsche Telekom's proposed $50
billion purchase of the VoiceStream Wireless Corp. has run into
congressional opposition on national security grounds. Sen. Ernest
Hollings, D-S.C., has introduced legislation that would prevent an
acquisition like the one proposed by Deutsche Telekom, which is 58
percent owned by the German government. The Clinton administration
has opposed Hollings' legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Lambert, a security expert with DFI International who has
followed the NTT-Verio proceedings, said the merger, if completed
successfully, could become the standard for foreign purchases on
Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone will breathe a sigh of relief because they
want this to be a model,'' Lambert said. ``NTT basically has had to
carry water for other Internet deals down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Public relations professionals for the two companies involved
did not return phone calls seeking comment. A Treasury department
spokeswoman declined to comment on the negotiations.

BRAZIL RAISES $4.04 BILLION IN OIL COMPANY'S STOCK SALE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This story, eliminated earlier, is now restored) 
 By JENNIFER L. RICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Overcoming weeks of pessimism and low
expectations, the Brazilian government raised $4.04 billion
Thursday from the sale of 180 million ordinary voting shares of the
state-owned oil company Petroleos Brasileiros, or Petrobras.
</P>
<P>
   The stock sale was one of the largest in Latin American history
and was met with ravenous demand by investors in Brazil and
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   On the Sao Paulo exchange, Petrobras shares shot up nearly 15
percent from their offering price of 43.07 reais or $24 to close at
51.51 reais and helped push the benchmark Bovespa index up 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Petrobras' American depository receipts, which began trading on
the New York Stock Exchange, closed at $28.625, compared with the
offering price of $24, with more than 35 million shares changing
hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result was quite a nice surprise,'' said Rodrigo Marques,
oil analyst at Santander Investment. ``It should increase the
exposure of Petrobras among international investors, which will
wind up bringing a lot more resources to the company.''
</P>
<P>
   There had been some worry that the government had undertaken the
sale too quickly, not allowing enough time for interest to build
among investors. The government said, though, that the offer turned
out to be 100 percent oversubscribed.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts were disappointed at the price of the offer
though, which was well below the government's maximum price of $32
a share. The government wound up offering an additional 26.5
million shares to compensate for the lower price.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's National Development Bank, or BNDES, which organized
the sale, said that 60 percent of the shares were bought
internationally, by both institutional and private investors.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian government, which still retains control over 55
percent of Petrobras, sold the stock in order to pay down federal
debt and increase the number of investors in the former monopoly.
Brazil is in the process of deregulating its energy sector, which
will eventually subject Petrobras to full competition.

MAN SHOT IN SUV CRASHES, KILLING BYSTANDER, THEN DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISSA GOOTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A man who was shot through the window of his Range
Rover outside a downtown nightclub early Thursday managed to drive
away but lost control after two blocks, the police said, and struck
a Swedish-born director of award-winning television commercials.
Both men died.
</P>
<P>
   The incident started about 4 a.m., in front of NV, a bar and
lounge at 289 Spring St., in an industrial area on the western
fringes of SoHo, the police said. The driver of the Range Rover,
Ivory Davis, 27, was double-parked outside the club when a gunman
shot him about four times, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who was hit twice and started bleeding heavily, sped east
along Spring Street, losing control at the Avenue of the Americas,
where his sport utility vehicle struck the director, Jhoan Camitz,
38, who was preparing to cross the street, the police said. Camitz
was hurled into the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just saw the guy for a minute, and then I lost him from my
eyes, '' said Alex Kathis, who was setting up his coffee and
doughnut stand when he saw the accident across the street. ``He had
no chance to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Range Rover then crashed into a 30-foot traffic pole,
knocking it down, tore into the patio of the Aquagrill restaurant,
and knocked down several planters before flipping onto its side.
Davis died at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Camitz died at St. Vincent Hospital. He was revived for several
hours but died at 7 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   He had been on his way home from a night out with friends, said
a friend and colleague, Adam Kimmel. ``I assume he was probably
walking until he saw a cab, like we all do,'' Kimmel said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The young director's colleagues regarded him as a rising star.
Last year, a Volkswagen commercial that he directed won an ANDY
Award, the top prize from the Advertising Club of New York. The ad
depicted a dog propping itself up against a table to bask in a
fan's breeze.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Camitz garnered two gold Clio Awards, and three gold
and one silver award at the Cannes Advertising Film Awards, for a
series of advertisements he directed for Nike. In one, a boy
squeezes a steak so that its juices run onto a soccer ball, which
he takes outside and kicks down the street while neighborhood dogs
chase after him.
</P>
<P>
   The chief operating officer at Propaganda/Satellite Films,
Trevor Macy, said that Camitz was just starting to venture into
feature films. He was adapting ``Already Dead,'' a novel by Denis
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Film-making was his passion more than anything,'' Macy said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was a co-owner of a company called Yoyo Records, a label
that primarily produces rap music and is based on Pleasant Avenue
in Weehawken, N.J., the police said, but he also used an address in
the Clinton Hill section of Brooklyn. He used several pseudonyms,
including Ivery Davis, Irv Davis and David Caprice, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the first shooting in which Davis had been
involved, the police said. In February, he was shot while inside or
near the Tunnel club, they said. He had been arrested six times and
was awaiting a sentence for an assault conviction. He was paroled
in 1995 after serving one to three years for attempted
second-degree robbery, state records show.
</P>
<P>
   William H. Allee, the chief of detectives, said the police were
investigating Davis' possible involvement in other recent shootings
in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they did not know whether the gunman, who was
still at large, or Davis, had been inside the club.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   City Councilwoman Kathryn E. Freed, who represents Lower
Manhattan, said that if the police concluded the shooting was the
result of a dispute at the club, she would try to close it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``That club has been a problem since the day it opened,'' Freed
said. ``They periodically would meet with the community and promise
to clean up their act. For a little while it would be fine, and
then they'd just go back to their usual problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Freed said that in one incident, a rap artist was shot outside,
and in another, a bouncer who worked at the club fired several
shots from an unlicensed handgun.
</P>
<P>
   State Liquor Authority records show that in April 1997, NV paid
a $1,500 penalty after it was cited for operating without a cabaret
license and having disorderly premises, a count that resulted from
an altercation that erupted there, said Maris Hart, an authority
spokeswoman. And in August of that year, the club paid a $4,000
penalty after it was cited for being too noisy and after illegal
drugs were found there, Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Cantor, the general manager and co-owner of NV, said he
doubted that Davis or the man who shot him had been inside the
club, which closed at 2:45 a.m., more than an hour before the
incident. Cantor said he watched the incident on a videotape from a
surveillance camera outside of his club.
</P>
<P>
   Cantor said that the tape showed the gunman coming around the
corner from Hudson Street, and that he was wearing a baseball cap,
which is not allowed under NV's dress code.
</P>
<P>
   Cantor said he handed that videotape over to the police, as well
as footage from a surveillance system that photographs club goers
as they enter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We run an upscale, professional place,'' he said. ``You cannot
control what happens outside of your club after you've closed.''

COMPETING FOR BUSINESS: SOME X GAMES ATHLETES MAKE A
LIVING  RUNNING SPORTS-GEAR FIRMS 
 &HT;     BY JENNIE YABROFF
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ When Chris Gentry points his skateboard at the
upper lip of the vertical ramp during the X Games, his thoughts
will be on the bottom line.
<P>
   That's because Gentry doesn't just ride for Kingdom Skateboards,
whose logo will be plastered over his board and clothing. He owns
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Gentry, who runs Kingdom with his wife, Ricca, is one of a
handful of athletes competing in the X-Games who split their time
between the business and competition sides of their sports. The
games officially begin August 17 in San Francisco, though some
events start Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a world where a lucrative corporate sponsorship can guarantee
a life of nothing more than practice and competition, these
athletes also must deal with the daily pressures of running a
business.
</P>
<P>
   They say their motivation is not just financial. By running
their own apparel and equipment companies athletes, can sponsor
themselves at competitions and maintain control over their images
and careers.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes who are sponsored by outside companies can make a lot
of money. Snack-, sports-drink- and apparel-makers pay hundreds of
thousands of dollars to get athletes to appear at their events and
wear their logos when they compete.
</P>
<P>
   But it often comes at a price. They may wind up representing a
company that may not know, or care, about promoting the sport
itself, and that is interested in the athlete only for his ability
to sell their product.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been sponsored for years, but I didn't like the
direction the big corporate sponsors were going,'' said veteran
skater Tony Hawk, who founded Birdhouse Skateboards in Huntington
Beach (Orange County) in response to what he saw as increased
negativity by his sponsors and a lack of understanding of the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the big companies were some guy sitting behind a desk
who had never skated in his life, and they wanted to create
competition (between skaters)'' he said. ``I wanted an image that
promoted skating for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawk launched Birdhouse in 1992 with his earnings from his
skating career. He says the company now has 40 employees, and sales
reached $10 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Like Hawk, other athletes have become entrepreneurs to increase
public awareness of their sports. That's because many of the X
Games events such as street luge, in-line skating and freestyle
motorbike riding still are relatively new on the American sports
scene.
</P>

   Biker Sherlock is a street luger who sells apparel and equipment
through Dregs, a 12-employee company in San Diego that sold more
than $1 million dollars in merchandise last year. He also runs an
event-promoting company that he said he got involved in out of
necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got involved (in street luge), no one else was
promoting it,'' he said. ``I hate promoting events with a passion,
but the nonathlete promoters don't know what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherlock said owning his own company lets him retain a family
feel to his team. ``The people on the Dregs team are all guys I
grew up with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But owning the team has its disadvantages, too.
</P>
<P>
   The distractions of doing both can be great. ``Being an athlete
is an advantage as a business owner, but being a businessman is not
an advantage as a racer,'' he said. ``I'm always distracted during
events, trying to see things from both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Gentry resolved the problem by letting his wife take over
the business side of things while he concentrates on skating and a
rapping career he's trying to get off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   For Ricca Gentry, who was a model before she got involved with
Kingdom, running the Houston business has been a learning
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know skating was a sport until I met Chris,''
she said. ``Now we have all these crazy ideas _ we're designing
skateboards, we want to do a music label, Chris is a rapper, plus
we're always traveling to events and competitions. Basically, we
have no life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricca Gentry said that if her husband was skating for a big
sponsor, they would have plenty of money, but as it is, all their
earnings go back into Dregs.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Gentry agreed. ``I'm learning that if you don't have a lot
of money, (running a business) is really hard to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to manage all their businesses themselves, the Gentrys
are doing things the hard way, according to Paul Terry, who works
with entrepreneurs at San Francisco's Renaissance Entrepreneurship
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Terry said people from nonbusiness backgrounds can do well as
entrepreneurs but need a little help.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, it's hard to do it alone,'' he said.
``Someone without business experience will need someone who
understands the concepts of running a small business as well as
skateboarding.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry said athletes should connect with a partner with the
technical know-how to run a business as well as the management
experience to understand the product and how to market it.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Tony Hawk did when he formed Birdhouse. Knowing he
couldn't oversee all aspects of his business and keep a full
skating schedule, Hawk partnered with Per Welinder, a former skater
with a master's degree in business administration.
</P>
<P>
   Welinder handles most of the daily details of their business,
while Hawk concentrates on marketing and managing the Birdhouse
skate team.
</P>
<P>
   Mat Hoffman, a biker who owns Hoffman Bikes in Oklahoma City,
took a similar approach. He connected with business partner Steve
Swope to handle the technical aspects of the business, leaving
Hoffman free to concentrate on the creative side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will dig a hole and jump in, and Steve is the one who
remembers to bring the ladder,'' he said, describing their working
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman said running a business has been ``a definite
challenge'' but added that he likes to be his own boss. ``It's
worth it to have control over the final product,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes who are also business owners admit they feel a twinge
of envy toward competitors who can focus completely on their
sports. ``There's a lot of skaters who wake up and skate all day
and that's all they do,'' said Gentry. ``I have to wake up and get
on the phone and do sales before I can practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawk has had the same experience, but says it makes the time on
his skateboard that much sweeter. ``Having the business helps me
appreciate skating more,'' he said. ``It's my time.''

DOES GENTRY KNOW WHAT HE'S GETTING INTO WITH CLIPPERS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There he stood, bless his innocent little soul,
saying all the right things, all earnest and sincere, and
absolutely doomed to fail.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard not to feel some for Alvin Gentry, introduced Thursday
at the Clippers' annual news conference to name a new coach.
</P>
<P>
   He stood at the podium flanked by general manager Elgin Baylor,
vice president Andy Roeser and some guy in a black hood with a very
large ax.
</P>
<P>
   Gentry seems well-meaning and eager to make his mark. Maybe he's
a great coach, too, though it's almost guaranteed we'll never find
out while he leads the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt this is a golden opportunity for this
franchise,'' Gentry said. ``The young players and what we have
going for us here, we have a chance to really make this something
special over the next couple of years, and something that can last
a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   See, naive to the core. The trouble with the Clippers is, the
only thing that has lasted a long time is Donald Sterling.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the owner of what Sports Illustrated so delicately
labeled the worst franchise in professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   Gentry looks at the team and sees the talented Lamar Odom, their
three No.1-draft picks _ Darius Miles, Keyon Dooling and Quentin
Richardson _ this wealth of young ability, and gets all giddy.
</P>
<P>
   P.T. Barnum warned you. Hey, every year the Clippers are full of
young talent. Then as soon as they can become free agents, they get
the hell out of Dodge.
</P>
<P>
   Their record stinks every season, so they keep getting high
draft picks to replenish their young talent, and apparently for
Sterling, offer eternal hope.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the team disappoints and the guy in the black hood
gets to do his thing on the coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great day for me,'' said Gentry, not realizing his
Clippers career had just peaked.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches are supposedly hired to be fired, but the Clippers offer
a temp service to make Kelly Girl envious. They're the first ones
voted off the island, out of the house and into unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   It's the merry-go-round that never ends, and now Gentry gets a
couple of trips around.
</P>
<P>
   He should know better, too. He was once an assistant here to
Mike Schuler. You all remember Mike Schuler, of course.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers have a long history of recycling either formerly
renowned coaches _ Bill Fitch, Bob Weiss, Gene Shue, Cotton
Fitzsimmons, Jack Ramsay (remarkably, Hubie Brown has never made
the list; one of the great Clippers mysteries), or tabbing an eager
assistant _ Jim Lyman, Don Chaney, Paul Silas.
</P>
<P>
   To the latter add Gentry, who had been hired to be an assistant
with the San Antonio Spurs. This after two failed, if brief,
efforts as a head coach at Miami and Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   What almost every Clippers hire has in common?
</P>
<P>
   Desperation.
</P>
<P>
   The recycled guys want to make a few, last bucks. The assistants
want to be NBA coaches so badly, they're willing to take a shot at
the Clippers _ a team with one winning season in their 16 years in
Los Angeles. Are we sensing a slight pattern?
</P>
<P>
   And how many more chances do you figure Gentry thought he had?
</P>
<P>
   Gentry was asked if he didn't have friends warning him he'd be
crazy to take the Clippers job. When Gentry said they all
encouraged him, the questioner was left wondering if he had any
friends.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers may always be young, but they've never had to be
burped. Miles is 18, Dooling and Richardson both 20, and Odom is
21. Then there's third-year center Michael Olowokandi, whose
basketball instincts are around 16.
</P>
<P>
   News item: Young teams do not win in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're looking at a young team, and it's important to get
someone with the right temperament who can work with the players,
develop the players, improve these players, and not just kill their
confidence right away,'' Baylor said. ``Sometimes you get veteran
coaches who don't have the patience to work with young players.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor said this despite making a run at another recycled guy,
Mike Fratello.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably wasn't their first choice of my wife, either,''
Gentry said. ``But we've been together 10 years now, and she kind
of likes me.''
</P>
<P>
   Keep that sense of humor, Alvin.
</P>
<P>
   We should probably be thankful Baylor didn't give the job to the
always dour Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the Clippers assistant who has all
that experience with youth from the reservation.
</P>
<P>
   You can't accuse Baylor of settling for mediocrity. Baylor
dreams of some day being mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   In Clippers Land, it's always (ital) deja vu (endital). We've
all been here before. We'll be here again, just not with Gentry. &QL;

SEC'S REGULATION SHOULD FORCE ANALYSTS TO DO HOMEWORK 
 &HT;     BY KATHLEEN PENDER
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;         c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Even though it's riddled with loopholes, the Securities and
Exchange Commission's new full-disclosure rule will have a profound
impact on everyone in the financial markets, including investors
large and small, stock analysts, business journalists and public
companies in the United States and maybe even abroad.
<P>
   ``This is a landmark event, one of the most important rulings
the SEC has ever made,'' says Mark Coker, founder and president of
BestCalls.com, a Los Gatos Web site that lists company conference
calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will send a strong statement to the rest of the world,''
he adds. ``It's a global investment community. Markets that do the
best job of protecting investors will be able to compete most
effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   The rule approved yesterday, dubbed Regulation FD, won't exactly
level the playing field, but it will make it less tilted by
requiring companies to disclose ``material'' information to
everyone at once.
</P>
<P>
   This will change the cozy and sometimes strained relationships
between companies and the analysts who follow their stocks.
</P>
<P>
   It could put a damper on investment conferences that are open
only to brokerage firms' favored clients.
</P>
<P>
   It will encourage more companies to let the public in on the
conference calls they hold with analysts after announcing earnings.
</P>
<P>
   And small mutual funds will be able to get the same information
from companies as behemoths like Janus and Fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   But the most immediate impact will be on the nature of stock
research.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of waiting for CFOs to spoon-feed them earnings
estimates, analysts will have to spend more time talking with a
company's plant managers, suppliers, competitors and customers.
</P>
<P>
   They'll have to do research ``the real way, as opposed to the
guidance way,'' says John Skeen, director of portfolio strategy
with Banc of America Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Roper, director of investor protection for the Consumer
Federation of America, agrees. ``I think it returns security
analysts to their role of analyzing the information, and not just
scooping the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though they didn't support it, ``a lot of companies
secretly appreciate this new regulation,'' says Coker. ``It gives
them the strength to push back on analysts who are going over the
line, putting pressure on companies with a veiled threat that if
they don't provide (nonpublic) information, they won't get a buy
rating.''
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, analysts might be more willing to criticize a
company without fear of getting cut out of the information loop.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of dirty pool that takes place between companies
and analysts,'' says Coker.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect a sudden surge of sell signals. Analysts will
still have to worry about alienating companies that might give
their employers some investment banking business.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, investors won't have to rely as much on analyst
ratings if they can get more information firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   Already, more companies are opening their conference calls to
the public, and Reg FD will surely accelerate the trend.
</P>
<P>
   Coker estimates that about half of U.S. companies hold
conference calls with analysts following earnings releases. Of
those that do, about 75 percent provide some sort of public access,
up from 25 percent a year and half ago.
</P>
<P>
   This access may take one of four forms: live or replay, by phone
or via audio Webcast. Individual investors are rarely allowed to
ask questions, buy they might hear unpublished information that
could move a stock.
</P>
<P>
   Coker says investors should listen closely for information about
international operations, management changes, competitive
pressures, market share, profit margins and _ these days _ staffing
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can learn so much listening to management,'' Coker adds.
``Are they articulate? Do they inspire you? Do they put you to
sleep? Are they fumbling around for answers? Are they upbeat or
downbeat? Management's mood is material information, and it's not
regulated by Regulation FD.''
</P>
<P>
   Once they get comfortable with public conference calls, Coker
predicts that many companies will start promoting them as marketing
tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``As many companies opened up calls, they realized that it
allows them to retake control of their message; to define it their
own words instead of the analysts' or media.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its potential for real change, Regulation FD has enough
exceptions that it's not likely to staunch the flow of information,
as some opponents charged.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, investors won't be able to file private lawsuits
against companies that violate the regulation. Only the SEC can
take enforcement action.
</P>
<P>
   That's a disappointment, but not a surprise, to consumer groups.
``Regulators are always underfunded ... and these are the kind of
regulations that don't get aggressively enforced,'' Roper says.
</P>
<P>
   It also applies only to senior management, investor relations
people and others who ``regularly communicate'' with market
professionals and shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   That means a plant manager who tells an analyst that production
is slowing down can't be nailed by the SEC _ although he could be
in hot water with his boss.
</P>
<P>
   Reg FD also doesn't apply to information selectively disclosed
to journalists. Apparently the SEC decided that when you tell a
reporter something, you're telling the world.
</P>
<P>
   The rule also exempts rating agencies like Moody's and Standard
&AMP; Poor's, who convinced the SEC they couldn't do their job without
inside information.
</P>
<P>
   The regulation does not apply to ``road shows'' or any other
communication associated with an initial or follow-on stock
offering.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest loophole says that if a top officer
accidentally leaks information that turns out to be material, the
company has 24 hours or until the next market opening, whichever is
later, to publicly disseminate the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-four hours is a lifetime in today's market,'' Roper
says. ``You have to have some mechanism for people who make honest
mistakes. But distinguishing between an honest mistake and an
intentional violation of the law is not an easy thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its shortcomings, Hardy Colcott, general counsel with
Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., says the rule may have the intended effect of
bringing more investors into the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a subset of people in the country today who don't
invest in the securities markets because they feel they're unfair
for individual investors,'' he says. The rule ``will give them the
feeling they won't be left out.''
</P>
<P>
   JANUS WATCH: Now that Jim Craig is leaving Janus, should
shareholders follow?
</P>
<P>
   Not yet, according to experts I called yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Craig was Janus' chief investment officer and one of the
masterminds behind the company's smashing success.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Janus raked in $32 billion or 28 percent of all new
money going into U.S. equity funds, according to AMG Data Services.
This year, it brought in $35.4 billion, or 20 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   ``Craig's leaving is not a reason to pull your money out of
Janus,'' says Jeremy DeGroot of the No-Load Fund Analyst
newsletter. ``Craig and (chief executive Thomas) Bailey have built
a really solid team of analysts and portfolio managers, an
investment approach and a process. It's a self-sustaining
organization now.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he adds, ``if other portfolio managers leave in the
next few months, then I'd be concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret that the Janus folks are unhappy that former
parent Kansas City Southern Industries spun off Janus along with a
bunch of other financial companies instead of separately.
</P>
<P>
   Although Craig insisted he didn't leave because of the spin-off,
DeGroot says other managers might.
</P>
<P>
   The managers to keep an eye on, he says, include Helen Young
Hayes (Janus Worldwide), Scott Schoelzel (Janus 20), Warren Lammert
(Janus Mercury) and Jim Goff (Janus Enterprise).
</P>
<P>
   Russ Kinnel, director of fund analysis with Morningstar, agrees.
``As long as everyone else is staying put, I don't see any reason''
to dump Janus funds. ``But we've been watching this strife with
Kansas City Southern and everyone is nervous to see if anyone else
is leaving.''

GAP'S EARNINGS SINK AGAIN AS OLD NAVY UNIT UNDERPERFORMS  &HT;     BY CAROL EMERT
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ Going from bad to worse, San Francisco's Gap Inc.
said Thursday that its problems could stretch through the end of
the year, for four straight quarters of earnings disappointments.
<P>
   The warning was based on preliminary data for the third quarter
showing that traffic at the company's Old Navy division has
continued to lag in the third quarter, which started July 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course this is very, very early in the (third) quarter,
with a lot of time left for results to change,'' said Chief
Financial Officer Heidi Kunz in a conference call with analysts
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, ``If current trends were to continue, earnings in
the third quarter could be at or below last year (35 cents per
share) and fourth quarter could be slightly below consensus,'' 57
cents per share, Kunz said. ``You should know that the current
environment is uncertain.''
</P>
<P>
   Gap shares dropped 14 percent Thursday to close at a 52-week low
of $27. Several analysts lowered their recommendations on Gap stock
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Gap's second-quarter earnings came in at 21 cents per share, the
consensus estimate after two warnings by the company about
continued problems at Old Navy. Initially, analysts forecast 26
cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Second-quarter net earnings dropped 6 percent to $184 million as
the company marked down large amounts of inventory at all three of
its chains: Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Sales at stores open at least a year, called comparable-store
sales, declined 2 percent, with Old Navy posting a drop in the low
double digits versus a jump in the low 20s in the second quarter of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Gap store sales rose in the mid single digits while sales at
mature Banana Republic stores remained flat compared with a year
ago. Companywide sales jumped 20 percent to $2.95 billion as the
company's store count rose 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Company chief executive Mickey Drexler characterized the
problems at Old Navy as growing pains after an extraordinary
five-year run.
</P>
<P>
   The low-price chain has been suffering since July from
logistical problems that prevented merchandise from being sorted
and shipped to stores in a timely fashion, Drexler said in the
conference call.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ``We think the stores lack a little bit of the
energy and excitement that they have had and we're working on that
to improve it,'' Drexler said.
</P>
<P>
   A key challenge for Old Navy is to soften its emphasis on
teenage fashions such as cargo pants and do a better job of selling
to parents, Drexler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happened is, we have this very successful kids'
business, so the parents were in there (but) they couldn't find
clothes'' for themselves, Drexler said. To meet this demand, Old
Navy has begun rolling out adult collections that are appropriate
for work, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Gap, too, third-quarter marketing efforts will focus more on
completing sales among customers who are already in stores than in
getting more people in the door.
</P>
<P>
   The company is dropping Gap adult television advertising for the
quarter and instead emphasizing in-store promotions for its ``shop
card,'' which provides a $20 discount for people who buy $100 worth
of merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, Old Navy will begin a two-week denim promotion and
a ``techno chino'' ad campaign starring spokeswoman Carrie Donovan.
Both campaigns will highlight the store's low-price points, a
message that has been getting lost, Drexler said.
</P>
<P>
   Kunz said Thursday that Gap Inc.'s total square footage would
grow close to 30 percent this year, compared with an early estimate
of about 25 percent, largely due to more Old Navy openings during
the fourth quarter than forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts in the conference call questioned the wisdom of
accelerating new Old Navy stores in light of the chain's problems.
</P>
<P>
   But Kunz said the openings were a result of being ``far more
successful in our real estate negotiations this year'' than
expected. Drexler said the long-term prospects for Old Navy remain
strong, so he is not worried about the additional stores.
</P>
<P>
   As of July 29, Gap Inc. ran 1,885 U.S. Gap stores, 454
international locations (mostly Gaps), 365 Banana Republics and 580
Old Navys.

FLAG PROMPTS REQUEST TO MOVE NCAA FINAL FOUR OUT OF GEORGIA 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the executive committee of the National Collegiate Athletic
Association meets in Indianapolis Friday, it will consider a
request to move three of its basketball championships from Atlanta
because Georgia uses the Confederate battle symbol as part of its
state flag.
</P>
<P>
   The request, made by the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference, calls for the NCAA to change the site of the men's
Final Four in 2002 and 2007 and the women's Final Four in 2003. The
request was made in a letter from Martin Luther King III, the
president and chief executive officer of the SCLC, to Cedric
Dempsey, the president of the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes of Georgia said in a statement Thursday that the
matter ``is a difficult issue about which discussions are
ongoing.'' He said removing the Final Four events from Georgia
would be unproductive and that ``actions like this do nothing but
inflame and excite emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, which was sent to Dempsey on Tuesday, King said
that the SCLC has requested that the flag be changed by March 31,
2001. Only the Georgia Legislature can authorize a change in the
design of the flag, a spokesman for the governor said. The
Legislature does not meet again until January.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to Dempsey, King said the Confederate flag
``symbolizes brutality, death to people of color and racism.''

SPECIAL BOEING AUDIT FINDS MORE THAN 100 PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SEATTLE _ A special audit by the Federal Aviation Administration
of The Boeing Co.'s airplane production and design system
identified more than 100 specific problems, the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer has learned.
</P>
<P>
   The audit found that the production and quality control woes
that have plagued Boeing over the past year resulted from systemic
breakdowns and were not just isolated instances.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the many problems uncovered, the federal agency
sent five separate letters of investigation to Boeing, an
unprecedented action that sources said reflects the agency's
concerns about the scope and seriousness of the findings.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, the FAA announced that it had proposed a record
$1.24 million in civil penalties against Boeing for inadequate
supplier oversight and for failing to quickly report cracked parts
on two older jetliners. Those incidents occurred two to three years
ago, and were unrelated to the special FAA audit.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Boeing nor the FAA would comment Thursday on the
specific findings of the special audit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, if the FAA had found anything where the flying public
would be at risk, they and Boeing would have taken immediate
action, and no such action was required,'' said Liz Otis, vice
president of quality for Boeing's commercial airplane operations.
</P>
<P>
   But in response to the audit, Boeing has crafted a sweeping
corrective action plan that will be implemented in several stages,
according documents obtained by the Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear if the special audit will result in
additional proposed fines against Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   The ``special technical audit'' was launched by a team of FAA
inspectors last December to scrutinize Boeing's aircraft
manufacturing processes after a string of highly publicized
assembly-line mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   It was completed earlier this year, but Boeing and the FAA have
refused to disclose the findings, pending FAA approval of the
aerospace giant's plan to correct the problems identified during
the audit.
</P>
<P>
   That plan has undergone several revisions and is now being
reviewed by FAA officials in Washington, D.C. A spokesman for the
agency said Thursday it could be several weeks or longer before any
findings of the audit are made public.
</P>
<P>
   The Post-Intelligencer, however, has obtained internal Boeing
documents that outline the company's proposed corrective action
plan. The documents also provide some detail of what the special
audit found.
</P>
<P>
   The audit documented 87 specific problems or ``findings'' with
Boeing's production system, and 20 more problems with the company's
engineering design work.
</P>
<P>
   Findings included a range of problems from parts not conforming
to specifications to workers not following approved procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The documents do not go into detail about those 107 findings.
But they include the following ``executive summary'' of the
findings:
</P>
<P>
   _Insufficient processees.
</P>
<P>
   _Overly complex and incomplete processes.
</P>
<P>
   _Processes not followed.
</P>
<P>
   _Requirements not followed.
</P>
<P>
   _Inadequate manufacturing planning.
</P>
<P>
   _Inadequate inspections to assure comformity.
</P>
<P>
   _Personnel not knowledgable of requirements.
</P>
<P>
   _Evidence of some non-compliances _ parts being relaesed and
delivered.
</P>
<P>
   _Evidence of some non-conforming parts released and delivered.
</P>
<P>
   The audit triggered five letters of investigation to Boeing from
the FAA, according to the documents.
</P>
<P>
   An FAA letter of investigation is a formal notification of the
findings of an audit and requires Boeing to investigate and take
corrective action.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA routinely audits Boeing's airplane production system,
but it has never before issued multiple letters of investigation in
response to a single audit. It did so this time to communicate to
Boeing the agency's strong concerns about the scope of the
findings, as well as to group the findings into categories, said a
Boeing source with knowledge of the audit.
</P>
<P>
   Those five letters, according to the documents, grouped the 87
production-related findings into the following broader categories:
</P>
<P>
   _Inadequate work instructions.
</P>
<P>
   _Personnel not complying with drawing/planning.
</P>
<P>
   _Insufficient inspections.
</P>
<P>
   _Personnel not aware of or able to access needed information.
</P>
<P>
   _Products not conforming to requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's Otis said Thursday that the company has taken steps to
correct problems found by the FAA audit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took some very appropriate and immediate steps,'' she said,
adding that Boeing is continuing to coordinate further corrective
action with the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   Otis would not comment on the action plan outlined in the
documents obtained by the newspaper, other than to say there have
been significant changes to the proposed plan from an earlier
draft. And there could be still more changes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing source who gave the documents to the newspaper said
the action plan outlined is the latest version submitted to the FAA
for approval.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the proposed plan would establish 10
``conformity'' teams for each of Boeing's airplane programs _ the
737 and 757 programs in Renton, Wash., and the 767, 777 and 747
programs in Everett, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Those teams, according to the documents, would consist of a
Boeing quality representive, a manufacturing engineer, a design
engineer and a mechanic. The teams would make hundreds of checks
and collect data for later analysis. That analysis will eventually
result in what Boeing describes as ``systemic process
improvements.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has prepared a list of frequently asked questions and
answers for members of those teams and others.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the question ``What specifically is going on
here?'' Boeing wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Each program and several components organizations will have
teams on the factory floor performing both a paper audit of our
production system requirements and how they flow down from drawing
to specifications to work instruction as well as a check of the
completed job for how it comforms to those requirements. The teams
will also be talking with the mechanic, the planner, the
manufacturing engineer and the design engineer about how our system
can be improved.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to another question, Boeing wrote:``The FAA helped
us identify what systemic issues we have and need to improve.''
</P>
<P>
   When the special audit was announced in December, FAA senior
manager John Hickey said the agency was taking action to determine
the ``root cause'' of what had been a series of highly publicized
production problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last few months, we have seen episodes of breakdown
and we want to find the root cause of what happened in each of
these cases,'' Hickey said then. ``We want to find out whether
these are isolated episodes or systemic in nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Those breakdowns included:
</P>
<P>
   _Improperly tightened bolts that hold the massive tail to the
fuselage of the 767. The problem was caused by mechanics using
improperly calibrated tools to tighten bolts.
</P>
<P>
   _Improper use of an adhesive that did not meet federal
flammability standards. It was used on air ducts and on a part in
the cockpit of all Boeing models but the 737.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fuel tanks on new airplanes were improperly cleaned before
they were loaded with fuel for the first time, which caused the
paint to flake.
</P>
<P>
   Mistakes continued to be found even after the audit was
completed in February.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Boeing reported that portions of 27 of its 747 jumbo
jets were improperly fitted with rivets. That problem surfaced
shortly after Boeing found that some nuts were not properly
tightened on a key flight control mechanism in the tail of the
company's next-generation 737 jetliners, including some jets
already in service. The loose nuts could result in a loss of
control during landing or takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to problems on its assembly lines, Boeing in recent
months increased scrutiny of its suppliers after several
embarrassing quality control lapses resulted in defective parts
being installed on its airplanes, from faulty fasteners to bad fuel
tank supports.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Thursday if the FAA audit reflects systemic problems with
Boeing's production and quality control system, Otis said:
</P>
<P>
   ``We agree that our process can be enhanced to be more effective
and efficient and we are working toward that in full coordination
with the FAA. ... But we continue to stand by the intergrity of our
quality system and believe the excellent safety record of our
products clearly validates that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the best record in the industry and its the best
record in any industry.''

EDITORIAL: WHEN TIRES START BLOWING APART  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Aug. 11:
</P>
<P>
   There are too few public facts to know for sure whether
Bridgestone/Firestone or Ford Motor Co. waited too long to recall
tires that may have caused hundreds of accidents, 80 injuries and
46 deaths in the United States alone. But what is known is deeply
troubling.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone/Firestone recalled about 6.5 million tires this week
because they are prone to shedding their treads. The company says
it does not know why the specific models of tires in question are
plagued by problems. But it decided to recall the tires anyway in
the wake of mounting complaints, a federal investigation and dozens
of lawsuits. The recall is expected to cost more than $300 million,
and that does not count the potentially huge liability costs.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints, however, are hardly news to either company. Both
have settled lawsuits over tire problems, imposing a gag rule on
plaintiffs as a condition for cash rewards, so that word of the
cases never reached the public or federal safety officials. In the
past year Ford has recalled tires in Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and
several other countries in hot-climate zones, yet continued to
install them on vehicles in the United States.
Bridgestone/Firestone has provided replacement tires for customers
whose tires failed during the warranty period, yet the company did
nothing to protect its other customers until this week.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, any time that a product is recalled as defective it
gives rise to the question ``why not earlier?'' Ford says that the
tire failures abroad appeared to reflect unusual driving conditions
_ high-speed travel in very hot climates in overloaded vehicles on
underinflated tires _ unlike those in the United States.
Bridgestone/Firestone says its complaint records did not reveal a
disturbing pattern. The National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration launched an investigation only in May of this year
because it received too few consumer complaints to establish an
unusual trend of accidents.
</P>
<P>
   But before Bridgestone/Firestone or Ford can re-establish
credibility with the public, they must provide reassuring answers
to some critical questions. Was Ford's dismissal of the relevance
of crashes abroad cavalier given that most of the accidents in this
country seem to have occurred under hot driving conditions in the
South that may have mirrored some of the conditions abroad? As for
regulatory responsibilities, manufacturers are required to report
defective products to the safety administration. Did
Bridgestone/Firestone comb its warranty data and other records
carefully enough?
</P>
<P>
   At least one consumer safety advocate does not think so.
Clarence Ditlow of the Center for Auto Safety says data that his
organization has collected suggests that the number of complaints
and the failure rate on the suspect tires far exceed levels that
should trigger a recall.
</P>
<P>
   Some lessons emerge even without a final accounting of the
facts. Ford says that in the future it will inspect warranty data
on the tires it installs on its vehicles, a sensible practice that
might have cut short this problem. By the same logic, the safety
administration, and Congress, should examine whether manufacturers
should be required to submit summaries of warranty information to
federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The safety administration appears understaffed and
underfinanced, hampering its ability to react to such crises. The
agency collects reports on fatalities and accidents, but they are
not nearly exhaustive enough to reveal disturbing patterns before
outsiders bring complaints to their attention. That too deserves
serious review. Had it not been for a Houston television report on
the problem that triggered a spate of complaints to the agency
earlier this year, most drivers would still be unaware of the
danger.

that have plagued Boeing over the past year resulted from systemic
breakdowns and were not just isolated instances.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the many problems uncovered, the federal agency
sent five separate letters of investigation to Boeing, an
unprecedented action that sources said reflects the agency's
concerns about the scope and seriousness of the findings.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, the FAA announced that it had proposed a record
$1.24 million in civil penalties against Boeing for inadequate
supplier oversight and for failing to quickly report cracked parts
on two older jetliners. Those incidents occurred two to three years
ago, and were unrelated to the special FAA audit.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Boeing nor the FAA would comment Thursday on the
specific findings of the special audit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, if the FAA had found anything where the flying public
would be at risk, they and Boeing would have taken immediate
action, and no such action was required,'' said Liz Otis, vice
president of quality for Boeing's commercial airplane operations.
</P>
<P>
   But in response to the audit, Boeing has crafted a sweeping
corrective action plan that will be implemented in several stages,
according documents obtained by the Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear if the special audit will result in
additional proposed fines against Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   The ``special technical audit'' was launched by a team of FAA
inspectors last December to scrutinize Boeing's aircraft
manufacturing processes after a string of highly publicized
assembly-line mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   It was completed earlier this year, but Boeing and the FAA have
refused to disclose the findings, pending FAA approval of the
aerospace giant's plan to correct the problems identified during
the audit.
</P>
<P>
   That plan has undergone several revisions and is now being
reviewed by FAA officials in Washington, D.C. A spokesman for the
agency said Thursday it could be several weeks or longer before any
findings of the audit are made public.
</P>
<P>
   The Post-Intelligencer, however, has obtained internal Boeing
documents that outline the company's proposed corrective action
plan. The documents also provide some detail of what the special
audit found.
</P>
<P>
   The audit documented 87 specific problems or ``findings'' with
Boeing's production system, and 20 more problems with the company's
engineering design work.
</P>
<P>
   Findings included a range of problems from parts not conforming
to specifications to workers not following approved procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The documents do not go into detail about those 107 findings.
But they include the following ``executive summary'' of the
findings:
</P>
<P>
   _Insufficient processees.
</P>
<P>
   _Overly complex and incomplete processes.
</P>
<P>
   _Processes not followed.
</P>
<P>
   _Requirements not followed.
</P>
<P>
   _Inadequate manufacturing planning.
</P>
<P>
   _Inadequate inspections to assure comformity.
</P>
<P>
   _Personnel not knowledgable of requirements.
</P>
<P>
   _Evidence of some non-compliances _ parts being relaesed and
delivered.
</P>
<P>
   _Evidence of some non-conforming parts released and delivered.
</P>
<P>
   The audit triggered five letters of investigation to Boeing from
the FAA, according to the documents.
</P>
<P>
   An FAA letter of investigation is a formal notification of the
findings of an audit and requires Boeing to investigate and take
corrective action.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA routinely audits Boeing's airplane production system,
but it has never before issued multiple letters of investigation in
response to a single audit. It did so this time to communicate to
Boeing the agency's strong concerns about the scope of the
findings, as well as to group the findings into categories, said a
Boeing source with knowledge of the audit.
</P>
<P>
   Those five letters, according to the documents, grouped the 87
production-related findings into the following broader categories:
</P>
<P>
   _Inadequate work instructions.
</P>
<P>
   _Personnel not complying with drawing/planning.
</P>
<P>
   _Insufficient inspections.
</P>
<P>
   _Personnel not aware of or able to access needed information.
</P>
<P>
   _Products not conforming to requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's Otis said Thursday that the company has taken steps to
correct problems found by the FAA audit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took some very appropriate and immediate steps,'' she said,
adding that Boeing is continuing to coordinate further corrective
action with the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   Otis would not comment on the action plan outlined in the
documents obtained by the newspaper, other than to say there have
been significant changes to the proposed plan from an earlier
draft. And there could be still more changes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing source who gave the documents to the newspaper said
the action plan outlined is the latest version submitted to the FAA
for approval.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the proposed plan would establish 10
``conformity'' teams for each of Boeing's airplane programs _ the
737 and 757 programs in Renton, Wash., and the 767, 777 and 747
programs in Everett, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Those teams, according to the documents, would consist of a
Boeing quality representive, a manufacturing engineer, a design
engineer and a mechanic. The teams would make hundreds of checks
and collect data for later analysis. That analysis will eventually
result in what Boeing describes as ``systemic process
improvements.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has prepared a list of frequently asked questions and
answers for members of those teams and others.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the question ``What specifically is going on
here?'' Boeing wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Each program and several components organizations will have
teams on the factory floor performing both a paper audit of our
production system requirements and how they flow down from drawing
to specifications to work instruction as well as a check of the
completed job for how it comforms to those requirements. The teams
will also be talking with the mechanic, the planner, the
manufacturing engineer and the design engineer about how our system
can be improved.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to another question, Boeing wrote:``The FAA helped
us identify what systemic issues we have and need to improve.''
</P>
<P>
   When the special audit was announced in December, FAA senior
manager John Hickey said the agency was taking action to determine
the ``root cause'' of what had been a series of highly publicized
production problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last few months, we have seen episodes of breakdown
and we want to find the root cause of what happened in each of
these cases,'' Hickey said then. ``We want to find out whether
these are isolated episodes or systemic in nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Those breakdowns included:
</P>
<P>
   _Improperly tightened bolts that hold the massive tail to the
fuselage of the 767. The problem was caused by mechanics using
improperly calibrated tools to tighten bolts.
</P>
<P>
   _Improper use of an adhesive that did not meet federal
flammability standards. It was used on air ducts and on a part in
the cockpit of all Boeing models but the 737.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fuel tanks on new airplanes were improperly cleaned before
they were loaded with fuel for the first time, which caused the
paint to flake.
</P>
<P>
   Mistakes continued to be found even after the audit was
completed in February.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Boeing reported that portions of 27 of its 747 jumbo
jets were improperly fitted with rivets. That problem surfaced
shortly after Boeing found that some nuts were not properly
tightened on a key flight control mechanism in the tail of the
company's next-generation 737 jetliners, including some jets
already in service. The loose nuts could result in a loss of
control during landing or takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to problems on its assembly lines, Boeing in recent
months increased scrutiny of its suppliers after several
embarrassing quality control lapses resulted in defective parts
being installed on its airplanes, from faulty fasteners to bad fuel
tank supports.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Thursday if the FAA audit reflects systemic problems with
Boeing's production and quality control system, Otis said:
</P>
<P>
   ``We agree that our process can be enhanced to be more effective
and efficient and we are working toward that in full coordination
with the FAA. ... But we continue to stand by the intergrity of our
quality system and believe the excellent safety record of our
products clearly validates that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the best record in the industry and its the best
record in any industry.''

A POLISH ELECTION VEXED BY COMMUNIST SPIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By TINA ROSENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until Thursday, Poland's presidential election on Oct. 8 seemed
unlikely to turn on agriculture, pensions or any other subject
Poles seriously worry about. The most important issue was the
identity of ``Alek'' and ``Bolek'' _ code names belonging to
supposed domestic spies of 15 and 30 years ago, culled from deep in
the secret police archives.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1998 law, signed by President Aleksander Kwasniewski,
informers who do not come clean about their past cannot hold high
government posts _ and ``Alek'' was alleged to be Kwasniewski
himself, an overwhelming favorite to win re-election if he is
allowed to run. ``Bolek,'' moreover, is allegedly one of his
competitors and the hero of Poland's liberation from communism,
former president Lech Walesa.
</P>
<P>
   Kwasniewski was cleared Thursday. A special court may rule
Friday on the fate of Walesa. As Poland is learning from these
cases, screening laws, which are designed to strengthen democracy,
do not always do so. They lend themselves to manipulation by
unscrupulous politicians. What has happened in Poland now may be a
tale not of Communist-era spying, but of present-day political
intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Poland decided to emulate the Czech Republic and pass a
law to keep former secret police agents out of government. In
Poland, officials must declare whether they were informers. Only
those found to be lying lose their jobs. Kwasniewski and Walesa
said they were not spies, and so risked losing the right to run.
</P>
<P>
   Accusations of spying have brought down two recent governments.
In January 1996, Prime Minister Jozef Olesky resigned after being
accused of spying for the KGB. Three months later, prosecutors
dropped the charges after finding that the evidence was flawed. In
1992, by contrast, it was the accusers who fell. Antoni
Macierewicz, the interior minister of a right-wing government,
released a list of 64 people he said the secret police files named
as spies _ among them the prime minister's most important political
adversaries, including Walesa, who was then president. A
parliamentary committee later concluded that only six of the 64 had
signed any agreement to collaborate _ Walesa not among them. The
government fell. But Macierewicz is one of Walesa's accusers today.
</P>
<P>
   The accusation that Lech Walesa was a paid informant illustrates
the absurdity of screening laws. Walesa has long admitted that in
1970 he signed some documents he was not particularly proud of. But
he says he never promised collaboration and never informed.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Walesa, who specialized in telling people what they
wanted to hear, was perfectly capable of signing anything and then
behaving as he pleased. His calculated duplicity was so effective
that at the height of the Solidarity movement, top Communist
leaders were convinced he could be won over. The strategy served
him _ and the foes of communism _ well.
</P>
<P>
   The documents could also be fakes. Secret police officials often
cooked up files to blackmail dissidents. Walesa says he saw
versions of the same documents in 1992, and they have been altered
to be more incriminating today.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Kwasniewski had been an informer, that would be
irrelevant today. He presided over Poland's accession to NATO.
Poland today is the economic success story of the former East Bloc.
Despite the allegations of spying, Kwasniewski remained the choice
of a majority of voters. Throwing him off the ballot would be
undemocratic.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the accusations may be no accident. In March 1999,
investigators requested Kwasniewski's file from Poland's current
security service. Poland's parliamentary government is led by a
center-right party opposed to both Kwasniewski and Walesa. But the
file was presented to the court only now, shortly before the
election.
</P>
<P>
   The proper way for Poland, and every other nation, to deal with
its secret police files is to open them in a depoliticized manner.
The files should go to an independent historical commission.
Individuals should be able to see their own files, as in Germany.
Access to their files has enabled the victims there to understand
the havoc wreaked on their lives, to find out which of their
friends did not spy, and to begin dialogues with those ``friends''
and colleagues who did _ dialogues that have turned into important
national conversations about the nature of collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   Poland, which is planning to open its files to individuals next
year, needs this kind of discussion as well. It should abandon the
current screening law, which can be easily used for political
attacks based on questionable evidence.

   NIGERIA-OIL (Oviri-Court, Nigeria) _ The Niger Delta of Nigeria,
one of the world's top oil producers, has for years been the center
of violent despair. The swampy patch of land yields almost all of
Nigeria's 2 million barrels of crude a day, most of which ends up
at gas stations in the United States. But because of this country's
complicated history of ethnic politics, its inhabitants have
remained stunningly and desperately poor. And in gruesome displays
of that poverty, hundreds have been burned to death in recent weeks
in at least five explosions as they tried to scoop up fuel. By

himself expelled by them in turn. He was assigned to a church in
Kosovo Polje, a largely Serbian town, but it was badly damaged by
hand grenades a year ago. About a month ago it was attacked again
and reduced to rubble. Now Panic serves at the last remaining
church in Kosovo Polje, the Church of St. Nicholas, which is

even some old friends in the process by presenting himself as more
conservative than he was. In that race, Gore's first job was to
differentiate himself from his father, Sen. Albert Gore, just as in
this one, the vice president must separate himself from another

Researchers have found that fervent fans become so tied to their
teams that they experience hormonal surges and other physiological
changes while watching games, much as the athletes themselves do.
Testosterone levels in male fans go up significantly after their
team wins and drop sharply after a loss, one study found. And while
science has not yet grappled rigorously with the broad question of
whether rooting avidly for a team is good or bad for someone's
health, there are early clues, some of them surprising. By James

biography (the classic ``Thayer's Life of Beethoven,'' perhaps, as
revised and edited by Elliot Forbes) and an LP set of the
symphonies and you thought you had a fix on the composer. Now the
book and CD shelves groan, yet Beethoven seems to grow only more
