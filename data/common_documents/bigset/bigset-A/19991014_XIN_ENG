<HEADLINE> Leukemia-Hit Nyerere Can't Recover: Doctors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 13 (Xinhua) - Tanzanian founding
president Julius Nyerere, struggling with Leukemia in a London
hospital, was announced by doctors as slipping into a deep coma, a
presidential press release said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"After intensive consultations the doctors have now informed us
formally that the stroke is so severe that he can not recover,"
the statement said. " His condition is very critical."
</P>
<P>
As there was no improvement in the conscious level by Monday, a
CT head scan was performed on the 77-year-old the Father of the
Nation, said the statement signed by Geoffrey Nkurlu, Press
Secretary to Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa.
</P>
<P>
"According to the doctors, the results showed an extensive
stroke (sub- arachnoid haemorrhage)," said the brief release
issued at 20:30 local time (1730GMT).
</P>
<P>
Nyerere was admitted in the St Thomas Hospital in London
September 24 and kept under the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for
rescue operation following his condition deteriorated on October
1.
</P>
<P>
Under the life-support machine, Nyerery has since remained
unconscious and his condition became from bad to worse.
</P>
<P>
His wife Maria and six sons and daughters were at his bed
together with Tanzanian Minister for Regional Administration and
Local Governments Kingunge Ngombale-Mwiru and other officials.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa has been urging his people to pray for
Nyerere's recovery since his admission and the Tanzanians were all
anxiously waiting for any news from London.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, diagnosed as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or blood
cancer, during checkups last year, developed jaundice and other
complications that deteriorated his health at a very quick pace.
</P>
<P>
Born in the town of Butiama, Tanganyika in 1922, Nyerere led
the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) to win an
independence from British colonial rule in 1961.
</P>
<P>
He also united Tanganyika and Zanzibar as one republic in 1964
and became its first president until he retired in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, who preferred to be called Mwalimu in Kiswahili or
teacher in English, has been a prominent leader on many
Pan-African issues. He has successfully assembled the warring
factions of Burundi to start a tortuous peace process.

<HEADLINE> Air Botswana to Upgrade Fleet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Air Botswana plans to step
up upgrading of its fleet after a suicide pilot Monday wiped out
three of its four planes, South African Press Association reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Grounded airline captain Chris Phatshwe, 33, Monday flew one of
the airline's three ATR42s into the other two, which were parked
on the apron at Sir Seretse Khama Airport in Gaborone.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft are expected to be replaced by the end of the
month, Air Botswana general manager Joshua Galeforolwe told a
press conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Commercial manager John Williams said no decision on the type
of aircraft to be acquired had been made, but it was unlikely the
airline would change from the French-made ATRs it used previously.
</P>
<P>
"We have the spares, the crews, it makes sense," he said.
</P>
<P>
The airline did not expect this to interrupt its plans to
privatize.
</P>
<P>
"We are in phase one, examining the way to go. This should take
four to five months. Then we have to identify a partner, negotiate
and close the deal," Galeforolwe said. "This should take another
seven months."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Galeforolwe said the airline had leased three HS748s
from airlines in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, South Africa Air Express Airways would fly on the
core Botswana to Johannesburg route.
</P>
<P>
"This is a short term measure," he said.
</P>
<P>
Galeforolwe also said Phatshwe, who was an experienced pilot
and a captain since 1995 after joining the airline in 1987, was
ill at the time of his suicide and had been grounded in August.
</P>
<P>
"He was obviously very disturbed by this," Galeforolwe said.
</P>
<P>
Phatshwe was doing ground duty as the airline's air safety
officer, which allowed him continued access to aircraft on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
It was using this authority that early on Monday morning he
entered a parked ATR42 being readied for a 1,000-kilometer round
trip to Francistown in northeast Botswana.
</P>
<P>
"He used the pretext of a safety inspection of the aircraft,"
Galeforolwe said.
</P>
<P>
Phatshwe took off immediately and was airborne for 90 minutes
before crashing into two other ATR42s.
</P>
<P>
Galeforolwe confirmed that Phatshwe had asked to speak to
Botswana President Festus Mogae, who was out of the country, about
his grounding. Vice president Ian Khama had agreed to speak to
him.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses say Phatshwe's girlfriend was brought to the
airport during the incident. She pleaded with him not to kill
himself and to land instead. She witnessed the crash and went into
immediate shock.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Official Optimistic for Peace in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of Commerce
William Daley on Wednesday expressed optimism about a new chapter of
peace in the Middle East which he said will bring prosperity to
the people in the region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon arrival at Cairo International
Airport, Daley said he is more optimistic about the realization
of peace in the region than ever before.
</P>
<P>
Peace will "provide economic stability and jobs for the people
of the Middle East," he added.
</P>
<P>
Daley is leading a delegation of 12 representatives of medical,
financial, engineering and telecommunications companies for a
two-day visit to Egypt, part of a regional tour that has taken
him to Jordan, the Palestinian self-rule areas and Israel.
</P>
<P>
He will also travel to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian officials have voiced welcome to the U.S. official's
visit. Minister of Home Trade and Supply Hassan Khedr said on
Tuesday that Daley's visit is aimed at strengthening the bilateral
trade, investment and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
His trip is "of special importance in light of the two
countries' efforts to further promote their trade and investment
relations," Khedr said.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Daley is expected to meet with President
Hosni Mubarak, Prime Minister Atef Ebeid, Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa and Minister of Economy and Foreign Trade to discuss ways
of expanding the U.S.-Egyptian commercial ties, according to a
press release issued by the U.S. embassy in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is one of the closest allies of the U.S. in the Middle
East. The trade volume stood at 4.26 billion U.S. dollars between
the two countries in 1998, with Egyptian exports being at 660
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has so far invested around 2 billion dollars in Egypt,
making it the largest investor of the country. Cairo hopes to
increase exports to 1 billion dollars in 2000 and that the
U.S. will raise and diversify its investments.

<HEADLINE> 30 Drug Smugglers Caught in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian police
captured 30 prominent drug smugglers wanted in the United States
in a great roundup throughout the country on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The detention of the drug smugglers was part of an
international operation code named "Millenium", which also involved
Mexico and Ecuador, in addition to Colombia, said Director of the
Colombian police General Rosso Serrano.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 Colombian police, with the help from the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency
(DEA) participated in the roundup, which began at midnight local
time and ended 6 hours later.
</P>
<P>
The cities of Santafe de Bogota, Medellin and Cali were the
principal places where the detentions took place.
</P>
<P>
Among those captured were Fabio Ochoa Vazquez (Medellin),
Alejandro Bernal Madrigal, Luis Revelon Arcila and Jaime Gonzalez
Castiblanco (Santafe de Bogota), as well as Elver Villafanales
(Cali), the Director of police said.
</P>
<P>
Ochoa belonged to a clan associated to the former drug cartel
of Medellin, headed by Pablo Escobar Gaviria, who died in 1993
during a police operation.
</P>
<P>
According to Rosso Serrano, operation "Millenium" was the most
effective attack on the drug smuggling operations in Colombia
since the breakup of the Medellin and Cali cartels.
</P>
<P>
The roundup followed a full year of investigation, and the
detainees may be extradited to the United States, he added.
</P>
<P>
The police chief delivered a complete description of the
operation to the Colombian president Andres Pastrana Arango on
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Bulgaria to Strengthen Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem said here Wednesday that the relations between Turkey and
Bulgaria should set an example of good neighborliness for all
countries in the Balkans and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Cem made the remarks after meeting with his visiting Bulgarian
counterpart Nadezhda Mikhailova, who arrived here for a two-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
"We have no political problems. Both sides have only some minor
sensitivities, which are dealt with mutual understanding, " Cem
said.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Turkey and Bulgaria went through a severe
crisis in the 1980s when Bulgaria carried out an assimilation
campaign against its 1-million-strong Turk minority.
</P>
<P>
Over 300,000 ethnic Turks migrated from Bulgaria to Turkey in
1989 alone.
</P>
<P>
Their bilateral ties thawed after Bulgaria restored the
political and cultural rights of the Turks in the country.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Bulgaria wants to ink an agreement that
will facilitate the Bulgarian Turks's travel to Turkey, but Ankara
has kept silent on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Cem said that during their upcoming separate visits to
Bulgaria, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel and Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit will inaugurate the construction of two major
projects undertaken by Turkish companies -- a dam over the Arda
River and a highway from the southern city of Plovdid to the
Turco-Bulgarian border gate at Kapikule.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cem reiterated Turkey's support for Bulgaria's bid
for membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, saying
that it is of vital importance for the security of Turkey and the
whole Balkans.

<HEADLINE> Putin: IMF Money Unrelated to Spending on Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin said Wednesday that the military operation against rebels in
the breakaway republic of Chechnya is financed from additional
federal budget spending and has nothing to do with IMF money.
</P>
<P>
Putin was apparently responding to a statement by IMF Managing
Director Michel Camdessus earlier Wednesday that the fund would
suspend loans to Moscow if Russia's military spending gets out of
control, given the country's military operations in the North
Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
The spending around Chechnya "is absolutely unrelated to the
IMF money" which goes only to repay interest on old loans, the
Interfax news agency quoted Putin as saying.
</P>
<P>
Putin said the federal forces in the North Caucasus are
conducting an anti-terrorist operation and expressed confidence in
the solidarity of the international community with Russia's
efforts against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Europe One Radio, Camdessus said that the IMF's
role is to assess the economic policy pursued by a country and its
budget.
</P>
<P>
"If I see that the (Russian) budget is getting out of control
due to an unwise increase in military spending, we will suspend
our support," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said nobody has the right to claim that the war in
Chechnya and Daghestan is funded at the expense of the IMF.

UNITED NATIONS, October 13 (Xinhua)-- The U.N. Security Council
on Wednesday condemned the hostage-taking of seven U.N. workers
near the line separating the Georgian government forces and the
territory of Abkhazia and urged their immediate release.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Permanent Representative to the United Nations and
current council president Sergey Lavrov called it a "unacceptable
act" following a council meeting to hear a briefing on the
incident.
</P>
<P>
U.N. deputy spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva told reporters
on Wednesday that the United Nations deplores the taking of
hostages and demands their urgent release.
</P>
<P>
He listed the hostages as five U.N. military observers from
Uruguay, Sweden, Greece, the Czech Republic and Switzerland and a
U.N. doctor from Germany plus an Abkhazian translator.
</P>
<P>
Abkhazian sources said they were seized Wednesday by gunmen
soon after they arrived by helicopter at the mountain village of
Azhara to deliver aid to Georgian refugees living there.
</P>
<P>
"At this time the hostages appear to be in good condition,"
Almeida e Silva said.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 U.N. observers are in Georgia to monitor the truce
between the districts separating government forces of Georgia and
separatists in Abkhazia, located in the northwestern part of the
republic.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Urges More Cooperation With Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei Wednesday underlined the need of using the positive
grounds available for expanding cooperation between Iran and Greece.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in meeting with visiting Greek President
Costis Stephanopoulos, who arrived here Tuesday on an official
visit.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said that there is no negative point in Iranian
nation's mind about Greece, adding that scientific and cultural
exchanges and cooperation have always existed widely between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Iranian and Greek peoples have shown their talent on issues
related to culture and civilization and on this basis, can
consolidate their friendship, the Islamic Republic News Agency
quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Stephanopoulos on his part said that Greece and Iran are
inheritors of rich cultures and on this basis, officials of the
two countries feel more responsible towards present issues of the
humanity.
</P>
<P>
Underlining the importance of cooperation between Greece and
Iran in various fields, he said that there are many fertile
grounds for expansion of Athens-Tehran relations.
</P>
<P>
Stephanopoulos, the first Greek head of state to visit Iran
since the country's Islamic revolution in 1979, also met former
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that Greek and Iranian officials are willing to
develop relations which are on a growing trend on the basis of
mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani expressed pleasure with the growing relations
between Iran and Greece and called for continued cooperation
between the two countries in every field.
</P>
<P>
"The historical and cultural background shared by the two
countries requires us to do so," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the outcome of the visit by the Greek president will
lead to a turning point in the bilateral relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Stephanopoulos is the second European Union head of state to
visit Iran since 1979. Austrian President Thomas Klestil visit the

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves 501 Million Dollars in Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) approved Wednesday 501 million U.S. dollars in
emergency assistance for Turkey in support of the government's
efforts to limit the adverse effects of the devastating earthquake
that struck the country on August 17, 1999.
</P>
<P>
This amount is available immediately, the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
"Directors expressed their deepest sympathy for the people of
Turkey following the devastating earthquake that hit the Marmara
region, causing immense human suffering and extensive material
damage," IMF Deputy Managing Director Shigemitsu Sugisaki said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Directors considered that the drawing from the fund will help
complement the resources that Turkey needs to sustain the
reconstruction, and to meet the immediate financing needs
associated with relief and reconstruction, while ensuring an
adequate level of reserves," he said.
</P>
<P>
Although estimates of the economic effects of the earthquake
remain tentative, preliminary assessments by the World Bank put
the loss of the physical capital in the range of 3-6.5 billion
dollars. The output loss in 1999 related to the earthquake could
be in the order of 0.5-0.75 percent of the country's gross
domestic product.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Continues Battle on Nuke Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Republicans and the
Democrats continued their battle over whether the Senate would
delay a vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty on nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott could still decide to delay
Wednesday's vote, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle told
reporters on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
If the two sides agreed to a plan to postpone the vote, the
treaty will be withdrawn from consideration in the Senate.
Supporters of the treaty conceded they lack enough votes to pass
the treaty.
</P>
<P>
However, Daschle said that Democrats and the White House appear
to have lost an effort to delay the vote, saying, "We are prepared
to vote."
</P>
<P>
He said neither he nor President Clinton is willing to make any
further concessions to Senate conservatives _ even if it means the
treaty will be rejected later today by a largely party-line vote.
</P>
<P>
"There's a limit to what I can do and I've reached that limit,"
Daschle said, blaming "a small group of senators on the far right"
for preventing Lott from honoring a tentative deal reached Tuesday
by the two Senate leaders.
</P>
<P>
Since the Senate put aside debate on the treaty to take up farm
legislation this morning, it would require a majority vote to go
back to the treaty, Daschle said. He said Democrats would oppose
that motion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lott said that there are still different
possibilities on the treaty.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have an agreement at this point to do anything but go
forward with the vote, but we're exploring all kinds of
possibilities and that's where we stand," Lott said.
</P>
<P>
The two parties agreed to postpone the vote on the treaty but
they differed on when it should be postponed. The Republicans
demand the Clinton administration will not bring the issue up
during the rest of his tenure. The White House refuses to accept
such a demand.

<HEADLINE> China Lists Obstacle in World Arms Control, Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- China said Wednesday
that the cold war mentality, hegemonism and power politics are
major factors which make the world even less stable, and the
recent negative developments in the world constitute an obstacle
in the international arms control and disarmament process.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Shen Guofang, China's deputy permanent
representative to the United Nations, took the floor at the
general debate of the First Committee of the 54th General Assembly
session, which opened here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Since the last General Assembly session, the international
situation has undergone profound and complex changes, he said.
"The cold war mentality is still there, coupled with the new
developments in hegemonism and power politics, thus making the
world even less stable."
</P>
<P>
"In Europe, the only military bloc left over from the cold war,
under its `new strategic concept,' bypassed the U.N. Security
Council and bombed, with its world's most powerful and
sophisticated military machinery, the weak sovereign state, the
Federation of Yugoslavia, turning the Balkan region, a land that
experienced so much misery in this century, into a test ground for
its new strategy," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
"In Asia, certain individual countries are pressing rapidly
ahead in their joint TMD (Theater Missile Defense) development
program in a bid to further strengthen their military alliance in
the region, which should, otherwise, have died out with the end of
the cold war," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In North America, the vigorous and accelerated pursuit of the
so-called missile defense program to the detriment of strategic
stability has confronted the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM
Treaty) with grave challenges," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The afore-mentioned negative developments have, in our view,
worsened the international security environment and constituted an
obstacle to the sound development of the international arms
control and disarmament process," he said.
</P>
<P>
NATO, without the authorization of the U.N. Security Council,
began 78-day air strikes on Yugoslavia, an independent sovereign
country, on March 24, seriously violating the U.N. Charter and
international law and gravely affecting the international arms
control efforts.
</P>
<P>
The general debate runs through October 20. The First Committee
is in charge of international security and disarmament affairs.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- China said Wednesday
that "The international arms control and disarmament is now at a
cross-road," but "the old security concept based on military
alliances and arms build-up will not help resolve any problem."
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang, China's deputy permanent representative to the
United Nations, made the remarks at the general debate of the
First Committee of the 54th General Assembly session, which began
Monday. The First Committee is in charge of international security

</P>
<P>
"The international arms control and disarmament is now at a

pressing issue of common concern to the international community."
</P>
<P>
"We are of the view that the relaxation of the international
situation and the arms control process are mutually reinforcing
and supportive with each other," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The old security concept based on military alliances and
arms build-up will not help resolve any problem" in this field,
he said.
</P>
<P>
China is "not in favor of any attempts to seek, under certain
excuses, military strength that goes beyond one's legitimate
self-defense needs," he said. "Likewise, we are also against any
attempt to unilaterally seek absolute security advantage for one
country or country bloc by limiting and weaking other countries
under the pretext of arms reduction and non-proliferation."
</P>
<P>
"We believe that to promote disarmament process, to prevent
arms race and safeguard international security, it is imperative
that a new security concept in line with the changed international
situation be established," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, in his March 26 statement
delivered at the plenary of the Conference on Disarmament in
Geneva, said that the core of such a new security concept should
be mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The five principles of peaceful co-existence and the principles
of the U.N. Charter make up the political foundation underpinning
world peace; mutual beneficial cooperation and common prosperity
constitute the economic guarantee of world peace; dialogues,
consultations and negotiations between and among parties concerned
on an equal footing represent the correct approach to resolving
disputes and safeguarding peace.
</P>
<P>
"It is in this context, we call on the international community
to take the above new security concept as guideline," he said.
"Only by so doing, can they ensure that the arms control and
disarmament process move in a correct direction, thus safeguarding
world peace and security."

<HEADLINE> Daley Against Misuse of Palestinian Industry Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Commerce Secretary
Willam Daley on Wednesday voiced objection to using Palestinian
industrial zones as a mechanism to ship duty-free and quota-free
goods to the United States and other countries of the world.
</P>
<P>
If that happens, it will seriously damage the support for the
industrial zones, Daley told a news conference in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Daley, who heads a 12-member U.S. trade delegation, arrived
in Israel on Sunday for a three-day visit. He also visited
Palestinian territories during the trip.
</P>
<P>
Daley said the Palestinians have expressed satisfaction with
the growth of investment in their first industrial zone, which
straddles Israel and the Israel-occupied Gaza Strip, but added
they are looking for more investment.
</P>
<P>
This first industrial zone, Karni Industrial Park, which opened
early this year, is one of the six industrial zones Israel and
the Palestinians agreed to construct in the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip under interim peace deals.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, Daley met Israel's National Infrastructure
Minister Eli Suissa and discussed with him the building of a
power plant in Gaza.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Calls for Ban on Gases Unfriendly to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican refrigeration
industries have been urged to adhere to modern technologies and
stop using gases that destroy the ozone layer, the Mozambican News
Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Besides the general interest of protecting life on the planet,
it is also in the interest of the industrialists themselves to
adopt ozone- friendly technologies, Francisco Mabjaia,
Secretary-General of the Mozambican Environment Ministry, said in
Maputo Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Montreal Convention on the Preservation of the Ozone Layer
dictates that production of the noxious gases be completely banned
by the year 2010, the official was quoted as saying. Mozambique
ratified the convention in December 1983.
</P>
<P>
Refrigeration industries have been using gases such as
chloro-flouro- carbons (CFCs) that, when leaked into the
atmosphere, react with the ozone layer, reducing the amounts of
ozone it contains.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the control of the use of harmful gases, Mabjaia
said that it is difficult because of the large number of small
operators, who repair refrigerators, air conditioners and other
appliances. These operators are still using the gases unfriendly
to the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
The environment official noted that most of these electric
products are imported from South Africa, despite orders for the
customs services not to allow them to enter Mozambique.

<P>
TEHRAN, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi Wednesday strongly condemned the
recent Israeli air raids on parts of southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said that the perpetration of the Israeli regime openly
contradicts the regime's claims of seeking peace and pulling out
of Lebanon, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He also condemned Israel's expansionist policies.
</P>
<P>
he said denial of the rights of the Palestinians and Lebanese,
continued occupation of Islamic lands, especially the holy Al-Qods
(Jerusalem), impossibility of Palestinian refugees' returning to
their homeland and repeated attacks on Lebanon are main factors
for tension, instability and insecurity in the region.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman called on Muslim countries and international
organizations to show serious reaction to the repressive
measures of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a border stripe in 1985 in south Lebanon as
security zone with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Condemns U.S., Britain for Blocking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Trade Ministry on
Wednesday condemned the U.S. and British representatives at the
U.N. Sanctions Committee for blocking 20 contracts it signed with
foreign companies under the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed spokesman for the ministry said that the United
States and British envoys at the Sanctions Committee suspended
these contracts during the committee's sessions held on October
3-4 and October 10.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said these contracts were signed in the fourth
and fifth phases of the oil-for-food program, now in its sixth
phase which expires in November.
</P>
<P>
The contracts were signed with companies from Russia, Italy,
Spain, Lebanon, Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and Greece
for the purchases of medicine, detergents, electricity generators,
oil spare parts, computers and tyres, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal with the U.N., Iraq is allowed to
sell limited amount of oil in every six months to buy food,
medicine and other humanitarian supplies for its 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has long accused the U.S. and British envoys in the
Sanctions Committee of hampering the endorsement of its contracts,
arguing that the oil-for-food deal has failed to alleviate the
sufferings of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
According to a latest report of the United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF), the mortality rate among Iraqi children has more
than doubled since the imposition of the U.N. sanctions on Iraq in
1990 due to its invasion of Kuwait.

<P>
MAPUTO, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique has started exporting
 processed milk to neighboring Swaziland, the Mozambican News
Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The privately-owned milk company Parmalat-Mocambique, starting
from Tuesday, will initially export 50,000 liters of milk to
Swaziland every month as from October, and will strive to expand
its market, Laranjeira Lopes, general director of the company, was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Lopes said that Parmalat will gradually increase its exports to
a target of 200,000 liters a month, which he expects the company
to achieve by the second half of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Parmalat also processes fruit juices, which it hopes to export
to other countries of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC).
</P>
<P>
Lopes attributed this breakthrough into export markets to the
improved quality and quantity of his factory's products.

<HEADLINE> WFP Offers Relief Food to Djibouti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World
Food Program (WFP) announced Wednesday an emergency food relief
operation to assist poor people affected by ongoing drought in
Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
WFP's initial emergency program will assist about 30,000 people
 by providing 414 metric tons of food worth 198,000 U.S. dollars,
said a WFP press release available here.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the current drought in Djibouti is causing
serious food shortage in five districts of the country, three of
which borders Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Women, children and the elderly are extremely vulnerable, the
release quoted WFP Djibouti Country Director Sanda Maina as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Many school children are eating only one meal a day consisting
of boiled rice with a little sugar or salt, Maina said.
</P>
<P>
A joint mission of the U.N. agency and the Djibouti government
indicated that 80,000 to 100,000 people will be in urgent need of
food assistance in the coming six months if climatic conditions do
not improve.
</P>
<P>
The WFP is the United Nations' front-line agency in the fight
against global hunger. Last year, its relief workers fed 75
million people, including most of the world's refugees.
</P>
<P>
Headquartered in Rome, Italy, the WFP has food aid operations
in 80 countries around the world.

BAGHDAD, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein

<HEADLINE> High Interest Rates May Lead to Recession in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean economists Wednesday
warned that the current interest rates, which can be as high as 80
percent, may lead to a new economic recession if not curtailed
soon.
</P>
<P>
The high lending rates ranging from 55 percent to 80 percent
and money markets rate of 52 percent affected mostly the informal
sector, new and small-scale businesses because they could not
afford them, the economists told the Zimbabwe News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"The informal sector and other small businesses cannot afford
these rates," Chief economist of Zimbabwe National Chamber of
Commerce John Makamure said. "The banks are charging even 70 or 80
percent depending on whether your business is regarded as high
risk."
</P>
<P>
He said the high lending rates are resulting in a high default
rate because people could not repay their debts.
</P>
<P>
As long as the default rate continues to rise, the commercial
banks will keep on increasing the lending rates, he said.
</P>
<P>
Makamure said one solution would be to reduce the inflation
rate, which currently stands at about 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economist of the Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe Andy Hodges said:
"Because of the high inflation rate, the bank rates will continue
to be high. High interest rates mean low growth rate, no business
expansion, no investment and no job creation."
</P>
<P>
S. Chuma, a consultant for business, media and political
solutions, said that businesses could not survive as long as the
interest rates continued to be high.
</P>
<P>
"The little that we are trying to get out is being eroded.
There are no returns to our investment. This is a very worrying
situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance has also expressed concern at the high
interest rate and has indicated that reducing the interest rates
was a major priority for the government if reducing the inflation
rate.

</P>
<P>
Cem said that the adverse developments in the Kosovo province

Mihaylova, for her part, stressed the importance of
international cooperation in the face of "the security challenges"
in the region, which also originated from terrorism and organized
crime.

WASHINGTON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said on Wednesday that the removal of
Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif by the military creates a
"new level of uncertainty" and called for a return to the civilian
rule.
</P>
<P>
"What we hope very much is there is a return to a
constitutional system in Pakistan and that we are able to continue
the work that we have been doing to deflect the conflict, to get
India and Pakistan to talk again about solving the Kashmir problem
peacefully," she said after delivering a lecture at the University
of Maine.
</P>
<P>
The United States is watching closely for indications about the
direction army chief Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf, who deposed the prime
minister on Tuesday, intends to take the country.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Washington "has been
reaching out on a variety of diplomatic levels" to gather
information.
</P>
<P>
"We still are concerned and will continue to work until we get
a clear picture of what's going on on the ground," Lockhart told
reporters. "We call very clearly for the earliest possible
restoration of democracy and constitutional rule in Pakistan," he
added.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear what the Clinton administration had i mind to
register its displeasure over Musharraf's move of overthrowing
sharif's government.
</P>
<P>
The State Department often withdraws its ambassador as a sign
of unhappiness in this kind of occasion. But officials said that
U.S. Ambassador William Milam, who was in the United States on
Tuesday, planned to hurry back to his post in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
At the Pentagon, spokesman Ken Bacon noted that Pakistan's
nuclear program has been in the hands of the military, so the
seizure of power by the army left the situation unchanged.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 13 (Xinhua) - A set of jobs figures in Britain
released Wednesday is showing a record number of people in work
and unemplyment at a 19-year low.
</P>
<P>
The number of people in work has grown to 27.4 million, the
highest figure ever published. Unemployment continues to fall,
with a 5,400 cut in the claimant count last month to 1,209,600, a
jobless rate of 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the good news was marred by a 0.3 percent increase in
average earnings last month to 4.9 percent. The Office for
National Statistics said the increase was driven by private sector
service companies.
</P>
<P>
Economists are watching the figures - especially average
earnings - closely for clues as to the future direction of UK
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
With the jobless record, there have been fears that wages may
be forced up by the falling numbers of available employees.
</P>
<P>
It is believed here if this was to happen the Bank of England
would be expected to raise interest rates to cool down the economy
in order to avoid a rise in inflation.

<HEADLINE> Gunmen Seizes U.N. Observers in Abkhazia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Gunmen in Abkhazia, a breakaway
region of Georgia, on Wednesday took a group of U.N. military
observers hostage and were demanding 200,000 U.S. dollars as
ransom for their return, media reports said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. mission officials in Sukhumi, the capital of Abkhazia,
said six observers were being held -- a Czech, a German, a Greek,
a Swede, a Swiss, and a Uruguayan -- along with an interpreter.
Earlier reports had mentioned five captives.
</P>
<P>
The victims were seized in mid-morning after landing by
helicopter in the Kodori Valley, a remote mountain region of
Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze, on a visit to Germany,
has reportedly ordered a team led by the deputy defense minister
to go to Kodori to "conduct operations to free the captives.'
</P>
<P>
Abkhazia broke away from Georgia in 1994 after a war which
killed thousands of people. Georgia controls the Kodori Valley as
it is populated mainly by ethnic Georgians rather than Abkhaz.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNMOMIG), which
has around 100 unarmed observers, conducts limited patrols in two
districts separating Abkhazia from Georgia proper.
</P>
<P>
Most of the patrols are carried out by 1,500 Russian
paratroops, acting as peacekeepers under the auspices of the
post-Soviet Commonwealth of Independent States.
</P>
<P>
Russia has promised to help free the hostages.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry said its peacekeepers, "in
conformity with their mandate, will be rendering necessary
assistance," the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said a helicopter with 10 Russian paratroopers and
members of a U.N. mission to Georgia, had been dispatched to the
Kodori valley, where the observers were seized.
</P>
<P>
The paratroopers were escorting the mission members in response
to a request by the mission that the peacekeeping force provide
guards for the flight.
</P>
<P>
If the mission asks for soldiers to guard its members "in their
ground movements" in the Kodori valley, "guards from among our
peacekeepers will be provided," the ministry said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Waiting Future Pakistani Government for Loan Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund would neither rule in nor rule out possibility to work with a
future military government in Pakistan, a senior IMF official said
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I thing we need to see the shape the new government takes,
particularly the economic and financial side of the government,"
IMF external affairs chief Thomas Dawson told a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Before the military overthrew Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif on Tuesday, the IMF had been in talks with Sharif's
government about releasing new funds from a $1.5 billion loan
approved in 1997. No agreement on term to resume payments has been
reached between the two sides. And Sharif's government has now
been ousted.
</P>
<P>
"The change in government will clearly have implications for
how we go forward i terms of timing and for the economy," Dawson
said. "The IMF does not act in a vacuum in terms of what the
international community's attitude is. Clearly if there were
concerns in the international community in one direction, the fund
would not go in the opposite direction."
</P>
<P>
IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessue, speaking in Paris
earlier on Wednesday, made clear that Pakistan might lose IMF aid
if the civilian government was not restored.

LONDON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Prime Minister Tony

Blair and Jospin are scheduled to meet in Helsinki on Friday at

grave concern over the situation in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, she appealed to the Pakistani military

<HEADLINE> Russian Upper House Blocks Ouster of Chief Prosecutor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
suffered another setback Wednesday when the country's upper house
of parliament for the third time rejected his wish to dismiss the
Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov.
</P>
<P>
The Federation Council voted 98-52 against the dismissal,
following Skuratov's defense that Yeltsin wanted to fire him in
order to block his investigation into alleged Kremlin corruption.
</P>
<P>
"A personal interest of the president and his family is the
driving force behind attempts to oust me," Skuratov was quoted as
telling the lawmakers before the vote.
</P>
<P>
The house first rejected Yeltsin's appeal to fire Skuratov in
March. Shortly afterward, state television aired a tape that
showed a man resembling Skuratov having sex with two women
identified as prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin then suspended Skuratov for allegedly accepting
prostitutes in exchange for dropping criminal investigations.
Skuratov has not denied that he was the man in the tape, but
called it a provocation by his foes.
</P>
<P>
He has not been charged with any wrongdoing, but remains
suspended and under investigation.
</P>
<P>
Under Russian law, the president needs the upper house's
consent to appoint and dismiss a chief prosecutor. After three
consecutive rejections, the Federation Council has asked the
Russian Constitutional Court to rule on the issue.

suggested lifting Cold War-era sanctions "which hinder the

<HEADLINE> Angola Needs 124,000 Tons of Grain by End of 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- War-rampant Angola has to
solicit the international community for more 124,000 tons of grain
in assistance by the end of this year, an official of the Angolan
Agricultural Ministry announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The scarcity of alimentary goods is the result of a fatal
decline in the agricultural production in the 1998-1999
agricultural year and the instability of the military and
social-economic situation, according to the unidentified official
in charge of food security.
</P>
<P>
In the 1998-1999 agricultural year, Angola saw an 11-percent
decline in the agricultural production as compared with the
previous year, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Angola faces a shortage of 505,000 tons of grain
in 1999. Among them are 325 tons to be covered by commercial
import and 180 tons by emergency international assistance.
</P>
<P>
Until now, Angola can not get enough international assistance
to cover the deficiency of grain, in spite of the fact that the
international donators have promised to provide the country with
56,000 tons of grain.
</P>
<P>
Spain Wednesday delivered some 400 tons of alimentary goods
worth over 600,000 U.S. dollars to the Angolan Ministry of
Assistance and Social Reintegration, official Angop news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Among the donated goods are 231 tons of vegetable oil, 83 tons
of milk powder, 14.2 tons of tuna and 22.2 tons of canned
sardines.
</P>
<P>
With the start of another round of battles in the central
plateau, a lot of fields and plantations in the central area have
been given up and the Angolan agricultural production has fallen
into a deeper abyss.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Approves Defense Spending Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House Wednesday
voted 372 to 55 to pass a 267.7 billion U.S. dollars defense
spending bill which helps finance the largest military pay
increase in 18 years.
</P>
<P>
The bill for the fiscal year 2000, a compromise between earlier
House and Senate versions, now goes to the Senate for final
approval, and then President Bill Clinton is expected to sign it.
</P>
<P>
The legislation provides 4.5 billion dollars more for the
fiscal year that started October 1 than Clinton requested, and
17.3 billion dollars over last year's levels.
</P>
<P>
The increases include money to help pay for a 4.8 percent
across-the-board military pay raise also included in a defense
authorization bill signed earlier this week by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
It also earmarks 1.3 billion dollars to be used for equipment
and readiness-related shortfalls.
</P>
<P>
The legislation would delay for a year production of the
radar-evading F-22 fighter and would give the Air Force 1 billion
dollars for the program instead of the 1.8 billion dollars it
requested, some of which could be used to buy test planes.

<HEADLINE> Lions Clubs to Save Sight of 20,000 People Each </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Lions Clubs International,
the world' s largest service club organization, Wednesday pledged
to save the sight of 20,000 men, women and children each week in
the first year of the new century.
</P>
<P>
President of the organization Jim Ervin announced this in
Kenyan capital Nairobi when addressing a celebration marking the
World Sight Day.
</P>
<P>
"One of the reason we selected Kenya as the primary location
for the World Sight Day is that nearly 80 percent of the world's
blind live in Africa and Asia", Ervin said, adding that "Lions
Clubs are doing work with the visually impaired in more than 185
countries."
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Minister for Medical Services Amukowa Anangwe spoke
highly of the work undertaken by the Lions Clubs and other
organizations in eradicating blindness in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The organization spent two million U.S. dollars in building and
 equipping a Lions Sightfirst Hospital in Nairobi in 1997 and so
far the hospital has treated 32,000 Kenyan patients and performed
over 3,100 cataract and other surgeries, 95 percent of which have
been done free of cost.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that in Kenya there are over 250,000 blind
people, 150, 000 of whom are blind due to cataract, and each year
some 15,000 are added to the number of the blind.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization estimates that 40 million people
around the world are blind and the number could doubled in the
next 25 years without active intervention from non-governmental
organization such as Lions.
</P>
<P>
Lions Clubs International has some 1.4 million members
representing 44, 500 clubs in some 185 countries and regions, and
has adopted the primary mission of aiding the blind and visually
impaired over the past 80 years.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder, Chirac Propose EU to Strengthen Solana's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN October 13 (Xinhua)-German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
and French President Jacques Chirac has advised the European Union
(EU) to endue more power to Javier Solana, EU`s mediator for
common foreign and security policy.
</P>
<P>
The initiative was raised in a letter to the Finnish EU
rotating presidency prior to the EU summit scheduled for this
Friday in Tampere, Finland. The letter, jointly signed by the two
leaders, was disclosed Wednesday in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
The letter said Solana should chair the regular European
Council meeting on foreign policy and security issues, as well as
lead EU`s designated political and security committee.
</P>
<P>
Solana, the Spanish who has been NATO secretary general, is due
to take his new post on 18, October.
</P>
<P>
Such upgrade is crucial for promoting EU`s presence in the
world, the letter suggested.
</P>
<P>
"Only with a widely respected and firmly anchored
representative can we put our values and interests forward in all
over the world," it said.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder and Chirac called on other leaders in the 15-nation
bloc to discuss foreign and security issues in the coming year and
to give Solana full support.
</P>
<P>
Main topics in the two-day special summit in Tampere were
expected to include EU`s immigrant policy, asylum law,
crime-fighting steps and civil-law coordination among members.

<HEADLINE> HK's Economic Philosophy Remains Unchanged: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's economic
philosophy remains unchanged since it became a special
administrative region of China on July 1, 1997, Chief Executive
Tung Chee Hwa of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening dinner of the Business Week CEO Forum
held at the Grand Hyatt Hotel Wednesday evening, Tung said that
Hong Kong has been successful for a long time because of its
belief in the free market, its belief in letting market forces
dictate the pace of the market.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to believe this very strongly," Tung noted. "We do
not wish to interfere at all. We will only interfere when the
market is being distorted, or being monopolized," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe in small government. We believe in prudent finance,
and we believe in level playing field for everybody," he added.
</P>
<P>
The government's major role is to provide infrastructure, both
soft and hard infrastructure, the chief executive said.
</P>
<P>
Soft infrastructure means the environment, education, the
friendliness for business, etc. and hard environment means the
best airport in the world, efficient railway system, good road
system, good telecommunication network, he explained.
</P>
<P>
The government has to take a strategic direction and the
strategic direction decisions were only taken after having very
carefully listened to the views of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
There has been no major change, Tung said. "The only change I
can say is that because of the challenges that we faced in the
past two and a half years, we probably have responded more
effectively," he said. "We were more quick at our feet, getting
things ready and getting things done," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Third Annual Business Week CEO Forum opened Wednesday at
the Hong Kong Grand Hyatt Hotel.
</P>
<P>
Over 200 global business and political leaders, including Tung
and former U.S. president George Bush, attended the forum.
</P>
<P>
The forum's theme, "Managing the Speed of Change: Meeting the
Needs of Tomorrow", is addressed in sessions on strategies, and
participants will focus their efforts on discussions of the
sustainment of Asia's return to economic growth in the following
two days.
</P>
<P>
In association with the Better Hong Kong Foundation, the
three-day forum will examine topics relating to corporate
governance and response to various economic issues throughout
Asia, including industries and organization transformation,
restructuring, mergers and acquisition, growth of the digital
economy, and maximum leadership.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Scientists Find Anti-Cancer Bacteria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Canadian scientists have
discovered that the toxin produced by a strain of bacteria can
penetrate certain cancer cells and prompt them to self-destruct.
</P>
<P>
The Globe and Mail newspaper reported Wednesday that a team of
researchers in Toronto and Edmonton is recasting the nasty strain
of bacteria E. coli into a bug with the ability to battle cancer.
</P>
<P>
E. coli is usually associated with undercooked meat and blood
diarrhea, giving hamburger a bad name.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the disease-causing enemy is now being used to
fight another disease-causing enemy.
</P>
<P>
The mechanism is that the bone marrow can be cleansed with the
E coli toxin outside the body before reimplanted into a patient's
body without reintroducing the disease.
</P>
<P>
The Shiga-like toxin seems to bind to a particular receptor
known as CD 77 on the surface of a lymphoma cell. Once the toxin
attaches itself, the receptor draws the bacterial poison into the
lymphoma cells to make them shut down and die.
</P>
<P>
Jean Gariepy, the senior scientist at the Ontario Cancer
Institute, first showed the baterial toxin could kill lymphoma
cells in human blood samples in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In the past year and a half, Dr. Gariepy hooked up with the
clinical researchers in Edmonton to demonstrate that the toxin
could have a similar effect on other cancerous cells, if the cells
had the same CD-77 receptors on their surfaces.
</P>
<P>
The researchers have now asked the country's Health Protection
Branch for permission to begin the first trials in patients this
spring.

<HEADLINE> Environment Should Be Taken into Account: U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Environmental factors should be
taken into account when countries are making their national
economic policies so as to achieve a sustainable development, a
high-level United Nations meeting said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia
and the Pacific (ESCAP), the Second Session of the Committee on
Environment and Natural Resources Development, which is being held
here from Wednesday to Friday.
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural address, Savit Bhodivihok, minister to the
Prime Minister's Office of Thailand, urged the international
community to take prompt action on the integration of economic,
social and environmental objectives, with emphasis on enhancing
national capacity.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Thailand attaches great importance to
minimizing environmental degradation in implementing development
activities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Azizul Islam, officer-In-charge of ESCAP, said that
there was a need to promote a strategic environmental management
approach in the Asian and Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
According to Islam, the strategic management approach involves
a long-term view of development taking into account natural
resources use and environmental quality.
</P>
<P>
Such an approach, he said, would also define measurable targets
which allow for the monitoring of progress as well as
accountability and promote cooperation among both governmental and
non-governmental stakeholders.

<HEADLINE> China Underliens Importance of Nuclear Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- China Wednesday said
that to promote nuclear disarmament and prevent nuclear
proliferation still remain a formidable task for the international
community not only now but also for a fairly long time to come.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Shen Guofang, China's deputy permanent
representative to the United Nations, was delivering a speech at
the general debate of the First Committee of th 54th General
Assembly session, which kicked off Monday and will end Wednesday
next week.
</P>
<P>
The current session will review a series of resolutions
pertaining to nuclear disarmament, he said, adding that "the
elimination of nuclear weapons represents the common aspiration of
the people all over the world."
</P>
<P>
"However, the nuclear disarmament process between the U.S. and
Russia is now bogged down in a statement after achieving certain
temporary progress, which is coupled with new nuclear tests after
the conclusion of the CTBT (Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty)," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Such developments clearly indicate that to promote nuclear
disarmament and prevent nuclear proliferation still remain a
formidable task for the international community not only now but
also for a fairly long time to come," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his statement delivered at the Conference of Disarmament
in Geneva on March 26 this year, Chinese President Jiang Zeming
outlined the next step for the nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The step is to continue to take the lead by countries with the
largest nuclear arsenals in the world to drastically cut down
their respective nuclear arsenals and refrain from improving the
quality of nuclear weapons and developing such weapons, to
negotiate and conclude a Fissile Materials Cut-off Treaty (FMCT)
to cap the quantity of nuclear weapons, to ensure the
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons through the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) while comprehensively promoting the
attainment of all the objectives of the NPT, to negotiate and
conclude an international legal instrument on unconditional
no-first use of nuclear weapons, no use of nuclear weapons against
non-nuclear weapon states or nuclear-weapon-free zones, and on
comprehensive prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons, and
ultimately move to negotiate and conclude a Treaty on
Comprehensive Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons so as to genuinely
achieve the goal of a nuclear-weapon-free world.
</P>
<P>
"To achieve the goal of a nuclear-weapon-free world, it is
essential that al countries should act on the principles of
maintaining global strategic stability and safeguarding security
interests of all countries," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
"Only by so doing, can they ensure that sustained progress be
registered in the nuclear disarmament process," he said. "The
vigorous development and proliferation of advanced missile defense
systems, obviously, will not contribute to international nuclear
disarmament and non-proliferation endeavor."
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, they will only poison the atmosphere and
conditions required for movement in the nuclear disarmament
process and breed risks for arms race at an more advanced level,"
he said. "The comprehensive prohibition and thorough destruction
of nuclear weapons, in our view, should be the ultimate goal of
the international community."
</P>
<P>
"This is because that, if nuclear weapons are eliminated, there
will be no proliferation of nuclear weapons, nor will there be
proliferation of long-range missiles or missile threat," he said.
"So, in a final analysis, to reduce the threat to peace, it is
desirable to devote more efforts in disarmament per se instead of
otherwise."
</P>
<P>
The general debate will be concluded on October 20. The First
Committee is in charge of international security and disarmament
affairs.

<HEADLINE> Africa Urged to Declare AIDS Continental Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The International Labor
Organization (ILO) Wednesday called on African nations to declare
the AIDS crisis a continental disaster and take actions to curb
the killer disease.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made in an AIDS action program for Africa
announced in a statement at the end of three-day conference by the
United Nations agency in Windhoek, Namibia.
</P>
<P>
The statement said delegates had agreed on a platform of action
on HIV/ AIDS in Africa since "the pandemic is the most serious
social, labor and humanitarian challenge of our time".
</P>
<P>
"AIDS is rapidly becoming the single most serious threat to
social and economic progress in Africa today," said the statement
adopted at the meeting attended by some 400 delegates from 20
sub-Saharan countries, including government officials and trade
union leaders.
</P>
<P>
It called on "all African governments to declare HIV/AIDS as a
national disaster, requiring urgent attention and mobilization of
relevant resources. "
</P>
<P>
An estimated 22.5 million Africans have been infected with the
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) out of 33 million people
infected worldwide. HIV usually leads to the Acquired
Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS).
</P>
<P>
Economic consequences of the epidemic are exacerbated by
fragile economies, high levels of unemployment, and widespread
poverty, the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
"All these factors contribute to preventing Africa from being
competitive in the global market," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, AIDS is no longer just a health problem. It is a
developmental crisis with potentially ominous consequences for
Africa and the world," the delegates warned.
</P>
<P>
"Yet a culture of silence, fear and denial continues to reign
and prevent action," they said.
</P>
<P>
The ILO and its partners said the program will fight
discrimination against people infected with HIV/AIDS, and increase
support for AIDS orphans, children suffering from the disease, and
those who are forced to work.
</P>
<P>
Employment of AIDS-infected workers and increased social
programs for them were also listed as goals of the action plan.

<HEADLINE> China Always Pursues Policy of No-First-Use of Nuclear Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- China said Wednesday
that its nuclear weapons are purely for self-defense purposes and
has always pursued the policy of no-first-use of such weapons.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Shen Guofang, China's deputy permanent
representative to the United Nations, delivered a speech at the
general debate of the First Committee of the 54th General Assembly
session, which began Monday.
</P>
<P>
"China has always pursued the policy of no-first-use of nuclear
weapons at any time and under any conditions, no participation in
nuclear arms race and no deployment of nuclear weapons outside its
territory," he said.
</P>
<P>
"China was subjected to nuclear threat or blackmail on several
occasions in the 1950s and 1960s," he said. "China was thus
compelled to develop limited number of nuclear weapons. It is
against this backdrop that we have all along adopted a responsible
attitude toward the question of nuclear weapons and have made our
due contributions to promoting nuclear disarmament."
</P>
<P>
"China's nuclear weapons are purely for self-defense purposes,"
he said. "They do not constitute any threat to anyone. Moreover,
China's extremely limited number of nuclear weapons are placed
under strict control and there is no risk of accidental launch."
</P>
<P>
It should be pointed out the overall international environment
of peace, security, stability and trust is a must in talking about
measures such as transparency in nuclear arsenals and de-alerting
of nuclear weapons, he said. "Therefore, such measures should,
naturally, be linked with nuclear disarmament negotiation process."
</P>
<P>
"At present, there is a very wide gap among nuclear weapon
states in terms of their nuclear strength," he said. "Certain
country is pursuing its nuclear deterrence policy based on first
use of nuclear weapons while vigorously developing its missile
defense systems to the detriment of the strategic balance."
</P>
<P>
"It also wantonly resorts to or threatens to use force in
international relations," he said. "Under such circumstances, it
is both premature and unfair to indiscriminately call for the
adoption of open and transparency measures on nuclear front."
</P>
<P>
"We should be alert and see to it that nuclear disarmament be
not led astray," he said. "The recently published Report of Tokyo
Forum, for instance, is a report with quite lopsided and biased
view."
</P>
<P>
In Mid-August, the Tokyo Forum issued a report here, listing
some recommendations on nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"Many of its arguments are neither just nor fair, deviating
from the purposes of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation,"
he said. "In this context, China cannot but register its
opposition."

<HEADLINE> China Attaches Importance of Prevention of Arms Race in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- China said Wednesday
that it has all along attached importance to the question of
prevention of arms race in outer space (PAROS) and is particularly
concerned over the latest developments on this front.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Shen Guofang, China's deputy permanent
representative to the United Nations, was delivering a speech at
the general debate of the First Committee of the 54th General
Assembly session.
</P>
<P>
"Certain country has, on the one hand, tried hard to block the
establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee on PAROS at the Conference
on Disarmament (CD) (in Geneva), but on the other hand, pressed
rapidly ahead in pursuing its outer space and missile defense
programs in an attempt to seek military advantage on the ground
through dominating and controlling the outer space," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The development in the vigorous pursuit of missile defense
systems since the beginning of this year is most disturbing," he
said. "The international community is confronted with the danger
of weaponization of outer space and the repudiation of the ABM
(Anti-Ballistic Missile) Treaty."
</P>
<P>
"Under such a circumstance, it has become a pressing issue
for the international community to find ways to strengthen their
efforts against an arms race in outer space," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We maintain that relevant UNGA (United Nations General
Assembly) resolution to be adopted this year should continue to
urge the CD to re-establish the Ad Hoc Committee at an early date
next year and immediately begin its substantive work so as to
reverse the negative developments in the field of PAROS and
missile defense," he said.

UNITED NATIONS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- China Wednesday voiced
its hope to co-sponsor a draft resolution with Russia on the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Shen Guofang, China's deputy permanent
representative to the United Nations, was delivering a speech at
the general debate of the 54th General Assembly session, which
began on Monday and will end on Wednesday next week.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese Delegation fully supports the Russian Delegation
in its effort to table a draft resolution entitled 'Prevention and
Compliance with Anti-Ballistic Treaty', and wishes to inscribe
itself on the list of co-sponsors," he said.
</P>
<P>
China hopes to see the re-establishment of an Ad Hoc Committee
(AHC) on the question of the prevention of arms race in outer
space (PAROS).
</P>
<P>
"However, to our regret, the 1999 session of the CD (the
Conference on Disarmament) failed to re-establish the AHC due to
the obstruction by certain individual country," he added.
</P>
<P>
The last General Assembly session, in adopting a resolution,
urged the CD to play a major role in concluding a multilateral
legal instrument on PAROS.
</P>
<P>
"We maintain that relevant UNGA (the United Nations General
Assembly) resolution to be adopted this year should continue to
urge the CD to re-establish the AHC at an early date next year
and immediately begin its substantive work so as to reverse the
negative developments in the field of PAROS and missile

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- China said Wednesday it
supports the efforts to comprehensively strengthen the
effectiveness of the Biologic Weapons Conventions (BWC) and to
establish a fair, reasonable, appropriate and feasible
verification mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Shen Guofang, China's deputy permanent
representative to the United Nations, was delivering a speech at
the general debate of the First Committee of the 54th General
Assembly session, which began Monday.
</P>
<P>
"To this end, it is imperative that the balance between rights
and obligations of states parties be taken into full account so as
to prevent the abusive use of verification and to protect the
legitimate security and economic interests of all states parties,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime, it is also very important to enhance
international cooperation and exchange in the field of biology,"
he said. "It remains our objective to conclude negotiations of the
Protocol before the 5th Review Conference of the Convention."
</P>
<P>
"The key to progress in negotiations lies in full accommodation
of each other's legitimate concerns by all parties," he said.
</P>
<P>
"To place undue emphasis on speed and table the so-called
`clean text' prematurely while there are still major disputes
among parties can only be counter-productive," he said.
</P>
<P>
"China, for its part, wishes to continue its earnest
negotiations on the basis of the existing rolling text in a bid to
help bring about a good Protocol acceptable to all," he added.
</P>
<P>
It has been two years since the Chemical Weapons Convention
(CWC) entered into force, but its universality is yet to be
further promoted, he said.
</P>
<P>
"A few countries, especially one country with major chemical
industry, have hitherto failed to submit their initial
declarations on civilian chemical industries reservations, through
domestic legislation, in implementing the Convention," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This issue left over from history should be resolved at an
earliest possible date," he said. "In this context, we call on the
countries concerned to face squarely the above-mentioned problems
and earnestly work to implement the Convention in full."

UNITED NATIONS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- U.N. General Assembly
President Theo-Ben Gurirab Wednesday called for the strengthening
of disaster reduction programs to limit the impact and costs of
human suffering.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement on the World Disaster Reduction Day with
the theme of observance as "Prevention Pays -- Science and
Technology for Disaster Prevention Save Lives and Secure Assets."
</P>
<P>
Gurirab said the number of natural disasters has risen two
times between the 1960s and the 1990s while the disaster costs
increased more than nine-fold in the same period.
</P>
<P>
The trend is likely to worsen in the future as many economic
and social factors such as rapid urbanization, environmental
degradation, climate change, the decaying of infrastructure,
overpopulation and poverty continue to increase the vulnerability
of communities everywhere in the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the need for prevention, the president said lives
have been saved and assets protected due to effective prevention
policies in many regions hard hit by natural disasters especially
in 1999 when furious storms, violent earthquakes and devastating
droughts took place.

<P>
About 100 countries will celebrate this year's Disaster
Prevention Day.

UNITED NATIONS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- U.N. General Assembly
President Theo-Ben Gurirab on Wednesday called for the
strengthening of disaster reduction programs to limit the impact
and costs of human suffering.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement on the World Disaster Reduction Day with
the theme of observance as "Prevention Pays -- Science and
Technology for Disaster Prevention Save Lives and Secure Assets".
</P>
<P>
Gurirab said the number of natural disasters has risen two
times between the 1960s and the 1990s while the disaster costs
increased more than nine-fold in the same period.
</P>
<P>
The trend is likely to worsen in the future as many economic
and social factors such as rapid urbanization, environmental
degradation, climate change, the decaying of infrastructure,
overpopulation and poverty continue to increase the
vulnerability of communities everywhere in the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the need for prevention, the president said lives
have been saved and assets protected due to effective prevention
policies in many regions hard hit by natural disasters especially
in 1999 when furious storms, violent earthquakes and devastating
droughts took place.
</P>
<P>
About 100 countries will celebrate this year's Disaster
Prevention Day.

<HEADLINE> Barak Urges U.S. Congress to Approve Aid Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak Wednesday urged the U.S. congress to approve the aid
package promised to Israel and the Palestinians under the Wye
River peace deal signed last October.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process has entered a critical stage and
without the aid package, the process can not be moved forward,
Barak told reporters after meeting settler leaders.
</P>
<P>
The planned aid package of 1.9 billion U.S. dollars will be
divided among three countries, with Israel getting 1.2 billion,
the Palestinian authority 400 million and Jordan 300 million.
</P>
<P>
The aid to Israel is used for redeployment of the Israel
Defense Force (IDF) and IDF's purchase of combat helicopters and
intelligence planes.
</P>
<P>
The approval of the package by the congress is delayed due to
power struggle between President Bill Clinton's Democratic
administration and the Republican-controlled congress, which
overruled all budget requests by the administration.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here said the aid package might not be
approved this year.
</P>
<P>
The delay will have repercussions on final-status talks with
the Palestinians to attain a permanent settlement or an agreement
with the Syria that may proberly be reached next year, Barak
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Barak has met U.S. Ambassador to Israel Ned Walker and
emphasized the need for the U.S. to fulfill its part in the Wye
peace deal.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hopes SADC to Be Free Trade Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States has expressed
hope that the Southern African Development Community (SADC) should
develop into a free trade area to make the region more attractive
to investment.
</P>
<P>
This suggestion was made by the newly-appointed U.S. special
representative for the 14-member SADC region, Rober Krueger, who
is also US ambassador to Botswana, on Wednesday at a press
conference in Maputo, capital of Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The SADC is the only region in Africa where U.S. President Bill
Clinton has appointed a special representative.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Rober Krueger is touring the region, holding a
series of meetings with the region's leaders and businessmen in a
bid to encourage free trade.
</P>
<P>
In Maputo he met with President Joaquim Chissano in his
capacity as the president of SADC.
</P>
<P>
Krueger said that Mozambique is seeking to make SADC more
efficient, and he was briefed on the work currently being
undertaken by four regional countries aimed at proposing a
structure that will improve SADC efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Krueger also said that the U.S. government praises the efforts
by SADC towards solving the conflict between the Angolan
government and the UNITA rebels.
</P>
<P>
"The SADC position on Angola as regards the imposing of an
embargo against UNITA is the same as that of the U.S.," he said.

<HEADLINE> Killer Whales Off Vancouver Contaminated, Study Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A five-year study has said that
killer whales off the Canadian coast of Vancouver are among the
most chemically contaminated marine mammals in the world.
</P>
<P>
Citing the study to be published in the international
scientific journal Marine Pollution Bulletin, Canadian media
reported Wednesday a high level of polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs) in the 47 killer whales found off the coast of Vancouver
Island.
</P>
<P>
The killer whales are found to have PCBs four times as high as
that of beluga whales in the St. lawrence River, according to the
study.
</P>
<P>
While both are on Canada's endangered-species list, killer
whales take the form of population decline as a result of higher
level PCBs; beluga whales in St. Lawrence River are found
suffering from tumor at a lower level.
</P>
<P>
"Based on the weight of the evidence, we expect these PCB
levels present a risk to the killer-whale population," said Dr.
Peter Ross of the federal Institute of Ocean Sciences, which
launched the joint study with the Pacific Biological Station in
Nanaimo and the University of British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
PCBs are toxic, fat-soluble chemicals that were used
industrially before they were banned in the United States and
Canada in the early 1970s.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate to Proceed With Vote on Nuke Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Senate will proceed with
a vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty on nuclear weapons,
following the failure of the Democrats in the arms control battle
with the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
Senate Democrats failed in a last-ditch attempt to force
postponement of action on the treaty, losing on a party-line vote
that opened the way to expected rejection of the pact.
</P>
<P>
In a roll call vote demanded by the Democrats, a motion by
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott to return to consideration of
the treaty was approved by a simple majority vote of 55-45.
</P>
<P>
The vote shows that the treaty will be certainly rejected by
the Senate. The Democrats needed to have 67 votes for the Senate
to ratify the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle said that Democrats
and the White House appear to have lost an effort to delay the
vote, saying, "We are prepared to vote."
</P>
<P>
He said neither he nor President Clinton is willing to make any
further concessions to Senate conservatives even if it means the
treaty will be rejected later Wednesday by a largely party-line
vote.
</P>
<P>
"There's a limit to what I can do and I've reached that limit,"
Daschle said, blaming "a small group of senators on the far right"
for preventing Lott from honoring a tentative deal reached Tuesday
by the two Senate leaders.
</P>
<P>
The two parties agreed to postpone the vote on the treaty but
they differed on when it should be postponed. The Republicans
demand the Clinton administration will not bring the issue up
during the rest of his tenure. The White House refuses to accept
such a demand.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Programme (WFP) will provide 22,625 tonnes of food aid over the
next three years to the victims of natural disasters in
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The food aid is worth more than 12.3 million US dollars and
will cover 24 pre-selected districts in the centre and south of
the country, Mozambique News Agency quoted a WFP press release as
saying on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The release indicates that most of the food aid will be
distributed through "work for food" schemes, targeting the
agriculture, health and nutrition, sanitation, education and
infrastructure areas.
</P>
<P>
"These are projects where the community helps to build,
rehabilitate or provide basic services to improve agricultural
land, water sources, schools, roads and health installations,"
says the release.
</P>
<P>
The food fund is a joint-programme of the Mozambican
government and the WFP aimed at aiding communities to protect
themselves against the devastating effects of natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique is prone not only to periods of drought, but also
to floods in the main river valleys, insect pests that can wipe
out large areas of crops, and epidemics among other natural
disasters.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Bednet Scheme to Save African Children's Lives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Some 60 million
African families will be provided with insecticide-treated
mosquito nets over the next five years, according to the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The first step toward this goal is to achieve a 30-fold
increase in the number of treated nets available and in use over
the period, a World Health Organization (WHO) project manager said.
</P>
<P>
About 700,000 African children died last year from malaria
when a four U.S. dollar bed net could have saved them, UNICEF
figures show.
</P>
<P>
Malaria is transmitted through the bite of an infected
anopheline mosquito, which is most active between dusk and dawn,
killing 1.1 million people worldwide each year, with 1 million
in Africa. The malaria deaths account for one out of every four
childhood deaths in the continent.
</P>
<P>
Currently only an estimated 2 million African households use
bednets. If insecticide-treated, they can cut malaria deaths by
nearly a quarter, WTO officials believed.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Provide One Third of UN Troops in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will contribute some
2,000 troops to a United Nations peace-keeping force to supervise
the disarming of rebels in Sierra Leone, a senior official of the
Foreign Ministry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The contribution constitutes a third of the 6,000-strong force
being proposed for the task, and will be provided at the U.N.
request, the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said in
the Nigerian capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
"We should have no difficulty in providing the troops since
they would be paid for by the U.N.," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council is yet to approve the proposal by
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan for the deployment of troops,
although half of the 216 U. N. observers to monitor the
implementation of the July 7 peace agreement between the rebels
and the government are already in that country.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria provided the bulk of the12,000 west African
intervention force (ECOMOG) to help restore President Tejan Kabbah
in March last year after nine months of junta rule in Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
In August this year, the new Nigerian government began a phased
 withdrawal to reduce its troops level in that country to some
1,000.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal was suspended after the return of the first
batch of 2, 000 troops following a request by President Kabbah.

<HEADLINE> Third Bullish Session of Dollar Trade in Ecuador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The steady rise of the U.S.
dollar continued for the third consecutive day Wednesday,
reaching 15,000 sucres to the dollar in the country's foreign
money market in the morning.
</P>
<P>
In Quito, the dollar normally maintains an average of 14,500
sucres buying and 15,400 selling, while in Guayaquil, the North
American currency stands at 14,600 buying and 15,250 selling.
</P>
<P>
The said indicators signify an increase of 300 sucres in the
dollar price, compared with the beginning of the week, signifying
a 2 percent increase in three days.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, the rise of the dollar is a worry for
investors due to lack of approval by the state budget, sent by the
government to the National Congress, in addition to the closure
credit lines from foreign sources and speculative factors.
</P>
<P>
However, according to money dealers, nervousness and
instability in the markets are due to the government's
announcement last month of unilateral default on the Brady debts.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that the rise of the dollar will continue
because the average price of the currency, according to the
proposed budget of the government which is being discussed in
parliament, is 15,000 sucres to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador, in its worst economic crisis in decades, has said it
cannot repay its 13 billion-dollar foreign debt, which takes up
more than half of its budget each year.
</P>
<P>
On September 30, Ecuador became the first country to default on
Brady bonds. Brady bonds, named after former U.S. Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady, were created in 1989 to refinance the
debt burden of developing nations. Ecuador's PDI (past due
interest) and discount bonds were issued in 1995 as part of its
Brady plan to restructure debt.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Agency Deplores Burundi Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) deplored here Wednesday the killings of
U.N. humanitarian aid workers in Burundi, calling on the
international community and government in particular to protect
the U.N. staff members in the field.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy said in a statement
that the international community should change its way to handle
the protection of humanitarian aid workers.
</P>
<P>
Her call came one day after a UNICEF representative and a
staff member of the World Food Program were shot dead in Burundi,
bringing to four the number of U.N. workers killed in the field
in the recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
"What we say yesterday in Burundi was a calculated,
cold-blooded murder of humanitarian workers, plain and
simple... they are part of a contemporary and continually
expanding pattern in which humanitarian workers are being
identified and targeted for death -- a pattern the world simply
can no longer tolerate, " she said.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF official urged individual states to take urgent
actions to ensure the safety of the U.N. aid workers to prove
their adherence to humanitarian conventions and international
law.
</P>
<P>
"Put simply, there has been too much looking away from what
needs to be done, and people are playing with their lives," she
complained.
</P>
<P>
She strongly recommended that laws be strictly enforced and
those who killed humanitarian workers be brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
Hard choices must be made regarding the disarmament of
militias and other armed groups around the world, and pulling
out of dangerous environments must be a step of last resort for
the U.N. agencies, she said.
</P>
<P>
"We are now calling on the international community -- and
government in particular -- to put their heads and their
collective wills together to reverse the tide of violence that
is eating away at the very idea of humanitarian relief," she
added.

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, surplus electricity generated in the evening can be
used for battery charging for electric vehicles, said Lun.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, China generated 270 million kwh of electricity, 60
million of which were surplus and can be used for battery charging
for 12 million electric vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Lun noted that the research on hybrid vehicles and fuel cell
vehicles is now a trend, adding that the hybrid vehicle, with its
advantages of having both an internal-combustion engine and
batteries, will have a larger market in China in the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
Since 1998, the Toyota Motor Corporation has sold 30,000 hybrid
vehicles. Other major auto makers, such as General Motors, are
also doing research on them.

<HEADLINE> Annan Not to Call Talks on Cyprus Without Assured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan does not intend to convene peace talks on
Cyprus unless he is assured of their success, Annan's envoy for
Cyprus James Holger said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Holger, acting special representative of the U.N. chief for
Cyprus and acting chief of UNFICYP (U.N. Peace-Keeping Force in
Cyprus), arrived here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after his first meeting with Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides, Holger said he arrived here with no specific
instructions from the Secretary General because consultations are
still underway.
</P>
<P>
He said that many factors, including the forthcoming summits
of the European Union (EU) and the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, have a bearing on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Admitting that there are many obstacles that prevent the talks
from taking place, the Chilean diplomat, who has served here with
the U.N. in the 1980s, was cautious on the prospect of the Cyprus'
peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
He did not rule out the possibility of having the talks
convened in the beginning of next year, instead of late this year
as was hoped.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the international community has been trying to
bring the two sides to negotiate for reunification through a
bicommunal settlement. But no tangible progress has been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on the Cyprus issue have not been held in the past
two years because the Turkish Cypriot side, backed by Ankara,
demanded that their breakaway state be recognized by the
international community and talk with the Greek Cypriots on a
state-to-state basis.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Cooperatives Erasing Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The supply and marketing
cooperatives (SMC) in China erased 370 million yuan in deficits in
the first eight months this year, basically holding the money-
losing trend in check.
</P>
<P>
SMC is a non-governmental farmers' organization. It is also a
key channel of commodity purchase and sales in China's rural areas.
It was born out of the planned economy.
</P>
<P>
Under the transition from a planned economy to a market-
orientated economy, the problems of cooperatives such as staff
redundancy, low-efficiency and lack of competitiveness have become
increasingly apparent.
</P>
<P>
The State Council issued a circular early this year urging an
immediate system reform to reverse the loss-making trend of
cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
The All China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives,
the administrative body of grassroots cooperatives, has enhanced
efforts in reshaping money-losing enterprises by adopting the
shareholding system, acquisition and merger.
</P>
<P>
Li Dianhui, who is with the organization and attending the
fifth Asia-Pacific Cooperative Ministers' Conference being held in
Beijing, said that cooperatives are striving to make profits, and
"at least not to lose money in operation this year."
</P>
<P>
Although the downward trend is not reversed, the number of
money-losing enterprises were reduced by a large margin, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has a total of 30,000 cooperatives at all levels, with
cooperative members exceeding 180 million.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Republican-controlled Senate emphatically rejected
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Wednesday, dealing a devastating
blow to a pact that has been at the center of global efforts to
curb the spread of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
-- Hundreds of civilians were killed as they crossed bridges
that a U.S. general and other Army officers ordered blown up at
the start of the Korean War in August 1950.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton said Wednesday he would act to
protect at least 16 million hectares of forest land from road
building, logging and mining permanently.
</P>
<P>
-- The Pakistani army chief, General Pervez Musharraf, said in
a nationally televised speech Wednesday he would soon lay out the
army's plans, which could entail martial law, new elections or the
installation of a civilian government controlled by the military.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- General Motors Corporation of the United States, in an
effort to appease angry U.S. dealers, said Wednesday it will "move

dealerships, and will try to include dealers as partners in its
factory-controlled stores where possible.
</P>
<P>
-- The Bank of Japan eased monetary policy, saying it will buy
short-term debt from the government to weaken the yen and sustain
economic recovery.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Appoints Rights Bill Subcommittee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
appointed an eight-member cabinet subcommittee to handle the new
proposals under the proposed equal opportunities bill, a minister
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"There have been publicly motivated elements with racist
tendency resorting to using innocent school children to create
problems," Mangala Samaraweera, media minister and cabinet
spokesman, told a press briefing, dismissing allegations against
the bill.
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee headed by Education Minister Richard Pathirana
will re-examine certain areas in the bill, which seeks to provide
equal opportunities to the country's many ethnic and religious
groups.
</P>
<P>
The bill has ignited controversy among the majority Sinhalese
community as well as the minorities.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of students of two leading Buddhist schools in Colombo
took to the streets last Thursday to protest against the bill,
saying the admission of minorities would be a threat to the
cultural identity of the schools.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 percent of Sri Lanka's population of 18.5 million
are Buddhists, and Tamils form 18 percent and Moslems account for
some seven percent. The rest are Eurasian Burghers, ethnic Malays
and aboriginal Veddahs.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been plagued by a 16-year-old war fought between
the Sinhalese dominated government troops and Tamil Tiger rebels
who allege the minorities have been discriminated against in jobs,
education and land settlement by the majority Sinhalese.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Expects U.S. Senate to Change Position on CTBT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 14 (Xinhua) -- South Korea Thursday voiced hope
that the Republican-controlled United States Senate could
reconsider and ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
"We expect the issue will be discussed again in the United
States in consideration of the atmosphere of global support for
the CTBT," the South Korean Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea hopes the U.S. Senate's rejection of the treaty is
not the final position of the United States, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"We also hope the United States, which has played a leading
role in the global non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and arms
reduction, will continue to do so," added the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, South Korea ratified the treaty, which is
aimed at curbing the spread of nuclear weapons by banning the
detonation of nuclear bombs underground, at sea, in the atmosphere,
and in space.
</P>
<P>
In a roll call vote Wednesday, the U.S. Senate failed to ratify
the treaty by a 51 to 48 vote. The Clinton government signed the
treaty in 1996 and sent it to the Senate for ratification in
September 1997.
</P>
<P>
Explaining its decision, the Senate said a total ban on nuclear
tests would undermine the U.S. ability to upgrade nuclear weaponry.
</P>
<P>
The CTBT was approved by the U.N. General Assembly in 1996 and
has been signed by 154 countries. It will take effect when it is
approved by all 44 member nations of the Geneva-based Conference
on Disarmament. To date, 26 states have ratified it.

<HEADLINE> NATO Bombing Causes Serious Pollution in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"As part of the humanitarian aid to the region, the
international community should assist the relevant authorities in
dealing with the key environmental hot spots, thus avoiding
further harm to human health and the environment in Yugoslavia and
the wider Balkans region," the UNEP said in its report titled the
Kosovo Conflict - Consequences for the Environment and Human
Settlements.
</P>
<P>
Although the Yugoslav government has the main responsibility
for clean- up efforts, the international community are required to
offer assistance, said Pekka Haavisto, head of the Balkans Task
Force set up in May by the UNEP and U.N. Center for Human
Settlements (Habitat).
</P>
<P>
However, the NATO bombing did not cause an environmental
catastrophe affecting the Balkans region as a whole, Haavisto
said.
</P>
<P>
The task force has focused its work on five areas. Four field
missions were carried out between July and September, including
environmental impacts on industrial sites and the Danube river,
bio-diversity in protected areas, consequences for human
settlements and the environment in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The fifth area of work is about the possible consequences for
the environment and human health caused by depleted uranium
weapons used in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Because of the lack of information on actual use of uranium,
the subject was covered by carrying out a Geneva-based "desk
assessment" by the World Health Organization, the International
Atomic Energy Agency, the Swedish Radiation Protection Institute
and the UNEP.

<HEADLINE> China to Levy Tax on Bank Account Interest in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China will begin to levy tax on
the interest of savings accounts on November 1, the government
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The 20-percent tax will be levied on the interest of all
Renminbi and foreign currency savings accounts that an individual
person opened in banks in China.
</P>
<P>
However, the interest that the savings accounts generated
before November 1 will be exempt.
</P>
<P>
The State Council announced here today that the government will
not levy tax on savings accounts exclusively for educational
purposes and other special savings accounts and funds that the
finance authorities has designated.
</P>
<P>
In August, the Chinese government activated the long-inactive
clause on interest tax in the Law on Individual Income Tax in a
move to stimulate consumption by residents.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Ministry of Finance said that the new tax is
like an interest rate cut by one percentage point.
</P>
<P>
The government believes that imposing the interest tax will
help take from the rich to pay the poor because about ten percent
of the population own 50 percent of the total savings deposits in
the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Finance, the tax money will be
used to raise economic assistance for low-income people.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, China's total savings deposits soared to 5,
910 billion yuan, compared to 1,520 billion yuan at the end of
1993.
</P>
<P>
However, China's retail prices have been falling for more than
20 consecutive months as economists rang alarms for deflation.

<HEADLINE> Asia-Pacific Countries Urged to Upgrade Fruit, Vegetable Processing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- An international symposium on
fruit and vegetable processing technology and industrialization
closed here today, with countries in the Asia-Pacific region urged
to improve the processing technology they currently use for these
foods.
</P>
<P>
The three-day symposium was an important component of the
International Symposium and Exhibition on Fruit and Vegetable
Processing Technology and Industrialization, the first
international symposium on the matter ever held in China.
</P>
<P>
Scholars and experts from at home and abroad gave presentations
on issues in the field. The symposium has received 112 reports and
papers from over 20 countries and international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 participants from over 30 countries put forward some
recommendations in which they urged countries of the United
Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (
ESCAP) region to go all out in upgrading processing technology for
fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
They suggested that a similar seminar be held next year to
exchange experiences and to demonstrate equipment and products.
</P>
<P>
Other recommendations encouraged the Regional Network of
Agricultural Machinery (RNAM) and the Asia Pacific Center of
Transfer of Technology (APCTT), two important regional
institutions of the ESCAP region, to play a greater role in
promoting fruit and vegetable processing and industrialization.
</P>
<P>
It was suggested that RNAM expand the scope of its work so as
to better meet the needs of fruit and vegetable processing, which
covers the whole process of planting, harvesting, post-harvest
processing, storage and marketing.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from some international organizations,
including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations (FAO), the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO),
World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank, participated in the
symposium.

<HEADLINE> Unsung Russian Steals Spotlight from Favorites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The lead alternated between
favorites until it finally settled at unheralded Russian Nikolay
Krukov, who beat a strong field to claim the individual men's all-
round title Thursday at the 34th world championships here.
</P>
<P>
Krukov, who finished first in parallel bars and high bar at the
World University Games in earlier summer this year, fought back to
take the blue-ribbon title on a total of 57.485 points.
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe what had happened," said Krukov after the
medal awarding ceremony, "I won the all-around title!"
</P>
<P>
Naoya Tsukahara of Japan also came from behind to finish runner-
up on a total of 57.337.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian Jordan Jovtchev, who placed fourth at Atlanta and
third at European Championships in 1998, came in third with 57.212.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy with Nikolay's results and all those guys who
performed today," said Arkavevf Lenoid, head coach of Russia team.
</P>
<P>
It was really not the day for Ivan Ivankov of Belarus, the
defending champion, who withdrew form the competition after he
finished 7.795 points in the horizontal bar.
</P>
<P>
The guy has been poised to make history as he will become the
first three-time world champion in the all-round competition with
a gold medal but all this turned out to be only a dream.
</P>
<P>
But the result did not become clear until the last moment after
several pre-game heavy favorites failed to keep the lead for more
than one rotation.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Lu Yufu, who placed sixth at the 1997 worlds, started
strong by finishing first at the first rotation only to see
Atlanta Olympics champion Alexei Nemov of Russia displace him in
the provisional rankings. He finally won 57.086 to finish fifth.
</P>
<P>
Nemov's upsurge proved to be a flash as the Russian had his
winning momentum broken at the third rotation where he only earned
only 8.737 on the rings with a start value judged only at 9.50.
</P>
<P>
The Russian continued his slump as he finished at last at sixth
on 56.793 points.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian top gymnast Jovtchev, who placed fourth at Atlanta
and third at European championships in 1998, stole the lead from
Nemov at the third rotation when he scored 9.600 at the pommel
horse.
</P>
<P>
But he failed to pull away as Huang Xu, the runner-up at the
1997 worlds, surged to top the fourth rotation as he impressed the
partisan crowd with a good execution and solid landing to finish 9.
725 points on parallel bars. Huang Xu finally only placed 11th on
56.660.
</P>
<P>
While the Chinese lead could not last long as Krukov began to
show his teeth at the next round of competition by wrapping up
with 9.637 at the horizontal bar and became the men who smiled to
the last.
</P>
<P>
Yang Wei, who qualified first in the event, started badly as he
failed in the pommel horse and came in 12th on 56.573.
</P>
<P>
"I am proud of my gymnasts, especially Yang Wei, who topped
qualifiers but suffered slump in the first rotation tonight. He
won himself in the meet," said Huang Yubin, head coach of the
Chinese team, who won the men's team title with a overwhelming 230.
395 points, holding a big margin of 2.250 points over runners-up
Russia.
</P>
<P>
"All our three boys, Yang Wei, Huang Xu and Lu Yufu had chance
to take the title," said Huang Yubin,"but they all made fatal
mistakes. So we'll have to improve our training quality when we
start to prepare for next year's Sydney Olympic Games."

<HEADLINE> Two Japanese City Banks Announce Merger Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Sumitomo Bank and Sakura Bank,
two of Japan's major commercial banks, announced an agreement
Thursday to form a broad-based alliance by April 2002 to create
the world's second largest bank.
</P>
<P>
"We have reached a basic agreement on business integration,
which we assume will be achieved by April 2002," Sakura Bank
President Akishige Okuda said in a joint press conference with
Sumitomo Bank President Yoshifumi Nishikawa.
</P>
<P>
"The new bank intends to be one of the world's top commercial
banks," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two have combined assets of 99 trillion yen (about 820
billion dollars), second only to the one to be formed by a planned
alliance among Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank (DKB), Fuji Bank and the
Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ).
</P>
<P>
Sumitomo and Sakura's announcement came one week after Asahi
Bank and Tokai Bank said they would set up a joint holding company
in October 2000.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March 2000, the end of the current business year
for both banks, Sumitomo and Sakura will own shares in each other,
the two banks said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Ahead of full integration, the banks will form a partnership in
some areas of retail and wholesale banking, and in international
services, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The two banks plan to close 151 domestic outlets and 32 offices
abroad by March 2002 and will trim 9,300 jobs by March 2004, they
announced.
</P>
<P>
They also said nonperforming loans, a major factor behind the
banking industry shakeup, will be put to an end by March 2002.
</P>
<P>
Sumitomo Bank, based in Osaka, western Japan, has 51.5 trillion
yen (about 428 billion dollars) in assets with about 15,000
employees, while Tokyo-based Sakura Bank has 47.2 trillion yen (
about 392 billion dollars) in assets with a workforce of 16,300.
</P>
<P>
Sumitomo Bank and Sakura Bank have acted as the chief source of
funds for Japan's two major competing corporate groups-- Sumitomo
and Mitsui.

<HEADLINE> Local Records in China Revised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China is carrying out a
nationwide revision of local records, aiming to faithfully mirror
historical events.
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 historians and compilers have been involved
in the largest project of the kind in 20 years, renewing some 4,
000 volumes of chronicles, said Shan Tianlun, an official
responsible for directing the national job.
</P>
<P>
"Accuracy and documentary value are our top requirements for
the job, so that the history can be truly reflected," Shan
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The entire work includes 6,000 volumes of historical books with
a total six billion words.
</P>
<P>
An exhibition to display achievements of the massive effort
will soon be on view at the Museum of the Chinese Revolution,
which is located east of Tian'anmen Square in central Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Records compilation and revision have a history of over 2,000
years in China. This activity has not only enriched the country's
cultural heritage, but also provided reference for today's
policymakers, Shan said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government has always paid attention to the local
chronicle revision work, even though it was suspended during the "
Cultural Revolution" (1966-1976), he said, adding that special
institutes have been set up in provinces, cities and counties.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Continues Work to Control Air Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The national capital launched
the third stage of its anti-air-pollution campaign today by
proposing a set of 22 measures to reduce the volume of air
pollutants.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has implemented a set of 46 measures to take air
pollution under control since late 1998, according to Zhao Yixin,
director of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Zhao told the press today that Beijing has made progress in
controlling air pollution thanks to effective measures to curb
local air pollution caused by coal burning, auto exhaust emissions,
and dust and suspended dirt particles.
</P>
<P>
He said that the sulfur dioxide density in the air in the past
nine months of this year fell an average of 25 percent from the
same period last year. The amount of nitride and oxide in Beijing'
s air remained at the same level as last year, even though the
city's number of automobiles has been increasing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
The new measures will focus on the control of coal-burning and
auto-exhaust emissions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The city's industrial firms are all required to meet the city's
standards in environmental protection before the end of the year
2000, or they will be shut down, Zhao said.

<HEADLINE> German Businessman Hofer Imprisoned Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- German businessman Helmut
Hofer, who was acquitted recently of adultery, was imprisoned
again on Thursday for further investigation on other charges
against him.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Justice Department said in a statement that Hofer was
summoned by Branch No. 1406 of Tehran General Court on Thursday
morning for preliminary investigations on other charges and was
informed about these accusations.
</P>
<P>
Hofer was then sent back to prison pending further
investigations, the Islamic Republic News Agency quoted the
statement as saying, adding his case will remain open at Branch
No. 1406 until the investigations are completed before issuance of
the final verdict.
</P>
<P>
The German businessman has already paid his fine of 23,000
U.S. dollars for having illegal relationship with an Iranian
Muslim woman, and was hoping to be released, at least
temporarily, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
However, no details about the other charges against Hofer were
revealed.
</P>
<P>
Hofer was arrested in September 1997 for illegal sexual
relations with an Iranian woman and was sentenced to death
in January 1998. Iranian laws prohibit affairs between a
non-Muslim man and a Muslim woman.
</P>
<P>
However, Hofer argued that he had converted to Islam before
having an affair with the Iranian woman. The death sentence
was then rejected in April by Iran's Supreme Court, which
ordered a retrial.
</P>
<P>
He was released from jail on bail in April, but was again put
behind bars in August.
</P>
<P>
After two years in prison, an Iranian court acquitted him of
adultery for insufficient proof on Saturday.

BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China plans to allow high-tech
firms easier access to the capital market in a bid to facilitate
technological upgrade of the state sector, a senior official said

Meanwhile, the commission is considering to allow selected
firms currently listed on China's B-share market and Hong Kong
stock market to buy back their shares, he disclosed without
elaboration.

<HEADLINE> HK Enhances Legislation Against Piracy, Counterfeiting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government
announced Thursday that copyright piracy and trade mark
counterfeiting offenses would be added into the Organized and
Serious Crises Ordinance (OSCO), subject to the approval of the
Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
The offenses to be included are related to the making or
dealing with infringing copies of copyright works under the
Copyright Ordinance and infringement of trade mark rights and the
import or export of goods bearing a forged trade mark under the
Trade Descriptions Ordinance, the government said.
</P>
<P>
"The proposal underlines again our determination to protect
intellectual property rights," a government spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
With the offenses specified under Schedule 1 to the OSCO,
Customs and Excise officers would have additional legal powers to
investigate piracy and counterfeiting offenses, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"These cover the production of material for investigation,
handling of crime proceeds and enhanced sentencing," he added.
</P>
<P>
If organized crime as defined in OSCO is involved, two
additional powers, confiscation of proceeds of offenses and the
removal of the right to silence, are available.
</P>
<P>
"With the additional legal tools, we will be able to deal more
severely with infringes," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"More legislative proposals are in the pipeline, for example,
prevention of bootlegging. The message is clear: piracy and
counterfeiting activities will not be tolerated in Hong Kong," the
spokesman emphasized.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Rejects Four-party Meeting on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus government rejected on
Thursday any idea of a four-party meeting on the Cyprus issue
which would also include Greece and Turkey besides the two
communities on the divided island.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides said that if Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash is ready for talks there is always
the framework set out by the United Nations Security Council
Resolution 1250 and the international community for U.N.-sponsored
unconditional talks.
</P>
<P>
"What we have on the agenda is the decision of the Security
Council Resolution 1250 and this is what we are aware of," the
Greek Cypriot minister said.
</P>
<P>
Resolution 1250 calls on U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to
invite the leaders of the two communities in Cyprus for
unconditional talks in the fall of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Denktash reportedly said Wednesday in an interview on the
"Bayrak" television in northern Cyprus that if he is invited by
United States President Bill Clinton for a four party meeting, he
"will consider it and evaluate it positively."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated
south, which was internationally recognized, and the Turkish
Cypriots-controlled north, backed by Ankara, since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the international community has been trying to
bring the two sides to negotiate for reunification through a
bicommunal settlement. But no tangible progress has been
achieved.

<HEADLINE> Newly-discovered Minor Planet Named after CAS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese-discovered minor
planet has been named after its discoverer, the Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS), CAS President Lu Yongxiang said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The minor planet, discovered on March 11, 1996, by a group of
experts headed by CAS member Chen Jiansheng, is at least the 10th
minor planet found by the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The discovery was later confirmed and recognized by the Minor
Planet Center under the International Astronomical Union (IAU).
</P>
<P>
The IAU announced earlier this year the minor planet had been
named "Zhongguo kexueyuan," which means "Chinese Academy of
Sciences," as proposed by CAS.
</P>
<P>
The president said that by naming the minor planet after the
academy, the leading research organization in China, it intended
to demonstrate the achievements it has made since it was founded
in 1949.
</P>
<P>
The academy has made great contributions to the completion of
China's first nuclear bomb, hydrogen bomb and first man-made
satellite, the president said.
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 minor planets have been officially named, Chen
Jiansheng said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urged to Open Market to Egyptian Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's new prime minister, Atef
Ebeid, on Thursday urged the United States to open up its market
to Egyptian products to promote bilateral trade ties.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made during a meeting between Ebeid and visiting
U.S. Secretary of Commerce William Daley.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Economy and Foreign Trade Youssef Boutros
Ghali, who also attended the meeting, said U.S. market is one of
the largest in the world, and the entry of more Egyptian products
into the market will greatly boost Egyptian exports.
</P>
<P>
Daley began a two-day visit to Egypt on Wednesday within a
Mideast tour, which has taken him to Jordan, the Palestinian
self-rule areas and Israel. He will also travel to Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
Daley heads a delegation including 12 representatives of
medical, financial, engineering and telecommunications companies
to seek business opportunities in the region.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is one of the closest allies of the U.S. in the Middle
East. Bilateral trade volume stood at 4.26 billion U.S. dollars in
1998, with Egyptian exports at 660 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Egypt hopes to increase its exports to 1 billion dollars in
2000 as part of the efforts to reduce its annual trade deficit of
more than 10 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Ghali said that at the meeting, Ebeid told Daley that Egypt is
keen on providing foreign investors with a stable investment
climate and creating investment opportunities for them in a bid
to sustain economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Daley promised to expound Egypt's investment opportunities to
the U.S. Department of Commerce, encourage U.S. businessmen to
invest in Egypt and work on further promoting trade relations
between the two countries, Ghali said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has so far invested an estimated 15 billion dollars in
Egypt, mainly in its oil sector, making it the largest investor in
the Arab, northeastern country.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, on the other hand, has expressed hope that the
U.S. would increase and diversify its investments.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi Thursday sent a message of condolence to Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa on the death of Julius Nyerere, former Tanzanian
president.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, Tanzania's founding father, died of chronic leukaemia

days beginning Friday following the death of Nyerere.

The president said he had lost a good friend. With passing
away of Nyerere, Moi said, Tanzania, east Africa and the entire
continent had lost a selfless son and a statesman who dedicated
his life to the cause of African dignity.
</P>
<P>
Moi had worked closely with Nyerere to bring about peace and
harmony in Burundi and known each other since 1950s during the
time of the Pan-African Movement for East and Central Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan president also recalled that while agitating for
independence under the umbrella of Pan-African Movement for East
and Central Africa, they used to meet in Nairobi, Moshi in

<HEADLINE> HK Land Sale Attracts Lukewarm Response </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Lands
Department sold two government lots for a total of 706 million HK
dollars (90.5 million US dollars) at a public auction Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's biggest property developer, Cheung Kong (Holdings)
Ltd., won the bid for a 14,435 square meter site in rural Tin Shui
Wai for 555 million HK dollars (71.15 million U.S. dollars),
slightly higher than the opening price of 500 million (64.1
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The smaller lot of 2,267 square meters in the luxury
residential area of Repulse Bay attracted keen bidding with the
government offering it for 120 million HK dollars (15.38 million U.
S. dollars). It was sold to Fu Hop International Investment Co.
Ltd., a registered shell company, for 151 million HK dollars (19.
23 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Analysts had expected the two sites put on sale by the
government to raise around one billion HK dollars (128.2 million U.
S. dollars), and the outcome indicated that a recovery in the
property market still had some way to go.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the land developers are cautious but active
as the land auction was seen as a key test for the health of the
property sector, one of the mainstays of the Hong Kong economy.
</P>
<P>
But over the past six months property prices have edged upwards
by about 10-15 percent, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
This was the fourth land auction by the HK government. On April
20, the government's first land sale in nine months raised almost
1.5 billion dollars (192.3 million U.S. dollars), beating market
projections of 1.2 billion dollars (153.8 million U.S. dollars)
for three residential plots on offer.
</P>
<P>
The government suspended its land sales program at the end of
June last year in a bid to shore up sagging property prices that
had been hit hard by the Asian financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Ships Allowed to Enter Yugoslav Waters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A Romanian convoy consisting
of 12 ships entered Yugoslavia's territorial waters this week, the
local daily newspaper Curentul quoted the director of the Drobeta
NFR River Navigation Company Dumitru Vidoe as saying.
</P>
<P>
They are the first Romanian cargo ships to enter the Yugoslav
territory since the Kosovo conflict broke out.
</P>
<P>
The convoy bound for Novi Sad to load grain in the Romanian
Black Seaport of Constanta.
</P>
<P>
Romanian shipowners and river operators blocked the Danube
River in August to draw the attention of the Yugoslav and Romanian
authorities to the difficulties the naval companies were facing,
which were caused by the delay of restoring traffic on the river.
</P>
<P>
Romanian river fleet operations have sunk into a poor state
after NATO's airstrikes destroyed three bridges in Yugoslavia,
blocking the traffic on the Danube in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Romanian naval companies registered huge losses from the
blockage, since almost 85 percent of the Romanian river
commodities freights are bound for Hungary, Austria and Germany
through the Yugoslav Danube River's waters. Millions of tonnes of
goods from and to Central Europe piled up in the Romanian ports by
the Danube and the Constanta Port.
</P>
<P>
Romania has the largest river fleet in Europe, with 1,100 non-
propelled vessels of 1,000-3,000 tonnes and over 180 tugboats of
500-4,600 horse power. International river traffic contributes 75
percent to the Romanian river's fleet capacity.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Somali People Cry for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Traditional leaders, civic
societies and women groups in Somalia are holding various and
well-organized demonstrations, expressing their desire to end the
deadlocked peace process in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
They are reacting actively to the proposals put forward by
Djibouti President Ismail Omar Gelle at the United Nations General
Assembly last month regarding the search of a solution to
Somalia's political crisis.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations began from the capital Mogadishu and were
immediately expanded to almost all the regions including Puntland.
</P>
<P>
According to the demonstrators, there's no hope of any
solution forthcoming from any meeting by the opposing faction
leaders alone.
</P>
<P>
It is noted that Somali artists, organized under the recently
founded Somalia's Artists Club, have nowadays started a new
campaign in fostering peace through large and extensive public
awareness program.
</P>
<P>
They held a series of outdoor gatherings in the populous parts
of the capital, especially around the main markets, and attracted
a lot of people with poems, songs and plays, all concerning how
devastating the civil war is and how the faction leaders have
failed to bring about any solution to the country.
</P>
<P>
In the populous area of Manapolio market in the north part of
Mogadishu, the artists set up large amplifiers, microphones,
drums and other musical instruments and started playing songs and
reading poems in the open air.
</P>
<P>
The artists said they were using their arts to distinguish the
flames of animosity among the Somalis. Some of the Somalis even
believe that the artists have been mainly responsible for the
popular uprising, which toppled the late regime in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The campaign has been pushed to the formerly dangerous Sana
junction in north Mogadishu, where the artists, in collaboration
with the women groups, have made a good lesson to the listeners
under the very hot sunshine by sensitizing how dreadful the civil
war is.
</P>
<P>
Then the campaign swept across the southern part of the
capital where the artists set up equipment in the super market of
Bakara, Somalia's largest business center, attracting hundreds of
people.
</P>
<P>
Abdurahman Mohamed Ali, one of the businessmen in the market,
said this shows how the people are ready to support any effort
towards a solution to Somalia's problems.
</P>
<P>
"The people are fed up with the fuss and complications of the
civil war and the illusions of the faction leaders," he said,
adding that "the clan- based arrogance could not take the people
any where."

HANOI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Among the approximate 15,000 HIV
carriers that have been detected in Vietnam so far, more than
7,000 are children of whom many have already died of the disease,
Vietnam News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>

The HIV infection rate among pregnant women in the country is
on the rise. This rate increased from zero percent in 1994 to 0.13
percent in the whole of 1998 and 0.08 percent in the first half of
1999. Each year, between 1,800 and 2,600 Vietnamese pregnant women
are infected with HIV.

<P>
To protect children from the threat of HIV/AIDS epidemic,
Vietnam's National HIV/AIDS Committee and the Ministry of

<HEADLINE> WTO to Order Canada, US to Scrap Unfair Auto Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization (
WTO) is siding with Japan and the European Union to ask Canada and
the United States to scrap their 34-year old auto pact.
</P>
<P>
Canadian media reported Thursday that the WTO believes the pact
to be preventive and unfair against foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
The ruling, which was first disclosed Wednesday, will take its
final form in about a month. Canada would have to get rid of the
pact within 90 days if the ruling were finalized at the time.
</P>
<P>
The final WTO rulings rarely deviate from interim decisions,
according to the country's media reports.
</P>
<P>
Canada and the U.S. forged the auto pact in 1965. Under the
deal, General Motors of Canada Ltd., Ford Motor Co of Canada Ltd.
and DaimlerChrysler Canada Inc. are required to build as many cars
in Canada as they sell.
</P>
<P>
The big three U.S. automakers in return are exempted from
paying a duty when they import cars for sales in Canada from
anywhere else in the world.

<HEADLINE> Mass Housing Program to Create More Jobs in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Thursday that his administration's mass housing
program to build nearly half a million homes for the poor in the
next two years will also generate jobs for hundreds of Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the signing of an accord for domestic industry
at the presidential palace, the president said, "We will build
about 400,000 houses within two years' time or maybe less than two
years. My target is about half a million in two years."
</P>
<P>
Aside from stepping up efforts to provide decent and affordable
shelter to the homeless, he added, the housing program will also
give the poor employment to help them live better.
</P>
<P>
Bienvenido Laguesma, secretary of the Labor and Employment
Department, also said that the mass housing program is expected to
benefit hundreds of thousands of workers if it is implemented in
full blast in the following years.
</P>
<P>
He said the housing scheme is labor-based and
equipment-supported because Estrada wants to create massive
employment opportunities for the people.
</P>
<P>
"In my view, the housing program will help a lot in creating
jobs because building houses needs many workers," Laguesma said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada has pledged to construct 1 million houses for the poor
during his term. He has also committed to providing decent shelter
to the country's policemen and soldiers.

CAIRO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The Starwood international hotel network is planning
to invest 300 million U.S. dollars in Lebanon to build seven new
hotels.
</P>
<P>
The network's manager for Africa and the Middle East, Sami
Zoghbi, was quoted as saying that Lebanon is becoming more healthy
and is restoring its tourism role in the region and the world.
</P>
<P>
The Starwood took charge from the beginning of the year the
luxurious Bristol Hotel in Beirut which is currently under
renovation. Starwood owns a chain of 720 hotels in 70 countries.
</P>
<P>
Tourists flocking into Lebanon amount to about 600,000 a year
as compared to 1 million tourists before the 1975-90 civil war.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt's foreign currency reserves dropped to 17.582
billion U.S. dollars in July from 18.066 billion dollars in June,
said a report issued by the Central Bank of Egypt Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The monthly report said the foreign currency reserves reached
the climax of 20.183 billion dollars in September last year, but
began to decline in the following month.
</P>
<P>
GAZA -- The Palestinian National Authority is pinning great
hopes on the Tokyo conference of donor countries starting Thursday
to overcome its steady financial deficits and raise the necessary
funds for its development projects.
</P>
<P>
Director General of the Palestinian Ministry of Planning and
International Cooperation Magdi Al Khaldi was quoted as saying
Thursday that the Palestinian development plan is experiencing a
real crisis as a result of the lack of finances, due to the
failure of donor to live up to their pledges.
</P>
<P>
The donor countries had pledged at their last meeting to
provide 750 million dollars, but only 250 million dollars has so
far been extended, Khaldi said.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the situation is not much different in the past year
when pledges to the Palestinian Authority amounted to 650 million
dollars, of which only 390 million dollars were transferred.
</P>
<P>
According to the Palestinian Central Statistics Department, the
per capita gross national product in Palestinian self-rule areas
is 1,763 dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 Washington conference for donor countries pledged 3.3
billion dollars over the next five years, of which 750 million
dollars were earmarked for 1999.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt's inflation rate stood at 1.9 percent on a
year-on-year basis in July, dropping by 2.4 percentage points from
the same period last year, a report issued by the Central Bank of
Egypt said on Wednesday.

According to the monthly report, the inflation rate also
declined to 0.1 percent in July on a monthly basis, compared to
0.3 percent in June.

in the country.

<HEADLINE> CCT Telecom to Continue Invest in China's Mainland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The investment environment in
China's mainland is becoming better and better, according to
Clement Mak, chairman of CCT Telecom Holdings Limited, a Hong Kong-
based integrated information technology services provider.
</P>
<P>
CCT Telecom will continue to invest on telecom projects in the
mainland as the company's business there has enjoyed a smooth
development in the past years, Flora Cheng, executive director of
the company, said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
CCT Telecom, originally a manufacturer of telecom products and
electronic and plastic components, started its telecom networks
business in 1997 by cooperating with China Unicom in investing on
GSM networks in northern China's Shanxi province.
</P>
<P>
Later on, the company took part in China Unicom's GSM networks
project in Shanghai, the biggest city in China.
</P>
<P>
So far, CCT Telecom has invested more than 500 million HK
dollars (64 million U.S. dollars) in the GSM networks in China's
mainland and the company has begun to make profits from the
investment.
</P>
<P>
The company now has several factories on the mainland to
manufacture dual and trio band mobile phones and other telecom
products.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of 1998, CCT Telecom began entering Hong Kong'
s Internet market by buying HK Net. Eight months later, HK Net
ranked 2nd in the share of Internet market in Hong Kong with 160,
000 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
HK Net is a provider of diversified Internet services including
ISP, IDD, Portal/ICP, E-Commerce, VPN, Security, System
integration, Web hosting and co-location and Web design.
</P>
<P>
HK Net has been recently elected the 4th Internet company in
Asia by Telecom Asia Magazine.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Japan's NTT Communication Corporation bought
49 percent of the shares of HK Net, becoming a strategic partner
of HK Net.
</P>
<P>
CCT Telecom is planning to list HK Net on the NASDAQ stock
exchange of the United States at the beginning of next year and
the company is now applying for the fixed wireless license and the
external gateway license from the government.
</P>
<P>
CCT Telecom is making efforts to become a global telecom
operator in the future, Mak said.

OTTAWA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean

<HEADLINE> Nyerere's Contributions to Sino-Tanzanian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador to
Tanzania Wang Yongqiu Thursday praised the late Tanzanian leader,
Julius Nyerere, for his "indelible contribution to the friendship
between Tanzania and China".
</P>
<P>
Mourning the death of the Tanzania's founding father, the
Chinese envoy said: "Having profound friendship with three
generations of Chinese leaders, Nyerere is an old friend of the
Chinese people and enjoys a high reputation both in China and in
the world."
</P>
<P>
Wang said he was shocked at the sad news and expressed deep
sorrow for Nyerere's death.
</P>
<P>
"Nyerere built the friendship between Tanzania and China along
with Chinese late leaders Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The death of Nyerere is also a great loss to the Chinese
people," said the ambassador. But he expressed the belief that the
two countries' friendly relationship will be consolidated under
the leadership of Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa.
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of Nyerere and his successors, Wang said ,
 Tanzania has been adhering to "one China" policy and greatly
supported China in many international issues such as resumption of
its legal status at the United Nations and human rights.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere led the Tanzanian people to gain independence and made
a great contribution to the making of a steady political
environment and economic development.
</P>
<P>
He also contributed to the independence and liberation of the
African people, to the unity and peace of the African countries
and to the elimination of racism in the continent, the Chinese
ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere visited China for more than 10 times during his life.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Embassy in Tanzania flew its national flag at
half-mast soon after it heard Nyerere's death. Nyerere died of
leukemia in a London hospital on Thursday morning.

<P>
HONG KONG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Health and
Welfare Bureau has pledged to provide more public hospital beds,
improve public health and curative services, as well as promote
healthy living by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The target was announced by Secretary for Health and Welfare, E
K Yeoh, when he introduced plans for health care services next
year at a meeting of the Legislative Council (LegCo) Panel on
Health Services Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yeoh said the bureau aimed to provide 853 additional public

since last April, and the remainder before the end of next March.
</P>
<P>
"In the 2000-2001 financial year, the bureau will provide a
further 460 public hospital beds," Yeoh said, adding that the
total number of beds in the public hospital system by then would

<TEXT>
<P>
The report alleges that in China, foreigners' religious
activities face more limits and monitorings and that preaching is
not allowed in the country.
</P>
<P>
The fact is that the Chinese government fully respects the
freedom in religious belief of all the foreigners within its
territory, and protects their normal religious activities.
</P>
<P>
"The Provision on the Administration of Religious Activities of
Aliens Within the Territory of the People's Republic of China,"
which was promulgated by the Chinese government in 1994,
categorically stipulates that China respects the freedom in
religious belief of aliens within its territory, and protects
friendly contacts and cultural and academic exchanges of aliens
with Chinese religious circles.
</P>
<P>
It also stipulates that aliens may participate in religious
activities at sites for religious activities within the Chinese
territory, may preach and expound their scriptures at Chinese
sites for religious activities at the invitation of Chinese
religious bodies at or above the level of provinces, autonomous
regions and municipalities, may hold religious activities attended
by aliens at the sites for religious activities approved by the
department of religious affairs of the people's government at or
above the county level, may invite Chinese religious personnel to
hold such religious ceremonies as baptism, weddings, funerals, and
Taoist and Buddhist rites, and may carry into the country
religious printed matter, religious audio-visual products and
other religious articles for personal use.
</P>
<P>
Also, when China holds large international conferences, sports
events, and cultural and academic exchanges, organizers may apply
to the Chinese government for designating special religious sites
for the religious activities of foreign participants.

During the Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995, religious
organizations and sites in the city of Beijing received over 10,
000 participants from 103 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, a U.S. religious delegation led by Rabbi Arthur
Schneier, president of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation,
Archbishop Theodore McCarrick of the Newark Roman Catholic
Archdiocese, and Reverend Don Argue, president of the National
Association of Evangelicals, visited China and was received by
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Chairman Li Ruihuan of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to China the same year, U.S. President Bill
Clinton went with his family to the Chongwenmen Church in downtown
Beijing to attend Sunday morning services.
</P>
<P>
As a sovereign state, China has always held that its relations
with other countries should grow on the basis of friendship.
Aliens conducting any activities, including religious activities,
within the Chinese territory should naturally abide by China's
laws and regulations, and not undermine the country's public
interest, nor interfere in its internal affairs including
religious ones, nor preach or spread religious materials to the
public.
</P>
<P>
For those aliens that violate the country's laws and
regulations, Chinese law-enforcement departments have every right
to punish them according to law. If this is regarded as limiting
and monitoring aliens, one would like to ask whether the United
States allows aliens to engage in unlawful activities within its
territory.

TOKYO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo

</P>
<P>
The two leaders reached the agreement during a 25-minute

<HEADLINE> HK Govt Committed to Improving Elderly Welfare Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government has
pledged to provide premises for more than 14,000 residential care
places in the coming nine years.
</P>
<P>
For the short term, the government expects to provide an
additional 4,500 residential care places of various types between
1999/2000 and 2001/2002 to shorten the waiting time for admission
into care-and-attention homes.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the government will allocate 10 million HK
dollars (1.28 million U.S. dollars) over the next two years to
help strengthen the functioning and problem-solving abilities of
families at risk and the development of parenting skills.
</P>
<P>
These were disclosed by Secretary for Health and Welfare E. K.
Yeoh, at the (Legislative Council) LegCo Welfare Services Panel
meeting on the 1999 Policy Address Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of work progress, Yeoh said that of the 38 pledges
made last year to improve elderly services, action on 11 pledges
had been completed while the rest were making steady progress.
</P>
<P>
To enable elderly people to lead an active and meaningful life
in their golden years, Yeoh said the Social Welfare Department,
Education Department and voluntary organizations had been
providing them a range of continuing education courses, as well as
social and recreational activities.
</P>
<P>
"And building on the momentum of the International Year of
Older Persons, we plan to strengthen our work in this key area in
the coming years," he added.
</P>
<P>
Notwithstanding the present climate, Yeoh continued, the
government will inject fund to provide in the next financial year
new or additional services, including 300 child-care center places.
</P>
<P>
"In conclusion," Yeoh stressed, "the government remains firmly
committed to helping those members of our community in need."

<HEADLINE> China Refutes U.S. Charges on Religious Freedom (8) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In order to maintain stability and unity in Xinjiang and assure
the safety and normal life of local Moslems, the local government
has stood firmly against religious extremism and has cracked down
on violence and terrorist activities in accordance with law, and
as requested by the local people themselves.
</P>
<P>
The effort made by the government, therefore, is fully
justified, as separatist activity would in no way be tolerated by
any country in the world, and would be dealt with firmly.
</P>
<P>
The authors of the report, who regard as abnormal the legally
justifiable punishment against the very small number of
separatists and terrorists, went on to make accusations against
China. Judging by their accusations, people can see very clearly
what they support and what they oppose.
</P>
<P>
The report does not mind taking the trouble to list many "
individual" issues in a bid to accuse China of conducting what it
calls religious persecution.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the Chinese government is committed to
freedom of religious belief. And the Chinese Constitution and laws
provide Chinese citizens full guarantees for freedom of religious
belief and legal religious activity, therefore there is no
question of an issue of religious persecution.
</P>
<P>
Under the Chinese Constitution, every Chinese citizen enjoys
equal rights and obligations in the eyes of the law, and any
person who commits any criminal act is subject to criminal
prosecution regardless of their religious belief.
</P>
<P>
No single person in China has been or will be detained or
imprisoned simply because of their religious beliefs or their
legal religious activities. On the contrary, stipulations have
been made within China's criminal laws saying that any government
employee who illegally deprives any citizens of their freedom of
religious belief is subject to up to two-year imprisonment, or
criminal detention according to the seriousness of the case. But
those who use religion as a camouflage for illegal activities will
be dealt with firmly according to law.

<P>
The report also accuses China of "imposing restrictions on
construction of new mosques" in Xinjiang, and of having "arrested
and executed quite a few Moslems."
</P>
<P>
In fact, Moslems in Xinjiang have the complete right to enjoy
freedom of religious belief, and there are enough mosques in the
region to satisfy the religious needs of the Moslems.
</P>
<P>
Only a few ethnic separatists have been punished by Chinese law
enforcement departments for the violence and terrorist activities
they have committed, which has nothing to do with their religious
belief.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang is a region with quite a few ethnic Islamic groups
that densely populate part of the region.
</P>
<P>
Under the system of ethnic regional autonomy, the Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region has been established to ensure regional
ethnic autonomy, and people in the region fully enjoy their right
of religious belief as protected by law.
</P>
<P>
There are nine million Moslems in Xinjiang, accounting for half
of all the Moslems in China, but the number of mosques in the
region totals 23,000 and represents two-thirds of the total in
China, or one mosque for every 200 Moslems. More than 30,000
Moslems in Xinjiang have gone on the pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi
Arabia in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The great majority of Islamic people in Xinjiang and other
religious believers there are patriotic and law-abiding and
conduct their religious activities as permitted by laws and
regulations and government policies.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, the situation in Xinjiang can be
characterized as one of stability and unity among the different
ethnic groups. Terrorist activities in the past few years such as
murders and bombings committed by a very small number of ethic
separatists who use Islam as a camouflage have caused great
indignation among the Moslems of various ethnic groups who
strongly oppose such violence.

<P>
Some cults have existed in parts of China in recent years whose
leading members spread misinformation using religion as a
camouflage to deceive the general public, swindle money and
property from people, and sexually exploit women. These people are
hated bitterly by the general public and religious people. Taking
legal action against the leading members according to law is meant
to rid the people of a scourge and benefit the community.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, there is no country in the world which
allows illegal and criminal activities in the name of religion.
One has to ask why it was quite reasonable for the United States
to ban the Branch Davidian cult a few years ago, and Japan to
outlawed the Aum Shinrikyo religious cult, while China is being
accused of "persecuting religious people" simply because it banned
some cults?
</P>
<P>
While ignoring its own problems, including religious ones, the
United States has been making purely fictitious and improper
comments about China's religious affairs, willfully vilifying
China, and even threatening sanctions and demanding that China
amend its laws in a way preferred by the United States.
</P>
<P>
The key point at issue is the United States using the freedom
of religion as a camouflage to grossly interfere in China's
internal affairs, which is absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese
government and people.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government must immediately put an end to interfering
in China's internal affairs through the use of the so-called
religious issue.

HONG KONG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong police and customs
seized over 796,000 pornographic items including 698,000 VCDs
during the 1999 campaign against pornographic materials which
ended on September 30.
</P>
<P>
Some 361 persons that were suspected of breaching the
provisions of the Control of Obscene and Indecent Articles
Ordinance were arrested in the 328 operations, according to a
briefing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The campaign was jointly launched in mid-July 1999 by the
Police, the Customs and Excise Department, and the Television and
Entertainment Licensing Authority (TELA).
</P>
<P>
Esmond Lee, assistant commissioner for Television and
Entertainment Licensing, said that the three enforcement
departments stepped up action against retail black spots and
suspected wholesale outlets and manufacturing plant, thereby
minimizing young people's access to pornographic materials.
</P>
<P>
"TELA also enhanced young people's understanding of the bad
influence of pornographic materials through publicity and public
education," he said.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Dismantle 12 Jewish Encampments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Israel will begin from next
week to dismantle 12 Jewish encampments in the West Bank under an
agreement reached between the government and settler leaders, the
Prime Minister's Office said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Danny Yatom, political and security advisor to Prime Minister
Ehud Barak, met settler leaders here Wednesday night. The two
sides agreed to remove 12 hilltop outposts instead of 15 as
decided earlier by Barak.
</P>
<P>
Of the 12 outposts, one will remain as pasture land and another
as a preparatory school through the end of the school year and
their future will then be discussed.
</P>
<P>
The settler leaders, who had opposed Barak's decision, said
they were satisfied with the results and promised that they would
help facilitate the evacuations.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on this issue, President Ezer Weizman said that the
dismantlement of the illegal encampments is necessary and the
result could help push the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
After the first meeting Sunday of a ministerial committee
reviewing the policy on Jewish settlements under former right-wing
government, Barak informed Jewish settler leaders Tuesday that he
plans to dismantle 15 encampments illegally built in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Barak said his decision was based on the recommendations from
the defense establishment, which found that settlers have
established 42 encampments throughout the West Bank since the
signing of the Wye River peace accord last fall and their
legalities were all in question.
</P>
<P>
"I consider settlement activities in the West Bank, which was
always conducted at the behest and with the authorization of the
government, very important. But I think the law is of utmost
importance," Barak told the leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians regard Jewish settlements in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip as illegal and demand that Israel evacuate all 144
settlements in these areas.
</P>
<P>
They were angry with Barak for approving the construction of
2,600 new housing units this week in four settlements near
Jerusalem, saying the settlement expansion could prevent the start
of the final status talks and destroy the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel denied it was expanding Jewish settlements, saying that
the new housing units are all within the borders of existing
settlements.
</P>
<P>
One month after a ceremonial start, Israel has yet to name its
negotiators in the final status talks, in which the fate of the
Jewish settlements will be dealt with. The Palestinians accused
Israel of foot-dragging.

MANILA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
planning to prioritize the rehabilitation of irrigation systems
in rural areas to boost rice production, a senior official said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary Edgardo Angara said in a radio speech
that the government needs to maximize rice production in these
areas and help attain self-sufficiency in this staple.
</P>
<P>
"We'll prioritize irrigation in rice-producing areas. We have
to maximize our rice production," Angara stressed.
</P>
<P>
Among the areas covered by this priority, he said, are Iloilo,
Cagayan Valley, Central Luzon, Bohol, and parts of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
He added that in the next five years, his department would
allocate 1 billion pesos (25 million U.S. dollars) a year for
rehabilitating irrigation systems.
</P>
<P>
Angara said his department would correct a discrepancy in
irrigation, noting that 89 percent of Central Luzon is irrigated
as compared to only 11 percent of the Visayan, central part of the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
He also said that with the irrigation systems, the government
expects the percentage of land irrigated in Mindanao to rise from
22 percent to 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
"By the end of the Estrada administration, we hope we will be
able to bring that up to the national average of 54 percent,"
Angara added.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Greece on Thursday
signed two documents for economic, scientific and technical
cooperation in agriculture sector as well as in women's affairs.
</P>
<P>
The documents were inked at the end of a three-day visit to
Tehran by Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos, the first visit
by a Greek head of state since the victory of Iran's Islamic
Revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
According to the protocol on agricultural cooperation, the two
sides agreed on the exchange of related technology and scientific
data, exchange of researchers, and holding of regular sessions,
the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Greece stressed cooperation in such areas as
irrigation, fight against drought and desertification, as well as
olive cultivation and breeding.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of the second agreement, the two countries agreed
on providing facilities for broader participation of women in the
two countries in line with the trend of dialog among civilizations
and scientific-research activities of women, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the signing ceremony, Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami underlined the need for further
expansion and consolidation of Tehran-Athens ties in various
fields.
</P>
<P>
He said officials of the two countries have reviewed mechanisms
for future bilateral cooperation, and held talks on mutual support
for implementation of joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Iran's relations with members of the European
Union (EU), Khatami said that Iran's policy of detente in the past
two years has resulted in further consolidation of Tehran's
relations with European nations on the basis of respect for each
other's interests and principles.
</P>
<P>
Iran's third national five-year economic development plan
(2000-2005) stipulates further expansion of ties between Iran and
other countries, he said, voicing Tehran's readiness in exporting
its technical and engineering services to other countries.
</P>
<P>
The Greek president termed his visit to Iran as "positive" and
said that consolidation of bilateral relations in the field of
joint venture is highly important.
</P>
<P>
Citing culture and civilization as two major factors in dialog
among civilizations proposed by his Iranian counterpart, he said
that his country would spare no effort in further expansion of
ties between Iran and European countries.
</P>
<P>

historical city of Isfahan in central Iran on Thursday morning.

Mali that China is ready to make joint efforts with Mali to push
forward bilateral relations.

cooperation.

other country. China and Mali established diplomatic relations in
October, 1960.

cooperative projects China established in Mali over the past few
years have been running quite well, and have generated certain
economic and social benefits.

Keita said he was deeply impressed by the huge achievements
China made over the past 20 years of reform and opening.
</P>
<P>
He said Mali highly values its friendship with China, which has
withstood the test of time. Mali will continue to attach
importance to its relationship with China because China has been
sincere to the African people, and never names any pre-conditions
in the development of bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Gymnasts: Like Father Like Son </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Gymnastics is believed to be a
sport of talents and  usually a family heredity leads young
gymnasts to the way of success.
</P>
<P>
That's true in the current Tianjin world championships when
gymnastics family got together with fathers and son and daughters
competing and coaching under the same roof.
</P>
<P>
Japan's leading gymnast Naoya Tsukahara is the son of Tsukahara,
the 1972 Olympic and 1970 world champion and inventor of the
Tsukahara Vault and Tsukahara Dismount of High Bar. The junior
Tsukahara tried every effort to emulate his famous father and led
the Japanese men's team to a fourth place in the final.
</P>
<P>
Naoya's teammate Akihiro Kasamatsu also came from a famous
gymnastics family. Akihiro's father, Shigeru Kasamatsu, will never
be forgotten because of the tragedy in 1976 Montreal Olympic Games,
where the senior Kasamatsu had to undergo an appendix operation
just days prior to what should have been his Olympic gold medal
competition.
</P>
<P>
But Akihiro and Naoya, the "brothers in arms", will try to
retrieve their family glory and spearhead the Japanese team to the
medal podium in next year's Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Besides the father-son gymnasts, great coaches also have a role
to play to guide their children to be the world class gymnasts.
</P>
<P>
Jesus Carballo, a former national coach for the Spanish men's
and women's team, is the father of the 1996 world champion on high
bar Jesus Carballo-Junior.
</P>
<P>
Jana Komrskova of Czech Republic surged into the all-around
competition as a surprise. Jana is named after her father, Jan
Komrskov, who is the Czech national coach and was used to
dominating the world with star gymnast Vera Caslavska.
</P>
<P>
Yewki Yomita, 19, the youngest gymnast in the United States
team in Tianjin, who competed in the Individual all-around final
on Thursday, is also coached by his father Yoichi Yomita, who
competed for the American national team in 1979-80.
</P>
<P>
Krisztian Jordanov is one of the best gymnasts in the Hungarian
team. He was so sad about his team's failure to qualify for the
Sydney Olympic Games by finishing 13th in the team final. The
coach who comforted him was his father, Zoltan Jordanov, whose
father and Krisztian's grandfather, Dimitar Vassilev, was in fact
the first outstanding gymnast in the family. Dimitar competed in
the 1952 Olympic Games with the Bulgarian team.

<HEADLINE> Thai Banks Seen Unlikely to Profit in Near Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's banks are unlikely
to return to profit in the near term since some 863.5 billion baht
(22.1 billion U.S. dollars) are needed to overhaul the whole
system, international ratings agency Standard and Poor's said in a
report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The rating agency said the money is needed to restore solvency,
absorb losses on problem loans and recapitalize to prevent the
heightened risk profile.
</P>
<P>
The Thai banking sector should recapitalize by injecting common
equity, but there is insufficient capacity in the market to meet
this need, the agency said in the report.
</P>
<P>
Aggressive loan restructuring could moderate capital needs, but
restructured loans will remain vulnerable in the still fragile
operating environment, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The recapitalization needs of the public-owned and nationalized
banks represent about 20 percent of the sector assets, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Though the report acknowledged some positive developments of
Thai banks, it also pointed out the risks posed by overstated
collateral values and inadequate provisioning.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thai Farmers' Bank, the country's third largest bank
in assets, reported Thursday a 9.42-billion-baht (241.5 million
dollars) net loss in the third quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The figure is a noticeable improvement from the
19.44-billion-baht (498.4 million dollars) net loss in the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Moody's Investors Service, another ratings agency, has sent
three analysts to Thailand to conduct reassessment of the
country's economic situation this week.
</P>
<P>
The evaluation of the country's economic recovery progress
could lead to a review of the agency's Thailand's sovereign rating
which is now at Ba1, one degree below the investment grade.
</P>
<P>
But there has been mixed expectation in the local business
sector toward Moody's assessment of the Thai economy.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Founding President Nyerere Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian founding
president Julius Nyerere died of chronic lymphocytic leukemia
Thursday morning in a London hospital, aged 77, Tanzanian
President Benjamin Mkapa announced in the capital Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the nation on TV, Mkapa said Tanzania has lost an
important leader and he urged the nation to be "cool as there is
no cause for panic."
</P>
<P>
The president said "everything is under control", adding that
the country is waiting for the arrival of the late leader's body.
However, he did not mention when Nyerere's body will be carried
home.
</P>
<P>
"All Tanzanians will continue with what Nyerere has already
done to this country especially in guarding our national union
with Zanzibar, which has been our main force of unity of the
country," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere led the then Tanganyika to independence from Britain in
1961 and masterminded its union with Zanzibar in 1964 to form
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said "everyone of us in Tanzania is saddened and shocked
at the news." He added that Nyerere will be given all respects he
deserves and the government will issue more statements later.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, revered as the father of the nation, was diagnosed
with leukemia last year. He was admitted at St. Thomas' Hospital
in London for treatment on September 24 and his condition
deteriorated abruptly on September 30. An extensive sub-arachnoid
hemorrhage had hit him before he passed away.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere is survived by his wife Maria Nyerere, five sons and
three daughters.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa summoned national media leaders on Thursday morning and
announced the death of Nyerere at 11:50 a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
Most of the residents received the news with unusual calm with
no outpouring of grief. Coconut peddlers are still doing their
business and everything goes on in order.
</P>
<P>
However, many people said they are saddened by Nyerere's death.
A 27- year-old man, Masord Tulio, who works at Dotto Adverts
company, said that he is in deep sorrow as Nyerere is the father
of the nation. He said that several clients have requested his
firm to put advertisements on newspapers in memory of the late
leader.
</P>
<P>
National TV cut off normal programs and started to show the
video footage of Nyerere's lifetime. Nyerere was seen preparing
farmland, speaking and waving his hand in public gatherings, or
busy with other political affairs. At the same time radio stations
are narrating the stories of his life.
</P>
<P>
Several foreign embassies have made responses shortly after
they heard the news. The Chinese and Danish embassies lowered
their flags half-mast after Mkapa made the announcement.

<HEADLINE> China Refutes U.S. Charges on Religious Freedom (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Religious
Bureau of the State Council issued an article today refuting
charges leveled by the U.S. State Department's "Annual Report on
International Religious Freedom for 1999" against China's policy
on religion.
</P>
<P>
The following is the full text of the article:
</P>
<P>
The State Department of the United States recently issued its "
Annual Report on International Religious Freedom for 1999", which
irresponsibly commented on religious affairs in many countries,
including China, threw mud at China for no reasons, listed China
as a country for "special concern" based on the "the
International Religious Freedom Act", and went so far as to
threaten China with sanctions.
</P>
<P>
We are strongly indignant at and resolutely opposed to such
unfounded and unreasonable accusations.
</P>
<P>
The China section of the "Annual Report on International
Religious Freedom for 1999" is nothing new, but rumors, distortion,
fabrication and imagination with some brand-new packaging, plus
some threats as always, to create excuses for the implementation
of its International Religious Freedom Act.
</P>
<P>
We must solemnly point out with justice that in China, freedom
of religious belief is a fundamental right to which all citizens
are entitled by the Constitution and law and the problem of "
religious persecution" does not exist in China. Such fact can not
be distorted by anyone in any means.

<P>
Chinese citizens enjoy full religious freedom. China is not
only a large country in terms of population, it is also a major
country in terms of religion, with schools of Buddhism, Taoism,
Islam, Catholicism, Protestantism and others, and a total of 100
million religious adherents among a national population of 1.2
billion.
</P>
<P>
Religious adherents engage in various religious activities at
temples, mosques, churches and individual residences. There are
85,000 places of worship across the country, 300,000 clergymen,
over 3,000 religious organizations, and 74 religious seminaries
run by those organizations to train clergymen.
</P>
<P>
All religious organizations operate their own affairs
independently, run seminaries to suit their own needs, publish
their classical works and other publications, and have service
organs for the public interest.
</P>
<P>
In the case of Christianity, more than 20 million copies of the
Bible have been printed in the past ten and more years, making
Chinese Christianity the largest school of religion in the world
in terms of Bible publication.
</P>
<P>
Most religious figures praise the fact that this is the best
time for all the religions in Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
The authors of the U.S. State Department's report have put on
a masquerade of caring for the religious freedom in other
countries, and have been repetitiously producing legislative bills
and reports for the alleged purpose of improving religious freedom
in other countries.
</P>
<P>
Faced with the sound conditions of religion in China, they
still irresponsibly throw stones at China like a blind man feeling
a giant elephant. Can anyone believe they do not have ulterior
motives?

<P>
Along with hackneyed and stereotyped expressions, the U.S.
report chooses bits and pieces with which to criticize China to
deny any achievements made by the Chinese government in the field.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the fact that the Chinese people have the right to
believe in religion, a right protected by Chinese law, the report'
s authors had to acknowledge the freedom of religious belief among
the Chinese on one hand, but repudiated the role of the law to
standardize social behavior in China on the other hand.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. report made the nonsensical charge that the
registration of religious places to the Chinese government means
strict control of religious groups and their activities.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Chinese government strives for better protection
for the legitimate rights of religious groups through registration,
in accordance with the Chinese law.
</P>
<P>
It is also an international practice to register social groups.
In China, any social group, including religious one, must apply
for registration from civil affairs authorities, a practice which
is in agreement with the management regulation for social groups.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the management regulations for religious
ritual places which was promulgated in 1994, appropriate religious
activities in ritual places should be protected by the law, and no
group or individual may infringe on religious people's legitimate
rights or intervene in their affairs.
</P>
<P>
The regulation also stipulates that all ritual places which
meet the legal requirements can be authorized to register. After
registration, the ritual place can obtain legitimate status, which
is fully safeguarded by the law.
</P>
<P>
If there are infringements on its legal rights, religious
groups and management bodies for religious activities may appeal
to governmental administrative organs or even people's courts to
seek legal settlement.

<TEXT>
<P>
Therefore, Chinese religious figures uphold the regulation on
registration of religious places. If ordering religious groups to
register is a restriction, many nations and regions throughout the
world are implementing the very same "restriction."
</P>
<P>
What is the purpose of the U.S. criticizing the registration
regulation, a practice normal in many countries?
</P>
<P>
In addition, the U.S. report talked nonsense about 30 million
Chinese people carrying out their Mass at "home churches". In fact,
there are no "house churches" in China.
</P>
<P>
Christians usually organize religious rituals in families,
which is only called a House Meeting. Christians who take part in
the House Meeting also join congregations in churches, except for
those who are too old or weak. House Meetings are just a
supplement to church meetings.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government respects these House Meetings and would
never intervene.
</P>
<P>
The authorities do not ask religious believers to register
these kinds of gatherings, and they neither intervene in nor
restrict their activities.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the Chinese government has no specific statistics on
House Meetings. The U.S. report barely knows the facts about the
religious activities of the Chinese people, but rather fabricates
stories according to their own daydreams.
</P>
<P>
After randomly criticizing religious freedom and governmental
management in China, the U.S. report pretends to bewail the times
and pity the people, asking the Chinese government to revise its
laws and regulations and loosen the requirements for registration.
</P>
<P>
It is rude as well as naive for the U.S. to intervene in the
internal affairs of other nations and impose its own will on them.
</P>
<P>
In today's world, there is no nation with sovereignty that
follows up other nations' will or allows them to intervene in its
internal affairs.

<HEADLINE> Howard Rolls Out Brakes in Australian Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard rolled out Thursday any possible brakes in the Australian
economy.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister believed Australia's economy was stronger
now than at any time in the past, and had reached a new plateau.
</P>
<P>
"We have been able to see the Australian economy grow at a
faster rate without us having to slam on the brakes," APP quoted
him as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the past, each time the economy grew, it was bedeviled by a
blowout in inflation or the current account, forcing the
government to slam on the brakes, he said. "We don't have to do
that now. That is the new freedom, the higher plateau of economic
liberation that Australia is now enjoying," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We can run a stronger economy for longer without higher
inflation, without a balance of payments crisis, and therefore
over time generate more jobs," he added.
</P>
<P>
Howard's comment was contrary to that of economic experts here
who believe a rise of interest rate would be unavoidable later
this year and it would mean a brake in the economy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the consumer sentiment index issued by
Westpac-Melbourne institute was 112.9 points during October, down
from 113.9 points the previous month. Experts see it as a sign
that as the major driver of the country's economy, consumption in
Australia has passed its zenith.

<HEADLINE> S. Lankan President Calls on Opposition to Work for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has called on the main opposition United National
Party (UNP) to prove its sincerity in ending the long-running
ethnic conflict, Cabinet Spokesman Mangala Samaraweera said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He told a weekly press briefing that Kumaratunga sent an
eight-page letter to UNP leader Ranil Wickremasinghe on Tuesday in
response to his recent remarks on the readiness to solve the
ethnic conflict.
</P>
<P>
"I hasten to stress the necessity for you to finally make a
clear, concrete decision as to the precise set of proposals that
should be discussed with the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam)," said President Kumaratunga in her letter.
</P>
<P>
She blamed Ranil Wickremasinghe for the delaying of the
negotiated settlement of the ethnic war which has been fought
since 1983 between the government and the LTTE who demand a
separate Tamil homeland in Sri Lanka's north and east.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga described in details the indecisive and
uncooperative attitude displayed by Wickremasinghe's UNP towards
the government's proposals of constructive bipartisan action
during the last four years.
</P>
<P>
"Let it be remembered by all our people that for every day you
procrastinate, another precious Sri Lankan lives are lost," she
said, referring to the heavy casualties caused by the ongoing war.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga said, to prove its sincerity for peace, the UNP has
to give specific proposals for a solution to the ethnic problem,
speak out its specific views on the entire set of proposals
presented by the government.
</P>
<P>
She added that the UNP should give a specific date and a time-
frame to hold bipartisan talks on ethnic issue as well as a full
and honest explanation to the people of the content and purpose of
the several discussions the UNP representative has had with the
LTTE over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
Ranil Wickremasinghe and his UNP are not immediately available
for comment on the letter.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Nobel Laureate Thanks Motherland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian scientist who has
just won the Nobel Prize for chemistry has expressed gratitude for
his nation, saying that he owes a lot to it for his success,
Egypt's national daily Al-Ahram reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the Arabic-language newspaper on
Wednesday, Ahmad Zoweil described Egypt as "mother of
civilization," wishing his motherland prosperity and welfare.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Egyptian-born scientist was honored by the
Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for his pioneering role in a
revolution in chemistry by demonstrating that a rapid laser
technique can observe the motion of atoms in a molecule as they
occur during a chemical reaction.
</P>
<P>
The value of the prize is that Egypt has now a prominent
position in the history of science, Zoweil said, expressing hope
that the prize would help Egyptian youngsters to see that success
can be gained through hard work.
</P>
<P>
Soon after Zoweil was laureated the Nobel Prize, Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and Prime Minister Atef Ebeid sent
separate cables of congratulations on his success, terming him as
"one of Egypt's exemplary sons."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said the prize "is a tribute to the
Egyptian people who produced this scientist."
</P>
<P>
Zoweil, who holds both Egyptian and U.S. citizenship, has held
the Linus Pauling chair of chemical physics at the California
Institute of Technology since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish academy honored him for his pioneering
investigation of fundamental chemical reactions, using ultra-short
laser flashes, on the time scale in which the reactions actually
occur.
</P>
<P>
The academy said Zoweil's work in the late 1980s led to the
birth of femtochemistry, the use of high-speed cameras to monitor
chemical reactions at a scale of femtoseconds, or
0.000000000000001 second.
</P>
<P>
Zoweil is the third Egyptian to be honored the Nobel Prize. In
1978, the late president, Anwar Sadat, won the Nobel Prize for
peace after reaching a peace agreement with Israel. Naguib
Mahfouz, a renowned writer, was awarded the prize for literature
in 1988.

Chuan was responding to reporters' question whether Thailand

"The Thai government realizes what we should do with the five
armed Myanmar students seizing the Myanmar Embassy and holding 96

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A new generation of gymnasts
stole the limelight by impeccable performance as Maria Olaru of
Romania rallied to win the women's all-around title at the
gymnastics World Championships here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Olaru, the hottest contender for the title,
surged to claim the victory with an aggregate score of 38.774
points, followed by Vyctoria Karpenko of Ukraine in 38.705 and
Elena Zamolodchikova of Russia 38.687, respectively.
</P>
<P>
"Today's competition is in a way that looks like the team final
on Tuesday because it is until the last apparatus that the final
result is clear, " said the Romanian head coach Octavian Bellu.
</P>
<P>
Olaru, 1.61cm, silver medalist at Goodwill Games in the United
States last year, planted her name into everyone's heart when she
led through the qualifying ground and team final with flawless
routines, of which were all above 9.600 points.
</P>
<P>
However, she placed seventh after her first rotation on the
uneven bars in today's finals, fourth after the beam in 9.737, and
second overall before she scored a decisive 9.625 in the last
apparatus of the vault. The score was good enough for her to edge
pace-setter Karpenko by 0.69 points for the title.
</P>
<P>
Karpenko led after the third rotation, suffered a weak vault of
9.493 points and had to settle for the silver medal.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Elena Produnova of Russia won the fourth in 38.
675, ahead of Andreea Raducan of Romania 38.617. Chinese Dong
Fangxiao and Huang Mandan ranked fifth and sixth in 38.143 and 38.
018, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Svetlana Khorkina of Russia finished a
distant 12th for 37.611 points, while her long-time rival Simona
Amanar of Romania, Atlanta Olympics vault champion and all-around
runner-up in 1997, ranked 14th overall with 37.299.
</P>
<P>
Amanar, third overall before her lethal falling down from the
uneven bars, her last apparatus, slipt away the chance of winning
the title.
</P>
<P>
"Time has changed and the young are pushing the experienced who
are tired to resist the pressure, like Simona Amanar and Khorkina.
But the young are hungry for the medals and success," Bellu said.
</P>
<P>
"We deeply respect Simona and Khorkina, They will be in the
2000 Olympics, it is a great credit to them, " added Bellu.
</P>
<P>
Russian coach Marina Boulachenko agreed with legend Romanian
coach Bellu and said: "One defeat does not tell everything of
stars like Khorkina and Amanar. And I'm sure them are to come back
at the Sydney Olympic Games.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Tops List for Foreign Investment in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria received the highest
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflow in Africa in 1998,
recording 1.54 billion U. S. dollars out of a total inflow of 8.3
billion dollars on the continent.
</P>
<P>
A "World Investment Report 1999" issued here on Wednesday said
that Egypt was the second on the FDI chart in Africa, which
registered a significant increase in FDI inflow from about 840
million dollars in 1997 to 1.1 billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, which topped the FDI chart in 1997, suffered a
dramatic decline in FDI inflow from 1.5 billion dollars in 1997 to
350 million dollars, "The Post Express" newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Fuijap Njinga, director of the United Nations Information
Center in Nigeria, said that though Africa and the least developed
countries continue to attract FDI in absolute terms, the African
continent experienced a small increase in 1998.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey indicated that prospect for attracting FDI had
significantly improved for a number of African countries, notably
Botswana, South Africa, Nigeria, Uganda, Cote d'Ivoire,
Mozambique, Namibia and Tunisia, according to the UN official.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Africa is no longer limited to natural resources
extraction in attracting FDI, but is also increasingly found in
such sectors as telecommunications, food, tourism and textiles.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey report published by the United Nations
Conference in Trade and Development (UNCTAD), as for prospects of
creating a business-friendly environment, Botswana tops the list,
followed by South Africa, Nigeria, Uganda and Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that the most attractive industries for FDI
in the past three years (1996-98) included telecommunications,
food and beverages, tourism, mining, quarrying, textile and
leather.

<HEADLINE> Russian Spokesman: Moscow-NATO Ties Remain Frozen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Thursday that its
ties with NATO remain frozen and Moscow is not taking part in any
joint activities with NATO aside from the peacekeeping operations
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"The readiness of NATO to better take into account Russia's
interests and concerns regarding fundamental European and
international security issues may become a prerequisite for the
unfreezing of relations between Russia and NATO," Russian Foreign
Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministry's statement came in response to "recent
attempts by representatives of various NATO structures to increase
contacts with Russia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moscow's ties with NATO was frozen following the beginning of
NATO air raids on Yugoslavia on March 24. All contacts with NATO
have since been halted other than consultations on the
peacekeeping mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Russia has 3,600 troops in the Yugoslav province as part of 40,
000 multinational peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that another condition would be the
willingness of the alliance to strictly observe the understandings
in the framework of the Russia-NATO Founding Act.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has taken notice of the statement concerning the need
to improve NATO-Russia relations made by the alliance's new
Secretary General George Robertson shortly after his appointment,
Rakhmanin said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Concerned Over U.S. Refusal to Nuclear Test Ban </HEADLINE>

<P>
MOSCOW, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Thursday voiced
serious concern over the refusal by the U.S. Senate to ratify the
comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, saying it marked a
worrisome trend in U.S. activities recently.
</P>
<P>
Moscow is "disillusioned and seriously concerned" about the
Senate's decision, which "deals a serious blow to the whole system
of agreements in the field of nuclear disarmament and non-
proliferation, especially as far as the non-proliferation treaty
is concerned," Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
The Senate voted 51-48 Wednesday to throw out the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). More than 150 countries have
signed the deal but it cannot go into force unless all 44 nuclear-
capable states, including the United States, ratify it.
</P>
<P>
"What causes deep concern is the quite definite trend that can
be seen in U.S. activities of late," the Interfax news agency
quoted Rakhmanin as saying.
</P>
<P>
Along with its decision not to ratify the test ban treaty, the
U.S. has adopted a new law on ABM defense systems, issued new
threats about export controls and taken other steps that "
destabilize the foundations of international relations", the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it was the U.S. that took "the most active part"
in the preparation of the CTBT and was also the first country to
sign it, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman said, U.S. President Bill Clinton's
statement that Washington will keep to its moratorium on nuclear
tests, which is being observed by all five nuclear powers, did not
pass unnoticed by Moscow.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Moscow, sticking to the treaty, "regards it
as its duty to take into consideration the consequences of the (
Senate's) decision on the treaty for security and safety all over
the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Defense Ministry also blasted the Senate decision,
saying it set "a dangerous precedent with far-reaching
consequences."
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the decision "may cause an imbalance in the
entire system of control over the nonproliferation of nuclear arms
and nuclear technologies," Interfax reported.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Inflation Tumbles to 15-year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's consumer prices
continued to drop in September, pushing inflation to a 15-year
low, business newspaper The Saigon Times Daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to an official of the Vietnamese Government Office,
September consumer prices of the country dropped 0.6 percent from
the previous month, pulling down inflation in the first nine
months of the year to 0.2 percent compared to late last year, the
lowest in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Food and foodstuff prices tumbled 1 percent last month and 1.3
percent in the first nine months, thus affecting farmers'
consuming demand, he said, adding that consumer prices could pick
up less than 2 percent in the last three months.
</P>
<P>
According to the Vietnamese official, food production in the
first nine months grew more than 1.6 million tons over last year
to 22.7 million tons and aqua-product output soared 13 percent
over the year-earlier period to 1.4 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's industrial sector recorded a 10.2 percent growth over
the same period last year. However, industrial growth was slowing
down.
</P>
<P>
Its crude oil output increased by 2 million tons over a
year-ago period and reached 76 percent of the year's target, and
steel production grew 8.6 percent and reached 68 percent of the
year's target.
</P>
<P>
In the remaining period of the year, the Vietnamese government
would focus on seeking measures to fulfill major economic targets
set for the year and preparing an economic development plan for
the next year, said the official.

CANBERRA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Australian Environment
Minister Robert Hill criticized Thursday the U.S. senate decision
not to ratify the nuclear test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
"I think probably most Australians will be disappointed by that
even though it is the U.S. decision," Hill told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate Thursday morning blocked the ratification of
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty which is aimed at curbing the
spread of nuclear weapons by banning nuclear explosions in the
atmosphere, space or underground.
</P>
<P>
According to AAP, Australian Greenpeace nuclear campaigner Jean
McSorley described the U.S. decision as "reckless and
unforgivable."
</P>
<P>
"It's absolutely reckless and unforgivable that they should
hold hostage a treaty that the world is entitled to," he said,
adding that "It's one of the most shocking decisions ever seen by
the U.S. Senate."

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank Set for Coming of Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Central Bank
(PCB) has revealed its contingency plan to address the possible
year 2000 (Y2K) computer problem Philippine News Agency (PNA) said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for the maintenance of a six-month buffer stock
in its Cash department and in 18 regional centers outside Metro
Manila to provide banks with money in case of heavy withdrawals
during the contingency period.
</P>
<P>
The plan, which is under Monetary Board Resolution 1040 dated
July 23, will cover December till the first half of January 2000,
including all the Saturdays and holidays within this period, said
PCB managing director for accounting and information technology
department Teresita Hatta.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K problem affects older computers that cannot distinguish
between the years 1900 and 2000. It is feared that this will cause
computer systems to crash and wreak havoc on bank records.
</P>
<P>
In a briefing for bankers, business leaders and local
government officials on Wednesday, Hatta said the PCB would open
on all Saturdays of December except December 25. It will also be
open on New Year's Eve, New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
If computer facilities fail, financial reports transmitted
electronically to the PCB will be reported in diskette media with
a certified hard copy of the contents of the diskette.
</P>
<P>
For security, the PCB has established its Safety Information
Technology Chamber for Critical Hardware to protect magnetic media
containing valuable information.

<P>
TIANJIN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Mexican gymnast Aleman Manuel,
who had injured his neck during an exercise last Saturday, was
discharged from hospital on Thursday, said Jose Pilar Sanchez,
head of the Mexican delegation on Wednesdays.
</P>
<P>
After aborative treatment in the hospital, Manuel is likely to
resume regular training within two months.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican fell and lost consciousness during a floor exercise
warm-up Saturday afternoon at the on-going world championships
here. After courtside emergency treatment, he was rushed to
hospital in 15 minutes, according to championships' doctor-in-
chief Liu Keqiang.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez, who is also the president of the Mexican Gymnastics
Federation, paid his gratitude to Tianjin and "all the beautiful
people here".
</P>
<P>
"The emergency service was efficient and Manuel was lucky
having such a good treatment after the injury," Sanchez said. "He
had 24-hour service a day in the hospital."
</P>
<P>
The accident reminded of a similar one involving Chinese woman
teenager gymnast Sang Lan, who had her neck broken when she fell
head first during a vaulting warm-up at the Goodwill Games last
July in New York and was paralyzed since then.
</P>
<P>
Manuel, however, did not hurt his nerves in the spine.
</P>
<P>
Manuel was the most serious among the four injuries at the
championships here. Among others, Yong Chol Ri from South Korea
strained his right ankle during the men's vault competition. He
is expected to be fully recovered in six weeks.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Prince Hassan is
scheduled to visit Israel on Sunday to attend an international
conference marking the fifth anniversary of the signing of the
Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
The last-minute decision by Hassan, uncle of King Abdullah
Hussein, to visit Israel was aimed at reducing further
repercussions to the Jordanian-Israeli relations over the Hebron
incident, the Jerusalem Post newspaper quoted an Amman-based
diplomatic source as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hassan will deliver a key-note speech at the opening of the
two-day conference at Tel Aviv University, to be organized by the
Yitzhak Rabin Center of Israel Studies, to commemorate the
Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty inked in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's presence at the event had been thrown into doubt by
the chill in relations after Jewish settlers in the West Bank city
of Hebron heckled 20 Jordanian lawmakers, including Lower House
Speaker Abdu Hadi Majali on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government denounced the Hebron incident as a
provocative move of an anti-peace extremist mentality. On Monday,
it asked Israel to postpone a scheduled visit to Jordan by
Industry and Trade Minister Ran Cohen.

<HEADLINE> Grandi: Degree of Difficulty Can't Grow without Limit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Acrobatics or Artistry? Which
choice should gymnastics take for its future?
</P>
<P>
"We prefer the balance between them and will control the degree
of difficulty with new scoring rules," said Bruno Grandi,
president of the International Gymnastics Federation, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"We will take into account both the factor of execution and
degree of difficulty when we are developing the new rules for
judging," said the president who has brought gymnastics under
reform since he came into power in 1996.
</P>
<P>
There have been mixed reactions to the to-be-finalized new Code
of Points which de facto has encouraged the gymnasts to pursue
more difficult routines.
</P>
<P>
"Gymnastics has made some progress in terms of difficulty
degree, but the unbridled development in degree of difficulty can
not go too far,"said Grandi.
</P>
<P>
The president advised gymnasts not to rely on tricks to win
because they will be likely to miss both artistry and technique at
one time.
</P>
<P>
"Not everyone can perform difficult tricks and sometimes the
poorly performed routines will backfire and destroy the cleanness
and elegance."
</P>
<P>
He said that the FIG will control the development of the very
difficult tricks for it is "dangerous and will tarnish the image
of the gymnastics".
</P>
<P>
But this is not the only reason why he aims to put the degree
of difficulty under rein.
</P>
<P>
"The tricks may surprise you but it will not last long. While
the artistry can impress the spectators for quite a long time. So
to keep the vitality and vigor of gymnastics we need to be
artistic," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Like the landing on the moon it might create a sensation but
just lasts for some time. It is the same case with gymnastics
whose tricks may become commonplace as more and more gymnasts can
perform it."
</P>
<P>
"What makes gymnastics distinct from the other sports is their
artistic and cultural aspects." the official stressed.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the FIG will work out rules and
regulations for scoring and all gymnasts are expected to follow
suit.
</P>
<P>
"Now the problem is that the scoring rules have been led by the
abnormal development in the degree of difficulty. We should let
them meet the requirements of the rules and not the other way
around."
</P>
<P>
When asked if Svetlana Khorkina of Russia, who is famous more
for artistry than tricks, will be one of the models for the future
direction of gymnastics, the president said:"Why not?"

<HEADLINE> Profile: Tanzanian Founding Father Julius Nyerere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian founding father
Julius Kambarage Nyerere died of Leukaemia on Thursday morning at
St. Thomas Hospital in London, aged 77.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere was born on April 13, 1922, in Butiama Village, Mara,
Tanganyika, to the chief of a small Zanaki tribe. He began his
primary schooling in Musoma on Lake Victoria at the age of 12.
Then he went for education at Tabora Government Secondary School
and was offered a scholarship to study at Makerere University in
Uganda where he obtained a Teacher's Diploma.
</P>
<P>
A convert to Catholicism, he taught in several Catholic schools
before going to Edinburgh University, where he was the first
Tanganyikan to study at a British university. He graduated with an
M.B. in history and economics in 1952 and returned to Tanganyika
to teach. In 1953, he got married to Maria Maggie.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere developed a strong interest in politics shortly after
he returned to his country, particularly in the drive to push for
Tanganyika for independence from the colonial rule of Britain. In
1954 he founded the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU). He
became the chief minister of Tanganyika in 1960 and continued as
Prime Minister when Tanganyika became independent in 1961. A year
later when Tanganyika became a republic, he was elected President.
</P>
<P>
In 1964 Nyerere formed Tanzania, a union of Tanganyika and the
island of Zanzibar, with himself as the president. Committed to
African liberation, he offered sanctuary in Tanzania to freedom
fighters from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Angola and
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere was the founding member and Chairman of Chama Cha
Mapinduzi (CCM- Revolutionary Party), which was formed by a merger
of TANU and the Afro- Shiraz Party of Zanzibar in February of
1977.
</P>
<P>
He resigned voluntarily after serving four terms. In 1985, he
handed over power to a constitutionally chosen successor Ali
Hassan Mwinyi, but continued as head of the ruling party Chama Cha
Mapinduzi (CCM) until 1990.
</P>
<P>
As outlined in his political program of socialism and
self-reliance, the Arusha Declaration, which was proclaimed in
1967, Nyerere was committed to the creation in Tanzania of a
socialist society based on cooperative agriculture, known as
"ujamaa" campaign. He collectivized village farmlands, carried out
mass literacy campaigns, and instituted free and universal
education.
</P>
<P>
As a strong supporter of indigenous African culture, Nyerere
promoted the use of Kiswahili. Under his leadership, Tanzania
became the only country on the continent with a native African
official language. He also translated the works of Shakespeare
into Kiswahili.
</P>
<P>
During his tenure, Tanzania faced major economic hardships but
the country maintained an expanding educational system and a
strong sense of national unity.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere was widely credited with impressive oratorical skills
and a sense of humor, often causing laughter while addressing the
audience.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere was deeply loved by his people. During his last days,
people across the country, irrespective of their religions, were
praying for his recovery. "He is part of our country," a Tanzanian
observed.
</P>
<P>
Highly respected for his wisdom and integrity, Nyerere was
addressed throughout Africa as Mwalimu, or teacher in Kiswahili.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere also achieved international status as one of the
driving forces behind the founding of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
He served as the Chairman of the South Commission from 1987 to
1990, an independent international organization set up to review
development experience and make recommendations on development
strategy for the use of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He served as Honorary Chairman of the Geneva-based
Intergovernmental South Center, the successor organization of the
South Commission, which aims to promote South-South cooperation
and solidarity. Since 1996, Nyerere had been tirelessly brokering
peace for Burundi, which borders Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere held a string of honorary degrees from Duquesne
University of the United States, University of Nigeria, University
of Liberia, University of Zimbabwe, Fort Hare University of South
Africa, among others.
</P>
<P>
He was Chancellor of University of East Africa (1963-1970),
Chancellor of University of Dar es Salaam (1970-1985) and
Chancellor of Sokoine University of Agriculture (1984).
</P>
<P>
His publications include Freedom and Unity (1966), Freedom and
Socialism (1968), Freedom and Development (1973) and Ujamaa
(1968).

<P>
 -- Victorious in the legislative elections in Austria on
October 3 in which he became the head of the second largest party,

<P>
-- After the coup d'etat in Pakistan on Wednesday, the United

who is having his fingers on the nuclear button in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>

inheriting the global balance sheet of his father without
approving it totally. The new king once again attacked government

opposition leader living in exile in France since 1965 to return
home.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President to Play Soccer in Weekend Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni will play in a soccer match at the Mandela National
Stadium here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The match between the Cabinet XI and the Federation of Uganda
Football Association (FUFA) XI will serve as a curtain raiser for
an Olympic qualifier between Uganda U-23 Kobs and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The president used to be a sportsman and he loved to played
football in his secondary school years. Even when he was in
Entebbe, he played football with children, although he was now
forced to play much less due to his heavy official duties,
Presidential Press Secretary Hope Kivengere told Xinhua in a
telephone interview on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Museveni is said to captain the Cabinet side that takes on the
ex-internationals in the FUFA XI.
</P>
<P>
The president accepted an invitation for the match in order to
encourage Uganda soccer fraternity. He is a sportsman and wants
to prove that, Thursday's New Vision daily reported quoting FUFA
Secretary Godfrey Kisekka.
</P>
<P>
The invitation follows a challenge from the president that
local sports officials organize a match in which he would play
instead of being invited to the stadium as a spectator, the
newspaper reported.

<HEADLINE> 22nd ISO Congress to Be Held in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The 22nd Congress of the
International Standardization Organization (ISO) will be held in
Beijing during October 20-22, the State Bureau of Quality and
Technical Supervision (SBQTS) announced here today at a meeting
marking the 30th World Standards Day.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first ISO Congress held in Beijing since the
organization was founded 52 years ago. So far, about 360 delegates
from 92 countries and over 10 international organizations have
signed up to participate in the congress.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the coming congress will be the making of key
policies and long-term strategic plans, technical aid and
personnel training for developing countries, and international
cooperation. A symposium, Living Quality in the 21st Century,
will also be held during the congress.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yiming, SBQTS deputy director, said the Chinese government
attaches great importance to cooperation with international
standardization organizations. Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo
will be the honorary chairman of the congress, and SBQTS Director
Li Chuanqing will be the congress chairman.
</P>
<P>
China joined the ISO in 1978, and the law on standardization
was implemented in China ten years ago. Among the nearly 20,000
national standards, about 40 percent are international standards
and 22 percent are ISO standards.
</P>
<P>
This year's World Standards Day highlights the importance of
international standards in the construction sector. Construction
quality is also becoming a focus in Chinese society. To date,
China has issued nearly 300 national standards for construction
and over 450 national standards for construction materials.

<HEADLINE> India Rules out Any Change in Stand on CTBT Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- India Thursday ruled out any
change in its stand on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)
issue in the wake of the military take-over in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh told reporters, "There
is no need to consider any change on account of developments in
Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the rejection by the U.S. Senate would give some
elbow room to India in its negotiations with the U.S. on nuclear
non-proliferation issues, he said that India was engaged in a
dialogue with several countries including the U.S. to apprise them
of India's security concerns.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that India remained committed to the voluntary
moratorium on further nuclear testing announced by the government
soon after the Pokhran nuclear tests in May last year.
</P>
<P>
"India will not stand in the way of entry of force of the
CTBT," he said, adding "It is our expectation that other nations
would also act accordingly."
</P>
<P>
He said that India's stand on the CTBT had been outlined by
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee at the U.N. General Assembly
session last year Categorically and unambiguously. It remains
unaltered.
</P>
<P>
Senior foreign office officials said that the U.S. Senate's
decision against the ratification of the CTBT would give more time
to the new government to build the widest-possible consensus on
the question of signing it.

<P>
Reports said Sharif was shifted to Rawalpindi on Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Sharif sacked Army Chief General Pervaiz Musharraf on Tuesday
afternoon and appointed Lt. General Ziauddin as the new army
chief, prompting the dismissal of the government.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the announcement of the new army chief, army
personnel took over the state-run Pakistan Television, Radio
Pakistan and other key installations and airports throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
In his short address to the nation, General Musharraf blamed
Sharif for politicizing the army and creating dissent in its
ranks. Confusion still marks the army takeover as Musharraf
detailed no definite plan about the future government set-up.
</P>
<P>
Sharif has been arrested for the first time since he entered
politics in 1981. His first government was ousted through a
presidential order.

<HEADLINE> UAE Papers Urge Pakistan to Restore Civilian Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Newspapers published in the
United Arab Emirates Thursday urged Pakistani military leaders
that took over power through a coup on Tuesday to restore civilian
rule in the country to ensure stability.
</P>
<P>
"The army's action is not an event for rejoicing or one that
will help Pakistan," the English-language daily Khaleej Times
commented on Pakistani Army Chief General Pervaiz Musharraf's
dismissal of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government.
</P>
<P>
"Friends of Pakistan can only hope that the period of military
rule will be brief and a new elected civilian dispensation will
take office sooner, rather than later," the paper added.
</P>
<P>
Another English daily, the Gulf News, also called for the
restoration of democracy in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible that General Musharraf can muster public
support for the removal of Mr. Sharif, but a country still
working to assimilate democracy must find the answers to its
problems from within democracy," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It expressed concern that Pakistan's economic situation could
be worsened by the coup, citing the U.S. sanctions which already
exist, the country's heavy borrowing and the possible losing of
aid from international organizations.
</P>
<P>
"A stable Pakistan is crucial to the region. If the already
precarious economic situation is worsened by international
censure, the coup could have achieved nothing," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The best way would be to move quickly to restore democracy,
added the paper. It warned the coup leaders not to try to manage
the country themselves, or they "will find they have bitten off
more than they can chew."

<HEADLINE> China Scores Breakthrough in Study of Mammal Origin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China has achieved a
breakthrough in the study of the origin of mammals with the
discovery of a large number of fossilized mammal bones dating back
some 100 million years in northeastern China's Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
The fossils, including teeth, jawbones, vertebra and limbs,
belonged to a kind of small animal living in the Mesozoic Period,
said Zhang Pulin, who discovered these fossils along a 80-meter-
long and 50-meter-wide stratum in summer.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that it is quite rare to find mammal bones of the
Mesozoic Period, when the dinosaur dominated the world.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, the discovery will provide valuable
materials for the study of mammal origins, which will be the
hottest topic among the world's archeological in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Similar Mesozoic fossils have also been discovered in the
western region of Liaoning Province, also in northeastern China,
where Sinornithosaurus, believed to be the ancestor of birds, were
unearthed. But local archeologists believe these belonged to a
different family.

<HEADLINE> Industrialization Way Forward For China's Rural Economy: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China should upgrade its rural
economy by promoting the industrialization of agriculture,
according to a senior Chinese official.
</P>
<P>
"The industrialization of agriculture must be the way forward
for China's rural economy," said Song Jian, vice-chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, China's highest advisory body.
</P>
<P>
Song, also president of the Chinese Academy of Engineering,
made the remarks at the ongoing International Symposium and
Exhibition on Fruit and Vegetable Processing Technology and
Industrialization, sponsored by the Economic and Social Commission
for Asia and the Pacific of the United Nations and several other
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Great changes have taken place in rural China as a result of
the reform and opening-up drive, Song said, but the country has
just begun efforts to industrialize and modernize agriculture.
</P>
<P>
China's rural economy has been facing a series of problems,
including inadequate intensive production and mechanized
operations, according to Song.
</P>
<P>
For instance, Song said, China grows hundreds of millions of
tons of vegetables and 9.5 million tons of fruit annually, but
these huge harvests are mainly brought about by traditional
methods which are technically backward and consume too many
resources.
</P>
<P>
Song said one of the major tasks facing Chinese science and
technology in the coming century is the all-out promotion of
agricultural industrialization.
</P>
<P>
Greater efforts will be taken to develop high-tech farm produce
and processing machinery in a bid to accelerate this process and
increase the value of agricultural products, Song said.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing symposium and exhibition will have a positive
effect on the modernization of China's rural economy, Song said.

<HEADLINE> Patriotic Song Warmly Greeted in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The song entitled "Five Star
National Flag" presented during the evening gala celebrating the
50th anniversary of the founding of New China was warmly received
by the Chinese and caused a great stir nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The patriotic song, composed specially for the 50th anniversary,
has been turned into a MTV program featuring a variety of flag-
raising scenes, by the Beijing Television Station.
</P>
<P>
Although the song has a political theme, it has gained great
popularity among the Chinese because of its beautiful melody,
inspiring lyrics, and the patriotism the five star national flag
stands for in the hearts of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The five star national flag represents the past tribulations of
the Chinese people, their pleasure in victory, and their great
expectations for the future, according to the song's composer,
Tian Ming.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the song will bring everyone together, by inspiring
patriotism and idea of national cohesion," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yongfeng, a renowned Chinese mountain climber, said he
felt his heart quake when he heard the song. "The song is so
inspiring to me because the five star national flag is a sacred
symbol to every alpinist," he said. "During the final sprint
toward the summit, a climber may abandon camera, food, clothing,
and even oxygen, but the flag is something indispensable and we
must plant it on the summit we have conquered."

<HEADLINE> Ten Chinese Women Farmers Awarded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- They have different lives.
They are master cultivators of grapes, flowers, fruit trees and
red peppers, and shepherdess and entrepreneurs. But all of them
are successful women farmers whom many men would envy.
</P>
<P>
Today, ten Chinese women farmers received awards from the All-
China Women's Federation for their remarkable achievements over
the past several decades.
</P>
<P>
The federation inaugurated a competition ten years ago among
Chinese women farmers, aiming to improve their education and
mobilize them to become devoted to agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the competition, more than 20 million illiterate
women received education and nearly 100 million of them were
trained in agricultural technology.
</P>
<P>
Among the ten award-winning women farmers today was Cheng
Xianxin from the eastern suburbs of Beijing. She not only
cultivates delicious grapes, but has also spread her techniques to
more than other 10,000 farmers.
</P>
<P>
Ji Xihua, a farmer in east China's Jiangsu Province,
established China's largest production base for azalea flowers,
and her flowers are sold to more than 150 cities across China.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> IP System Supports Knowledge-based Economy: Chinese  Official (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The intellectual property
system plays an important role in supporting the development of
the knowledge-based economy, China's top IP official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
"The development of the knowledge-based economy can't live
without the IP system," Jiang Ying, director of the State
Intellectual Property Office (SIPO), said at the ongoing
International Symposium on Intellectual Property and Knowledge-
based Economy organized by the World Intellectual Property
Organization (WIPO) and the SIPO.
</P>
<P>
"The IP system is an important legal system encouraging the
creation, dissemination and application of knowledge based on the
acknowledgment that knowledge is an asset and needs protection,"
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"To develop the knowledge-based economy requires not only
attaching importance to the creation, transfer and application of
knowledge, but also paying more attention to protection," she said.
</P>
<P>
"When trade barriers such as tariffs are canceled in the next
century, the competition of comprehensive national strength will
focus on knowledge," the director said.
</P>
<P>
Facing the challenges of the new century, many nations have
devised IP protection strategies, accelerated the enactment of IP
laws, and stiffened the enforcement of IP protection to take full
advantage of the IP system for maintaining their favorable status
in the world, she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Modern society has established the IP system to protect and
encourage people's creativity, and China also has been increasing
safeguards for IP rights in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
In the 14 years since the promulgation of the Chinese Patent
Law, patent applications in China have increased dramatically
every year.
</P>
<P>
The total number of domestic patent applications in 1998
reached 96,223, compared to 9,411 in 1985.
</P>
<P>
By the end of August this year, total domestic patent
applications received by the country's patent offices totaled 794,
457.
</P>
<P>
"Under the IP system, most technology inventions are disclosed
to the general public through documentation," Jiang said. "Under
the market economy, the IP system has an important role in
assuring the reasonable distribution of knowledge-production
resources."
</P>
<P>
The World Trade Organization (WTO) has devised an agreement to
urge all countries to obey certain regulations relating to IP in
the development of world trade.
</P>
<P>
New IP-related areas resulting from the development of
biotechnology, gene engineering, computer software and others,
symbolize a new phase of IP advancement, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
She called on countries throughout the world to enhance
exchange and cooperation in this regard to bring the IP system
into full play along with the development of the knowledge-based
economy.

<HEADLINE> China Slams U.S. Over Religious Criticism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China's religious officials
today expressed strong indignation and opposition to the United
States' accusations of religious intolerance.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department recently issued its "Annual Report
on International Religious Freedom for 1999," which irresponsibly
comments on religious affairs in many countries, including China,
and lists China as a country for "special concern" and threatens
China with sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"We are strongly indignant at and resolutely opposed to such
unfounded and unreasonable accusations," said the spokesman for
the Religious Bureau of China's State Council.
</P>
<P>
The China section of the report is "nothing new, but rumors,
distortion, fabrication and imagination with some brand-new
packaging, plus some threats," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In China, freedom of religious belief is a fundamental right
guaranteed to all citizens by the Constitution and by law.
</P>
<P>
"It is well-known that there is no problem of 'religious
persecution,' and facts can never be distorted," the spokesman
noted.
</P>
<P>
Instead of being concerned about its many domestic problems,
including religion, the U.S. government is keen on making
slanderous accusations against China's religious affairs and even
threatens to impose so-call sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"This is in essence a wanton interference in China's internal
affairs under the pretext of religious freedom. The Chinese
government and people will never accept this," the spokesman
stressed.
</P>
<P>
" The U.S. government must stop immediately interfering in
China's internal affairs under the pretext of religion," the
spokesman said.

<P>
LONDON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- UK's Conservative leader William Hague declares on Thursday
that he will not flinch from his controversial new policy on
Europe and tells Tory and Labor opponents that they can "shout and
scream all they like".
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Gordon Brown, the chancellor of exchequer of Britain, on
Wednesday urged employers to put the brakes on pay, as a sharp
jump in average earnings added to pressure for further rises in
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- A radical blueprint of a more powerful European Union, in
which Britain would lose its veto over tax policy and be bound by
a joint constitution, is to be published next week by Romano Prodi,
the new president of the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- British Prime Minister Tony Blair has deepened Tory splits
over Europe with a stark warning that William Hague's hardline
policy would wreck the British economy.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States on Wednesday threw out a major
international non-proliferation agreement, effectively destroying
the comprehensive test ban treaty and possibly opening the way to
a new nuclear arms race.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Clarifies on Political System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has written to the government's New Vision daily, saying
that the decision on whether to bring back the multiparty system
or not rests with the electorate.
</P>
<P>
The president made the clarification after a visiting British
minister said here Tuesday that Museveni had promised to bring
back multiparties by the year 2007, Radio Uganda reported Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Multi-partyism is unsuitable to Uganda because of the
fratricidal conflicts caused by sectarian parties in the past, the
president explained in the letter dated October 13, emphasizing
that the sovereign power to bring back multi-partyism in Uganda or
not lies in the hands of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM)
would recommend the electorate to maintain the Movement system in
next year's referendum. However, the final decision rests with the
electorate themselves, he said.
</P>
<P>
As there are still opportunistic and sectarian forces, the NRM
leadership would recommend the continued rejection of
multi-partyism for the referendum slated for June next year,
Museveni said.
</P>
<P>
"We may change that recommendation in the coming decade as the
 sectarian forces fade more and more," he said at the end of the
letter.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution promulgated in 1995, a referendum would
be held in five years to decide on the country's political system.
As the date for the next referendum approaches, more and more
opposition can be heard from other political forces in the
country.
</P>
<P>
 The NRM proclaims itself not a political party and therefore
bans all the other parties from organizing official activities,
assemblies and demonstrations.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Assists China's Power Sector Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development

<HEADLINE> Israeli Move to Try Settler Harassing Jordanian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Jordan welcomed the Israeli move
to prosecute a hard-line Jewish settler who harassed members of a
Jordanian parliamentary delegation during its visit to the West
Bank city of Hebron last weekend.
</P>
<P>
"This is a step in the right direction and we hope that the
tension which emanated from that incident will fade," the
semi-official Jordan Times quoted an unnamed official as saying
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police issued an arrest warrant Wednesday against an
extremist Jewish settler accused of involvement in attacking and
heckling Jordanian parliament members outside the Ibrahim Mosque
in the Israeli-controlled part of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The suspect, identified as Baruch Marzel, is a former member of
the outlawed anti-Arab group Kach, who lives in a Jewish enclave
in the heart of Hebron, reports from Israel said.
</P>
<P>
The 20-member delegation headed by Lower House Speaker Abdu
Hadi Majali had planned to pray at the mosque last Saturday
before they were forced to receive security checks by Israeli
soldiers and then harassed by some 15 Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
Amman has lodged a formal and strong protest to the Israeli
government over the incident, saying it not only violated the
spirit of peace, but also ran against diplomatic conventions.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government also postponed indefinitely a visit
to Amman scheduled for Wednesday by Israeli Industry and Trade
Minister Ran Cohen, and demanded an investigation into the
incident.
</P>
<P>
Israel regretted the incident but fell short of officially
apologizing.
</P>
<P>
The Hebron incident was one of the few unhappy episodes between
the two countries after they signed a peace treaty in 1994. For
years Jordan has been actively promoting the peace process between
Israel and its Arab neighbors.

<HEADLINE> China's Listed Township Enterprises Report Higher Profits than Nation's Average (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Interim reports of the 29
township enterprises listed on China's Shanghai and Shenzhen stock
exchanges indicate that their profits for the first six months of
the year outgrew the average for all domestic listed companies.
</P>
<P>
From January to June this year, these township enterprises
gained an income of 12.7 billion yuan from their main business
operations, up 51.9 percent from the same period last year, and 39.
43 percent higher than the national average for all listed
companies.
</P>
<P>
Their net profits hit 1.612 billion yuan, up 22.49 percent, and
17.65 percentage points higher than the average.
</P>
<P>
The reports also show that the listed township enterprises
further increased their money-making ability. In the first half
year, the average profits of these enterprises reached 55.5
million yuan, with the average ratio of assets and liabilities
standing at 38 percent. Six of them also have surpassed ten
percent in net-asset-return ratio.
</P>
<P>
To date, nearly 40 township enterprises have been listed
domestically since 1993 when the first township enterprise,
Guangdong Yuemeidi Electric Appliance A shares, was listed in
Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
And some township enterprises has began to offer on overseas
stock exchanges. For example, the Guangdong Kelong Electric
Appliance has been listed in Hong Kong, and a porcelain company in
Guangdong Province is soon to be listed in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Township Enterprise Bureau under the
Ministry of Agriculture said that the listed township enterprises,
which lead in assets and profits in their respective domestic
sectors, are playing an exemplary role for other township
enterprises nationwide in their reform and development.

<HEADLINE> China's Listed Township Enterprises Report Higher Profits than Nation's Average (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
But despite their superb economic performance, township
enterprises still face many obstacles in their attempts to become
listed, and the total number of listed township enterprises
account for only about 4 percent on the domestic stock market.
</P>
<P>
"This is not conducive to township enterprises reform, nor to
their competition with state-owned enterprises on an equal footing,
" he said, noting that such a small percentage of listed
enterprises does not jibe with the status of township enterprises
in the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 50 years, and especially since late 1970s,
township enterprises have witnessed remarkable development and now
constitute the main part of the rural economy, representing almost
half of the country's industrial sector and a pillar of the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
The National Bureau of Statistics indicates that in 1998,
rural businesses realized an added output value of 2.2186 trillion
yuan, making up 27.9 percent of the nation's gross domestic
product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
At the same time, these businesses contributed one-fifth of
all national tax revenues and 34.8 percent of the country's total
exports.
</P>
<P>
China's township enterprises have maintained a momentum of
steady growth so far this year. From January to August, they
reported a total output value added of 1.6213 trillion yuan, up 16.
8 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
 The official called for more attention to be paid to the
importance of listing township enterprises and more support in
this regard.

<HEADLINE> China Needs to Improve Freshness-Preservation Technology: Russian Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China needs to strengthen the
development and application of fruit and vegetable freshness-
preservation technology to ensure product quality and sharpen the
competitive edge in the global market, a renowned Russian
horticulture expert said today.
</P>
<P>
"Fresh-keeping facilities are essential to ensure that fruit
and vegetables retain their taste. This is the main appeal for
global customers," said Gudkovskl Vladimir Alexandrovich, director
of the I.V.Michurin All-Russian Research Institute of Horticulture,
one of the world's leading academic institution on horticulture
development.
</P>
<P>
The professor was airing his view at a workshop on agriculture
technology and know-how in Yantai, a port city in east China's
Shandong Province. The seminar was part of the International
Symposium and Exhibition on Fruit and Vegetable Processing
Technology and Industrialization, the first ever held in China,
which is runs through October 16.
</P>
<P>
The lack of advanced technology for keeping fruit and
vegetables fresh has long plagued the growth of the fruit and
vegetable processing industry in many developing countries in Asia,
including China, and has ruined 50 to 60 percent of their harvest
every year, he said.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the world's largest fruit and vegetable
producers, with an annual production of hundreds of millions of
tons, but much of this is ruined every year due to poor fresh-
keeping facilities and technology.
</P>
<P>
The professor said that Russian research institutions and high-
tech enterprises are willing to come to China's aid with advanced
technology and facilities, and that exchange and cooperation in
this regard between the two countries is encouraged.
</P>
<P>
Russia has developed freshness preservation and storing
technology for a variety of fruits. For example, it boasts a newly
developed storehouse equipped with advanced air-conditioning and
control systems which sharply reduce the amount of oxygen. Under
these conditions, apples can retain their look, taste, and
freshness up to 10 months after they are picked.
</P>
<P>
"I hope there will be more channels for technology talent of
both countries to cooperate in order to contribute to the
development of more advanced agricultural know-how," he said.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Farmers Assured of Fertilizer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Zambian government has assured
farmers of enough fertilizer in time.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, Food and Fisheries Minister Suresh Desai said here
on Wednesday that while Nitrogen Chemicals of Zambia (NCZ) has
been given a task of producing 20,000 tons of fertilizer, the
private sector will supply 130,000 tons of fertilizer, Zambia
Daily Mail reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The country's annual fertilizer consumption averages 150,000
tons.
</P>
<P>
He said the farmers in the country will experience no shortage
of fertilizer this year since there are proper arrangements
between the government and the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Last year delayed fertilizer affected the country's
agricultural production. The failure by farmers to repay the
fertilizer loans caused the delay.
</P>
<P>
Desai also said the country has enough maize, staple food for
Zambians, to last up to the next crop harvest next year.
</P>
<P>
He said the reported shortage of mealie meal in some parts of
the country may be due to operational problems experienced by
millers and not the maize shortages.

<HEADLINE> China Scores Breakthrough in Study of Mammal Origin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China has achieved a
breakthrough in the study of the origin of mammals with the
discovery of a large number of fossilized mammal bones dating back
some 100 million years in northeastern China's Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
The fossils, including teeth, jawbones, vertebra and limbs,
belonged to a kind of small animal living in the Mesozoic Period,
said Zhang Pulin, who discovered these fossils along a 80-meter-
long and 50-meter-wide stratum in summer.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that it is quite rare to find mammal bones of the
Mesozoic Period, when the dinosaur dominated the world.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, the discovery will provide valuable
materials for the study of mammal origins, which will be the
hottest topic among the world's archeological in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Similar Mesozoic fossils have also been discovered in the
western region of Liaoning Province, also in northeastern China,
where Sinornithosaurus, believed to be the ancestor of birds, were
unearthed. But local archeologists believe these belonged to a
different family.

WASHINGTON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Wilt Chamberlain died of
heart failure, the great basketballer's agent Sy Goldberg said
Wednesday in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
"He had congestive heart failure," Goldberg said the day after
Chamberlain died at age 63. "He had deteriorated relatively
quickly over the last month or so."
</P>
<P>
Michele Hamilton, associate clinical professor of cardiology at
UCLA, said: "Most likely, with a man of his age group dying
suddenly, it would be from blockage in the blood vessels, causing
an irregular heartbeat, regardless of his past medical history."
</P>
<P>
Funeral services for Chamberlain are scheduled for Saturday.
Chamberlain's sister, Barbara Lewis, said her brother had
undergone dental surgery last week and looked worse than she had
ever seen him.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Makes High Debut at Gymnastics World Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Mexico is looking forward to a
historic bronze medal after they vaulted to a flying start in the
women's horse vault qualifying competition of the world gymnastics
championships here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mexican Denisse Lopez entered the finals after finishing third
in the qualifiers and became the first world championships
finalist in the nation's 72-year history in the sport.
</P>
<P>
The surprising delight came when the country fielded both men's
and women's teams for world championships for the first time in
the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
It was a great encouragement to Sanchez, president of the
Mexico Gymnastics Federation who took the post two months ago.
</P>
<P>
"I were just elected two months ago, and I think it is really
hard to come here, so we make analysis of the situation and got
the best gymnasts of the country," said Sanchez. "We also got
support from the sponsors, so we have the responsibility to work
hard."
</P>
<P>
"Before the games we had a target of one qualifier for the 2000
Sydney Olympics, now we did that," said Sanchez. "It means a lot
for us. The government is going to put more attention into our
program."
</P>
<P>
"It was really a good news for the Mexicans, for the team are
still young and inexperienced," Sanchez said of his country whose
gymnastics program started from scratch 72 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"If she can win a medal, even a bronze medal, Mexico will have
a fiesta, a bigger party," Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
But Rome is not built overnight as the country has geared up
for international glory although it remains a big challenge for
them to get further.
</P>
<P>
"In the past there were no gymnastics programs in public
schools but in the past three years the government have started to
put in the programs. For us gymnastics is everything, it is the
basics of the sports."
</P>
<P>
They also have foreign coaches to get the gymnastics wilderness
updated with the development of the sport and produced good local
coaches which have been a far cry for them.
</P>
<P>
"Russian coaches came to give us advice and classes, Cuban
coaches stayed for one year through the interchange program, and
we have 35 Bulgarian coaches all over the country," said the
president.
</P>
<P>
After seeing China ended up with the men's team gold and women'
s team bronze, Sanchez has turned his eyes on the Chinese coaches.
</P>
<P>
"I will start talking with the Chinese coaches, and tomorrow I
will go to the Mexican Embassy in Beijing and talk with the
ambassador about this. I know between China and Mexico we have
interchange program," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez was also aware of the problem that gymnastics is still
an amateur sport in his country.
</P>
<P>
"We maybe not good at basketball or wrestling, but our
constitution is good enough to play soccer, cycling and gymnastics.
And they are also talented.
</P>
<P>
"But they need time to work. It is hard for most of them are
University students. They can only spend five or six hours a day.
</P>
<P>
"Our federation has talked with the parents and principles of
universities and tried to persuade them to allow time for the
gymnasts. So in a sense parents and head of the universities are
also part of the team for the championships. We cannot do without
their support," said Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
But the ambitious president expressed his full confidence to
have a strong team in the future.
</P>
<P>
"I think in the next Olympic cycle we will be more motivated,
more experienced with more international competition."
</P>
<P>
A philosophy is the thing that stands behind him.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing impossible in this world and the only thing
that have no solution is death," he added.

<HEADLINE> Industrialization Way Forward For China's Rural Economy: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China should upgrade its rural
economy by promoting the industrialization of agriculture,
according to a senior Chinese official.
</P>
<P>
"The industrialization of agriculture must be the way forward
for China's rural economy," said Song Jian, vice-chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, China's highest advisory body.
</P>
<P>
Song, also president of the Chinese Academy of Engineering,
made the remarks at the ongoing International Symposium and
Exhibition on Fruit and Vegetable Processing Technology and
Industrialization, sponsored by the Economic and Social Commission
for Asia and the Pacific of the United Nations and several other
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Great changes have taken place in rural China as a result of
the reform and opening-up drive, Song said, but the country has
just begun efforts to industrialize and modernize agriculture.
</P>
<P>
China's rural economy has been facing a series of problems,
including inadequate intensive production and mechanized
operations, according to Song.
</P>
<P>
For instance, Song said, China grows hundreds of millions of
tons of vegetables and 9.5 million tons of fruit annually, but
these huge harvests are mainly brought about by traditional
methods which are technically backward and consume too many
resources.
</P>
<P>
Song said one of the major tasks facing Chinese science and
technology in the coming century is the all-out promotion of
agricultural industrialization.
</P>
<P>
Greater efforts will be taken to develop high-tech farm produce
and processing machinery in a bid to accelerate this process and
increase the value of agricultural products, Song said.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing symposium and exhibition will have a positive
effect on the modernization of China's rural economy, Song said.

<HEADLINE> Ten Chinese Women Farmers Awarded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- They have different lives.
They are master cultivators of grapes, flowers, fruit trees and
red peppers, and shepherdess and entrepreneurs. But all of them
are successful women farmers whom many men would envy.
</P>
<P>
Today, ten Chinese women farmers received awards from the All-

<HEADLINE> IP System Supports Knowledge-based Economy: Chinese  Official (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The intellectual property
system plays an important role in supporting the development of
the knowledge-based economy, China's top IP official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
"The development of the knowledge-based economy can't live
without the IP system," Jiang Ying, director of the State
Intellectual Property Office (SIPO), said at the ongoing
International Symposium on Intellectual Property and Knowledge-
based Economy organized by the World Intellectual Property
Organization (WIPO) and the SIPO.
</P>
<P>
"The IP system is an important legal system encouraging the
creation, dissemination and application of knowledge based on the
acknowledgment that knowledge is an asset and needs protection,"
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"To develop the knowledge-based economy requires not only
attaching importance to the creation, transfer and application of
knowledge, but also paying more attention to protection," she said.
</P>
<P>
"When trade barriers such as tariffs are canceled in the next
century, the competition of comprehensive national strength will
focus on knowledge," the director said.
</P>
<P>
Facing the challenges of the new century, many nations have
devised IP protection strategies, accelerated the enactment of IP
laws, and stiffened the enforcement of IP protection to take full
advantage of the IP system for maintaining their favorable status
in the world, she said.

</P>
<P>
"Before the games we had a target of one qualifier for the 2000
Sydney Olympics, now we did that," said Sanchez. "It means a lot
for us. The government is going to put more attention into our
program."
</P>
<P>
"It was really a good news for the Mexicans, for the team are
still young and inexperienced," Sanchez said of his country whose
gymnastics program started from scratch 72 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"If she can win a medal, even a bronze medal, Mexico will have
a fiesta, a bigger party," Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
But Rome is not built overnight as the country has geared up
for international glory although it remains a big challenge for
them to get further.
</P>
<P>
"In the past there were no gymnastics programs in public
schools but in the past three years the government have started to
put in the programs. For us gymnastics is everything, it is the
basics of the sports."
</P>
<P>
They also have foreign coaches to get the gymnastics wilderness
updated with the development of the sport and produced good local
coaches which have been a far cry for them.
</P>
<P>
"Russian coaches came to give us advice and classes, Cuban
coaches stayed for one year through the interchange program, and
we have 35 Bulgarian coaches all over the country," said the
president.
</P>
<P>
After seeing China ended up with the men's team gold and women'
s team bronze, Sanchez has turned his eyes on the Chinese coaches.
</P>
<P>
"I will start talking with the Chinese coaches, and tomorrow I
will go to the Mexican Embassy in Beijing and talk with the
ambassador about this. I know between China and Mexico we have
interchange program," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez was also aware of the problem that gymnastics is still
an amateur sport in his country.
</P>
<P>
"We maybe not good at basketball or wrestling, but our
constitution is good enough to play soccer, cycling and gymnastics.
And they are also talented.
</P>
<P>
"But they need time to work. It is hard for most of them are
University students. They can only spend five or six hours a day.
</P>
<P>
"Our federation has talked with the parents and principles of
universities and tried to persuade them to allow time for the
gymnasts. So in a sense parents and head of the universities are
also part of the team for the championships. We cannot do without
their support," said Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
But the ambitious president expressed his full confidence to
have a strong team in the future.
</P>
<P>
"I think in the next Olympic cycle we will be more motivated,
more experienced with more international competition."
</P>
<P>
A philosophy is the thing that stands behind him.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing impossible in this world and the only thing
that have no solution is death," he added.

<HEADLINE> IP System Supports Knowledge-based Economy: Chinese Official (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Modern society has established the IP system to protect and
encourage people's creativity, and China also has been increasing
safeguards for IP rights in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
In the 14 years since the promulgation of the Chinese Patent
Law, patent applications in China have increased dramatically
every year.
</P>
<P>
The total number of domestic patent applications in 1998
reached 96,223, compared to 9,411 in 1985.
</P>
<P>
By the end of August this year, total domestic patent
applications received by the country's patent offices totaled 794,
457.
</P>
<P>
"Under the IP system, most technology inventions are disclosed
to the general public through documentation," Jiang said. "Under
the market economy, the IP system has an important role in
assuring the reasonable distribution of knowledge-production
resources."
</P>
<P>
The World Trade Organization (WTO) has devised an agreement to
urge all countries to obey certain regulations relating to IP in
the development of world trade.
</P>
<P>
New IP-related areas resulting from the development of
biotechnology, gene engineering, computer software and others,
symbolize a new phase of IP advancement, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
She called on countries throughout the world to enhance
exchange and cooperation in this regard to bring the IP system
into full play along with the development of the knowledge-based
economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's informal sector has
created more jobs in the east African country, which now account
for two-thirds of all job opportunities, a senior Kenyan official
has said.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard Thursday quoted Human Resources
Minister Kipkalya Kones as saying that 3.4 million people among a
labor force of 5.1 million worked in the informal sector.
</P>
<P>
"This accounts for a contribution of about 20 percent to gross
domestic product per annum," he said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, 366,600 new jobs out of 384,000 were in the informal
sector, representing 95 percent of the total jobs created that
year, Kones added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government was examining its policies on trade
policies,

<P>
foreign exchange management, wages and investment polices to
encourage the growth of the sector.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Closes Down Illegal Pharmacies Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
ordered all illegal pharmacies operators in the country to
immediately close their business.
</P>
<P>
If the dealers were not dealt with, the situation would be out
of control and the country would record a number of deaths, Health
Minister Nkandu Luo was quoted by Thursday's Times of Zambia
newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has been documented as the largest consumer of drugs and
yet there are press reports almost everyday on the shortage of
drugs in the country, Luo said while launching the medicines and
health public education campaign with the theme "Medicines and
Your Health" in Lusaka on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The reason is that the hospitals are sharing drugs with
unauthorized dealers who purchase them illegally, she said.
</P>
<P>
Luo warned of the danger of buying drugs from illegal dealers,
saying most of them sell expired medicines and don't give proper
guidance.
</P>
<P>
There is need to sensitize the public on where to get drugs
with proper guidance and instructions, she added.
</P>
<P>
At the same function, Chairman of Pharmacy and Poisons Board
Caeser Mudondo said the board has been making efforts to reduce
unauthorized dealings.
</P>
<P>
He said the board had resorted to regular inspection and
subsequent prosecutions and closures of unauthorized medicine
outlets to crack down on the illegal pharmacies operations.
</P>
<P>
It would be criminal for health practitioners to allow
unauthorized and unqualified vendors to continue selling drugs, he
said, adding that those found trading without licences would be
prosecuted.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Chinese Scholar Commemorated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, October 13 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 Chinese and
foreign scholars gathered in this capital of southwest China's
Guizhou Province today to discuss the important role an ancient
Chinese thinker may have in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
At an international seminar that opened here today, scholars
from the United States, Japan, Russia, China and the regions of
Taiwan and Hong Kong will exchange views on the study of Wang
Shouren, widely known as Wang Yangming, a famous thinker,
philosopher and educator of the Ming Dynasty ((1368-1644).
</P>
<P>
Tour to the ruins of the home of this ancient scholar has also
been arranged along with trade and investment promotion activities.
</P>
<P>
Wang was banished to Guizhou from the then capital city of
Nanjing, where he served as a senior official, for displeasing an
influential eunuch by speaking out from a sense of justice. While
staying in Guizhou, he trained many people by giving lectures
everywhere and cultivated a unique philosophical system.
</P>
<P>
His idea of stressing the unity of individual, society, nature
and heavenly laws can be equated to Western cultural values such
as equality and liberty, and his thinking has held an important
position not only in China for hundreds of years, but has also
influenced people in Japan and Korea, said one participant.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Rules out Possibility of Being Dismantled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's leading anti-Israeli
military group Hezbollah has ruled out the possibility of being
dismantled after a peace settlement is reached with Israel, the
Daily Star newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Hezbollah will remain after any settlement and those who
think the group's survival is threatened by the possibility of a
peace settlement are misled," Hezbollah's deputy secretary
general, Naim Qassem, said during a televised interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He added that although Hezbollah's circumstances and
performance may weaken or strengthen, it would always remain a
viable organization.
</P>
<P>
Qassem's remarks came after Israeli officials, especially Prime
Minister Ehud Barak, repeated the pledge to withdraw Israeli
troops from south Lebanon by July next year.
</P>
<P>
Israel has occupied parts of Lebanon since 1978 and set up a
self-styled security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with the
claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese guerrillas'
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, which was
created in 1982 after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, is leading
a guerrilla war trying to oust Israelis from country.
</P>
<P>
"Hezbollah has lined up several options should Israel withdraw
from south Lebanon, but it was not ready to divulge them yet,"
Qassem said.
</P>
<P>
He added that war strategies required tricking the enemy while
concealing one's ideas and plans for the future.

<P>
DHAKA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- India's Border Security Force
(BSF) has attempted to push a total of 957 people into Bangladesh
over the last 20 months, The Daily Star newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
All the push-in efforts were resisted by the country's border
force -- the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) -- and residents of the

officials were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The push-in incidents occurred in the border areas mainly in
southwestern, western, northwestern and eastern Bangladesh,

The BDR and the people in the border areas foiled attempts of
the BSF last Saturday to push a number of people into Nilphamari
district, 306 kilometers northwest of Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has strongly protested against the recent BSF
attempts to push in the so-called Bangladeshis, reports said.

<HEADLINE> Rich, Poor Gap Widening in Nepal: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's economic policy
adopted in 1991 has intensified social injustice and resulted in
"unequal distribution of resources," experts were quoted as saying
by the Rising Nepal Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The unequal distribution of educational and health
opportunities has widened the gap between haves and have-nots
worsening the condition of Nepal's deteriorating social justice
system," said Yagya Prasad Adhikari presenting a paper at a
one-day workshop here Wednesday on "Social Justice: Nepal's
Context."
</P>
<P>
He said that economic progress would pave way for the
restoration of social justice in the country, but the government
failed to take up proper policies and strategies to suit the
present global context of economic liberalization and
globalization.
</P>
<P>
Foreign aid and investment seemed to have failed to address the
prevailing problem of social injustice, instead, they have
worsened the situation, said Adhikari.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's noted geographer Harka Gurung said that all the
Nepalese would not get to taste the fruit of development unless
social justice was restored in the country.
</P>
<P>
In his view, foreign assistance would increase Nepal's
dependence on others, which in turn would lead to lopsided
development activities across the country.
</P>
<P>
Economist Mohan Man Sainju agreed that foreign aid was a hurdle
to Nepal's self-reliance. He stressed the need to seek the
root-cause of the social injustice and curb it before it worsened.
</P>
<P>
Sainju suggested that the international wave of economic
liberalization and globalization should be made compatible with
the social and economic context of the country.
</P>
<P>
The workshop was organized to create national awareness about
social justice in Nepal.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Send Envoy to Pakistan on Military Takeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said
on Wednesday that he will send the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan to
urge the military for an earlier restoration of civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan's interests would be served by a prompt return to
civilian rule," Clinton said in a written statement. "I am sending
my ambassador back to Islamabad to underscore my view directly to
the military authorities and to hear their intentions."
</P>
<P>
"I will also be consulting closely with all concerned nations
about maintaining peace and stability in South Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
A White House official said that William Milam, U.S. ambassador
to Pakistan, had been in Washington on vacation and for
consultations.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's written statement reinforced comments earlier on
Wednesday by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Albright made her remarks at the University of Maine in Orono,
Maine, when she said the United States expected Pakistan to return
to the civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
"I want to make it absolutely clear that military takeovers of
this kind make it difficult to carry on business as usual," she
added.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: U.S. Continues to Retain Moratorium on Nuke Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Wednesday that the United States will continue to retain its
moratorium on nuclear weapons testing even though the Senate
failed to approve a global nuclear test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the White House, Clinton also said he
would fight on for the ratification of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The president strongly criticized the Republicans for the
failure to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty on nuclear
weapons test, saying the Senate had simply not fulfilled its
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that the rejection of the treaty by the
Republicans is a "partisan" act. "Never before has a serious
treaty involving nuclear weapons been handled in such a reckless
and ultimately partisan way," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Senate has taken us on a detour, but America eventually
always returns to the main road, and we will do so again. When all
is said and done, the United States will ratify the test ban
treaty," Clinton noted.
</P>
<P>
"They clearly disregarded the views of the American people who
have consistently and strongly supported this treaty ever since it
was first pursued by Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy," he added.
</P>
<P>
The treaty is in the interests of the American people and still
on the calendar of the Senate, Clinton said, adding that the pact
will not go away and the Senate should ratify the treaty in the
future.
</P>
<P>
"I assure you the fight is far from over... For now the Senate
has said no, but I am sending a different message. We want to
limit the nuclear threat. We want to bring the test ban treaty
into force," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"We will press on to strengthen the worldwide consensus in
favor of the treaty," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, a resolution to ratify the treaty was
rejected in a roll call vote of 51-48. A majority of two-thirds
vote is needed for the ratification.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the vote, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said
the treaty is "unverifiable and unenforceable."
</P>
<P>
Lott also said he had asked Defense Secretary William Cohen to
review the nuclear weapons arsenal of the United States to ensure
the nuclear deterrent.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in the century that an arms control
treaty was rejected by the Senate, marking a humiliating foreign
policy defeat of the Clinton administration in fighting with the
Republican-controlled Senate.
</P>
<P>
The vote took place after Senate Democrats failed in a last-
ditch attempt to force postponement of action on the treaty by
losing a vote on a motion that brought up the treaty for a
ratification vote.
</P>
<P>
Proponents said that it is in the national security interests
of the United States to approve the treaty as it would help curb
the spread of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
They believe that the United States can maintain a very strong
nuclear deterrent without further nuclear testing and rejecting
the treaty would undermine the "leadership" of the United States
in weapons non-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
Opponents argue that the treaty is not verifiable and will
damage the reliability and safety of the U.S. nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
The two parties had earlier agreed to postpone the vote on the
treaty but they differed on when it should be postponed. The
Republicans' demand that the Clinton administration will not bring
the issue up during the rest of his tenure was rejected by the
White House.
</P>
<P>
The treaty was approved by the U.N. General Assembly in 1996
and has been signed by 154 countries. Clinton signed the treaty in
1996 and sent it to the Senate for ratification in September, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The pact will not take effect until it is ratified by all the
44 member countries of the Geneva-based Conference on Disarmament.
So far it has been ratified by 26 countries.

WASHINGTON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate President Pro
Tempore Strom Thurmond said here Wednesday that the U.S. Congress
is willing to develop strong relations with the National People's

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Wants Thailand to Arrest Gunmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar will normalize its ties
with Thailand after the latter arrests and prosecutes the five
gunmen who took over the Myanmar embassy in Bangkok, Channel 9,
the state television station, on Thursday quoted the Myanmar
ambassador as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The sooner they are arrested, the sooner the problems will be
solved," Myanmar ambassador Hla Maung reportedly said Wednesday
after talks with Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar closed its land border with Thailand and its waters to
Thai fishermen after five Myanmar gunmen took over the embassy on
October 1 and held 89 people hostage for 25 hours. Thailand gave
the gunmen safe passage to the Thai-Myanmar border in return for
the safe release of all hostages.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar ambassador escaped the capture because he had left
the embassy only a short time before its seizure.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the problem took place in Thailand. The Thai
government must solve the problem."
</P>
<P>
"There is no need to send them to Myanmar. The matter must
proceed according to Thai law. The Myanmar government will not
intervene," he added.
</P>
<P>
Surin summoned the ambassador to the Foreign Ministry to
inquire whether there was any progress in resolving the matters
since their last meeting on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman Don Pramudwinai said the
Myanmar ambassador had not issued a demand, but had only mentioned
in the meeting that the people who stormed the embassy were still
at large.
</P>
<P>
The five gunmen have been charged with illegal detention,
illegal possession of firearms, robbery and hijacking, and they
were being hunted by police, Don said.
</P>
<P>
Thai fishermen claim they are losing about one million U.S.
dollars a day as a result of the Myanmar ban.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has invited Myanmar Deputy Foreign Minister
Khin Maung Win to come to Bangkok to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Myanmar deputy minister on Tuesday, Thai
Deputy Foreign Minister Sukhumbhand Paribatra reiterated that the
government would not condone any "terrorist act" against foreign
representatives and outlined steps taken to prevent a recurrence.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor Orders DNA Tests On Pantani Blood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 13 (Xinhua) -- An Italian prosecutor ordered DNA
tests on the blood of Marco Pantani, the Italian cycling star
Marco Pantani, who was banned from the Giro d"Italia or Tour of
Italy in June after failing a blood test.
</P>
<P>
The random tests showed his count of red cells exceeded the
legal level of 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Bruno Giardina's office said in Trento, Italy on
Wednesday that the tests were intended to prove if the blood
samples actually belonged to Pantani and if tests that led to
Pantani's ban from the race were properly handled by the ICU
medical staff.
</P>
<P>
Tests might also reveal if the samples taken from Pantani and
10 other cyclists on the eve of the race's next-to-last stage
contained natural or artificial substances.
</P>
<P>
Pantani, a double Giro and Tour of France winner in 1998, was
suspended for two weeks and prevented from completing the Giro
which he was dominating.
</P>
<P>
A high count of red blood cells might signal the use of the
banned growth hormone EPO, but can also occur naturally.
</P>
<P>
Pantani has not been competing since his suspension in the Giro
but said recently he planned to return from a knee injury to
action next year.

<HEADLINE> Tourist Arrivals in Cambodia Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October, 14 (Xinhua) -- Tourist arrivals in
Cambodia by air rose year-on-year by 33 percent in the first eight
months of 1999, according to figures released by the Ministry of
Tourism Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The figures showed that the number of arrivals by air through
August was 166,536, compared to 124,729 for the same period in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Tourism officials attributed the increase to "improved security
and political stability."
</P>
<P>
By far, the largest percentage of tourists in first eight
months of this year were from the Asia-pacific region, reaching
88,964. Of these, Chinese nationals from the mainland comprised
the largest group at 17,488, followed by the Taiwan area and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Arrivals from North and South Americas in the eight months rose
by a dramatic 69 percent to 24,048, with U.S. citizens accounting
for almost 90 percent with 20,410. The number of European tourists
increased by 26 percent to reach 38,634, of which 16,042 were
French nationals.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 220,000 to 230,000 tourists visit
Cambodia per year. By the year 2003 the number will increase to
one million, thanks to the improvement of the infrastructure
throughout the country, according to tourism officials.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the three-day new millennium
celebration held in front of Angkor Wat from December 30, 1999 to
January 1, 2000 will attract at least 30,000 tourists and some 2
million U.S. dollars will be earned from the event.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Drug Operation Successes: Colombian Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Colombian police
chief described Wednesday a jointly anti-drug operation codenamed
"Millennium" as perfect.
</P>
<P>
The operation, carried out by the authorities of Colombia,
Mexico and Ecuador with U.S. help, "is perfect, because it
thwarted the most rampant drug trafficking in the world," said
Director of the Colombian Police Rosso Jose Serrano Cadena.
</P>
<P>
It is the third most significant campaign against international
drug networks, following previous twice massive actions taken by
Colombia in the middle of this decade, which led to the
dissolution of the Medellin and Cali drug cartels, the police
chief said.
</P>
<P>
He highlighted the detention of the ex-convict Fabio Ochoa
Vazquez and other 29 suspects, all of them facing possible
extradition to the U.S., as the result of this operation.
</P>
<P>
Ochoa Vazquez, along with his brothers Jorge Luis and Juan
David, formed the drug smuggling ring known as the "Clan Ochoa",
which was linked to the disbanded Medellin cartel led by late
Pablo Escobar Gaviria who died in 1993 during a police operation.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, at the mercy of the courts, the Ochoas were sentenced
up to 8 years imprisonment and locked up in the maximum security
prison of Itagua, in the northeastern Colombian province of
Antioquia. Due to good behaviour and confessions, the term was
later reduced to 5 years.
</P>
<P>
Serrano Cadena added there was a total of 200 police involved
in Operation "Millennium", during which a total of 72 operations
were carried out in the cities of Bogota, Medellin and Cali.
</P>
<P>
Operation "Millennium" signaled a message to the drug
traffickers that this is not a game, and "they will be subjected
to the judicial system" for their activities, the officer stressed.
</P>
<P>
Colombian drug traffickers have controlled a large part of the
U.S. cocaine market, and Colombia produces at a rate of 80 percent
of the global drug, he added.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: U.S. Continues to Retain Moratorium on Nuke Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Wednesday the United States will continue to retain its
moratorium on nuclear weapons testing even though the Senate
failed to approve a global nuclear test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the White House, Clinton criticized
the Republicans for the failure to ratify the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty on nuclear weapons test, saying the Senate had simply
not fulfilled its responsibility in curbing the spread of nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
The treaty is in the interests of the American people and still
in the calendar of the Senate, Clinton said, adding that the pact
will not go away and the Senate should ratify it in the future.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, a resolution to ratify the treaty was
rejected in a roll call vote of 51-48. A majority of two-thirds
vote is needed for the ratification.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the vote, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said
the treaty is "unverifiable and unenforceable."
</P>
<P>
Lott also said he had asked Defense Secretary William Cohen to
review the nuclear weapons arsenal of the United States to ensure
the nuclear deterrent.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that an arms control treaty was rejected
by the Senate in the century, marking one of the biggest failures
of the Clinton administration in a fight with the Republican-
controlled Senate.
</P>
<P>
The vote took place after Senate Democrats failed in a last-
ditch attempt to force postponement of action on the treaty.
</P>
<P>
"This is a terrible, terrible mistake," Senate Minority Leader
Tom Daschle said, urging Senators to recognize the serious
ramification of rejecting the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Proponents said that it is in the national security interests
of the United States to approve the treaty as it would help
contain the spread of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
They believe that the United States can maintain a very strong
nuclear deterrent without further nuclear testing and rejecting
the treaty would undermine the "leadership" of the United States
in weapons non-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
While opponents argue that the treaty is not verifiable and
will damage the reliability and safety of the U.S. nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
The two parties had earlier agreed to postpone the vote on the
treaty but they differed on when it should be postponed. The
Republicans demand that the Clinton administration should not
bring the issue up during the rest of his tenure. The White House
refuses to accept such a demand.
</P>
<P>
The treaty was approved by the U.N. General Assembly in 1996
and has been signed by 154 countries. Clinton signed the treaty in
1996 and sent it to the Senate for ratification in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
The pact will not take effect until it is ratified by all the
44 member countries of the Geneva-based Conference on Disarmament.
It has been ratified by 26 countries so far.

<HEADLINE> Natural Habitats Crucial for Siberian Tiger Protection: Zoologists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We need to intensify international cooperation, set up natural
reserves, and ensure a smooth communication channel for the wild
Siberian tigers, so as to save the species from extinction," said
Dr. Dale G. Miquelle, Field Coordinator of the Siberian Tiger
Project under the WCS.
</P>
<P>
Zoologists point out that excessive hunting, de-afforestation
and the fast spread of housing areas have caused the rapid
decrease in the Siberian tiger population.
</P>
<P>
"In the past two decades, its number has decreased from over 80
to some twenty to thirty in the early 1990s," said Guan Guosheng
with the Heilongjiang WRI.
</P>
<P>
Some natural living areas suitable for the tigers still exist,
said Dr.Zhang Endi, in charge of the Asia Conservation
Communication Program. And the Central Government's efforts in
natural forest protection, together with the fact that there
remain over 300 Siberian tigers in the Russian border area, make
the protection possible.
</P>
<P>
Setting up a Sino-Russian natural reserve and an efficient
control network, and issuing related regulations will benefit the
protection, Dr. Miquelle said.
</P>
<P>
The investigation by the Wildlife Conservation Society, the
Hornocker Wildlife Research Institute, and the Heilongjiang
Wildlife Research Institute (WRI) in the province starting from
1998 reveals that now only between nine and 13 Siberian tigers
live in the forests of Wandashan Mountain, Laoye Mountain, and the
Changbai Mountains.

<HEADLINE> China Learning a Lot from Climate Experience </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A series of climate experiments
designed to improve weather forecasts show that rising hot-air
currents over the Tibetan plateau and the South China Sea are
stronger than once thought.
</P>
<P>
Top China Meteorological Administration (CMA) official Wen
Kegang was quoted as saying that hot air masses rising over the
plateau are bigger than expected.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists determined that the air waves include a tropical
squall line that can cause waterspouts over the South China sea.
</P>
<P>
"Analysis and understanding of these results will help us
better understand atmospheric motions and the rules governing the
interactions of related spheres and layers," Wen stressed.
</P>
<P>
Wen pledged to get to the bottom of climate shifts affecting
storms in the Asian monsoon region and in the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The research was initiated in 1996 and carried out largely in
the summer of 1998. Using modern technology and large fields of
observation, the meteorologists did atmospheric-ocean-hydrological
tests in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the South China Sea, the
Huaihe River and the Taiwan Straits, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
Research also revealed the special characteristics and
complexity of the plateau's atmospheric structure, Wen said in his
latest report on the experiments. These projects had financial
backing from the country's Ministry of Science and Technology and
the National Natural Science Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The four experiments, involving 29 provinces, municipalities
and key industrial cities, also show China's advanced
meteorological level and ability to coordinate scientists at home
and abroad to undertake large atmospheric experiments.
</P>
<P>
"In this way, China is expected to make contributions to global
atmospheric research and to break through in the field," CMA's
experts said, adding that some 100 foreign experts jointed hands
with more than 500 senior Chinese meteorologists to do the tests.

official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar Trade Fair 2000, sponsored by the Laser World Co
Ltd, a local private company, is aimed at enabling the Myanmar

<HEADLINE> Mass Action to Protect Antelope in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING October 14 (Xinhua)-- An international jointed action
aimed at protecting the endangered Tibetan antelope is expected to
kick off soon, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The antelope face the threat of extinction because of massive
illegal hunting. The antelope are in high demand for their
underwool, used to make shawl known as "shahtoosh."
</P>
<P>
"Such a step has been in the works for years, as the illegal
poaching in China, the country of antelope's origin, and the
illicit manufacturing and trade of shahtoosh in processing and
consuming countries, defy the common wish of mankind to protect
wildlife," a leading Chinese forestry official was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"The root of the poaching is that the process and trade of
shahtoosh still exists in certain countries and regions as
poachers, processors and traders can obtain huge profits soaked in
the blood of Tibetan antelope," said Ma Fu, deputy-director of the
State Forestry Administration(SFA).
</P>
<P>
India-controlled Kashmir is the world's first and largest area
for the manufacturing of shahtoosh shawls. Most of the raw
materials for these luxury items has been smuggled from Tibet,
said one SFA expert.
</P>
<P>
Most of the shawls are sold in Europe. Since 1994, hundreds of
shahtoosh shawls have been seized or confiscated in France,
Belgium, the United States, Britain, Italy and Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Keegan: We Won't Under-Estimate Scots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- England manager Kevin Keegan
refused to believe his side already have one foot in next year's
Euro 2000 Championship finals after the mouthwatering play-off
draw with Scotland.
</P>
<P>
England have been installed as favorites to beat the Auld Enemy
in next month's two-legged tie, particularly because Keegan's side
have home advantage for the return.
</P>
<P>
When the draw was made in Aachen,Germany Wednesday morning,
with Scotland and England the first names to be revealed, Keegan
shook his head in disbelief as a wry smile creased his lips.
</P>
<P>
It is a match which will immediately capture the imagination of
the public, with England having recently had the last laugh on the
Scots following their Euro 96 success when goals from Alan Shearer
and Paul Gascoigne sealed a typically dramatic victory.
</P>
<P>
But Keegan knows that clash will have no bearing on the
forthcoming matches as he said: "It was a great game, and the
result was right.
</P>
<P>
"If you look at Euro 96 and the game there, it was the most
fantastic advert for football between the two nations. So a
repeat of that twice won't do any harm at all - in fact it will do
only good.
</P>
<P>
"But that's gone now; it's in the past. The personnel have
changed, and not just the manager but also a lot of the players.
</P>
<P>
"But some of the players, even the experienced English ones,
will not have played against Scotland before. It will be a new
experience for them," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said here Wednesday that the United States will continue to retain
its moratorium on nuclear weapons testing even though the Senate
failed to approve a global nuclear test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
Clinton criticized the Republicans for the failure to ratify
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty on nuclear weapons test, saying
the Senate had simply not fulfilled its responsibility in curbing
the spread of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The treaty is in the interests of the American people and still
in the calendar of the Senate, Clinton said, adding that the
treaty will not go away.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's foreign debts in
the first half of this year reached over 160 billion dollars, 0.7
percent lower than the end of 1998, said the Finance Secretariat
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It said some 97.25 billion dollars, or 60.6 percent, were
incurred by the public sector, 47.529 billion, or 29.6 percent, by
the private sector and the rest by banks and other sectors.
</P>
<P>
The debt repayment for the second half of this year will reach
19.661 billion dollars, it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Finance Secretariat, the external public debts
have been reduced by almost 16 billion dollars since 1995, while
private debts almost doubled from the end of 1996, to 47.529
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Debt repayment will continue to be reduced in the next few
years due to compromises with the multilateral credit institutions.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's foreign debts to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
in the first six months this year amounted to 5.97 billion dollars,
a reduction of 28.7 percent, down from 8.38 billion dollars last

<HEADLINE> Ireland "Happy Enough" To Play Turks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Republic of Ireland soccer team
manager Mick McCarthy put a brave face on his team's tough Euro
2000 play-off draw against Turkey.
</P>
<P>
It means the Irish will have their hopes of reaching the finals
next summer decided among the boiling hostility of Istanbul when
the second leg is played on Wednesday, November 17.
</P>
<P>
But McCarthy said: "It is the team we will be playing against,
not anything else. I'm happy enough with the draw because we
avoided the ones I wanted to avoid - England, because of all the
hype that would have entailed; and Ukraine, because they are by
far the best team in the play-offs with two great strikers in
Andriy Shevchenko and Sergi Rebrov."
</P>
<P>
Turkey beat Euro 96 champions Germany 1-0 in Group Three a year
ago and were assured of runners-up place before earning only a
goalless draw in the return in Munich on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
They also twice beat Northern Ireland 3-0. But McCarthy, who
will seek pointers on the Turks from Northern Ireland boss Lawrie
McMenemy, said: "The biggest disappointment is that we are playing
the away leg second, but Turkey won't fancy coming to Dublin
either.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever way you look at it you know it is going to be down to
who performs best on the day. It may be a difficult trip for our
fans to Istanbul - but even if we have to go there with just the
squad of 22 we'll give it a real go."
</P>
<P>
Ireland's last meeting with Turkey was on November 13, 1991 in
the final European Championship qualifier in Istanbul when Jack
Charlton's team - with McCarthy at center-back - won 3-1 thanks to
two goals by John Byrne of Sunderland and another by Tony
Cascarino who, now 37, is just one goal short of the all-time
Republic record of 20.
</P>
<P>
It was a magnificent performance by Ireland but not enough to
earn them a place in the finals in Sweden because England's draw
in Poland on the same night won the group. There were no play-offs
for second-placed teams then.

<HEADLINE> England Hold No Fears for Brown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Scotland manager Craig Brown is
savoring the prospect of a two-legged play-off against England to
secure a place at Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
Brown's team were the first name out of the hat and will face
the Auld Enemy for the first time since the 2-0 Euro 96 defeat at
Wembley, with Alan Shearer and Paul Gascoigne scoring for England
and Gary McAllister missing a crucial penalty.
</P>
<P>
But Brown said: "I am not surprised by the draw and I'm quite
relaxed about it. I think the England team were stronger in Euro
96 and I don't think we need fear them."
</P>
<P>
He added: "The unfortunate thing for England is that one of us
has to go through. Of course we are not under-estimating them;
England are very strong in attack and have great experience at the
back.
</P>
<P>
"We are just hoping we get everybody fit for the two games, and
they should be a couple of great matches."
</P>
<P>
The first match against England is due to be played at Hampden
Park on November 13, with the return leg at Wembley the following
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Brown said: "We are lucky the new stadium is now complete, and
there will be a full house. It should be a wonderful atmosphere
and a wonderful occasion."
</P>
<P>
He intends to take in a number of Premiership games in England
in the next month, along with his number two Alex Miller who is
now scouting for Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
"I know most of the England players - but one or two I'm unsure
about, like Frank Lampard. It would be good to see them at first
hand."

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, October 14 (Xinhua) -- In order to prevent the spread
of AIDS, the island province of Hainan in southernmost China has a
plan to stop the virus from being transmitted through blood
donation channels, a major cause of AIDS infection on the island.
</P>
<P>
The plan underscores the importance of popularizing AIDS
education and knowledge about the ways sexually transmitted
diseases can be combated to the rural population. Related topics
will also be included in school textbooks.
</P>
<P>
Next year, five to six monitoring centers will be set up
offering regular examinations for venereal disease carriers, drug
addicts, and blood donator.
</P>
<P>
The province will also establish advanced AIDS consultations
and treatment and service centers as well as specialized medical
teams. The monitoring and instruction about the disease will be
given to communities who will be urged to set up an AIDS-control
network.
</P>
<P>
Hainan detected the first case of AIDS in 1991. Since then, 29
out of 140,000 people who received blood tests were found HIV
positive, and six of them died of AIDS. Experts believe that the
number of people in the province now contaminated has reached more
than 300.

Guarnieri, who is visiting Quito, stressed that the money will

However, he stressed that any help given to the exporters will

<HEADLINE> Derailed Train Causes Seven Deaths in Mexico </HEADLINE>

<P>
MEXICO CITY, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A derailed train landed on
a house, killing its seven inhabitants in El Paraje in the central
Mexican state of Puebla, authorities said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The train, which belongs to the private company "Ferrosur", was
transporting 20 wagons of concrete when it got off the rail
Tuesday morning. The softening of the ground caused by recent
heavy rains in the region was blamed for the incident.
</P>
<P>
The rains also caused the delay of the news due to a
communication failure, they added.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains have caused a total of 170 deaths in the state last
month.
</P>
<P>
The authorities said that due to the conditions of the railroad
track and the heavy rains, there will be a delay in sending heavy
machinery to take away the derailed wagons.
</P>
<P>
In another similar incident, a train pulling four freight
wagons left the tracks Wednesday, resulting in two people
slightly injured in Tlaquepaque, close to Guadalajara, capital of
the eastern state of Jalisco, said the authorities.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Business-to-Consumer E-Commerce Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Business-to-consumer
electronic commerce companies have learned their lessons from past
years as the U.S. model of consumer e-commerce is being
implemented on a worldwide basis, according to a report released
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The worldwide business-to-consumer e-commerce market will reach
31.2 billion U.S. dollars in 1999, up from 11.2 billion dollars in
1998, said the report from U.S. market research firm Dataquest. In
2003, Dataquest predicted, revenue will surpass 380 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The reduced costs of Internet access and the growth of locally
based online merchants will drive the birth of large-scale
e-tailing throughout the world," the report said. "On a regional
basis, the so-called 'brick-and-mortar' businesses outside of the
United States have had the advantage of watching consumer
e-commerce develop over the last two years and are determined not
to repeat the mistakes of real-world retailers who were caught off
guard by the e-commerce revolution."
</P>
<P>
As for the United States, Dataquest found it is on pace to have
business-to-consumer e-commerce in 1999 totaling 20.5 billion
dollars, and by 2003, reaching 147 billion dollars. The European
business-consumer e-commerce market is projected to grow from 5.4
billion dollars in 1999 to more than 115 billion dollars in 2003.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the advent of free Internet accounts
is dramatically increasing the number of Internet users in Europe.
Relatively high penetration of smart cards, digital wallets and
other secure payment methods is reducing security concerns.
Consumer e-commerce in Europe is promoted by the increased
development of home-grown solutions, utilizing local currencies,
languages and distribution channels. Customers in other regions of
the world no longer have to order from e-tailers based in the
United States, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of business-to-business transactions over
the Internet has also grown steadily. U.S. market research firm
Forrester Research recently predicted that the global market will
explode to 1.3 trillion dollars by 2003.

<HEADLINE> Prodi Offers 12-Country Enlargement Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- European Commission President
Romano Prodi said here Wednesday six countries should be added to the
list of next year's enlargement talks between European Union (EU) and
EU candidate countries from Central and Eastern European nations.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said he wishes to recommand that EU's accession negotiations
with Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Romania and Slovakia be
opened in 2000. The six countries "have fulfilled the Copenhagen
political criteria and have proved ready to take the necessary
measures to comply with the economic criteria", he said.
</P>
<P>
So far, the EU has held accession talks with Cyprus, Estonia,
Slovenia, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic since March 1998.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive president also said whether the first accessions
take place starting in January 1, 2003, will depend fully on the speed
with which applicant countries can make progress on meeting membership
criteria set at 1993 EU summit in Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
But Prodi said this recommendation is subject to four conditions
both for Bulgaria and Romania. Negotiations with Bulgaria should not
begin until its government has "set an acceptable closure date for
the four unsafe units at their Kozloduy power station" and must
have "made significant progress in implementing economic reforms",
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Negotiations with Romania should not begin until the Romanian
authorities have acted decisively and effectively to reform their
child care institutions and to provide adequate funds for them"
while indicating it has taken "necessary steps to deal with the
country's macro-economic situation", Prodi told European Parliament
in Brussels.

<HEADLINE> Annan Recommends Allowing Iraq to Buy More Oil Parts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Wednesday recommended that Iraq be allowed to double
the amount of oil industry parts and equipment it could buy with
the revenue from oil exports.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the United Nations Security Council, Annan urged
the Security Council to approve the additional 300 million U.S.
dollars in equipment to improve the dilapidated state of Iraq's
oil industry, which was requested by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Annan said 300 million of the extra money should go to buy
more spare parts for the current phase which expires on November 20.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990. Under the "oil-for-food" deal with the United
Nations, Iraq was allowed to sell 5.26 billion dollars of oil in
every six months. The Security Council has also allowed Iraq to
spend 300 million from those proceeds to import parts and
machinery to repair its oil infrastructure.

LOS ANGELES, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A leading U.S.
semiconductor supplier said Wednesday that it has reached
wide-ranging technology agreement with Japan's electronic maker
Hitachi.
</P>
<P>
LSI Logic Corporation, also known as the system-on-a-chip
company based in California, said that the two companies will address
"the most costly and complex technology challenges associated
with ever-shrinking geometries."
</P>
<P>
This cooperation may shed some light on the trends of Japanese
electronic makers in catching up with new technologies. According
to the latest issue of Forbes Magazine, Japan-based electronic
makers were the undisputed rulers of the analog universe as the
1990s began.
</P>
<P>
LSI and Hitachi will contribute different technology strength
to address the issues associated with 0.10-micron transistors
including the performance, reliability and failure analysis
techniques, LSI said.
</P>
<P>
LSI said that research teams from both companies are already
engaged in the U.S. and Japan in a variety of technology
development activities.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate failed on
Wednesday to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty on nuclear
weapons in a bi-partisan roll call vote, striking a heavy blow at
the treaty.
</P>
<P>
A majority of two-thirds vote is needed for the ratification.
But the result is 48 for and 51 against.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the vote, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said
the treaty is "unverifiable and unenforceable."
</P>
<P>
Lott also said he had asked Defense Secretary William Cohen to
review the nuclear weapons arsenal of the United States to ensure
the nuclear deterrent.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that an arms control treaty was rejected
by the Senate this century, marking one of the biggest failures of
the Clinton administration in a fight with the
Republican-controlled Senate.
</P>
<P>
The vote took place after Senate Democrats failed in a
last-ditch attempt to force postponement of action on the treaty,
losing a vote on a motion that brought up the treaty for a
ratification vote.
</P>
<P>
"This is a terrible, terrible mistake," Senate Minority Leader
Tom Daschle said, urging Senators to recognize the serious
ramification of rejecting the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Wednesday, he told reporters that Democrats and the
White House appear to have lost an effort to delay the vote,
saying, "We are prepared to vote."
</P>
<P>
He said neither he nor President Bill Clinton is willing to
make any further concessions to Senate conservatives -- even if it
means the treaty will be rejected later Wednesday by a largely
party-line vote.
</P>
<P>
"There's a limit to what I can do and I've reached that limit,"
Daschle said, blaming "a small group of senators on the far right"
for preventing Lott from honoring a tentative deal reached Tuesday
by the two Senate leaders.
</P>
<P>
The two parties had earlier agreed to postpone the vote on the
treaty but they differed on when it should be postponed. The
Republicans demanded the Clinton administration not bring the issue
up during the rest of his tenure. The White House refused to
accept such a demand.
</P>
<P>
The treaty was approved by the U.N. General Assembly in 1996
and has been signed by 154 countries. Clinton signed the treaty
in 1996 and sent it to the Senate for ratification in September,
1997.
</P>
<P>
The pact will not take effect until it is ratified by all 44
member countries of the Geneva-based Conference on Disarmament. It
has been ratified by 25 countries.
</P>
<P>
The rejection of the U.S. Senate made it almost impossible for
the treaty to go into effect.

<HEADLINE> Papandreou: Cyprus Issue the Touchstone in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou stressed Wednesday night that despite the recently
improved climate in Greek-Turkish relations, the Cyprus issue
remained the touchstone of any further progress.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after talks with his visiting Cypriot counterpart,
Yiannakis Cassoulides, Papandreou said that the Cyprus problem was
an issue of foremost importance and relations between Greece and
neighboring Turkey could not be normalized unless there was
progress over the long-standing division problem in Cyprus, which
has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a failed
coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged Turkey to make certain moves to show that a
new page was opening in relations between the two neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
As for Turkey's European Union (EU) membership bid, Papandreou
said that Greece supported Ankara's European vocation, but Athens
would make its final decision over the days to come until the
Hilsinki summit in December.
</P>
<P>
On Cyprus' accession to the EU, Papandreou reassured
Cassoulides of Athens' undivided support for Nicosia's accession
course to the EU, saying that both sides were cooperating
steadfastly for the promotion of Cyprus' accession negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Cyprus' accession course was a process
parallel to efforts to resolve the island's political problem.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou said that Greece and Cyprus, which were in
anticipation of invitations being sent to the two sides by U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan, also expected from the European
partners and the U.S. to intensify efforts in the direction of
Turkey and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash to enable them not
only to start but also to promote talks for a solution to the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides, who arrived here Wednesday, said that his talks
with Papandreou provided the opportunity for the situation
concerning the Cyprus problem to be reassessed.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Approves Record Farm Bailout Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate approved
Wednesday a record package of emergency farm assistance totaling
8.7 billion U.S. dollars, the second big bailout in as many years
for producers clobbered by low commodity prices, drought and
flooding.
</P>
<P>
The Senate's 74-26 vote sends the package to President Bill
Clinton for his expected signature.
</P>
<P>
Most of the money in the package, about 6 billion dollars, is
intended to help farmers cope with a second year of depressed
commodity prices, with the bulk of the aid going to the Midwestern
Corn Belt. Farmers in Iowa would share 610 million dollars, the
most of any state, followed by Illinois with 535 million dollars,
according to the Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
The measure also includes 1.4 billion dollars for
weather-related crop and livestock losses, including 200 million
dollars earmarked for Eastern livestock producers who were hurt by
this summer's drought; 328 million dollars to compensate tobacco
producers for falling cigarette sales; and 125 million in
subsidies for dairy producers.
</P>
<P>
The first checks to farmers would go out within two weeks or so
of when the president signs the legislation, according to
officials from the Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
The size of this year's bailout, nearly 3 billion dollars more
than what Congress approved a year ago, is raising questions about
the future of the government's market-oriented farm policy. And
lawmakers may not be through doling out money to farmers this
year.
</P>
<P>
Congressional leaders are considering additional assistance for
producers whose farms were washed out last month by Hurricane
Floyd. Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle estimated 1 billion
dollars would be needed.
</P>
<P>
The money is included in a 69-billion-dollar appropriations
bill that will fund operations of the Agriculture Department and
the Food and Drug Administration for the 2000 budget year.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Fall Sharply For Second Straight Day </HEADLINE>

NEW YORK, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stock fell
sharply for the second straight session Wednesday as investors
were disappointed by the Intel Corp. earnings report that did
not meet expectation.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 184.89 at
10,232.15. The blue chip index fell 231.12 points Tuesday, the
second-biggest drop of 1999 in point terms.

Broader stock indicators were also sharply lower. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 27.49 at 1,285.55 and the
technology heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 71.16 at 2,801.27.
</P>
<P>
Intel, the world's largest manufacturer of semiconductors,
reported late Tuesday that its third-quarter per-share
earnings fell 2 cents short of the estimated 55 cents because
of falling prices for microprocessors and narrower profit
margins. The results surprised investors who expected the
company to meet or beat Wall Street forecasts.
</P>
<P>
The lower bond prices also dragged stocks. Bond prices
dropped sharply, pushing the yield on the 30-year Treasury
bond from 6.22 percent Tuesday to 6.28 percent, luring
investors away from the stock market to the bond market.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 11.29 at 592.09 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 2.70 at 789.41. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 5.36 at 419.32.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-3 margin on

NYSE volume increased to 813.77 million shares from 769.11
